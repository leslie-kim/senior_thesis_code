AROUND THE NATION; Toledo Abortion Clinic Damaged in Arson Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/01/us/around-the-nation-toledo-abortion-clinic-damaged-in-arson-fire.html,"An arson fire damaged an abortion clinic early today, a day after two clinics in Cincinnati were set afire and 12 hours after a bomb threat emptied another clinic here, the authorities said. The fire today caused $20,000 damage at Toledo Medical Services, the site of an arson fire Aug. 10 that is unsolved. Robert Stellingworth, the director of the Toledo office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said his agency was helping local officials. ''The fire is of suspicious origin,'' he said. Joyce Arend, the president of the Toledo chapter of the National Organization for Women, said a bomb threat was made at 2 P.M. Monday at the Center for Choice, another clinic, forcing the police to evacuate the building. The Cincinnati police reported no progress in the investigation into the fires at the Margaret Sanger Center of Ohio and the Women's Health Care Center, where damage came to $75,000 each.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/02/garden/hers.html,"UP until the day before yesterday, you were labeled a fanatic if you suggested that the next target of the ''prolife'' movement would be contraception - today the abortion clinic, tomorrow the drugstore. Never mind that the Roman Catholic Church has never made any secret of its ban on any form of contraception except abstinence. What is the rhythm method but planned abstinence - even when pregnancy means death. Never mind, too, that the Protestant fundamentalists take an only slightly less drastic position. In America, we like to think that truth lies in the middle - like the ''Happy Birthday'' on a cake. Thus, people who saw a threat to family planning had to be extremists, to balance the people who conducted funeral services over aborted fetuses. That's why it's so fascinating to watch the anti-abortionists come clean. At their behest, American aid to international family planning programs has been slashed. A few weeks ago, a bomb was mailed to a birth-control clinic - not an abortion clinic -in Oregon. Earlier this fall, Representative Jack F. Kemp and Senator Orrin G. Hatch attempted to cut off Title X funding for local family-planning centers - the only counseling available for millions of poor women - unless the centers agreed not to inform their clients of the existence of legal abortion. Although the move failed, it brought a new phrase to public light. According to Joseph M. Scheidler, chief spokesman for the Pro-Life Action League and author of its bible, ''Closed: 99 Ways to Stop Abortion,'' such funding is wrong because it promotes ''the contraceptive mentality.'' Like ''the abortion mentality,'' Mr. Schiedler wrote in a recent Op-Ed piece in USA Today, the contraceptive mentality is ''antichild.'' He said, ''It attempts to exclude the possibility of new life by perverting a natural function into a mere means of recreation, thus establishing the hedonistic value system based on selfishness.' So now it's official. The same adjectives used, rather successfully, to stigmatize women who choose abortion - ''antichild,'' ''hedonistic,'' ''selfish'' - also apply to just about every couple in the United States, including Catholics and fundamentalists. Your friends with the two adorable, petted toddlers actually hate children - without the Pill, they'd have 10. When you and your mate fall happily into bed on a Sunday afternoon, you're just using each other, like a prostitute and a john. This new honesty, I have to say, pleases me no end. I have a rather antimetaphysical turn of mind, so I always felt left out of those quasi-theological discussions about whether an embryo is a person or how would I feel if my mother had aborted me. It's good to have the debate back on earthly terrain: as a struggle over the meaning of sex. Suddenly a lot of things make sense. It's always seemed bizarre, for example, that the prolife (or antichoice) movement, which calls abortion murder and a holocaust, doesn't take to the streets to demand contraception for all. Using a diaphragm has to be small potatoes, morally speaking, compared with killing, like shoplifting compared with blowing up the store. But as a movement, anti-choicers oppose just about every measure that could cut the abortion rate by lowering the risk of unwanted pregnancy: sex education, in-school birth-control clinics, confidentiality for teen-agers, televised contraception ads. Even the more thoughtful prolifers, who can see the connection between abortion and poverty or lack of child-care services, are silent on the most obvious connection of all: that between abortion and lack of contraception. The problem in America isn't too much ''contraceptive mentality'' but too little. The sexual revolution may have brought sex out of the closet, sort of, but birth control is still in there with the old sweaters and sneakers. You'd think, for instance, that there would be a vast army of citizens agitating for enormous spending on contraceptive research. Short of a way to lose weight without dieting, would any scientific advance do more to increase everyday human happiness than a cheap, available, painless, foolproof, fussless method of birth control? An herb tea, say, that one could sip over the morning paper? But there is no such movement, and that's why I find myself at 36 facing the same choice I faced when I was 20: A method of birth control discovered by the ancient Egyptians versus those that present risks to my health. For something used regularly by so many, the cultural quiet surrounding birth control is striking indeed. It's as though the prudery and guilt that used to be associated with our sexual parts have attached themselves to our pills and devices instead. Sex is ubiquitous on televison, for instance, but not even sultry Joan Collins slips into the bathroom before trysting. And what about movies? Do Meryl Streep and Robert Redford discuss protection before the violin music and the dissolve? Novels are almost as circumspect. Most of the famous contraception scenes in our fiction are, interstingly, negative. There's poor Dottie in Mary McCarthy's ''The Group,'' waiting with her new pessary on a park bench for the married man who never shows. There's Updike's Rabbit Angstrom, who won't let his prostitute girlfriend use her diaphragm because it spoils the mystery of sex, and Norman Mailer's Rojack, who does the same with his prostitute girlfriend. The women go along with this, of course, and have the best sex of their lives - so much for realism in contemporary fiction. I wish we were a hedonistic culture and saw sexual pleasure as a normal part of civilized life, like tasty meals and summer vacations and opera tickets. But under the Playboy glitz, we're still the same old Puritans who thought Massachusetts winters were good for the soul. We still suspect sex entails punishment - an attitude strongly reinforced by the new sexually transmitted diseases - and because contraception breaks this connection, we can't acknowledge it except in a worried, furtive way. That's why nobody argues for teen-age birth control on the ground that sex can be a positive experience for young people - it's always presented as damage control. Contraception cuts another connection, too - the one between sex and sexism. Without contraception, women's rights are just words, because women who can't control their fertility can't stay in school or keep a job or postpone marriage or divorce a breadwinner or think of themselves as anything but nature's victims. This link is so strong and so obvious I would suggest that the ultimate aim of the antichoicers is not to save unborn children, or even to quell teen-age ''promiscuity,'' but to put women back in the kitchen. Right now, though, that's only one woman's fanatical opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHILDBIRTH DEATHS FOR OLDER WOMEN DECLINE 50%,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/03/us/childbirth-deaths-for-older-women-decline-50.html,"The death rate from pregnancy-related causes among women 35 years and older has dropped nearly 50 percent in recent years, a study shows, but women that age are still three times as likely to die from such causes. ''Although older women will probably continue to be at higher risk of maternal death,'' researchers said in an article to be published Friday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, ''recent trends should be reassuring to younger women who are considering postponement of pregnancy and to women aged 35 or older who are contemplating pregnancy.'' The reseachers said the decline could be attributed to the higher social and economic status of older women having babies in recent years. ''In general, people of lower education and income have higher mortality rates,'' said Dr. James W. Buehler, who headed the study at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. #50% Drop in Death Rates The study said pregnancy-related deaths among women 35 and over were about 50 percent lower in 1982 than from 1974 through 1978. The mortality rate among women of that age in 1982 was 24.2 deaths per 100,000 live births; from 1974 through 1978, the average mortality rate was 47.5 deaths per 100,000 live births, the study said. The mortality rates included deaths from abortion. The 1982 rates were compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COMMON SENSE ON FAMILY PLANNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/opinion/common-sense-on-family-planning.html,"One good way to help men and women make sound decisions about family planning is to make sure they obtain the necessary information. This season Congress is to be congratulated for its rare appreciation of that wisdom in balking at the efforts of those who deny it. Representative Jack Kemp of New York, for example, proposed to deny Federal funds to clinics that give abortion counseling, so as to erect what he called ''a wall of separation'' between family planning and abortion. But no federally funded family-planning clinics provide or even recommend abortions. They only advise that abortion is a legal option, as they should, and make referrals on request. Had Congress passed Mr. Kemp's proposal, clinics that inform clients about the full range of their medical options would have lost substantial subsidies. Fortunately for them and the people they help, the House and Senate rejected the idea. Congress showed more good sense last month in heading off a damaging new rule at the Agency for International Development. It plans to give poor nations $40 million over five years to promote ''natural'' family-planning programs but said it would no longer require the recipients to counsel couples about the wide choice of contraceptive methods. The issue here was not abortion (no A.I.D. money goes for abortion-related activities). The issue was the need of poor families to make a free and informed choice about family planning. Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, a foe of abortion, recognized the folly in the agency's new rule. What surer way to increase abortion rates than to deny people knowledge about contraception? The Senator got Congress to stipulate that the recipients of A.I.D. family-planning funds must provide, directly or through referral, advice on all birth control methods. Thanks to the Senator, couples in poor nations can be taught the natural family-planning method if they want it but they will not be denied access to other methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FALWELL FORMING GROUP TO LOOK AT BROAD ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/us/falwell-forming-group-to-look-at-broad-issues.html,"The Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of Moral Majority, announced today that he was forming a new political organization with the hope of mobilizing millions of conservatives who support his views on domestic and foreign issues. He said Moral Majority would continue to focus on ''strictly moral'' issues such as abortion and pornography as a subsidiary of the new entity, the Liberty Federation. He said the federation supported President Reagan's high-technology antimissile plan, favored financial aid to the rebels in Nicaragua and would help resist ''possible Communistic takeovers in Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, South Africa and all over the world.'' Charles E. Judd, executive director of the Liberty Federation and Moral Majority, said the new organization would be ''no more or less religious than Moral Majority.'' Bush Plans to Speak At a news conference here today, Mr. Falwell said Vice President Bush would speak at the first meeting of the federation in Washington on Jan. 24. An aide to Mr. Bush confirmed that the Vice President was planning to be there. Such an appearance could be expected to help Mr. Bush, a likely contender in the Republican Presidential primaries in 1988, to solidify his support among conservatives. Members of the Bush camp acknowledged that the Vice President might alienate some liberal or moderate Republicans if he was perceived as closely tied to Moral Majority. But they said Mr. Falwell's support was strategically important to Mr. Bush because it would be virtually impossible for any rival to gain the Republican Presidential nomination except by consolidating the New Right against him. Mr. Falwell, a leader of the Christian fundamentalist movement, said he was ''not a candidate for any political office'' and was supporting Mr. Bush for President in 1988. According to political professionals in both parties, Mr. Falwell's endorsement might cost a candidate more votes than it gained. National polls by both parties have also detected strong negative reactions to him. He has blamed the news media for such reactions. In the January issue of his newspaper, renamed Liberty Report, Mr. Falwell said: ''The press for six years has bloodied and beaten the name Moral Majority. There are a lot of people who will say yes to everything we are saying, but they dare not stand with us on particular policies for fear of getting tarred, hurt - that is, picking up baggage that the media have dumped on us.'' John Buchanan, chairman of People for the American Way, a group formed in part to counter Mr. Falwell, said in a statement, ''By changing its name and charter, Moral Majority is finally acknowledging its true identity: a political organization advocating right-wing positions.'' He said Mr. Falwell should now ''play by the same rules'' as others in the political arena. ''He should stop pretending to be chairman of the Lord's political action committee and stop suggesting that to disagree with Jerry Falwell is to side with Satan against God,'' Mr. Buchanan said. Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement: ''This public relations name change speaks volumes about the reputations of both Jerry Falwell and his organization. A Liberty Federation won't stand for true liberty any more than the Moral Majority represents the moral values of most Americans.'' Mr. Falwell, a Baptist minister from Lynchburg, Va., said Moral Majority had attracted six and a half million Americans since it was chartered in June 1979. Conservative Roman Catholics constitute ''the largest single bloc'' of members, with 30 percent of the total, he said, and Protestants and Jews are also members. Moral Majority has a budget of $7 million this year, according to Mr. Falwell. He said the Liberty Federation, including Moral Majority and Liberty Alliance, a new lobbying group, would have a budget of $12 million. He said the money would be raised from ''new constituents who are interested in our agenda.'' Roy C. Jones, legislative director of Moral Majority, and Alan P. Dye, a lawyer for Mr. Falwell's organizations, said charitable contributions to the Liberty Federation would be tax-deductible. Gifts to Liberty Alliance or Moral Majority Inc. will not be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE TRUTH ABOUT POLYGRAPHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/us/the-truth-about-polygraphs.html,"Polygraph, or lie-detector, tests are supposed to help investigators determine the truth. But the truth about the Government's use of the polygraph can be elusive. The staffs of at least four Congressional committees and the General Accounting Office, for example, are now trying to determine how the many different agencies of the Federal Government are actually using the polygraph and whether the device is an effective tool. Even the Federal Bureau of Investigation has got into the act by initiating a nationwide survey to learn how often polygraph tests have generated inaccurate leads in F.B.I. investigations. Efforts to Expand Their Use The interest of the Congressional committees was spurred by the Reagan Administration's repeated efforts to expand the use of polygraph testing for protecting national security secrets. Last month, President Reagan backed away from his decision authorizing Federal investigators to undertake the random polygraphing of tens of thousands of senior Federal officials after Secretary of State George P. Shultz suggested he would resign if forced to take such a test. One of the nagging questions about the polygraph concerns its basic usefulness. Although there is evidence the tests can help investigators in narrowly focused criminal cases, a 1983 study by the Office of Technology Assessment, a bipartisan agency that serves Congress, concluded, ''The available research does not establish the scientific validity of the polygraph test for personnel security screening.'' A second key question focuses on the questions the examiners are asking. In recent testimony before the House Government Operations Committee and several other Congressional bodies, for example, Richard G. Stilwell, then Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, said the military had restricted its questions to specific counterintelligence matters and avoided asking about political beliefs and personal activities. But an investigation published today by the General Accounting Office for the Senate Armed Services Committee found that the training manual used by the military until late November suggested asking about a subject's political, racial and religious affiliations and whether the subject had engaged in a variety of sex acts or had ever ''been a party to an abortion.'' The G.A.O. study said the Defense Department had now ordered the abolition of the training manual. Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Government Operations Committee, has denounced the manual as both illegal and inappropriate. Over all, few people seem to know how many polygraph examinations are being conducted by Federal agencies, mostly because several of the major programs are cloaked in official secrecy. The Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, for example, both have long-established procedures requiring such screening for both job applicants and, on a periodic basis, current employees. These agencies together are now thought to have about 100,000 employees. It is doubtful that the ambitious polygraph plans favored by both the Reagan Administration and some members of Congress can be achieved in the next few years. The major hurdle is the lack of enough people to conduct the tests, in which the subject's pulse and other physical signs are measured at the same time the person is being asked a series of questions. Military Has 152 Testers Defense Department experts say that an individual examiner working at top speed can conduct 300 tests a year. Yet department officials said recently that the military had only 152 examiners. In the fiscal year 1985, according to testimony before a special hearing held recently by Democratic Representatives Don Edwards of California and Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, examiners working in the Defense Department (but not including those working for the National Security Agency) were able to conduct 10,000 to 12,000 tests in connection with criminal investigations and about 3,000 tests for counterintelligence purposes. One little-known Defense Department polygraph project bears the code name ''Seven Screens,'' possibly an allusion to Salome's seven veils. Since 1982 this test has been used to examine the reliability of about 8,000 people mostly working on a classified Air Force contract. According to a recent briefing by the department for Congressional staff members, the test has produced doubts about 10 of the 8,000 people questioned. These cases have been referred to the F.B.I. #40 to 45 Testers at F.B.I. Lane Bonner, a spokesman, said the F.B.I. had 40 to 45 polygraph examiners. In the fiscal year 1984, he said, they conducted more than 2,800 examinations, mostly in connection with criminal investigations. A spokesman for the Secret Service said it was ''against policy'' to disclose how many polygraph examiners worked for the Service or how many tests they administered. The Secret Service is a Treasury Department agency with the dual tasks of protecting the President, Vice President and certain other political figures, and of combating counterfeiting. Most Government polygraph examiners are trained at a special school operated by the Army at Fort McClellan, Ala. Last year this school trained 48 new examiners. The Defense Department is now expanding the school so it can train 108 students a year. The Central Intelligence Agency has its own polygraph school, the operations of which are secret.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, JANUARY 4, 1985",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/nyregion/news-summary-saturday-january-4-1985.html,"International West Germany ruled out sanctions against Libya. Other Western European countries reacted cooly to calls by the United States for collective action against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's Government, which is accused of supporting terrorist groups. At the same time, there were signs of growing concern, particularly among countries on the Mediterranean, over a possible flare-up of violence. The concern came amid reports of United States naval operations in the area and plans for eventual military reprisals for the apparently coordinated terrorist attacks on airports in Rome and Vienna. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] There was a mood of uncertainty over whether the Reagan Administration would take military action in response to the airport attacks in Rome and Vienna. A United States carrier battle group headed south toward Libya, while President Reagan asserted there was nothing unusual about the ship movements. [ 1:4. ] Anti-U.S. demonstrations in Libya protested United States and Israeli accusations that Libya was linked to the terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna. Americans working in Libya expressed fear over a Libyan television report that said Colonel Qaddafi, was organizing suicide squads to to attack American and Western European properties. [ 4:3. ] The U.S. will help Mexico meet its financial problems, President Reagan pledged. He conferred for four hours in Mexicali with President Miguel de la Madrid. Mexico is seeking new foreign capital to meet its $96 billion external debt and is experiencing a series of domestic economic difficulties. While Mexico is not seeking direct United States financial support, Administration officials said it was asking the Administration's backing for loans from commercial banks and international lending agencies. [ 1:3. ] The blackout of the Catholic radio this week in Nicaragua was the latest step in a three-month campaign against non-Sandinista news outlets. The closing of the official station of the Roman Catholic Church followed the closing of two periodicals and warnings to others to close down. [ 1:5. ] Soviet cultural officials denounced two American movies as anti-Soviet propaganda. A group including the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko said the movies ''Rocky IV'' and ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' were part of a deliberate propaganda campaign to portray Russians as cruel and treacherous enemies. [ 3:4. ] Poland replaced its envoy to moscow with an Ambassador of more moderate views. The move was viewed by Western diplomats as part of a drive by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to reshape the Communist Party along more moderate lines. The former Ambassador, stanislaw Kociolek, has long been associated with the hard-line faction. His successor, Wlodzimeirz Natorf has spent most of his professional life in diplomacy [ 3:4 ] National Inmates freed their last hostages at the West Virginia Penitentiary and returned control of the prison to the state.

BACK TO A BASIC CONTRACEPTIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/05/business/back-to-a-basic-contraceptive.html,"ANNE, an attractive New York widow in her mid-40's, decided it was time to begin dating again. Before re-entering the social wars, she visited her gynecologist. Anne had long used a diaphragm to prevent pregnancy but feared this would provide little protection against AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome for which there is no cure. The doctor suggested that she stay with the diaphragm, but also invest in a packet of condoms. The medical profession considers the rubber sheaths, named after an 18th Century British physician, to be, after abstinence, the most effective preventive against sexually transmitted diseases, including the deadly AIDS. Anne did as advised, despite some embarrassment caused by the proximity of two youths to the drug store counter and her confusion at the variety of brands and styles available. When she emerged from the store, bearing a packet of lambskin Fourex, Anne joined the growing number of Americans reacquainting themselves with a device they thought consigned to the ash heap of sexual history. Manhattan, with its large homosexual and singles communities, is showing the sharpest sales increases. ''Sales are up 20 to 25 percent,'' said Irving Appel of Eichen & Appell, a pharmaceutical distribution house. Individual drug stores report increases of up to 50 percent. The West Coast shows similar gains, to which San Francisco's homosexual population undoubtedly contributes. ''Sales for the last two months of 1985 were 25 percent above the same period the year before,'' said Mark Klein, marketing vice president of Schmid Laboratories, a British-owned New Jersey company whose brands, including Ramses, Sheik, Excita and Fourex, account for 35 percent of the 400 million condoms sold annually in the United States. Physicians encourage the return to the ancient product, which has existed in some form since Roman times. Tests to see whether condoms can protect users against the AIDS virus are still underway. But the herpes virus failed to penetrate condoms, and medical experts expect similar results in the AIDS tests. ''There is no real cure for herpes,'' said Dr. David Grimes, a researcher for the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. ''And AIDS kills people. So we have to look at prevention until science comes up with a cure. That means the condom, preferably one that comes with a spermicide. Somehow the combination seems to create a synergistic action against a number of sexually transmitted diseases.'' Such recommendations come as a boon to Schmid, Ansell Inc. and Carter-Wallace Inc., the maker of Trojans, the three major companies in the industry. Condom makers spent the 1960's and 70's watching their product lose ground to competitive birth control methods. Condoms now account for only 20 percent of the nation's $1 billion birth control products industry, with the pill accounting for almost half. (Both products trail sterilization as the anti-pregnancy method favored by Americans.) But condom sales have risen well above their traditional 10 percent annual growth rate - the same rate as the birth control industry as a whole - and now are taking business from the pill. The biggest growth in the market is not from the users themselves, but from American women. For several years, doctors have been warning women over 35, especially those who are obese or smoke heavily, that they might be wise to switch from the pill to another form of birth control. Now the growing evidence that the AIDS virus can be transmitted during heterosexual sex is bringing even more women to the condom market. With society concerned not only about AIDS, but also about a flood of unwanted pregnancies among teen-agers, the industry figures it must continue to benefit. Women now spend some $100 million to buy nearly 40 percent of the condoms sold at retail, up from less than 10 percent a decade ago, say industry sources. In California, where trends often seem to start these days, the figure is closer to 60 percent. ''The outlook for condoms has never been better,'' concluded Mr. Klein. This optimism is tempered only by the industry's continuing inability to advertise its ''unmentionable'' product. Companies rely mainly on recommendations from counseling services and physicians, word of mouth and some offbeat approaches - because they have little choice. Despite a 1977 Supreme Court ruling that the advertising and display of contraceptive products are legal, the television and print media refuse such ads almost unanimously. They are cheered on by activist groups that are increasingly opposed not only to abortion but to contraception. George Schweitzer, vice president of communications for the CBS broadcasting group, summed up the networks' basic concern: ''Contraceptive ads would be an intrusion on the moral and religious beliefs of many members of our audience.'' During the sexual revolution of the 1960's and 70's, condom makers advertised in the only medium available, sex-oriented magazines such as Penthouse. ''The sex books push pleasure,'' said Fred Poppe, chairman of Poppe Tyson, Inc., an advertising agency for Trojans, the brand that is the perennial market leader, with a 55 percent share. ''They rejected all our ads mentioning the disease-prevention benefits of condoms.'' Trojans is now part of Carter-Wallace, a New York-based maker of personal hygiene products, which last October bought the former owner, Youngs Drug Products Corporation. More recently, though, condom makers have been buoyed by faint cracks in the solid wall of media opposition. On her cable TV show, Dr. Ruth Westheimer pitches Lifestyle condoms from Ansell Inc., an Australian-owned company that is the largest American maker (although most of its annual production is sold to the United States Agency for International Development for export to developing countries). The Turner Broadcasting System has has run ads for several birth control products. However, Turner Broadcasting declined to run the Lifestyle ads. ''Dr. Ruth is a proponent of sex for pleasure, and we did not want to be seen endorsing her views,'' explained Jerry Hogan, vice president for sales. Condom companies have also enjoyed some success by experimenting with untraditional advertising approaches. Last summer Schmid hired a plane to stream a banner reading ''Plan ahead with Ramses'' along the East and West Coast beaches. This winter the company is running similarly worded ads for Ramses Extra on Atlanta billboards. ''If we can sell in the Bible Belt we can sell anywhere,'' reasoned Mr. Klein. The Mentor Corporation, a Minneapolis-based maker of medical equipment, recently placed ads for its new condom entry in Los Angeles magazine and its Minneapolis/St. Paul counterpart, and is talking to women's service magazines about similar placements. Mentor packages its condoms in colorfully striped boxes that blend with feminine hygiene products. ''That way women can toss them in their shopping bags at the drugstore along with douches, tampons, and other feminine products and not feel embarrassed,'' said Thomas M. Hauser, Mentor executive vice president. Marketing condoms to women is a well-established tactic in Britain. ''Until four or five years ago, we promoted a macho image. But then all our research showed that it is usually women who make the decision about contraception.'' said Michael Broadbridge, a marketing manager for London International, whose Durex brands account for 96 percent of Britain's condom sales. The 70-year-old company, which also owns Schmid Laboratories here, advertises condoms in British women's magazines and national newspapers; its surveys show that women account for around 35 percent of sales. THE arrival of AIDS coincides with another boon for the condom makers - the epidemic of unplanned teen-age pregnancies in the United States. A recent study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute shows that unwed American teenagers produce children with far greater frequency than their counterparts in other Western industrial nations. The reason is not any greater promiscuity on the part of American youth, argues the study, but the other nations' greater willingness to introduce sex education into schools and to establish clinics where teen-agers, who are traditionally major condom users, can obtain birth control advice and products. Guttmacher and other organizations concerned with the unwanted pregnancy issue, notably the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, are trying to stem the tide. Planned Parenthood counsels two to three million young people annually. The Federation favors the pill for young women, but encourages young men to use condoms as prevention against both pregnancy and disease. ''There's a lot of sexually transmitted disease among young people,'' said Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood. A recent Louis Harris poll for Planned Parenthood reported that 85 percent of the respondents thought sex education should be taught in schools. Two-thirds of the adults favored requiring public schools to establish links with family planning centers so that teen-agers could obtain and learn about contraceptives. The condom makers are eager to provide such a link. Schmid, for example, doles out information to community boards contemplating sex education programs for their schools. ) The Harris study also showed that 78 percent of adult respondents believe TV should present messages about birth control as part of its programming. Miss Wattleton was particularly incensed last year when the networks rejected a public service ad on birth control prepared by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists because it contained the word contraceptive: ''It is outrageous that the TV networks, which often show people engaged in sex, will not accept contraceptive ads, even on a public service basis.'' Mr. Schweitzer of CBS dissents. ''We felt that amounted to advocacy for contraceptives,'' he said. ''Once A.C.O.G. agreed to remove the word then neither we nor the other networks had problems with the ad.'' Growing public pressure over such issues is clearly telling on the networks. They are accepting more pointed public service ads about public health and birth control. Mr. Schweitzer noted that CBS will devote 80 percent of its public service advertising to health information during the first part of 1986. ''Last year,'' he said, ''CBS donated time worth $200 million to public service advertising. This year's figure will be larger.'' So even though the condom makers cannot advertise, they plan to piggyback upon the public service TV ads. Most such ads contain telephone numbers or addresses for viewers interested in more information. With Planned Parenthood and A.C.O.G. encouraging people to use condoms if they engage in sex with multiple partners, the manufacturers benefit. Change is coming to newspapers at a slower pace. According to Donald W. Kurtz, vice president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, the vast majority of papers still do not accept condom advertising, although a few are rethinking their policies because of AIDS. ''It is no longer just a contraceptive matter, it's a health matter,'' said Leonard R. Harris, Director of Corporate Communications at The New York Times, which has long banned condom ads and, despite a recent review of that policy, continues to do so. However, Mr. Harris suggests, the policy is by no means engraved in stone. The condom makers are responding to the health issue by playing up the prophylactic aspect in their marketing. Several companies make forthright statements on their packages. Most forthright is Ansell's message for its Man-to-Man brand: ''The condom, when properly used, effectively aids in preventing the transmission and contracting of sexual genital disease.'' Ironically, the condom makers' most difficult sell ultimately may be the original customers. Men. When women began taking responsibility for birth control, few men regretted shedding condoms. Despite experiments with thinner latex, bright colors and ribbing, the product has not been improved enough to win favor with many males. Moreover, men are inclined to play down the health risk, identifying AIDS with intravenous drug users, recipients of donated blood and homosexuals. ''Men tell you they aren't infected so there's no reason for them to use a condom,'' said a female marketing executive in San Francisco, a city that claims a considerable number of bisexual men. ''Yet they can't always know. Something like AIDS can take years to show up. IN JAPAN: THE FAMILY FAVORITE TOKYO As in the United States, condoms are sold mainly in drugstores here. But they are such an accepted part of daily life that many Japanese buy them at supermarkets, from street vending machines and even from door-to-door salesmen. In a poll of married women conducted by a national newspaper two years ago, 80 percent of the respondents cited the prophylactic as their families' preferred contraceptive technique. All other methods lagged far behind, especially the pill, which was cited by only 2.2 percent. Birth-control pills are strictly regulated by the Government, which is worried about their side effects and limits their use. ''Japanese rely on physical measures rather than chemical measures for contraception,'' said Masao Asakawa, an executive at Okamoto Industries, Japan's leading condom manufacturer. Production last year was 806.4 million condoms, worth $55 million at the wholesale level. Figures on retail sales are closely guarded, but they probably were $70 million to $80 million. There are six manufacturers in Japan, but 98 percent of the supply comes from three companies - Okamoto, Fuji Latex and Sagami Rubber Industries. All of them consider their products technologically superior to the American and European versions. Since the 1960's, they have produced condoms with a thickness of one one-thousandth of an inch; the American variety is twice as thick and, in the Japanese view, more uncomfortable. Companies here emphasize this difference, portraying their products as more sensual and appealing. A television-industry code prohibits on-air advertising for condoms, so manufacturers use newspapers and magazines. Packaging is important. Okamoto's condoms are sold in elegant boxes that look as if they might contain mints or cigarettes. Still, sales growth in the domestic market has stopped and the companies increasingly have looked overseas. Last year Japan exported 230 million condoms, or 29 percent of total production. The United States, however, is largely out of bounds. Takeshi Yonese, an Okamoto executive, said the Japanese condom is considered too thin, failing to pass United States Government tests for durability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND A FLAT 25% TAX",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/05/books/liberty-equality-and-a-flat-25-tax.html,"RIGHT REASON By William F. Buckley Jr. A Collection Selected by Richard Brookhiser. 454 pp. New York: Doubleday & Company. $19.95. THIS has been a season for honoring William F. Buckley Jr. He just turned 60. His magazine, National Review, is 30, and his television program, ''Firing Line,'' is 20. He is a man who richly deserves praise. He is generous, erudite, witty and courageous, and he has performed a service to the whole nation, even to those who disagree with him. When the tide of intellectual and political history seemed headed inexorably leftward and the conservative movement was caricatured (not entirely unfairly) as a collection of segregationists, Babbitts and crackpot generals, Mr. Buckley had the temerity to uphold the cause of Toryism. He and his magazine nurtured the movement, helped it recover from the 1964 Goldwater debacle and gave it a rallying point and sounding board as it gradually gained the strength and respectability to win the Presidency. Conservatism is far from the dominant intellectual force in the country today, but neither is liberalism. There is now a balance between the movements, a permanent contest, and Mr. Buckley deserves credit for helping make it so. It would have been exciting if Mr. Buckley's various anniversaries had been commemorated by publication of a different book from this one, which is mostly a collection of columns over the last seven years. He reportedly knocks out his column in 20 minutes flat -three times a week for 260 newspapers. That is too little time for serious contemplation of difficult subjects. Often he picks targets that are like fish in a barrel -human rights hypocrisy at the United Nations, Jimmy Carter's rejection of any ''inordinate fear of Communism,'' Marxism as a failed economic model, advocacy of pederasty by a homosexual-rights leader and, of course, evil doings of the men who run the Soviet Union. He hits these every time, but it would be more interesting to see him analyze why so many people in the world are hostile to the American system, what we ought to do about dictators friendly to us who get in trouble with their own people, how to cope with poverty, what to think about homosexuality and whether the democratic West can prevail in protracted struggle with the determined Leninists in Moscow. Mr. Buckley's ethical system is deeply rooted in religion. He opposes abortion, and he defends the Moral Majority's right to be heard, but he is not a book-ban-ning ''New Right'' authoritarian determined to ''Christianize America.'' In his youth, Mr. Buckley was (or sounded) arrogant, strident and intolerant, but nowadays he can afford to be gentle. One of the best columns in this collection is a deft scolding of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith for honoring Hugh Hefner of Playboy magazine by giving him a First Amendment Freedoms Award. The racial toleration for which the Anti-Defamation League strives, he says, rests on the idea of the sanctity of the individual - ''yes, even that of the nubile girl'' - whereas Playboy subordinates anything and anyone to ''gratification of the male sexual impulse.'' In the same column, Mr. Buckley says that racial tolerance is also based on ''the proposition that we are all brothers, created equal by God.'' Not all conservatives believe that, but Mr. Buckley indicates that he now shares Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream ''that white and black Americans would in due course mix as though differences in the color of their skins were irrelevant.'' He turns this proposition smartly against Dr. King's would-be heir, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whom he accuses of an ''exuberant tribalism,'' of trying to persuade blacks that ''their ethnic bond is the chain that binds them together above all other kinships,'' which ''isn't good, not for blacks, not for America.'' Mr. Buckley believes in the equality of all mankind under God and before the law. He also believes that all citizens should pay equal tax rates - specifically, 25 percent. He stoutly (one might say, devoutly) believes that this will not only be good for the rich, but also for the nonrich, who will benefit from increased job opportunities. There is no specific endorsement in this book of supply-side economics in all its aspects, but Mr. Buckley surely seems an implicit adherent of that movement. To the supply-siders' greatest political problem, a profligate doubling of the national debt in just five years, Mr. Buckley has the same answers as Mr. Reagan - deep domestic spending cuts and passage of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Mr. Buckley favors welfare, shelter, medical care and food assistance to the poor, but not redistribution of wealth and not dependence on the state to uplift the underclass. Mr. Buckley believes in the old virtues -''hard work, faith and self-reliance'' - and he finds great satisfaction in the fact that 30 percent of voters making under $5,000 per year and 50 percent of those in the $5,000-$10,000 bracket voted for Mr. Reagan in 1984. I N foreign policy, Mr. Buckley is not one of the New Right conservatives who, echoing Woodrow Wilson and John F. Kennedy's Inaugural, want to do battle with Communist regimes because they are evil. More than once, he refers favorably to John Quincy Adams's statement in 1821 that America ''goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.'' But neither is he an isolationist who wants to arm to the teeth but never fight. Mr. Buckley believes in intervention, including declaring war, to protect American interests. He would have declared war on Iran -though, for tactical reasons, not dropped any bombs -when ''students'' seized hostages at the American Embassy. He was delighted when the United States invaded Grenada. He clearly wishes to do the same in Cuba any old day because it is ''a Soviet salient deep within the womb of territory putatively protected by the Monroe Doctrine.'' Mr. Buckley expresses disappointment that Mr. Reagan hasn't been tougher on Moscow and Havana, but he doesn't really blame the President. It is, he says, ''because the Western spirit is weak.'' There is a hint of deep pessimism here from a man whose experience and accomplishments should make him an optimist like the President. And after all the victories conservatism has scored, Mr. Buckley still believes that ''the liberals have pre-empted the categories'' of public discussion. Is the West too weak to prevail? Are the liberals really still ahead? Is William Buckley really a pessimist? These are subjects for a serious book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WORST-CASE SCENARIOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/05/books/worstcase-scenarios.html,"MOTHERS ON TRIAL The Battle for Children and Custody. By Phyllis Chesler. 651 pp. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company. $22.95. NEARLY 15 years ago in ''Women and Madness,'' Phyllis Chesler suggested that motherhood was a burden from which women needed to be freed. In ''Mothers on Trial,'' she describes it as a birthright for them to defend jealously. This apparent change of heart coincides with changes in popular feminist priorities; children have become as politically correct as careers. It also reflects the harm done to women, particularly older, traditional homemakers, by ''enlightened,'' nonsexist family-law reforms. Women have been impoverished by no-fault divorce and low, short-term alimony awards. Now, according to Phyllis Chesler, courts are less likely to presume mothers make better parents, and women are beginning to lose their children. Fathers have traditionally ''owned'' their offspring, as well as their wives, but throughout most of this century sex roles and social ideals kept mothers and children together - where Phyllis Chesler believes they belong. Today, she charges, the emergence of a New (sensitive) Male, the fathers' rights movement and antifeminist backlash are inspiring a spate of unjust paternal custody awards. ''Mothers on Trial'' is a fiercely polemic indictment of this development. With little hard statistical evidence to support her, Phyllis Chesler relies on anecdotes, case studies, expert testimony and her own impassioned belief that paternal custodial challenges are witch hunts designed to enforce patriarchal codes of maternal behavior. Beginning with a dramatic, selective history of mothers and custody from 1600 to the present, ''Mothers on Trial'' presents an impressive collection of horror stories about women who have been wrongfully deprived of their children. The primary focus is on interviews the author conducted with 60 women who were challenged for custody between 1960 and 1981. She did not interview the fathers (although she did talk to men involved in other custody disputes). Readers will hear only one side of these very rancorous cases. Still, the mothers' stories are believable and disturbing. All had followed traditional paths of marriage and motherhood; acting as their children's ''primary care givers,'' they had been what Phyllis Chesler calls ''good enough'' mothers by conventional standards. The overwhelming majority of the women lost custody, some to fathers who had been physically abusive, delinquent in child support payments or guilty of kidnapping their children. One of the most important factors in almost all of these cases was money; fathers were better able to afford litigation and could offer more material comforts to their children. Phyllis Chesler presents these as ''worst-case scenarios,'' suggesting that gross abuses of justice occur only in a society that routinely tolerates lesser ones. Whether her case studies are indeed indicative of a pervasive ''anti-mother'' bias or merely anomalous, they do highlight double standards for male and female parents. Mothers are forced to choose between custody of their children and ''self-determined'' lives, with interests outside the home. Fathers are allowed and expected to be absentee parents, and those who sporadically engage in child care are considered ''heroic.'' Supplementing her interviews with a sampling of other recent custody cases, Phyllis Chesler makes clear that it is relatively easy for a man to be a ''good enough'' parent and nearly impossible for a woman. Unfortunately she is not content to make this point alone or to make it in a way that will persuade readers who do not already share her views. She has a penchant for stating her opinions as facts (she doesn't argue so much as pronounce), issuing proclamations about patriarchal oppression that some will applaud and others call strident. (''Husband murder today is still treated as a form of regicide,'' she states. ''Unprovoked wife murder is still treated as the prerogative or sport of kings.'') Her brief, rhetorical discussions of such complex matters as abortion and reproductive technology are gratuitous. Moreover, although ''Mothers on Trial'' is heavily annotated, with nearly 200 pages of footnotes, it rests on some inadequately substantiated assertions. To support her claim that the child's ''best interests'' have generally been equated, in court, with the father's interest in custody, Phyllis Chesler cites an excerpt from an article in the Harvard Women's Law Journal stating that the ''best interest'' standard is an unduly subjective one. Her use of statistics is equally sloppy and misleading. In the preface she states that one million fathers won legal custody between 1975 and 1985; she later reduces this figure to 400,000. In neither instance does she offer a comparable estimate of the far greater number of women who won or retained custody during the same period. Finally, there is little hard information here about custody laws nationwide. A survey of state law would have helped to define, objectively, the extent of a pro-father trend. The author simply reports that two-thirds of the states have rejected the maternal presumption ''as customary,'' without noting whether they continue to use it at all or what they use in its stead. ''M OTHERS ON TRIAL'' concludes with the muddled demand that women be granted, automatically, prior legal rights to custody. Phyllis Chesler repeatedly complains that ''the maternal presumption was never interpreted as a maternal right,'' confusing the concepts of rights and presumptions. (A presumption is essentially a rule for determining the burden of proof, tipping the scales at trial.) She cites convincing arguments in favor of a maternal preference, based on the likelihood that the mother has been responsible for primary child care, but it is a great leap from this to a law mandating maternal custody. What Phyllis Chesler proposes is a form of protectionism for mothers, based on assumptions about their vulnerability as a class and, most of all, their superior capacity to rear and nurture children. That women are by nature or social conditioning better parents, as she asserts, is a matter about which reasonable feminists may differ - not a fact of which a court may take judicial notice. Littered with oversimplifications, rhetorical conclusions and boldfaced textual headings, ''Mothers on Trial'' is pop radical feminism. It will engender some appropriate outrage at sexist social injustice without providing a reasoned, credible analysis of its nature and scope. Phyllis Chesler doesn't demand enough of her readers. She settles for making them angry without necessarily making them think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HART SIZES UP THE ISSUES, PERSONALITIES AND STRATEGIES OF '88",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/06/us/hart-sizes-up-the-issues-personalities-and-strategies-of-88.html,"Senator Gary Hart has found splendid isolation in Troublesome Gulch, in a turn-of-the-century log and stone cabin on a dirt road that he says was once a stagecoach line between Evergreen and Denver. But as much as he says he loves his new home in the Rocky Mountains, he clearly has his eye on a better-known address at 1600 Pennslyvania Avenue. On Saturday, Mr. Hart announced that he will not run for re-election and instead will pursue the ''live option'' of seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988. A few hours after making that announcement, the 49-year-old Senator invited a small group of reporters to his cabin to talk about his political plans. With the fireplace crackling, Mr. Hart sat in a large leather chair, an elk hide on the wall behind him, and left little doubt that he would prefer to be seen as an outsider rather than a made-in-Washington front-runner. ''I'm better known that I was two years ago and that's about it,'' the Senator, who enjoyed unexpected success in the 1984 race, said as one of his dogs, Smokey, sat down by him and yawned. Doesn't Mind 'Respectability' He does not expect ''this front-runnership to hold up over the period of time,'' he said, and when ''the dust settles, it's going to look like a whole bunch of new people competing for the same job.'' Mr. Hart said he was not uncomfortable with the increasing attention being focused on him since Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts announced that he would not run for President in 1988. ''I don't mind the respectability,'' he said. ''I think it will give me an opportunity to get across a message, or my views, substantively, on issues like military reform and foreign policy.'' If there is a risk in being seen as the leader of the pack so early, he added, it is ''to be that visible that long and have nothing to say.'' Mr. Hart plans to have plenty to say between now and 1988, he said, and looks forward to the coming political debate with a new generation of Democratic Presidential hopefuls. Among those mentioned as his possible challengers for the nomination are Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, outgoing Governors Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Charles S. Robb of Virginia, and Governor Cuomo of New York. Similarity of Messages With the exception of Mr. Cuomo, who is 53 years old, the others are all in the 40's, and are sounding political themes some consider strikingly similiar to Mr. Hart's. ''I think the similarity of our messages remains to be seen,'' said Mr. Hart. ''I haven't yet heard what the message is.'' Mr. Hart said he would be spending the coming months refining and sharpening his own political views, starting with a series of speeches he expects to deliver next spring on foreign policy. One of them, he said, will deal with the appropriate use of military power. He said none of the likely Presidential hopefuls in his own party have yet ''quite worked out our foreign policy,'' and he added that no one, including himself, has yet defined the ''generational and attitudinal'' dynamics that will be at play in the 1988. In general, he said, his generation of Democratic leaders tend to be ''more market-oriented in economics,'' and opposed to protectionist trade policies. He said they are ''pro-choice on social issues,'' like abortion, and ''have a new and different interest in defense that hasn't quite jelled yet.'' Social Security at Issue Democrats, Mr. Hart said, are still searching for ''a way to be pro-defense without giving the Pentagon everything it wants.'' On one sensitive issue, the 1988 campaign is likely to see a major departure from the traditional Democratic Party line. Mr. Hart, among other potential candidates, has taken the position that new taxes and, if necessary, deferral of Social Security cost-of-living increases should be considered as part of any package to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Asked about the need to broaden his own political base, Mr. Hart contended he would be as strong a candidate in the South and among blacks as any of the other Democrats. One unknown factor is the plans of the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who won strong support from other blacks in his race for the Democratic nomination in 1984. Senator Hart said he did not believe ''any white candidate can make a bloc appeal'' to minority voters in 1988. Black and Hispanic voters, he added, are becoming ''more diverse and less monolithic'' in their political attitudes and ''are listening for new voices'' who offer them something other than just cliches. Of appealing to Southern blacks, he said, ''It's becoming a lot more subtle than just going into black churches in six Southern cities and saying, 'civil rights, civil rights.' I'll make that appeal as strong as anyone for I have the record to do so.'' Where to Base Campaign Most likely, he said, he will locate his national campaign headquarters in nearby Denver. ''It may make a great deal of sense to organize where I will be living when I leave the Senate,'' he said. ''The day is long past - and I think President Carter figured that out - when you have to run a national campaign out of Washington.'' He acknowledged that such a move would be made partly for ''symbolic purposes,'' but added that he has no intention of running an ''anti-Washington'' campaign. Mr. Hart said he does not expect to see the kind of ''constituency group lineup of domino endorsements'' that occurred in 1984. ''I think a lot of people learned what can happen,'' he added. Mr. Hart said his criticism of Walter F. Mondale in 1984 for winning the endorsements of organized labor, women's groups and others was ''misunderstood.'' He said he had actively sought the support of these same groups and will do so again in 1988 if he runs. ''The issue was whether you were willing to say what they wanted to hear to get their endorsements,'' said Mr. Hart. The Senator said he still is not willing to pay that price for endorsements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Deadline Set for Suits Over Dalkon Shield,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/06/us/around-the-nation-deadline-set-for-suits-over-dalkon-shield.html,"The A. H. Robins Company is beginning a 91-nation advertising campaign to inform 4.5 million women that they have until April 30 to file claims for compensation for health problems caused by the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterine contraceptive device. The campaign is aimed at an estimated 2.8 million women in the United States and 1.7 million women abroad who received the device between 1971 and 1974, when the Food and Drug Administration asked the company to halt sales because of health risks. Women seeking to file claims should write to Dalkon Shield, Box 444, Richmond, Va., 23203. The company said claimants would receive further instructions and a questionnaire that must be returned by June 30. The company said the procedure did not require a lawyer. The company and its insurer already have paid about $520 million to settle about 9,450 claims. The campaign was approved as part of the company's petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy law. The company filed the petition last year after being deluged with some 13,000 suits over the Dalkon Shield.

Name That Majority,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/08/opinion/name-that-majority.html,"According to a popular bumper sticker, ''The Moral Majority Is Neither.'' Neither, anymore, is it merely the Moral Majority. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, its founder and guiding light, announced last week that it had created a new political umbrella group, the Liberty Federation. A spokesman said the change had been made ''so we can speak out on a broader range of issues,'' like foreign policy and national defense. But to get back to that bumper sticker: the Moral Majority never did attract a majority of Americans. Six years ago, leaders of the campaign to forge a voting bloc out of religious conservatives estimated their potential constituency at 80 million Protestants, Catholics, Mormons and Orthodox Jews. The Moral Majority registers about 6.5 million members. Majority or no, is M.M. moral? It surely does embrace a certain morality, or at least moralism. Moral Majority is anti-abortion, anti-pornography and anti-E.R.A.; it is for voluntary prayer in public schools. It characterizes homosexuality as ''moral perversion''; says the only acceptable family form is one ''that begins with the legal marriage of a man to a woman,'' and describes ''secular humanists,'' a favorite bugaboo, as ''amoral.'' Now how about this new Liberty Federation? Is its name any more or less well chosen than Moral Majority? Federation is certainly right. Mr. Falwell points out that the Moral Majority's - no, the Liberty Federation's - membership is made up of Catholics, Protestants and Jews. And Liberty? Given Mr. Falwell's recent pronouncements on South Africa (praising its President, P.W. Botha, while assailing Bishop Desmond Tutu as a ''phony'') and the Philippines (''a paradise . . . a free country'' guided by a beneficent President Marcos), it appears that Mr. Falwell defines that word just about as carefully as he does ''majority.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ads Have First Amendment Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/opinion/l-ads-have-first-amendment-rights-939386.html,"To the Editor: The views of Melvin L. Wulf concerning First Amendment protection for commercial speech for tobacco advertising (letters, Dec. 25) are both candid and disingenuous. Mr. Wulf candidly reveals his antibusiness bias by his clear admission that he does not believe that commercial speech deserves protection under the First Amendment. Mr. Wulf would reserve the First Amendment for protection of speech that he considers important and would seem to relegate speech that he considers unimportant to a ''more flexible standard.'' Mr. Wulf is being disingenuous when he suggests that he disagrees only with his former colleagues at the American Civil Liberties Union that commercial speech on behalf of lawful products is entitled to full First Amendment protection. Mr. Wulf also disagrees with clear holdings of the Supreme Court. Is Mr. Wulf ready to suggest that such cases as Virginia Pharmacy and Central Hudson be reversed? Since he is so ready to ask for reversal of well-established constitutional rights, he might be ready to help Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d argue for reversal of Miranda (entitlement to counsel) and Roe v. Wade (legitimizing abortion). The suggestion that commercial speech be denied First Amendment protection is chilling to those who believe both in civil liberties and in a free market system. As Prof. Barbara Burnett of Syracuse Law School has suggested, ''The distinction between speech in the marketplace of ideas and speech in the marketplace for goods does not withstand scrutiny . . . [ to ] some, the importance of the decision-making process is as great in the choice of an automobile as in the choice of a mayor.'' Mr. Wulf has fallen into the trap of intellectual hubris so deplored by true civil libertarians - he would protect only that speech that he considers important and leave to a more ''flexible'' balancing test that speech he considers to be of less social value. Luckily for all of us, the Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment protects speech whether used for the purpose of selling goods or selling ideas. The Court has never suggested that we might have a class of philosopher-kings who can decide what speech is important and what speech is not. The Court has consistently held over the years that controversy calls for more speech, not suppression. It is lucky for all of us that neither ''sunshine patriots'' nor the American Medical Association are decision makers in the field of public policy.ELHANAN C.

U.S. MAY SEEK CURB ON MIRANDA RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/us/us-may-seek-curb-on-miranda-rule.html,"The Justice Department is actively investigating ways to blunt the effects of the Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda decision requiring the police to inform criminal suspects of their constitutional rights before questioning, or to overturn it, department officials say. In recent weeks they have said that the department was considering several options but that it had made no final decision on how, or whether, to attack the decision in Miranda v. Arizona, which Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d recently described as ''infamous'' and wrong. The department, one official said, may file a brief with the Supreme Court asking the justices to overturn the earlier decision, which came in a rape and kidnapping case involving Ernesto A. Miranda. Under another proposal, the official said the department would attempt to enforce a 1968 Federal law designed by Congress to reverse some effects of the Miranda decision. The law, which has been largely ignored because of concern about its constitutionality, permits use of voluntary confessions in Federal cases, even if suspects are not advised of their rights before questioning. Department Exploring Options ''We're looking at a wide variety of options,'' said Stephen J. Markman, Assistant Attorney General for legal policy. ''We are exploring whether or not there are alternative ways of protecting Fifth Amendment rights while at the same time interfering less with legitimate law-enforcement functions.'' He would not discuss details of the department's proposed action. The Miranda rule was based on the self-incrimination provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which says no person ''shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'' Under the 1966 rule, the police are prohibited from interrogating suspects in custody without first advising them of their right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present. Any move to weaken or eliminate the rule would doubtless prompt a battle between the Justice Department and civil liberties groups, which have long argued that the Miranda decision offers protection from coercive police tactics. Law-Enforcement Objections Statements obtained in violation of the Miranda rule are not admissible in court, and that has angered many law-enforcement officials, who say they have been forced by technicalities to abandon cases against dangerous criminals. Mr. Meese, a former prosecutor, is among the Miranda rule's fiercest critics. ''I think the idea that police cannot ask questions of the person who knows the most about the crime is an infamous decision,'' he said last August. ''I think if a person doesn't want to answer, that's their right,'' he added. ''But you've had time after time all these ridiculous situations in which police are precluded from asking the one person who knows the most about the crime.'' In recent months, officials said, Justice Department lawyers, acting with the support of Mr. Meese, have begun reviewing the options for curbing use of the Miranda rule or eliminating it. Change Seen as Unlikely Charles S. Sims, national staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said he was not overly concerned about the department's recent efforts. ''The Supreme Court has rejected the Government's approach in the past, and we don't expect that it's going to be particularly successful in the future,'' he said. ''I don't think that the Court will change the decision it's taken on Miranda merely because Mr. Meese wants to further his own personal agenda on the question.'' Bruce Fein, a former Justice Department official who remains close to top political appointees in the agency, said he believed the department was planning a ''major attack'' on the Miranda rule. He said Mr. Meese might offer a brief to the Supreme Court, asking a reversal of the decision. The brief would be similar to one the Justice Department submitted earlier this year asking the court to overturn its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. More likely, Mr. Fein said, is an attempt by the department to enforce the 1968 law, which declared that confessions in Federal cases were valid if given voluntarily. Failure of the police to recite the Miranda warning would be only one factor in deciding whether a confession was voluntary. Because it appeared to be an attempt to reverse a constitutional ruling with legislation, many lawyers have questioned the constitutionality of the statute, which was part of the omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968. The provision has been largely ignored in the years since. Mr. Fein suggested that prosecutors might now attempt to enforce the law in a carefully selected case, prompting a Supreme Court challenge that would allow the department to argue that it was attempting to uphold the will of Congress. The justices have historically been reluctant to overturn an act of Congress, even when the act was perceived as an attack on the Court. ''My view is that tactically they are far better off to use the Crime Control Act, because then they are vindicating a Congressional statute, which they are obligated to enforce,'' Mr. Fein said. ''They come to the Court not only with an executive branch imprimatur, but with legislative support, as well.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fetuses Grow Up,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/opinion/l-fetuses-grow-up-938486.html,"To the Editor: Logic is a necessary qualification for a head of state, yet President Reagan appears sadly lacking in it. On the one hand, he passionately defends the right to life of an unborn fetus, while on the other, by opposing gun control (even the registration of guns), he disregards the right to life of a human being who is already out of the womb. The incongruity is startling, especially as hordes of people are amassing fortunes by the sale of guns. Does it occur to Mr. Reagan that a good percentage of those fetuses he is trying to save will be gunned down in later years?

LEGISLATIVE 'GOLD',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/nyregion/legislative-gold.html,"Time and again in his State of the State Message today, Governor Cuomo used phrases like ''I shall again propose,'' ''I will once more ask,'' ''I will again pursue.'' And in the process, he unintentionally underscored that a number of the message's key legislative proposals for 1986 were hardly new. Many are leftover from past years, programs the Governor has repeatedly failed to get approved by the Legislature and is now undertaking still another campaign to enact. Once again, among more than a dozen such issues, the Governor called for passage of his housing program for New York City, of an environmental bond issue, of ways to control the rapidly rising costs of medical malpractice insurance. And once again, less than an hour after he spoke, the State Senate's Republican majority was already saying many of them would not be passed. Mr. Cuomo contends that all this is simply how the legislative process works, that a bill sometimes has to be submitted for two or three or four years before lawmakers become sufficiently comfortable with the proposal to pass it. 'The Gold Is That Deep' ''It's like digging for legislative gold,'' the Governor said this morning in an interview before his address. ''You shovel for two days or three days because the gold is that deep. You keep shoveling until you hit it.'' But both Democrats and Republicans suggested today that the Governor had failed to win passage of some programs in part because he had not set priorities but had instead laid out sweeping legislative agendas without concentrating on one or two specific programs. As an example, they pointed to a special session of the Legislature that the Governor called last month to win passage of a medical malpractice insurance bill. Instead of keeping the agenda then to that one issue, he added five others, thereby undercutting the focus of the session and diverting attention from the very issue he hoped to resolve. ''Cuomo says everything is important,'' said Gerald Benjamin, a political science professor at the State University College at New Paltz, who has studied the governorship. ''But the political process can't accommodate that. It has to focus on only a few things at a time. Where does he want to focus? Is it housing? Is it the environment?'' 'A Defining Issue' ''My perception,'' continued Professor Benjamin, who is also the Republican majority leader of the Ulster County Legislature, ''has been that he needs a defining issue or two, substantial achievements that he's going to move toward over a period of time. Otherwise, what will be the mark of his administration? Looking back, what will these years have counted for?'' Mr. Cuomo defended his legislative record, saying that more of his bills -69 percent - had won passage than those of any governor in 20 years. But he added that ''the whole notion of success and failure is inappropriate.'' Mr. Cuomo said that he thought it was his responsibility as the Governor to take the lead in selling his administration's proposals, but that the price was that evey failure was viewed as a personal defeat for him. 'An Unfair Test' ''If you were to spend a lot of time away from the chamber and leave it to your staff, then nobody would ascribe success or failure to you,'' he said. ''It's an unfair test.'' Repeatedly today, both in the interview and the address, Mr. Cuomo refused to attribute the blocking of his legislative proposals to politics, to the fact that he is a Democrat and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. He pointed out that previous governors had sometimes had difficulty getting their bills passed even when their party controlled both houses of the Legislature, although many of those issues that continued from year to year were emotional ones, such as changes in divorce and abortion laws. And throughout the day he was careful to be gracious about Republicans. A Change in Style? That is the style he has followed for much of his term as Governor. Asked if perhaps it was time to change that style, if perhaps more direct attacks on Republicans might break the long deadlock over key programs, the Governor said, ''There is a temptation to develop a whole new style, but I don't believe that the confrontation style works.'' In fact, he is clearly uncomfortable in confrontations. Ordering the Legislature to return last month and take up six of his bills was a confrontational act, but once the legislators were here and the special session had begun, Mr. Cuomo backed off and softened his tone. As its biggest weapon, the Cuomo administration is counting on the fact that this is an election year and that Senate Republicans, who hold the majority with only 35 seats out of 61, will be under strong pressure from special-interest groups to pass some of his programs. ''Do they really think they can run for re-electon by being an obstructionist Legislature?'' the Governor asked. But if the deadlock is to be broken later this session, that certainly was not evident today. Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader, said that ''there is nothing strikingly new'' in Mr. Cuomo's proposals and added, ''This was not one of the Governor's more distinguished efforts.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Proper Interpretation Of the Constitution,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/opinion/proper-interpretation-of-the-constitution.html,"Attorney General Edwin Meese's call last summer for a return to a ''jurisprudence of original intention'' has produced a sharp debate over how we should interpret the Constitution. This debate will not end soon. We have seen the problem of judicial activism before in our history, but never with such reach into so many areas previously left to the political process. On one side of the debate are those who argue, with the Attorney General, that any valid theory of constitutional adjudication must be rooted in the text as illuminated by the intentions of those who wrote, proposed and ratified the Constitution's articles and amendments. Among those subscribing to this view there are, to be sure, differences - mainly over how to interpret certain provisions, such as the 14th Amendment. Even so, the issue is how to read the Constitution, not whether to read it. All who hold to this view agree that the text in all its parts should be taken seriously as a written document whose meaning can be discerned and applied today. The other party in the debate argues, to the contrary, that a valid theory of constitutional adjudication cannot be grounded in the text as informed by original intention. Some argue that it is impossible to know the intentions of the Framers of the Constitution; Justice John Paul Stevens of the United States Supreme Court is even skeptical about whether one can speak intelligently about who the Framers were. Others argue that even if original intention is knowable, it need not be controlling today. Not surprisingly, those who reject a jurisprudence of original intention still admire judicial power. And they attempt to root constitutional decision-making in sources other than the written text - including ''contemporary values,'' ''ethical arguments,'' ''the notion of moral evolution'' and the ''right of equal citizenship.'' In our time, these extra-textual sources typically draw on political liberalism. Examples illustrate the vast difference between these two approaches to constitutional adjudication. In 1973, in Frontiero v. Richardson, a case involving sex discrimination, four Su-preme Court Justices argued that ''sex'' should be treated under the 14th Amendment as a classification as suspect as race. Needless to say, the Framers of that amendment did not contemplate sexual equality. Yet had the four been able to collect a fifth vote, the Court would have, in effect, enacted the Equal Rights Amendment. Such a decision could not have been grounded in any recognizable jurisprudence of original intention, and could only have reflected the Justices' own moral beliefs. Or consider capital punishment. Justice William Brennan reaches outside the text itself and invokes the ''ideal of human dignity'' to say that the Eighth Amendment outlaws the death penalty. For those who ground constitutional adjudication in the written Constitution, however, it is clear that no part of the text proscribes capital punishment. These examples may suggest to some that a jurisprudence of original intention is politically conservative. It isn't. Indeed, it is neither liberal nor conservative. Many conservatives are, for exam-ple, against abortion, but the Constitution does not contain within its four corners a right to life for the unborn. Like equal rights for women and like the death penalty, abortion is a matter that should be decided by the people through their legislatures. The issue is not whether one is liberal or conservative, but more fundamentally whether one believes in the Constitution as law - believes that it contains objectives and intelligible principles that constrain those who consent to it, including and especially judges. If the answer is that there are no such principles and that judges may fill the Constitution with their own beliefs and ideals, we will cease to be a self-governing people, and we will depend for our future on the wisdom, or the lack of it, of judges. Whatever else may be said about original intention, plainly it was not the intention of the Framers to make future generations of Americans dependent upon the unfettered and inevitably arbitrary wills of an elite few.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TEXT OF CUOMO'S 4TH STATE OF STATE ADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/nyregion/text-of-cuomo-s-4th-state-of-state-address-to-the-legislature.html,"Following is a transcript of Governor Cuomo's State of the State Address to the Legislature yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of Channel 13: This is the fourth annual message I've been privileged to deliver. It's an appropriate time for an accounting to the people and, I think, a good time to look forward. The last three years have been a time of achievement. They cap a decade of recovery and move us now, I think, to the verge of a grand resurgence. Little more than a decade ago, with the greatest city in the world virtually bankrupt and the future of the entire state in jeopardy, many of us sat in this chamber and heard the grim but realistic assessment by Governor Carey that the days of wine and roses were over. Our population was down, employment was down, taxes imposed a crushing burden, our infrastructure was crumbling. Businesses fell over one another in the exodus. Our time, in the opinion of many, had come and gone. But many of us, then led by Governor Carey, saw it differently. In the spirit that made this state great, we looked at our troubles and saw them as challenges. And we set about to restore our greatness. Together we worked for more than 10 years to lift ourselves from that low point, and we succeeded. We rescued ourselves from fiscal devastation. And then, three years ago, we took a firmer hold of our future and began to rebuild and renew our state. And at that time I offered to work with you on a program of jobs and justice, in a new, intelligent partnership that would put aside superficial differences and make our only special interest the common good of the people of this state. What we achieved since then has exceeded what some of us had hoped for. And the election year will inevitably be a time for discussing those achievements, a time for taking credit and a time for placing blame. And in all likelihood, some of us will take too much credit and some of us will place too much blame. It is possible that I will not be exempt from that temptation. But now, when we're still removed from the heat and rhetoric of campaigns, let it be recorded for the months ahead that the credit for the good that we achieve does not belong to the Governor, nor to one party, nor even to the Legislature, but to all of us together. It was our common activity - upstaters and downstaters, Democrats and Repubilcans - that enabled us to recover and to rebuild. A thousand times a year for three years we rose above narrow partisanship to join in making laws that sheltered and educated people, that reduced their tax burdens, that made them safer on the street and in their homes and that expanded their opportunities. We put aside polarizing and simplistic political poetry, and we let the plain prose of governance, of our laws and budgets, describe a fresh new brand of governmental philosophy -a New York philosophy that was at once aggressive and pragmatic, a New York philosophy that binds common sense to compassion and demonstrates that government can have a head and a heart at the same time. A 'Clear' Philosphy What we New Yorkers believe, our philosophy, is clear from what we've done. We believe in a free-enterprise system that produces what generations of immigrants came here for and what thousands of our New Yorkers still yearn for - a chance to earn their own bread with dignity. We believe in a government working to provide opportunity for individual growth on an equitable and inclusive basis for all who are willing to use their own talents. We believe in a government that cooperates with the private sector, unleashing the natural initiative and power of our people; a government that helps put people to work and encourages their progress without despising their success or condemning their profits; a government that contributes to the capacity and wealth of our state by providing the physical infrastructure that's needed and by helping to cultivate the human resources that are the essence of all progress. We believe that all who can work should work, but we believe that those of us who have succeeded should contribute, reasonably, to those who, because they are too old or too frail or otherwise impeded, have not been able to provide for themselves in the free-enterprise system. We are not afraid to be called compassionate. But we believe that any system of public welfare that discourages employment and encourages dependence on government subsidy from generation to generation is not compassionate, but callous. Now, of course, in the year ahead there will be questions that will divide us and that will define our differences, and that is as it should be. But it would be a mistake for us to magnify unnecessarily those differences, to draw arbitrary lines in the sand for attempted political advantage, to diverge now from a course that has proven so successful over the last three years. We should continue instead to operate on the proven premise that the very best government will also be the very best politics. Gains Are Listed Now, consider how much we have achieved together over the last three years that way: 894,000 more people at work today than in 1982, an unemployment rate under the national average; our streets and homes and businesses safer, with serious reported crime down 13 percent; the first budget in New York's history balanced according to generally accepted accounting principles. And if we will adopt the budget I will propose next week, we will reduce taxes this year by over $1 billion. That's what we agreed to do together last year. At the same time we provided more help for the mentally ill and retarded, for those grown too old to help themselves and those not yet old enough. And together we made our children's future more secure by investing generously and wisely in schools and computers and books. And all of us are safer on our highways because we enacted new, tough drunk-driving laws and a 21-year-old purchase age for alcohol. And together we produced a massive rebuilding of our roads and bridges and airports and centers of advanced technology and high-tech incubators that are beginning to generate a whole new industry of opportunity. And dramatic assistance to agriculture - an entire community added to the North Country at Fort Drum. Together we produced the first acid-rain law in the nation, the first seat-belt law, the first homeless program. Our population is up, our credit ratings are up. And on and on and on - all accomplished together as a family. Tax Victory Claimed We were able to achieve another singular victory because we stood together as a state. We stood up when no one else would against the radical, ill-conceived proposal to end deductibility of state and local taxes. Our middle class - those of us who are not poor enough to be on welfare nor rich enough to be free of worry - our middle class would have borne the brunt of this attack on our history and our constitutional right as a state. And we ignored those who said we could not win, and we refused to allow our political labels to divide us. With the interest of New Yorkers as their only concern, Warren Anderson spoke against the idea and locked arms with Stanley Fink, and Fred Orenstein joined with Clarence Rappelyea and John Marchi and Jerry Kremer and Ned Regan and Bob Abrams and Pat Moynihan and Al D'Amato, and members of our Congressional delegation, Tom Downey and Ray McGrath and Charlie Rangel, from both sides of the aisle. And I was privileged to be Governor of a state whose leaders, all of them, spoke with one voice in favor of federalism, in favor of fairness, and spoke so insistently and persuasively that the whole nation listened and agreed. We won a victory which a year ago practically no one outside of New York thought possible. And I tell you that this experience is a vivid illustration of the immense power of this state when all of us work toward a common objective. And it should be to us a source of encouragement, perhaps even inspiration, but not a reason for complacency. First, because the battle to preserve federalism is not yet over. This historic struggle against double taxation now moves into the United States Senate. And beyond that, because serious problems remain to be dealt with in this state. For all the affluence and all the power evident in the Empire State, there persists an intolerable amount of deprivation, even despair. And it's no consolation that many parts of the nation share this pain. Many of us are doing better than ever, but the stark truth is we have more poor and more homeless than at any time since the Great Depression. Too many of our people, especially minority men and women, are denied employment. And perhaps our worst and most dangerous failure is the new lost generation of children among us. One of every two minority children are born to poverty - and one out of every five children overall. The dropout rate for minority youth in high schools is appalling. Every year thousands of children are born to other children under circumstances that make their chance of success in this society a tragic improbability. And if we, you and I, look the other way as a generation of children born and raised in poverty, surrounded by drugs and despair, is denied adequate education and employment, none of us will escape the trouble and the pain that will come. Both love and self-interest demand that we do more. New Job Program Now, none of this, nor all of it taken together, should intimidate us. Our success in recent years proves our capacity to meet hard challenges, and we will meet them if we continue on the course that we've set for ourselves over the last three years. The agenda I propose is set out in detail in the full message before you. It's complete, it's practical, and it is emminently achievable. Let me for now just highlight some of its many features, in the time that's allowed us this afternoon. Now, since my inauguration I've pointed out that one of the most productive things government can do is to provide our people worthwhile jobs in the private sector. We've made especially good progess in these last three years. In November of 1985, last November, there were 8 million New Yorkers at work, more than any time in our history. And today New York generates one in every five new jobs nationwide. This year we should concentrate our efforts on expanding these opportunities. Under our director of economic development, Vincent Tese, we've provided a comprehensive long-range plan for doing that. In selected communities with acute needs - places like Buffalo, Oneida, Elmira, Ogdensburg, Mount Vernon, Brooklyn, Hempstead - I will ask you to create New York opportunity zones. Now, in these zones the state will offer financial help, energy, training and tax incentives for new and expanding firms that employ area residents. Communities considered for designation as opportunity zones will be asked to contribute themselves, contribute appropriate self-help initiatives like day care and security services. Now, these opportunity zones will provide incentives and produce jobs where we need them most - in the areas that have not enjoyed the full benefit of our economic recovery. But unlike the so-called Federal enterprise zone, our opportunity zones will not relax public health and safety rules or force people to work for less than the minimum wage. Our New York opportunity zones will help end misery and not write it into law. Welfare and Work We should also make opportunity a more integral part of our system of welfare. This state has never shirked its obligation to provide for the needy, and never will. But a system which doles out money without helping people to help themselves is more cruel than it is kind. And no one knows that better than the men, women and children who are on welfare. Work is better than welfare. I believe we can do a better job of ensuring that public assistance programs lead to work instead of to prolonged dependency. We should insist on measuring the ability of people on welfare to work in the private sector. And for those applicants who are employable, we should conduct a real, effective job search. We will encouarge businesses to hire and train public assistance recipients for real jobs in exchange for wage subsidies from the state and we will expand affordable day-care programs. The intolerable dropout rate among our high school students can be attributed, in part at least, to their feeling that their efforts in school will not be rewarded with a good job after graduation. They need to believe in a future worth struggling for. And so I propose we work toward providing a guarantee that every high school graduate will have a job in the private sector or an opportunity for a college degree. Organized labor and our business community are already at work developing, at my request, an act of partnership with our state government that will start us toward that objective by creating specific links between individual students and clearly identified jobs in the private sector. Now, our education system is a vital part of our opportunity arsenal and we have done much for it over these last three years. We must do more. We have the best teachers in the United States. This year because they are the best, we must see that the people whom we ask to instruct and motivate our children are paid something closer to their special worth. I propose we allocate funds on a need basis to school districts across the state with emphasis on entry-level salaries. I will propose we continue the development of high schools of excellence and that we establish this year's scholarships of excellence at $2,000 each for 1,000 of our most able graduates. The third year of our computer program will be provided for in the budget proposal I'll give you next week. And I reaffirm now my goal that by the year 2000 every child in this state will have the full opportunity to become computer literate. Help for Families Part of our education process must be devoted to helping those who are not in school. Many times these are young people who are leading lives of confusion that can become lives of despair. And no problem we face is more tragic than the syndrome of children having children. I will request additional resources for new avenues to dignity. Our program for adolescent support and pregnancy prevention. Now we can do many things to give our young people, our young men and women a better chance to use their gift of life with more wisdom and reverence. But one thing is most clear, there is ample proof that preventive family planning services can avoid thousands of unwanted pregnancies and consequent abortions. Therefore I will ask for an expansion of our help for family planning services, bringing our annual commitment to this important work to $10 million this year. And in order to give our children a healthy start, I will propose an increase in support for prenatal care as well as for the state nutrition assistance program. Now comprehensive economic development, welfare reform and the encouragement, assistance and education our young people deserve - all of these will contribute to more jobs and a more competitive New York. But there will be no real continuing growth in jobs without adequate and affordable energy. Now, this is an area so vital to the public interest that the state a long time ago intervened directly, becoming both a public producer of energy and establishing a commission to regulate private utilities. I believe in public power. The Assembly majority, led by Speaker Fink, has supported it for a long time. The State Power Authority works well in the energy marketplace, complementing investor-owned utilities. And I'm pleased that Senator Anderson has agreed that the possibility of more public power, especially on Long Island, is worth pursuing. In fact, our own study of the matter is well advanced but I will immediately appoint private-sector experts to supplement that investigation and help us determine with precision the feasibility of establishing public power facilities, on Long Island or elsewhere, and I will ask them to report as soon as possible, certainly well before the end of this session, so that we will have a chance if it is practical to do something this year. More Hydropower Hydropower is one of the most valuable natural resources that we have. It is cleaner, cheaper and a safer source of energy. So I will continue to work to bring more hydropower from Canada into our state, especially to southeastern New York. Reallocation of existing low-cost hydropower from upstate to downstate is another question. I understand the eagerness of the downstaters to share this cheaper power. But even substantial reallocation would produce only minimal help downstate while it would be devastating upstate. I will oppose reallocation, as I have in the past. I do this in order to protect the industries of western New York - in the North Country especially; it is wiser and fairer to seek new sources of cheaper energy for downstate homes and businesses. Now, our attention to jobs and the strength that economic development gives us would be incomplete without careful consideration of one of our largest, our oldest and our most productive industries - agriculture. Agriculture and the family farm are vital to New York's economy. I will recommend expansion of the Agricultural Research and Development Program, I will also ask the Job Development Authority to recapitalize its Rural Development Loan Fund, making cheaper credit available to agriculture. By now, after three years of this term and most of this message, it should be clear that I believe deeply that our future, like our past, will be created mostly by the labor of our own hands and minds in the private sector, through jobs and the freedom and dignity that they bring us. It's just as clear, however, that there are people who are not reached by that system. And where free enterprise fails, intelligent government must begin. Shelter for Homeless Today people are threatened with freezing to death because they have no shelter - here in New York and all across the nation - because there is not enough housing. It is as simple and as wrong as that. And the problem cannot be solved without government help, and it cannot be solved without our help. This state - and this Legislature, I am proud to say - have acted more aggressively and effectively than any other in the Union to provide shelter and care for thousands of homeless men, women and children. But now we need to do more. I will propose an additional allocation to the Homeless Housing Assistance Program of $20 million, an amount I'm sure will be spent with the blessing of every New Yorker fortunate enough to have a roof overhead and a meal to eat. In addition I wish to announce what I believe to be a unique initiative to help homeless families. Beginning in New York City, where the problem of homelessness is most prevalent, and together with Mayor Koch, we will bring together government and the private sector to provide shelter, social services and a transition into permanent residence and community living for thousands of families. This will bring hope to these families and end the welfare hotel rip-off. Support services, the essential support services, will be made to accompany the housing, and the housing will be built by the private sector. My full message to you spells out a comprehensive Housing New York plan that I believe deals fairly and effectively with all parts of the state and all aspects of the problem, and I ask for your full cooperation in achieving it. Improved Contracts You know that we cannot afford to waste public funds, not for housing or for any public purpose. The Wicks Law was passed generations ago to keep down construction costs. But the evidence indicates it does just the opposite: it drives costs up. If government is to be respected, it must admit its mistakes and correct them. The Wicks Law, in its present, absolute form, is a mistake. I ask you to replace it with more flexible and intelligent contract options that will assure quality, that will assure economy and compliance with prevailing wage requirements. There is another area where the free-enterprise system needs the help of goverment to meet our mutual obligations: The nearly 18 million New Yorkers who share the 50,000 square miles of the Empire State look to us for the protection and renewal of our common environment, our earth and water and air; the beauty and the natural bounty that we're blessed with. I am proposing this year a $1.45 billion environmental bond act. It will be the largest in the history of the State of New York, and it will allow us to remediate hazardous waste sites throughout the state, to acquire new public lands, to promote historic preservation and to enhance our urban parks. One of our greatest treasures is the Adirondacks. That's a region that will be kept more secure if its complex web of life is better appreciated by those who visit there. And so I will recommend that we establish an extensive educational and interpretive center at Paul Smith's College and satellite visitors' facilities at the park's major gateways. Praise for Courts No institution is more important to us than our system of justice. We are proud that our new Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, has so quickly established himself as a leader among the great jurists of the land. I'm grateful to him. I look forward to working closely with the Chief Judge to improve the administration of our courts and, finally, this year to achieve first passage of a constitutional amendment merging the state's trial courts into a single, coherent and unified system. One situation does need further study and should have been dealt with long before now. As long as men and women who are damaged wrongfully by toxic substances are denied the fundamental right to have their cases heard before the courts of this state, we cannot say we have done all the justice that we should do. We must have a toxic torts bill this year. One reason our system of justice has reached a new level of excellence and effectiveness in these last three years is the extraordinary success of our Director of Criminal Justice, Larry Kurlander. This year he will lead our efforts to continue to strengthen the Organized Crime Task Force under Ron Goldstock to enact stricter penalties for drug dealers -particularly those to peddle drugs to children - and to obtain a life-without-parole bill and to continue our support of police and prosecutors statewide. As a continuing expression of my commitment to the state police and my desire to keep this the most effective force of its kind in the nation, I will ask you to increase the uniform police by 200 troopers, giving them the strength they need to serve the entire state. Health Problems We must complete our work on medical malpractice insurance and deal with the problems of obtaining affordable liability insurance in other areas. Our elderly population grows larger every year and for all that we have done, many are not yet adequately provided for - nor are all of our disabled. Our health-care system, and particularly its reimbursement methods, are undergoing fundamental reform and redirection. We must guide that development now. And we will continue to increase community care for the mentally retarded and to reconfigure the residential services for the mentally ill. The battle against the killer AIDS must be continued. I will propose that we double our efforts this year. We must expand our open-meetings law with respect to local governments. And we must keep alive our deep commitment to human and civil rights, especially by speaking out in a substantial and effective way against the ugly sin of apartheid by refusing to deal with businesses that accept an inhumanity we cannot abide. And this year we must face the profound, the perplexing, the spiritually punishing questions of how to define life's end and under what circumstances to allow the end of life. Now, each of these matters is addressed in the message I have delivered to you today. All of this and more. And with all of its pieces, the actions I describe in this message will allow us to use the extraordinary achievements of the last three years as a platform from which to launch a whole new era of progress, to bring us closer to a good job for everyone who's able to work, expanded opportunities for those grown weak and those who have not yet been given the chance to grow strong; a more secure future for our children, a cleaner environment, a firmer grasp on the fundamental values of life that show New Yorkers to be a specially civilized people. And we know we can do it because we have done it before. Call for Action Our Statue of Liberty, whose centennial we celebrate this year, reminds us of that. As the layers of the years are chipped away from her handsome features, we will see her more clearly, and we will be reminded more vividly of the teeming masses yearning to breathe free, of the tired, the poor the wretched and the homeless; people whose names we bear, whose memories we reverence and whose deeds ought to inspire us, for they were a people who overcame fear and prejudice and ignorance; people who began in slavery or in steerage, who through their courage and their love, took the richness of the liberty and opportunity they found here and left us, their heirs, with more than they ever dreamed of. Remembering that, how can we do less than this agenda that I have proposed to you today? We can do all of this and more, for all of it is tied together by two endearing truths - the reality of our problems, of course, but the enormity of our capacity when we come together, as a family should, and bring to bear all the wisdom and all the compassion and all the power of this great place that we call the Empire State. I thank you for the privilege of being able to address you in each of these four years. I thank you for the good work you've done that has benefited the whole family of New York so much. And I pledge to you the fullest uses of my mind and heart in making this fourth year of my term the most fulfilling. Thank you, and God bless you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW GROUP SEEKS STRATEGIES FOR CURBING TEEN PRE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/nyregion/new-group-seeks-strategies-for-curbing-teen-pre.html,"DOCTORS, politicians and social service providers from throughout Connecticut are trying to tell people that thousands of teen-agers are having babies, in all kinds of communities -and that Connecticut can do something about the problem. Armed with studies and stories about the matter, a new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Council created by the state legislature has begun a two-year effort to set a long-term strategy for the state to cut down on teen-age pregnancy. Each year, more than 9,000 Connecticut teen-agers from cities and suburbs alike get pregnant, accounting for more than 15 percent of all pregnancies. ''This issue goes to the core of social policy in this country,'' said the council's chairman, Edward Keane, who has organized teen-age pregnancy prevention programs in Bridgeport. ''This group is key. The issue has to come out into the open.'' The council - which includes state representatives and officials of hospitals, government departments and agencies such as Planned Parenthood - considered at one of its first meetings this month organizing public forums throughout the state in 1986. The purpose of the forums would be to publicize individual teen-age mothers' stories, as well as those of agencies trying to deal with the problem. Meanwhile, State Representative Mary M. Mushinsky, a Wallingford Democrat who first sought to make teen-age pregnancy a prominent issue in the legislature, plans to reintroduce some bills defeated last session that proposed preventative steps. They include mandatory ''family life education'' and health clinics for teen-agers in public schools. Those and other proposals resulted from a task force Miss Mushinsky formed last year in which both pro-abortion and right-to-life advocates worked together on the matter. A state legislator in Wisconsin borrowed Miss Mushinsky's idea of uniting pro-abortion and right-to-life advocates to prepare a package of bills that passed that state's legislature this fall. The issue has caused growing concern elsewhere, too. A November Harris Poll showed 84 percent of Americans considering it a serious national problem. A cover story in the Dec. 9 issue of Time magazine declared that ''teen pregnancies are corroding America's social fabric.'' ''It's going to become one of the two or three biggest issues in Connecticut,'' said a council member, Dr. Victor Strasburger, director of Adolescent Medicine at Bridgeport Hospital. ''We as a group have to educate people about the issues - that it is economic, that it is preventable, that sex education doesn't tell kids to have sex.'' He and Miss Mushinsky agreed that the issue was becoming more prominent because of its increasing expense to the public. More than half of the women in the state receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children had their first child in their teens. Last December alone, benefits for these women and their children cost the state an estimated $5 million. More than half of the Connecticut teen-agers who become pregnant have abortions, according to a report issued by Miss Mushinsky's task force. ''Some kids who experiment in high schools have had two or three before they graduate,'' Miss Mushinsky said. Council members identify various causes for the high number of teen-age pregnancies, including the breakdown of the family, the depiction of sex by the media and a lack of both readily available birth control and important information. ''Every message in the media tells kids: 'Have sex now. Sex is adult. What's wrong with you if you're not doing it?' '' Dr. Strasburger said. ''A 10-minute film strip in the schools on menstruation doesn't do much. Sex is the one thing you're supposed to come out of high school knowing nothing about.'' He pointed to a recent study by the nonprofit, New York City-based Alan Guttmacher Institute. It showed that the United States has the highest teen-age pregnancy rate among industrialized nations, many of which dispense contraception and sex education more openly, despite the fact that American teen-agers are not more sexually active. The task force also identifies unemployment as a cause. Twenty percent of pregnant teen-agers interviewed said they intentionally had children because they saw no future career. The General Assembly responded to that finding earlier this year by passing a bill to use Federal job training funds to reach ''at risk'' teen-agers and teen-age parents. Another task force proposal that passed into law enables teen-age parents who earn 120 percent of the poverty level to remain eligible for Medicaid. A more controversial proposal, which lost by 26 votes, would have set up the ''family life education'' courses. Under the proposal, all Connecticut communities would elect locally run organizations to set up curriculums in the schools, including grade schools, on pregnancy and related issues, such as birth control. Members of the new state council, many of whom served on last year's task force, agreed at a meeting in Hartford earlier this month that they needed to build more support for the idea before it could pass into law. State Representative Norma Leone Cappelletti, a Waterbury Republican, reported on the reaction of a local board of education: ''They said, 'Forget it. That's sex education. You're showing teen-aged children how to have sexual intercourse.' '' The new council includes officials from the State Departments of Children and Youth Services, Health and Human Services and Human Resources, and the Office of Policy and Management. While advocates from both sides of the abortion issue are again represented, this new council is designed more to put the findings of last year's task force into practice, Miss Mushinsky said. ''I found that the state policy on teen pregnancy prevention was in real disarray,'' she said. ''The agencies weren't always on the same wavelength.'' A council member, Susan Bucknell, of the Office of Policy and Management, said state agencies had begun coordinating their approaches to teen-age pregnancy. The Health and Human Services Department and the Education Department, for instance, ''are already talking to each other'' about similar programs they run to help teen-age parents, she said. The new council, she said, will play a useful role in building public support for such efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE MORMONS; GROWTH, PROSPERITY AND CONTROVERSY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/magazine/the-mormons-growth-prosperity-and-controversy.html,"LIGHT SNOW AND HAIL FELL AS MORE than 6,000 mourners crowded into a cavernous, gilded church in Salt Lake City on a chilly Saturday in early November. Outside, thousands of others stood in the cold, trying to share a moment of history with those inside. As the 325 voices of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir filled the church, thousands, perhaps millions, of other Mormons across the country and in Canada participated vicariously in the funeral rites for their patriarchal leader via satellite-relayed television and radio broadcasts. Spencer Woolley Kimball, prophet, seer, revelator and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - the Mormons - was eulogized as a ''noble example of what the Lord expects of all of us.'' The following day, in accordance with church tradition, the man who spoke those words, Ezra Taft Benson, the senior member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, which rules the church, was elected Kimball's successor. Benson, a political conservative whose name became familiar during the 1950's when he was Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower, inherited absolute authority over a unique American institution. A century ago, the Mormon church was a small, persecuted religious cult whose leaders were being hunted down by Federal marshals as illegal polygamists. It is now the fastest-growing church among the major denominations in the United States and one of the richest. From a largely rural sect with roots in the American frontier, Mormonism has become a predominantly urban faith, controlled by an expanding bu-reaucracy in Salt Lake City, with a highly successful program of proselytism that has attracted converts in more than 96 countries. The church owns insurance companies, department stores, television and radio stations, office towers, hotels, industrial parks, orange groves, food-processing plants, hundreds of thousands of acres of productive farmland from Florida to Washington State and other temporal assets worth billions of dollars (box, page 38). With less than 2 percent of the nation's population, the church exercises political and social influence far beyond its numbers - an influence that for the most part is Republican and conservative. Growing at a rate of almost 6 percent a year, the church is likely to become even more influential in the future. The Mormons' birth rate is almost twice the national average. And each day, almost 30,000 bicycle-riding, dark-suited young missionaries go to work around the world in an effort to recruit more members, spreading a gospel, they point out, that is Christian but not Protestant. As Benson took charge of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it was an organization experiencing rapid growth, great temporal prosperity (based on the fact that to remain in good standing Mormons must pay 10 percent of their income to the church) and growing political influence. But it was also strangely haunted by its own history and caught inexplicably in the middle of a murder mystery. The victims were two Mormons involved in a thriving commerce in the sale of documents from the church's early days. There have been no arrests, but if nothing else, the police investigation has revealed the church's hierarchy to be obsessed with stopping any tampering with the church's official account of its past. HE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF Latter-day Saints is a native American religion. It is one of a handful of faiths, like Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-Day Adventists, that managed to survive a period of great religious ferment on the 19th-century frontier, an era that produced hundreds of sects that diverged from mainstream Christianity. The Mormons claim to be ''God's only true church,'' created at His direction in 1830 by Joseph Smith Jr., an upstate New York farm boy, centuries after the Protestant Reformation. Many Americans know of the Mormons mostly because of a few members: the singing Osmond family, former Presidential candidate George Romney, the Marriott family of hotelkeepers, or Peter Vidmar, the gold-medal-winning Olympic gymnast. But, driven by a will to succeed that is part and parcel of their religion, Mormons are rising to prominence throughout the country. Mark H. Willes, recently appointed president of the General Mills Corporation, is a Mormon; so is David P. Gardner, president of the University of California; Bruce Christensen, president of the Public Broadcasting Service; Nolan D. Archibald, chief operating officer of the Beatrice Foods Company, and Dr. William C. DeVries, the surgeon who implanted the first mechanical heart. Under President Reagan, Mormons have become more influential in Washington. David Fischer, the President's longtime personal assistant, is a Mormon, as are Rex E. Lee, the former United States Solicitor General, and Richard Wirthlin, Mr. Reagan's political adviser and poll taker. One of Utah's two Republican Senators, Orrin G. Hatch, has played a major role in an effort to reshape the Federal judiciary by appointing judges with more conservative views. The other, Jake Garn, was the first Congressman to go into space. Both are Mormons. The Central Intelligence Agency recruits heavily among young Mormons returning from missionary work abroad because of their experience overseas, their ability to speak foreign languages, their strict morality and conservative outlook. Mormons also show up in large numbers in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When their leaders ask them to do something, Mormons respond forcefully. Last January, members were asked to fast for a day and contribute the money saved to victims of the Ethiopian famine. A week later, they contributed more than $6 million. Four years earlier, church leaders asked members to help defeat the proposed Federal equal rights amendment. Largely because of pressure brought by Mormons in states that had not yet ratified the amendment, the measure was stopped in 1982. When he died on Nov. 5, at the age of 90, Spencer Kimball had presided over the church for almost 12 years. Like most top Mormon elders, he had risen to power after a successful business career. Although he was seriously ill and little more than the titular head of the church in the last four years of his life, the former insurance man presided over the church during a period of phenomenal growth. Worldwide membership jumped 75 percent during his tenure, to more than 5.8 million, including about 2 million overseas. New temples were opened in South Africa, Tonga, Tahiti, the Philippines, Guatemala, Japan, Brazil, East Germany, Mexico, Australia and a dozen other countries. The temples have attracted attention, not only because local people tend to view Mormons with suspicion, but because of the buildings' stunning architecture. A few of them bear a resemblance to the Salt Lake City temple, with its six Gothic towers, but many are strikingly contemporary, with tall, sharply pointed steeples that provide an almost unworldly aura. During his tenure, Kimball demonstrated that the church could still be as pragmatic as it had been in 1890. That year, one of his predecessors as the church's prophet, declaring that he had been in-structed to do so by divine revelation, banned the practice of polygamy. A law prohibiting ''plural marriages,'' as Mormons call the practice, had been passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court. Barring polygamy was the price demanded by Washington for Utah's admission to statehood, and the church leaders complied, abolishing one of the foundations of early Mormon doctrine. On June 9, 1978, Kimball said God had revealed to him that black males, formerly excluded because they carried ''the curse of Cain,'' should be given full status in the church. The decision not only improved the church's public standing at a time of growing criticism in the aftermath of the 1960's civil rights movement, it also opened the way for expanded missionary work in Africa and Latin America. RISING 28 STORIES, THE OFFICE BUILDING OF the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City is the tallest building in Utah. Its top floors look down on the dome of the State Capitol, less than a mile away. Brigham Young brought members of the church to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. His legacy is a state that is the closest thing to a theocracy America has produced. Seventy percent of Utah's residents are Mormons, and the church dominates its political, social and business life. From the skyscraper overlooking the city and the nearby Wasatch Mountains, hundreds of Mormon bureaucrats manage farflung ecclesiastical and eco-nomic enterprises. Nearby, on Temple Square, are the piercing Gothic spires of the mother temple and the domed Mormon Tabernacle where each Sunday morning the famous choir performs on a nationally broadcast radio program. Almost lost amid this architecture is a more modest, 75-year-old building where the senior elders of the church exercise absolute authority over the Mormon flock. At the top of the theocracy is Benson, 86, who as the president, prophet, seer and revelator, is said to speak with the word of God. Next in line are two presidential counselors, who share with Benson the office of the First Presidency: Gordon B. Hinckley, 75, who runs the church on a day-to-day basis, and Thomas S. Monson, 58, a former publisher of the church-owned Salt Lake City newspaper, The Deseret News. The next tier is the Council of the Twelve Apostles, followed by the First Quorum of the Seventy. Collectively, all are known as the General Authorities of the church. Recently, two of the apostles greeted a visitor in a wood-paneled office in the administration building. The visit came at a difficult time for the church. Documents from its earliest days, which some viewed as a kind of Mormon Dead Sea Scrolls, had surfaced and seemed to place in doubt some of the church's fundamental teachings. Worse, two Mormons involved in the search for such documents had been murdered and a third narrowly escaped death. Moreover, Mormons were under increasingly bitter attack from Southern Baptists and Christian evangelical sects who view the church as competitors and ''un-Christian.'' Thousands of people each month were being shown a movie produced by ex-Mormons called ''The God Makers,'' that assailed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as ''one of the most dangerous and deceptive groups in the world.'' The film depicts it as a rich cult that dabbles in pagan practices and the occult, distorts its history, brainwashes its members, subjugates its female members and bases its beliefs on scripture that ''is a fairy tale, just like Alice in Wonderland.'' In Israel, Orthodox Jews have rioted over efforts by the church to expand a Brigham Young University study center in Jerusalem, which they view as a beachhead from which the Mormons plan to launch a massive effort to convert Jews. When they received their visitor, the apostles, Neal A. Maxwell, 59, a former executive vice president of the University of Utah, and Boyd K. Packer, 61, a trustee of the church's Brigham Young University, were dressed in dark business suits, like those worn by their young missionaries. The Mormons, they said, had been accustomed to criticism by outsiders since their earliest days. After decades of being ''quiescent,'' anti-Mormon feelings were now on the rise, Maxwell said. But it was to be expected, he added, because Mormon dogma diverges so much from conventional Christian thought. ''It's hard to be noticed on a pastel landscape,'' he said. ''If we were nonsmoking humanists, nobody would pay any attention to us.'' I F THERE IS AN AMER-ica that embodies the vision that Ronald Reagan has for his country - a nation of pious, striving, self-reliant and politically conservative ''traditional'' families where men work hard at their jobs and women work hard in the home raising their children -it is in Mormon country. Mormonism is more than simply a religion that serves as broker between man and God. In the lives of its members, Mormonism is a pervasive spiritual and social presence. It not only promises members an afterlife but also envelops them in an earthly womb that includes emphasis on strong families, stable marriages, and a close community working together to achieve material success. Mormonism, says Peggy Fletcher, publisher of Sunstone, a journal of liberal Mormon thought that is not connected to the church, ''is unambiguous, simple and straightforward when life is full of ambiguity and chaos.'' In return, the church demands conformity and obedience. It is not a democracy. It expects members to have large families - typically, four children; often, six or eight. Members may not smoke or drink alcohol, coffee, tea or even soft drinks containing caffeine. The church tells them how to dress, how they should cut their hair and what their sexual practices should be. A church founded by men who took multiple wives and, according to some historical accounts, sometimes persuaded women to submit to them sexually with the promise of eternal salvation, is now one of the most puritanical. ''In Mormon theology,'' says a pamphlet explaining the church's precepts, ''adultery is next to murder in gravity.'' For a devout Mormon family, life is a constant round of social and religious meetings, all with the purpose, one way or another, of helping members get to heaven. According to Mormon doctrine, Jesus will someday return to rule the earth. When He does, He will turn for help to members of His ''only true church.'' All humans will be resurrected physically and joined with their spirits; if found worthy, they may also be reunited with their families. Everyone will be admitted to one of three heavenly kingdoms, but only the most worthy will be eligible for the highest of these kingdoms. Some will become godlike and redeem other planets, just as thousands of years ago Jesus was sent to earth to become its Redeemer. From early childhood, Mor-mons are warned to prepare for the millennium, to achieve ''perfection'' in their lives, to follow the Ten Commandments and to obey unquestioningly the church's teachings and the words of the current prophet, seer and revelator. At the age of 12, males in good standing are eligible for ordination into the priesthood. As long as they remain ''worthy,'' they have the authority to act in the name of God and participate in the rituals of the church. Females are excluded from the priesthood, but can enter heaven if they have led exemplary lives. They cannot reach the highest of the celestial kingdoms, however, unless both they and their husbands are judged worthy. Any member who violates church directives on doctrine, morality or life style, who challenges the word of the hierarchy, who declines to pay 10 percent of his income to the church, or otherwise fails to pass muster in the eyes of his local lay bishop, faces serious ecclesiastical consquences. The bishop can deprive him of a ''temple recommend,'' the right to enter the temple where Mormons must go if they are to complete the rites necessary to insure for themselves, their families and their ancestors a place in heaven. Sunday services at a Mormon church do not vary a great deal from any Christian denomination: the weekly sermon might include a few words from a lay bishop or congregation member about the importance of living a good life, and there are hymns and a communion service. But the rituals that are held at the temples - which contain clusters of elaborately decorated rooms, including some meant to remind members of heaven - are a unique part of Mormonism. Some of these rituals are similar to rites of the Masonic Lodge, to which many of the early Mormons belonged. Mormons in good standing visit their temple (normally on any day except Sunday) to be married in a complex ceremony in which they are said to be ''sealed for time and all eternity'' and to participate in what the church calls ''vicarious work on behalf of the dead.'' In these rites, they act as stand-ins for ancestors during baptisms and marriages, so that these people may have the same chance of an eternal life as do living Mormons. To help members identify their ancestors, the church operates the largest and most comprehensive genealogical library in the world. Though the Mormons face a new wave of criticism from outsiders, some members, academicians and others who follow Mormon affairs, have been arguing that the church's biggest problems are more internal than external: difficulties managing its rapid growth, especially overseas; an undermining of its teaching caused by changing sexual mores and other social currents; a loss of members to splinter groups that claim the right to practice polygamy; intellectual ferment within its ranks that refuses to die despite efforts to quell it, and a budding restiveness among some Mormon women over the role defined for them by the church. And, though many maintain that the loyalty of its members runs so deep that there is little reason for the church to worry, recent events suggest that some members of the hierarchy are haunted by a fear that the church could be destroyed by research into its past. A CCORDING TO MOR-mon doctrine, an 18-year-old Palmyra, N.Y., youth named Joseph Smith Jr. was visited in 1823 by an angel named Moroni, who led him to a cache of gold plates that the angel had buried in 421 A.D. Four years later, Moroni allowed Smith, with the help of special devices and two scribes, to translate the re-formed Egyptian characters that were printed on the plates. They told how a group had migrated from what is now Israel to the Americas before the time of Christ and had created a thriving civilization. Jesus was said to have visited the New World following His Resurrection and left a message that Smith interpreted as a call to establish a church in His name in the United States. Smith was to call the story that he transcribed the Book of Mormon, and it was to become the cornerstone of the new faith. As the church grew from a tiny frontier sect to a farflung international organization, successive generations of Mormon leaders steadfastly maintained that the Book of Mormon was literally true, and that the church must stand or fall on its accuracy as the revealed word of God. Last October, Ezra Benson, called it ''the most correct book on earth.'' In 1909, one of the church's most respected historians, Brigham H. Roberts, wrote: ''If the origin of the Book of Mormon could be proved to be other than that set forth by Joseph Smith . . . then the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and its message and doctrines, which in some respects may be said to have arisen out of the Book of Mormon, must fall.'' Mormonism has long had an obsession with history. Joseph Smith instructed his followers to make copious records, to keep letters, diaries and other documents for posterity. Many did, not only in the early years of the church, but after Smith was murdered by a lynch mob in Carthage, Ill., in 1844 and his successor, Brigham Young, led the persecuted Mormons to the Salt Lake Valley three years later. This wealth of documents would later create a cottage industry for historians studying the westward movement and other aspects of 19th-century American life. Over the past decade, and especially in the past year or so, many of the fundamental tenets of Mormon theology have been challenged. Anthropologists and geologists, for example, have found increasing evidence to support a theory that American Indians are descendants of people who migrated from Asia via a now-flooded continental land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, not from Israel in small boats, as the Mormons claim. But the greatest challenges have come from within the Mormon community itself. In November, the University of Illinois Press released ''Studies of the Book of Mormon,'' which contains a previously unpublished study by Brigham H. Roberts in which he showed how the Book of Mormon is remarkably similar to another book, ''View of the Hebrews,'' written in 1823 by a Christian minister, Ethan Smith. Roberts would later defend the Book of Mormon. But on page after page of the newly published study, which he sent to church authorities in the 1920's with an appeal for help in resolving his doubts, he pointed out similarities, ''coincidences'' and identical language in the two volumes. He suggested that Smith, who he called a youth with ''an unusually powerful faculty of imagination,'' had fabricated the Book of Mormon. Last May, Mormon leaders acknowledged possession of two letters that raised other questions about Mormon orthodoxy. By then, rumors of the letters' existence had already filtered out of the church bureaucracy. The first, written in 1830 by Martin Harris, Smith's close associate, to a friend, gives an account of the discovery of the gold plates that departs substantially from the one presented to church mem-bers. Harris recalled hearing a rumor in 1827 that Joseph Smith had found a gold bible, then wrote: ''I take Joseph aside & he says it is true. I found it 4 years ago with my stone but only just got it because of the enchantment. The old spirit come to me 3 times in the same dream & says dig up the gold but when I take it up the next morning the spirit transfigured himself from a white salamander in the bottom of the hole and struck me 3 times. . .'' The letter had been donated to the church by a Salt Lake City businessman and Mormon bishop, Steven F. Christensen, who said he had purchased it in January 1984 from two local document collectors, Lyn Jacobs and Mark W. Hofmann. He said that he and another local businessman, J. Gary Sheets, had subsequently spent $20,000 on research that proved it was authentic. In mythology, the salamander is a creature resembling a lizard capable of living in or enduring fire - a characterization, church officials contended, that did not preclude its use to describe an angel. Still, Harris's story was far different from the glorious religious experience described in Mormon theology. If Harris's letter was the Mormon equivalent of a Dead Sea Scroll, it was not the contemporary evidence Mormon leaders would have wanted most to prove the church's doctrine. A week after Harris's letter was made public, Mormon officials, under questioning from local reporters, released a letter written by Joseph Smith to a friend in 1825. They said it had been purchased more than a year earlier from Hofmann, the Salt Lake City document collector, by Gordon B. Hinckley, one of the church's three top officials. Hinckley had kept it in a church vault. Smith appears in the letter to be obsessed with finding buried treasure guarded by ''spirits,'' creating much the same image conveyed in Harris's letter and lending some credence to church critics who claim Smith was an imaginative dabbler in folk magic. Although the letters produced a lot of publicity, many Mormons and outsiders who know the church have insisted that they would have virtually no effect on the faith of the vast majority of church members, whose fealty runs deep and is based on more than belief in the official doctrine. ''Mormonism is not simply a commitment to a theology or a church practice, but a social-cultural order,'' said Sterling M. McMurrin, a Mormon philosopher and the E.E. Ericksen Distinguished Professor of History at the University of Utah. ''It becomes part of a person's second nature; he belongs to the church like he belongs to his family, and he does not quit his family because someone in it turns out to be a rascal.'' Jan Shipps, a leading non-Mormon historian of the church, agreed. A professor and director of the Center for American Studies at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, she said: ''Religions have an almost infinite capacity to explain things away.'' Mormonism, as a church of revelation, she said, can always revise its doctrines to accommodate new information. All it takes is a few words from the current prophet, seer and revelator. Nevertheless, at least some members of the Mormon hierarchy appear to have been growing increasingly troubled that old documents and research into the church's past, could undermine members' faith. These fears apparently began to harden in the early 1980's, when Mormon elders ordered the closing of certain church archives to scholars they regarded as unfriendly to the church. They also disbanded a team of professional historians that Ezra Benson, then an apostle, had condemned for attempting ''to inordinately humanize the prophets of God so that their human frailties become more evident than their spiritual qualities.'' Davis Bitton, a history professor at the University of Utah and a member of the church historical team that was dissolved in 1982, said members had been allowed considerable freedom early in the group's 10-year existence. But as time passed, they were progressively denied access to certain documents and church authorities increasingly pressured them not to publish work on topics such as polygamy that might embarrass the modern church. They were also forced to ''sanitize'' reports that might show early church leaders or the official doctrine in a dim light. Bitton said one member of the department, a librarian, regularly checked writings of church historians, ''underlined passages he considered inappropriate and sent these annotated copies to his personal contacts within the General Authorities.'' Stanley R. Larson, a New Testament scholar who lives in a Salt Lake City suburb, says he was forced from his job in the church's translations department this fall after writing a paper that concluded that the text of a speech attributed to Jesus in the Book of Mormon had probably been copied from a King James version of the Bible. The speech, Larson said, contains mistakes in translation identical to those found in copies of the Bible available in Joseph Smith's time. ''Stan has a new job now, and he's happy,'' said Larson's wife, Patricia, who, like him, is a Mormon. ''Now he's free to think for himself.'' Mormon leaders defend the limits placed on historians by saying that any research published by church employees carries the church's official imprimatur and that they do not want to be in a position of seeming to endorse material contrary to official view. Historians with the proper ''degree of commitment for the church'' may have access to Mormon archives, Elder Maxwell said. In June, Gordon Hinckley, in a speech relayed by satellite to Mormon young adults around the country, declared that the church encouraged ''individual freedom of inquiry, thought and expression.'' But he assailed those who were ''poking into all the crevices of our history, ferreting out little things of small import and magnifying them into great issues of public discussion, working the media in an effort to give credibility to their efforts.'' The recently discovered letters, Hinckley said, ''have no real relevancy to the question of the authenticity of the church or the divine origin of the Book of Mormon.'' In a speech at Brigham Young University in August, Dallin H. Oaks, an elder of the church, told Mormons to look skeptically at news reports and new histories of the Mormons, calling them often biased and told out of context. Satan, he said, ''can use truth to promote his purposes'' and ''the fact that something is true is not always a justification for communicating it.'' Oaks, who served as president of Brigham Young University, as a justice on the Utah Supreme Court and as chairman of the board of Public Broadcasting Service before being made an apostle in 1984, added: ''Criticism is particularly objectionable when it is directed toward church authorities; it is one thing to deprecate a person who exercises corporate power or even government power; it is quite another thing to criticize or deprecate a person for the performance of an office to which he or she has been called of God. It does not matter that the criticism is true.'' On Oct. 6, speaking at the church's annual fall conference, apostle James E. Faust sent a strong warning to the flock. Mormons, he said, who were questioning official accounts of Joseph Smith's experiences or were challenging ''his successors or any of the fundamental, settled doctrines'' of the church could be doing so at ''spiritual peril.'' A T ABOUT 8:15 A.M. on Oct. 15, Steven Christensen, the 31-year-old Salt Lake City investment counselor and Mormon bishop who had donated the Martin Harris letter to the church, arrived at his sixth-floor office in the Judge Building, a few blocks from the mother church at Temple Square. He leaned over to pick up a package addressed to him that was on the floor in front of his office. It exploded, hurling his body through his office door and puncturing it with a fusillade of hardened-steel cement nails. Later that morning, Kathleen W. Sheets, 50, whose husband had helped Christensen authenticate the Harris letter, returned to the family's home in a well-to-do Salt Lake City suburb after a trip to the bank. A package was waiting near the house. She picked it up and it exploded, killing her instantly. Later that day, a police official said, ''These are our suspects,'' and held up a lengthy computer printout listing investors in a troubled financial company headed by Mrs. Sheets's husband and with which Christensen had once been affiliated. But that afternoon, police subsequently learned, a series of events began that added another dimension to the murder investigation and seemed to rule out the investors. At about 2:50 P.M., Mark Hofmann, who had located the Martin Harris and the Joseph Smith letters, arrived at the world headquarters of the church. The 30-year-old Hoffman was a former missionary who had turned an adolescent preoccupation with church history into a prosperous business. At the headquarters, he asked to see Hugh W. Pinnock, an elder and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Pinnock was not there, but apostle Dallin H. Oaks agreed to see him. Oaks later said that he recognized Hofmann's name because Pinnock had told him that he and Steven Christensen had been trying to purchase a set of documents from the early days of the church known as the McLellin Collection. This collection, long ru-mored to exist, was said to contain letters and other materials compiled by a contemporary of Joseph Smith's, William E. McLellin, including some with possibly damaging comments about Smith and Mormonism. Oaks said Hofmann was planning to sell the collection to an unidentified person who intended to donate it to the church. The sale was scheduled to take place the following day. According to Pinnock, Christensen had introduced him to Hofmann the previous June, and Pinnock had agreed to help Hofmann raise $185,000 to buy the McLellin Collection from an unidentified source in Texas. Pinnock, a former director of the First Interstate Bank in Salt Lake City, said he called a bank officer who agreed to lend the money to Hofmann. (After the bombings, Pinnock said he had repaid the loan from his own funds.) According to Oaks, when Hofmann visited church headquarters on the afternoon of the bombings, he told Oaks he expected to be questioned by the police regarding the murders. ''He said he was worried about what he should say to them,'' said Oaks. ''I told him he should just answer their questions and tell them the truth.'' After about 10 minutes, Oaks said, Hofmann left. Police said the unidentified church member who had agreed to buy the documents from Hofmann and then give them to the church had drawn a check for $185,000 and planned to purchase them at 2 P.M. on Oct. 16. At 2:40 P.M. that day, a bomb detonated two blocks from the church's headquarters and blew apart a small car, severely injuring its owner - Mark Hofmann. Within hours, police officials said that Hofmann had been the principal suspect in the bombing murders the day before and, while carrying a third bomb, ''blew himself up.'' Hofmann denied it and was not charged with the murders. However, he and a 28-year-old friend, Shannon Flynn, were charged with possession of an illegal weapon, an Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun, allegedly found at Flynn's home. Following the bombings, Flynn had also asked church officials for advice on what he should tell the police. Nearly three months after the murders, the question of who planted the bombs remains a mystery. Police officials still maintain that Hofmann is their leading suspect, but independent polygraph experts say he easily passed a lie detector test in which he disclaimed culpability. Rumors have circulated in Salt Lake City that a s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cret group of right-wing Mormons was somehow involved in the deaths. Hofmann has refused to discuss the case with reporters, but according to a friend, he believes a ''religious crackpot'' unhappy with his commerce in documents from the Mormon past may have set the bombs. In the ensuing weeks, members of a Texas family said they had the McLellin Collection in a safe-deposit box and had never heard of Mark Hofmann before the bombings. Nothing has surfaced to link church leaders in any way to the murders. But during the investigation, it has become evident that high officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were doing a brisk business with Hofmann. Hinckley said at a press conference that, starting in 1980, he had purchased about 40 documents from Hofmann. Only a few of them have been made public; others are in a church vault. Whether they cast any new light on the church's past is not known. Whatever the outcome of the investigation, few people expect the church hierarchy to relax its resistence to efforts to rewrite its history. ''When all is said and done,'' Hinckley told a church conference recently, ''the only real wealth of the church is the faith of its people.'' T O MANY MORMONS, a much more important question than who planted the bombs is: In what direction will Ezra Taft Benson take them? The answer: Probably to the right, but not as far as some church critics expect. For much of his life, Benson has had close personal ties to the John Birch Society and similiar conservative organizations. At various times, he has attributed the nation's civil-rights movement to ''Communists'' and questioned whether it was possible to be a good Mormon and a liberal Democrat at the same time. He has also been a leading force in the church hierarchy seeking to crack down on dissenters and historical revisionists. Yet, insiders say, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is run on a much more collegial basis by the Council of the Twelve Apostles than many non-Mormons realize. Many of the most recently appointed apostles are less dogmatic than Benson is, and because of his age, Benson may turn over much of the day-to-day operation of the church to Hinckley, considered a moderate by Mormon standards. According to this view, there will be no more change in the course of the church than there would be at any large, successful corporate entity being taken over by new management. In his first public statement as prophet, seer and revelator, Benson seemed anxious to change his image as an archconservative when he said: ''I love all our Father's children of every color, creed and political persuasion.'' Still, others argue that Benson's personal feelings run too deeply for him to tolerate any significant dissent. Almost no one expects him to grant Mormon women full ecclesiastical equality with men as priests of the church, which many have sought. On one thing, Benson and the Council of Twelve Apostles seem in full accord - a strong belief in the need to protect the ''traditional family,'' which means resistance to pornography, homosexuality, abortion and women working outside the home, among other things. It is a battle that the church has been losing to some extent. Despite the pervasive presence of the church in Utah, the state's divorce rate is higher than the national average. While the rate of alcoholism is lower than the national average, social workers say Utah has serious problems with drug abuse, child abuse and teen-age pregnancies. Church pressure on women to stay home with their children notwithstanding, a Federal survey in 1984 found that 54.4 percent of Utah women over the age of 16 worked outside the home, higher than the national average. ''In the past two or three years, we've taken some steps backwards,'' said Linda King Newell, who with her husband, Jackson, edits Dialogue, a journal unaffiliated with the church that often questions its official line. The church, she said, had tried but not succeeded in halting efforts to probe into its past. Like some other Mormon observers, she maintains the church hierarchy has married itself too firmly to the literalness of the Book of Mormon. ''History doesn't change, but what we know about it does change.'' If honest scholarship proved that some Mormon doctrines were faulty, she said, the church could adjust to it and perhaps even be strengthened by it. But she said she didn't expect much assistance from the men who run the church. ''Change comes two ways in the Mormon Church,'' she said. ''Slowly or not at all.'' ONLY A HANDFUL OF high officials and senior members of a management team that runs the far-flung Mormon business empire know precisely how rich the church is. When members of the Council of Twelve Apostles are asked to place a value on the church's assets or to estimate its income, they say the church never discusses its financial affairs with outsiders. Public records, nevertheless, indicate that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is enormously wealthy, richer probably than any religious organization in the nation except the Roman Catholic Church. In ''The Mormon Corporate Empire,'' to be published in March by Beacon Press, authors John Heinerman and Anson Shupe estimate the church's total assets at nearly $8 billion and its yearly income at about $2 billion, about 75 percent of it from tithing and offerings. Besides temples, churches and other religious facilities around the world, the church owns television and radio stations, a daily newspaper, insurance companies, more than 800,000 acres of working farmland, a company that develops industrial parks, several food processing plants, department stores, office buildings, real estate investments and a portfolio of stocks and bonds said to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Many of the church's properties are controlled by an umbrella company, the Deseret Management Corporation. Among the major Mormon interests are the following. Insurance The Beneficial Life Insurance Company The Continental Western Life Insurance Company The Western American Life Insurance Company The Utah Home Fire Insurance Company Television stations KSL-TV, Salt Lake City (CBS affiliate) KIRO-TV, Seattle (CBS affiliate) Radio stations KSL-AM, Salt Lake City KIRO-AM/KSEA-FM, Seattle WRFM, New York WCLR-FM, Chicago KOIT-AM/FM, San Francisco KBIG-FM, Los Angeles KAAM-AM/KAFM-FM, Dallas KMBZ-AM/KMBR-FM, Kansas City, Mo. All of the stations are operated by the Bonneville International Corporation, a church subsidiary, which also owns the Bonneville Satellite Corporation, the Bonneville Entertainment Corporation and Bonneville Productions Inc., along with other smaller operating divisions. Publishing The Deseret News The Deseret Press The Deseret Book Company Brigham Young University Press Agribusiness Along with several food-processing plants, the church has vast agricultural acreage, mostly held by: U.I. Group, Utah (the church is majority stockholder) Deseret Ranch of Canada Elberta Farm, Utah Deseret Farms of California Deseret Land and Livestock, Utah Deseret Farms of Texas Deseret Ranch of Florida Templeview Farms, New Zealand Commercial real estate The church's commercial properties, as well as much of its assets in agribusiness, are held by two divisions, Zions Securities and the Beneficial Development Company. These include about 60 acres in downtown Salt Lake City and a number of buildings on this property, including the Hotel Utah and Temple Square Hotel; a shopping mall, and the Kennecott Building, headquarters for the Kennecott Company. In an effort to spur development in Salt Lake City, the church several years ago sold part of the site to the family of Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian financier, which is developing it as an office-retail complex called Triad Center. The Bonneville International Corporation is one of the facility's major tenants. Among other church assets are more than 50 percent of the stock of the Zion Cooperative Mercantile Institution, a retail chain that owns nine department stores in Utah; the Northland Business Park, being developed by the Beneficial Development Company on part of the church's 4,400 acres near Kansas City, and the Polynesian Cultural Center," a theme park for tourists in Hawaii that provides jobs to church converts from the Pacific islands.

"LONG ISLAND OPINION; UNWED, BUT JUST ANOTHER MOTHER",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/nyregion/long-island-opinion-unwed-but-just-another-mother.html,"THE two women had never been close. Lucy was a very casual housekeeper, in love with books and music. Margaret, her sister-in-law, was extremely neat and practical-minded. They both, however, had strong and outspoken opinions about life. For example, Lucy was ''pro-choice'' while Margaret believed in neither contraception nor abortion. And Margaret, unmarried, became pregnant. Margaret phoned Lucy [ not their real names ] from her home out of state and reported the news. Her boyfriend decided he couldn't cope with marriage, and she went to pieces. The humiliation she felt in her hometown was devastating. Moreover, her nausea wasn't abating; it seemed impossible to keep on with her job. ''You've really considered all options?'' Lucy asked. ''All, yes.'' ''What do you want to do?'' ''Have this baby. But how? I just can't stand staying here, and I have nowhere else to go.'' ''Come stay at our house,'' Lucy said. So it was that Margaret arrived and that we, Lucy's friends, became involved with a curious and instructive experience. She gathered a few of us beforehand to talk about Margaret. ''I believe in choice,'' she told us, ''and this is Margaret's choice. You're my friends, so I'm hoping you'll be Margaret's friends. Some people have made her feel guilty and some stupid, but we're going to help her feel good.'' There she added, ''I hope.'' She looked around for support. We hadn't much to give. Married, sheltered in middle-class neighborhoods, we hadn't seen a living, breathing unwed mother in years. We also had trouble believing that Margaret, in her mid-20's and known for good sense, had not practiced some form of birth control. And in addition, we were arty-bookish types; would she even want us as friends? ''Well,'' somebody said, ''we can at least make an effort. Let's put up some streamers and make a fancy sign saying ''Welcome Margaret.' '' It turned out not to be as bad an idea as it sounded. When she came, tired and shaky from the trip, we were not present but our handiwork was, along with a symbolic bottle of champagne to celebrate her courage. Lucy phoned me that evening: ''She's in bed but she wants me to say thank-you for her.'' ''Was she pleased?'' ''She cried,'' Lucy said. ''Oh my!'' ''And she said it felt wonderful. She wants to make us a luncheon next Saturday.'' It was a simple lunch, though I don't know how she managed it. One could see, in her eyes, the nausea. Still, she was efficient and neat -perhaps a bit prim to our eyes. ''So,'' she said to start some conversation, ''I guess you're, like, intellectual? I've always thought heavy reading is a waste of time, myself.'' Nonplussed, we answered in concert, ''Is that so?'' There followed a leaden silence. Lucy cleared her throat. Margaret had an appointment with a doctor, she said, ''and maybe you can give her the lowdown on him.'' ''I'm scared, going to a strange doctor in a strange town, kind of like a child would be,'' Margaret said then. The silence melted. We were full of reassurance, and Margaret became full of questions. She made us feel like experts on reproduction, roles normally left to nurses and other pragmatic women on our streets. Our ponderous advice, fortunately, was lightened by one companion who gave a comic routine on ''The First Feeding of the Newborn.'' Margaret, whose lips had been tight with emotional pain, relaxed and laughed. I never remember being so pleased with someone's laughter. It was a signal that we could hang together as her companions. I don't know what the others felt, but I'd come to meet her imagining that in the company of a pregnant person whose fiance ran off, one pretended the pregnancy wasn't happening. Humor, I had assumed, would be as out of place as at a funeral. None of us ever had been noisy about our abortion views, and we were not of one mind about the issue, either. Two believed it would have been best for Margaret. They saw, as I did not, the cruelty of our culture that offers so little economic and spiritual support to mother and child. I was distressed by the notion of aborting. Regardless, here we were with Margaret, and with Lucy. Those two were of such different personalities and persuasions that I, for one, expected disaster before a month was out. It never came. One would stop in to find them in feisty discussions about cleaning methods, clothing styles, even religion - and then one would see them set out together for a movie, joking. Many times Margaret ran the cleaner around Lucy's feet while she was absorbed in a book. Many times Lucy breezed home from graduate school with a surprise for Margaret - food she especially liked or the True Confessions-type magazines she read. There was an optimism, a momentum one could plainly sense that came from taking on this commitment together. That is not to say there weren't trying times. Though my life became enmeshed with Margaret's and I probably helped her in many small painless ways, I was not Lucy. I never lived through the long hours of depressions; or the desperate hours full of futile hope that the ex-boyfriend would see the light; or the final, fearful hours of labor. Instead, the rest of us received much more than we gave - hours of discussion with Margaret, Lucy and one another. Over time, we talked about all kinds of questions faced by pregnant women in all kinds of situations. Our words weren't abstract theory. They were glued to reality: helping figure the complicated numbers of our friend's medical bills; conjuring antidotes for the nausea that never left her; lugging a used crib to the bedroom. The more disparate our views on abortion, the closer we seemed to become. There was no place for anger or empty catchwords. The deeper our convictions, the deeper we had to search within ourselves, the more we seriously had to listen to others. Beyond dialogue were delicate moments of community that would always stay in mind. I can see one of them now. A friend who has had an abortion appears at the door with baby blankets for Margaret. The two cannot completely understand each other's convictions and they never will. But they are not enemies or faceless stereotypes to each other. Margaret smiles at her friend. ''Sit a while,'' she says. ''Have some tea.'' This period of our lives began to end as Margaret came to term and gave birth to a boy, who developed classic colic. She stayed on a few more months, and perhaps they were the hardest for both her and Lucy, but their alliance held. So did ours. We carried in baby gifts and sometimes took a turn at walking the little one. At last, she took the child and left for her home state where, 11 years later, she still is raising him alone. She never forgets to send a Christmas card, but she rarely visits here. She rarely travels anywhere: her life mainly has been occupied these years with the endless work of survival. Margaret virtually disappeared from our lives, but she and Lucy together affected mine forever. One way is in my response to those who utter angry, categorical slogans meant to divide the community of women. I think of those days, and simply cannot hear them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHAT STANDARDS FOR CORPORATE CRIME?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/books/what-standards-for-corporate-crime.html,"AT ANY COST Corporate Greed, Women, and the Dalkon Shield. By Morton Mintz. Illustrated. 308 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $17.95. IN 1971 many women, frightened by bad publicity about the side effects of oral contraceptive pills, were delighted to hear of a new contraceptive alternative: the Dalkon Shield, a crab-shaped intrauterine device that the A. H. Robins Company in Richmond was marketing as ''modern'' and ''safe.'' The company quoted the developer, claiming the shield was without ''the actual and potential hazards of systemic medication for birth control.'' It quickly became the leading intrauterine device, with more than 4.5 million sold worldwide, before sales were suspended in the United States in June 1974. But for the women who used the shield - and ultimately for A. H. Robins, which declared bankruptcy in August 1985 under the weight of 14,000 shield-related lawsuits - it was nothing short of disastrous. At least 110,000 women using the device became pregnant, and more than half of them miscarried; 15 in the United States are known to have had fatal septic abortions and 18 died of pelvic inflammatory disease. Some of the women left the shield in place during pregnancy and gave birth to deformed children, and thousands of others suffered pelvic infections that left them infertile. In retrospect, the most astonishing part of the shield's history is how casually the device was put on the market, with how little testing - and once on the market, how long it took for either A. H. Robins or the Federal Food and Drug Administration to note the damage and remove it. Morton Mintz, a reporter for The Washington Post who has covered the Federal regulatory agencies, does a meticulous job of tracing the steps that led to the ravages of the Dalkon Shield. The first villain of the story was Dr. Hugh J. Davis, then a faculty member at the School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University. According to the book, he invented the shield, produced the false and misleading test results on which the marketing campaigns were based and earned royalties on every shield sold - while passing himself off in medical journals, books and Congressional testimony as an impartial expert. Another villain was Dr. Ellen Preston, a pediatrician and Robins's liaison with physicians, who, Mr. Mintz asserts, seems to have been totally unconcerned about the mounting toll of injuries reported to her by doctors. A. H. Robins, throughout, showed far more interest in profits than in preventing further deaths and injuries. Company officials destroyed documents and made a policy of misleading both physicians and Federal investigators who asked questions about the Dalkon Shield. One employee discovered that the shield's design encouraged the growth of bacteria along the tail of the device and into the uterus. After finding a simple solution, he was ignored, reprimanded and forced out of his job. The lesson of these corporate misdeeds is a troubling one, Mr. Mintz points out. If any single individual had inflicted serious injury on thousands of women, and actually killed some of them, he would surely be prosecuted and jailed. But we have different standards for corporate crime. E. Claiborne Robins, the chief executive of A. H. Robins, is not perceived as a criminal. In fact, because he is a generous philanthropist, having given at least $100 million to educational institutions, he is lauded in local newspapers and received an award in 1982 in Richmond for distinguishing himself in his community. Why, Mr. Mintz asks in a thoughtful epilogue, have we allowed such a chasm to develop between personal and business ethics - why, for example are corporate officers not held personally responsible in such instances of corporate malfeasance. With large corporations wielding so much power over our daily lives, Mr. Mintz says, our failure to deter or punish corporate crime sets the stage for many more disasters like the Dalkon Shield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TRAVEL ADVISORY: BELOW THE SURFACE, ABOVE THE SALT",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/travel/travel-advisory-below-the-surface-above-the-salt.html,"Submarine Sail For Flora And Fauna For those who neither dive nor snorkel, there is now a new means of seeing the underwater attractions of the reefs and grottoes that lie off Grand Cayman island in the British West Indies - a submarine. Built at a cost of $2.8 million over a three-year period, a 50-foot-long, 28-passenger submarine, named the Atlantis and equipped with two-foot-wide portholes, is offering close-up views of abundant marine life and coral configurations during one-hour tours through the Eden Rock, a popular diving attraction near George Town, the capital. During these dives, the vessel, operated by a two-man crew, remains at a depth of 40 to 60 feet. Built of steel, aluminum and fiberglass, the Atlantis is buoyant. In the event of a power failure, it is designed to rise automatically to the surface. The cruises, from a dock on the waterfront, are priced at $45 by day, $35 at night. More information is available from the Cayman Islands News Bureau (Post Office Box 330106, Coconut Grove Station, Miami, Fla. 33133; 305-858-5101). An Astor Home In Britain Now a Hotel In 1666 the Second Duke of Buckingham commissioned the construction of a great house beside the Thames. When finished, the magnificent creation - with its immense terrace, its formal gardens and the mansion that took shape in 1859 after destruction of much of the original by fire in 1795 - was indisputably one of the great country houses of Britain. Known as Cliveden, it has for three centuries been a center of Britiain's political and social life. Home to Frederick, Prince of Wales, to the Dukes of Buckingham, Sutherland and Westminister, to the Earl of Orkney and the Astor family, it has numbered among its guests Winston Churchill, Lord Curzon, Rudyard Kipling, Henry James, George Bernard Shaw and Lawrence of Arabia. Shortly the renowned house will begin life in a new capacity - as a hotel. Under lease from Britain's National Trust, given the estate by Viscount Astor in 1942, Cliveden will be operated by Blakeney Hotels, the management of the Royal Crescent Hotel in Bath. Featuring 27 restored and converted rooms and suites, such art as John Singer Sargent's portrait of Nancy Astor, and 400 acres of grounds known for box parterre, flower borders, hanging woods, pavilions, temples, fountains and statuary, the new hotel, which opens Feb. 16, is 45 minutes by car from the center of London and 25 minutes from Heathrow Airport. Double rooms are priced at $218 and $261; suites range in price from $363 to $508, and all rates include English breakfast and value-added taxes. Among activities at Cliveden are tennis, squash, swimming in a heated pool in the privacy of a walled garden, fishing, boat trips and riding. More information and reservations on Cliveden are available from Scott Calder International (152 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-535-9530 or from outside New York State, 800-223-5581). Country Living, French Style One of the pleasures of winter is planning the summer. And for many people, thoughts turn to living in a foreign country - renting a home or an apartment and experiencing everyday life in the style of permanent residents. In France, this can mean renting one of the country homes known as gites. More than 500 of these homes may be rented from the United States through the French Experience, a New York-based company. The company has available a new catalogue, priced at $5, offering a picture and description of each gite, along with comments on the region, and a listing of nearby leisure activities. Gites are classified by the government in terms of comfort by means of symbolic ears of corn on a scale of one to three. Prices for the gites, available the year round and situated on farms or in villages, range from $90 to $420 a week, with a two-week minimum stay required during July and August. Travelers who are determined city dwellers may rent an apartment in Paris, where centrally located accommodations -equipped with linen, towels, telephone and television (maid service is extra) range in price from $250 a week for a studio to $300 for a one-bedroom, $550 for a two-bedroom and $1,600 for deluxe accommodations - for example, a three-bedroom, well-furnished apartment in a fashionable neighborhood. Apartments and villas in other areas of France are also available. More information and copies of the gite catalogue are available from the French Experience (390 Fifth Avenue, Suite 407, New York, N.Y. 10018; 212-868-3350). A Soviet Tour About Women And Politics In the Soviet Union, is a woman's place in politics? Yes, says the American Soviet Cultural Exchange, a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization that promotes unofficial exchanges between the people of the United States and of the Soviet Union. The role of Soviet women in local political groups is among the questions that will be explored during ''Soviet Women in Politics,'' a tour scheduled for April 5 to 20 by the American Soviet Cultural Exchange in cooperation with the Massachusetts League of Women Voters. In addition, the tour will take up such matters as the domestic role of women, child-care facilities, divorce and abortion. Combining discussions with Soviet women and sightseeing, it will visit five Soviet cities - Moscow, Piatigorsk, Ordzhonikidze and Tbilisi -before concluding with a brief stay in Helsinki, Finland. Based on double occupancy, the trip is priced at $1,749 a person. Included are round-trip air fare from Boston, accommodations, almost all meals, sightseeing, all transportation within the Soviet Union, transfers, services of guide and interpreter, service charges and taxes. More information is available from the American Soviet Cultural Exchange (151 Coolidge Avenue, Suite 609, Watertown, Mass. 02172; 617-924-0713). Swimmers Get New Showcase In Florida Central Florida's Cypress Gardens - in the wake of its merger with Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - has made some improvements at the park as well as introducing a new show to its millions of visitors. Aquacade '85, the high dive and synchronized swimming show introduced last summer, has been revitalized as a showcase for record-holding diving, swimming and water skiing champions. And Aquacade's new attraction, called Showstopper, an 88-foot-high, 200-foot-long snow ski jump enables downhill skiers to reach speeds of 45 miles an hour and leap 70 feet high before twisting, turning and flipping into a swimming pool. A major new show, called Southern Ice, featuring professional ice skaters, has been introduced. Since its founding 50 years ago, 35 million visitors have made their way to Cypress Gardens, which has grown into a 223-acre family attraction with botanical gardens, a high-diving show, a permanent snow ski jump ramp, a water skiing revue and the state's only year-round ice skating show. Besides the electric boat rides through canals where tropical and subtropical flora still flourish, there is a forest featuring 400 animals and birds, a 153-foot rotating ride called Kodak's Island in the Sky, and Southern Crossroads, an antebellum town of shops, kiddie rides, shows and an elaborate model railroad exhibit comprising more than 4,500 figures and 1,100 miles of track. Cypress Gardens, midway between Tampa and Orlando, off U.S. 27 on State Route 540 near Winter Haven, is open from 8 A.M. to sunset seven days a week. Admission is $12.95, children 3 to 11, $7.95. More information is available from Cypress Gardens (Post Office Box 1, Cypress Gardens, Fla. 33880; 813-324-2111 or, from outside Florida, 800-237-4826). Sled Dogs Competing at Saranac Lake Once again it's the time of the year when Saranac Lake goes - literally - to the dogs. Some 2,000 dogs are expected to be on hand to compete for $50,000 in prize money when the eighth annual Alpo International Sled Dog Races are run on the weekend of Jan. 24 to 26. Sanctioned by the International Sled Dog Racing Association, which governs the sport, the competition will consist of three classes of sprint sled-dog races to be run daily during the event. These are the unlimited class, usually consisting of 16-dog teams, running three 15-mile heats; the eight-dog class, running three 11-mile heats, and the six-dog class, running three 6-mile heats. On Saturday and Sunday, there will also be races for three-dog teams open to junior sled-dog drivers, 17 years old or younger, racing as amateurs under the association's rules. Besides the dog races, there will be weight-pulling competitions for dogs of less than 60 pounds to more than 110 pounds, on Saturday and Sunday. Last year's winner in the over-110 class moved a sled loaded with 1,721 pounds of dog food. The Saranac Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, co-sponsor of the event, offers help in arranging accommodations during the race weekend. Admission to the races is free. Additional information is available from Saranac Lake Area Chamber of Commerce (30 Main Street, Saranac Lake, N.Y. 12983; 518-891-1990). William Struhs Members of the Spoleto Festival Orchestra tuning instruments in preparation for an outdoor concert. 2 Birthdays to Be Celebrated at Spoleto, U.S.A. With a birthday party and a significant anniversary, the annual potpourri of the arts that is the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., is scheduled again this year for May 23 to June 8. Not only is this the 10th anniversary of the Charleston edition of the event that had its origins in 1958 as the Festival of Two Worlds in the Umbrian hill town of Spoleto, Italy, it will also mark the 75th birthday of its founder and artistic director, Gian Carlo Menotti. Among highlights of the 1986 festival will be a performance of Mr. Menotti's Pulitzer Prize-winning opera ''The Saint of Bleecker Street'' (which will open the festival), dance by the Scottish Ballet in its United States debut and by the National Ballet of Spain, music by the Baltimore Symphony with the pianists Misha Dichter and Jose Feghali, 32 chamber concerts, jazz performances, theater, art shows, and, on June 8, a gala celebration of the festival's anniversary and Mr. Menotti's birthday, which will incorporate music, dance and theater performances. More information and a brochure describing ticket subscriptions ranging from $20 to $260 are available from Spoleto Festival (Post Office Box 704, Charleston, S.C. 29402; 803-722-2764).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FOR SOME APPLICANTS, STUDENT ESSAY UNLOCKS OR SEALS THE DOOR TO COLLEGE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/13/nyregion/for-some-applicants-student-essay-unlocks-or-seals-the-door-to-college.html,"The college admission essay, Harry Bauld cautioned seniors at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, can be the ''ultimate noose with which a 17-year-old can hang himself.'' Mr. Bauld read hundreds of essays-turned-nooses when he worked in the admissions offices of Brown and Columbia Universities. Now a writer living in Pepperell, Mass., he returns every year to Horace Mann, where he once taught English, to offer the students some strong and funny advice about the art of writing good essays. Aside from drooling on the admission officer's oxfords, he contends, the college interview is not going to make that much difference. ''The colleges can't hold 30 minutes of white-knuckled terror against a kid who has four solid years of achievement,'' he said. ''Besides, the interview staffs are too large and include a lot of student interviewers. You can't count on their impressions.'' But the essay, he said, is crucial for applicants in ''the gray area'' -which he defined as ''where you're in the ball park but not one whose academic numbers make you too easy to dismiss or too overwhelming to deny.'' ''What matters in a big application pool is that you come alive,'' he said. ''And you've got to come alive on paper. This is where the college can really find out whether a kid is imaginative or unresponsive. ''If your essay is No. 39 in a pile of 50, and it begins, 'Hello, I am a very unique person,' you're in trouble. It goes into the pile with the old potato chips.'' Mr. Bauld said he disliked that kind of autobiographical, achievement-touting essay because he felt it ''promotes the tone of a kid talking to an adult, a counterfeit quality that comes through right away.'' There are five other stereotypes that he urged seniors to avoid: * The ''my favorite things'' essay. Sample: ''These are the things that I am for: puppy dogs and sunshine and Mrs. Field's cookies. These are the things I am against: spinach, nuclear war and being grounded.'' Mr. Bauld said that ''in admissions parlance, this is known as a fluff ball.'' * The trip essay. Sample: ''I went to Israel this summer, and it was exciting because I had to adapt to different food, different customs and a different way of life.'' Mr. Bauld complained that ''everything is different except the essay.'' * The ''3-D'' essay. Sample: ''I feel I have the determination, discipline and diversity of interests to succeed at whatever I do.'' As Mr. Bauld saw it, ''Those 3 D's equal a fourth: dull.'' * The ''Miss America'' essay. ''A high school kid should steer away from the big issues,'' he advised. ''When they go on and on, like a beauty queen, about nuclear war or abortion, it just generates a lot of cliches and makes them sound like they're parroting their parents.'' * The ''jock'' essay. Sample: ''Through wrestling, I have learned control, goals and how to work with people.'' Mr. Bauld did not recommend any formula that showed how the student had accrued ''noble achievement A, noble quality B and high-sounding attribute C.'' Some Topics Are Dictated Of course, to a certain extent, the topics are dictated by the colleges. Cornell asks applicants to write about ''an intellectual, social, political or personal issue you feel is important.'' Wesleyan has two: ''Identify a person who has had a significant influence on you and describe that influence,'' And, ''Share with us what you believe other Wesleyan students would learn from you both inside and outside the classroom.'' Stanford also requires two: ''Given the authority to establish a holiday, what would you choose to commemorate?'' And, ''Suppose you had the opportunity to spend a day with anyone. With whom would it be and how would you spend your time?'' The fact that each college comes up with an individual question - forcing applicants to write as many as a dozen different essays - leaves high school counselors annoyed and seniors anguished. But the admissions deans resist the notion of a standardized essay, arguing that they want to test teen-age writing and thinking skills in their own ways. If the colleges use essay questions to filter out students, some students use the essay questions to filter out colleges. Gillian Salton, a senior at Horace Mann, said she was put off by the colleges that required ''big issue'' essays - ''No matter how much you like to pretend, 17-year-olds don't know that much about Nicaragua or apartheid,'' she said. She was attracted to schools, like Stanford, whose questions show a sense of humor. Student Talents Differ Some students, like Miss Salton and Peter Urkowitz, a senior at St. Ann's School in Brooklyn, look forward to writing the essay. Others, like David Lender, a senior at Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, dread it. ''Some people speak better,'' Mr. Lender said. ''Some write better. I speak better.'' He tried to put aside his insecurity about his prose by choosing a controversial topic for his ''serious issue'' essay, taking a stand against affirmative action. He also typed his essays, because this suggested ''you put more effort into it.'' Mr. Bauld told students that they can maneuver, no matter what the question, to add a light, original touch and minimize what he called ''the greatest teen-age crime: pomposity.'' He advised the students to ''get back to simple writing tenets.'' ''Write about what you know,'' he said. ''Write something only you could write. If the most burning issue in your life is that when you put five pairs of socks in the dryer, you come out with a body stocking and a knit hat, write about that - not nuclear power.'' Handling the 'Big Issue' If a college requires a ''big issue'' essay, he said, ''try to get a personal handle on the issue; nobody wants a history or current events paper.'' He gaves the students a reading list of essays that he thought would expose them to a variety of appealing first-person voices, including George Orwell's ''The Art of Donald McGill,'' E. B. White's ''Death of a Pig,'' Doris Lessing's ''My Father,'' John Updike's ''Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,'' G. K. Chesterton's ''On Running After One's Hat'' and Tom Wolfe's ''Thursday Kind of Love.'' Mr. Bauld recalled several essays that came into the Brown University admissions office that made strikingly positive impressions in answering the requirement: ''We hope to gain as complete a picture of you as possible. Use this opportunity to tell us anything you think we should know.'' One teen-ager, taking the requirement literally, sent in a picture of himself posed like a Greek statue, with fig leaf. Another began with the lead, ''I do most of my best thinking in the bathroom.'' One of the most popular essays sent to Brown was a humorous piece by a teen-ager who talked about how growing a beard had changed all his social interactions. Entertainment Can Count ''You've got to picture weary, jaded admissions officers lying catatonic on the couch at midnight, blinded by grade point averages,'' Mr. Bauld said. ''They are people who like to be entertained.'' Of course, different admissions officers will respond differently to such gambits, and applicants who try to be original should take care not to slide over the line into preciousness. Jean Fetter, the dean of undergraduate admissions at Stanford, said many students ''tried to be overly clever'' on the 1984 essay question that asked candidates to choose one adjective to describe themselves. Some used adjectives like ''concise'' and ''terse'' and then did not write an essay. One applicant picked ''reflective,'' wrote the essay back to front and attached a hand mirror. ''I happened to read it very late at night and found it somewhat frustrating,'' Mrs. Fetter said. ''That kind of ingenuity can strike different people in different ways.'' Karl Furstenberg, the dean of admissions at Wesleyan, agreed, and said: ''A lot of people fall into the trap of trying to use gimmicks. They're overly humorous in a way that's unnatural, or they try to say something outrageous to catch your attention.'' In summary, Mr. Bauld advised students to ''loosen up, but don't loosen up too much - don't try to be Rodney Dangerfield.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURT TO REVIEW CONNECTICUT'S OPEN-PRIMARY BAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/nyregion/court-to-review-connecticut-s-open-primary-ban.html,"The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether Connecticut had violated the Constitution in barring the state Republican Party from opening to all voters its primary elections for Congress and statewide offices. The case, which could have an important impact on the electoral process nationally, is an appeal by the state of a Federal appellate decision in August. That ruling struck down the Connecticut law as a violation of the Republican Party's First Amendment right to freedom of association. The appellate ruling cast doubt on the Constitutionality of similar ''closed primary'' laws in more than 35 other states, including New York and New Jersey, which also prohibit voters who have not affiliated themselves with a political party from voting in that party's primaries. If the Court upholds the appellate court's reasoning in the Connecticut case, it could give a potent legal weapon to political parties to strike down laws in states that block the party from choosing its candidates for public office in any manner it chooses. Primaries Opened to All Voters The Court also agreed today to review two other Federal appellate rulings on election law. One of them struck down Washington State's restrictions on access of minor parties to the general election ballot. The other held the Federal ban on corporate campaign spending could not constitutionally be enforced against a nonprofit anti-abortion group in Massachusetts. The cases will be heard next autumn. In the Connecticut case, the Republican Party, outnumbered by Democrats in the state, sought to broaden its appeal in 1984 by amending its rules to open to all voters, regardless of affiliation, its primary elections for Congress and for statewide offices, although not those for the state legislature. In a bitter partisan battle, Democrats blocked Republican efforts to amend the state's closed primary law to conform to the new Republican Party rule. In 1984, the General Assembly, controlled by Democrats, rejected a Republican proposal to amend the law. In 1985, after Republicans had won control of the legislature, Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat, vetoed an amendment that the legislature had approved. 'Right to Self-Determination' The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, struck down the law on the ground that Connecticut's interest in regulating primary elections must give way to ''a political party's right to self-determination.'' In his lengthy opinion for the Second Circuit, Judge Irving R. Kaufman said, ''Our political organizations must retain the freedom to invite into their ranks those citizens with whom they wish to associate.'' New York and 14 other states, supporting Connecticut's Supreme Court appeal, argued that the Second Circuit ruling ''calls in question virtually any attempt by a state to regulate the primary process,'' and ''will create chaos rather than order in elections.'' On the other hand, the Connecticut Republican Party, in opposing the appeal, said ''the State's claims in support of the statute amount to an attempt - for whatever reasons - to freeze the Republican Party in a status quo, minority position.'' (Tashjian v. Republican Party, No. 85-766.) Spending Limits in Elections In Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, No. 85-701, the Court agreed to hear an F.E.C. appeal of a Federal appellate decision striking down a statutory limit on corporate campaign spending. The F.E.C. had sued Massachusetts Citizens for Life Inc. for having violated the Federal law, which bars corporate spending on elections, when it spent $9,912 in 1978 to support identified ''pro-life'' candidates. The appeals court said the statute violated the First Amendment right of free speech as applied to nonprofit, ''ideological'' corporations. The F.E.C.'s appeal said the decision raised ''an unresolved question of significant national importance'' and could enable for-profit corporations to evade disclosure requirements by giving money to nonprofit corporations for use in campaigns. In Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, No. 85-656, the Court agreed to review the State of Washington's requirement that a political candidate receive 1 percent of the votes cast for the office he seeks in the primary election in order to appear on the general election ballot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONFEREES SEE PERIL IN GOALS OF GROUPS ON RELIGIOUS RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/nyregion/conferees-see-peril-in-goals-of-groups-on-religious-right.html,"The religious new right poses an increasing threat to women's rights and freedom of religion in the United States, speakers at a conference on the effects of religious fundamentalism said yesterday. ''They want to prescribe a fundamentalist clampdown, a religious clampdown on the diversity of religious freedom and on the human spirit,'' the feminist author Betty Friedan told the gathering attended by about 100 people at the offices of the American Jewish Congress on East 84th Street. In a call that was echoed by other speakers, she urged the creation of a coalition to support what she termed the traditional American values of religious freedom and cultural pluralism. The conference was sponsored by the American Jewish Congress and the Women's American Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, a volunteer group that supports vocational, technological and scientific education. The session brought together more than a dozen speakers involved with women's rights and religious freedom. The overall theme of the conference was articulated by Norman Redlich, dean of the New York University School of Law. Religion, he said, provides basic guidance not just on matters of the spirit, but also on social questions such as the role of women. He said recent Supreme Court decisions had blurred the separation of church and state and had raised the specter of increasing government support for a particular religion's view of morality. Various speakers said that calls for censorship of school books, advocacy of prayer in public schools and of public financial support for private religious schools, and violence and intimidation against abortion clinics were part of a common trend. The session did not include any representatives of the religious organizations being criticized. Stan Hastey, director of information services for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, said fundamentalist leaders such as the Rev. Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson were betraying what he said was traditional Baptist support for religious pluralism. Mr. Falwell recently announced the formation of a new group, called the Liberty Federation, to lobby for political causes. The conference organizers said in a statement that the announcement was both ''revealing and cause for deepened concern.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Politics; From Money Magic to Money Misery,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/us/politics-from-money-magic-to-money-misery.html,"Ronald Reagan's political success seems to have been something of a financial disaster for Richard A. Viguerie, the direct-mail tactician who raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the 1970's for causes and candidates of the political right and, as a result, became a force in American politics. According to court records, Mr. Viguerie's fund-raising company is being sued for several million dollars by creditors for falling into arrears, and the Viguerie Company is now offering for sale its headquarters in Falls Church, Va., across the Potomac from Washington. Mr. Viguerie sold his nationally circulated monthly magazine, Conservative Digest, last fall. Of Conservative Complacency Mr. Viguerie did not respond to several telephone inquiries concerning his financial status. But fund-raising specialists say his problems came in good part because Mr. Reagan's political success has led to complacency among many conservative donors on mailing lists that once performed magicically for such heroes of the right as Mr. Reagan, George C. Wallace and Jesse Helms. Successes like that did not continue, however, and expensive direct-mail campaigns conducted recently in behalf of conservative causes failed, leaving Mr. Viguerie heavily in debt. The experts also say Mr. Viguerie faces increasing competition for direct-mail donors from the regular Republican Party campaign apparatus, which uses mailing lists that overlap with his. 'Issues That Were Getting Old' According to Herbert E. Alexander, director of the Citizens Research Foundation, a campaign-funds study group at the University of Southern California, Mr. Viguerie's high-riding success of the 1970's became the victim not only of conservative camplacency, with President Reagan in place, but also of Mr. Viguerie's long-standing emphasis on issues rather than candidates. ''He was strong on issues that were getting old or seem more or less settled, like abortion and capital punishment, or the Panama Canal treaty when that was a current controversy,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''He also was getting a lot of competition for basically the same conservative money from the regular Republican Party, which has built up a tremendous mailing list of its own.'' Since his debut on the New Right as director of Young Americans for Freedom in the early 1960's, Mr. Viguerie, now 52 years old, has always been something of an unorthodox, exceptionally independent-minded conservative. He said he declined ''on principle,'' for example, to raise money for President Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, and then in 1975, when he was raising millions for the third-party Presidential candidacy of Governor Wallace of Alabama, he said it was his ''fervent hope'' that Mr. Wallace and Mr. Reagan would ''team up as the ticket of a new party'' in 1976. Last year, backed by conservative church groups, Mr. Viguerie's independence led him to mount an ''outsider's'' campaign for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia. It was a doomed diversion that some of his associates believe distracted him from his direct-mail business at a critical time. Officials at two of the Viguerie Company's mass-mailing clients, the National Conservative Political Action Committee and another conservative group promoting a return to the gold standard, Ruff-PAC, say they suffered large losses in separately disappointing Viguerie-run campaigns in 1984. Suing for 'Millions' High mailing costs and poor returns left them owing money rather than counting it and left Mr. Viguerie about $4 million in the hole, the groups say. Ruff-PAC, contending that thousands of pieces of its mailing ended up in a Chicago dump, is not only disputing Mr. Viguerie's bill but also suing him for ''millions,'' said Neil Blair, its executive director. And N.C.P.A.C. is negotiating with Mr. Viguerie over about $3 million he says it owes him. In addition, the company's office suppliers are suing for nonpayment of bills. The Viguerie Company's mounting difficulties were illustrated at a hearing Friday in a courtroom in Fairfax Circuit Court in suburban northern Virginia, where the company collected and refined mailing lists of some 5 million Americans in a computer-filled office building. Defending him against one of the rash of creditor lawsuits - this one for $18,214 in overdue charges by Western Union Electronic Mail Inc. - Mr. Viguerie's attorney obtained court approval of an agreement to settle the debt for $16,440, payable at about $457 a month over three years. Office Bills, Pizza Bills With the sale of the Viguerie Company's building, worth several million dollars, Mr. Viguerie could presumably retire the unpaid office bills. They range from $70,000 to $210,000. But they pale in comparison with the money demanded in the latest suit against him, filed last month by the First American Bank of Virginia. In June 1984, the bank says, it lent Mr. Viguerie money that, with interest, now comes to about $1.1 million to equip and open the ShowBiz Pizza Place, a nonpolitical eatery in Fairfax County. Payments on the loan ceased last November, according to the bank's lawyer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DROP IN COMPUTER STUDY SEEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/us/drop-in-computer-study-seen.html,"Fewer college freshmen are planning careers in computers or engineering now than a year ago, and the total who consider it very important to make a lot of money decreased for the first time in 15 years, according to a new study. While business remained the most popular major, students are slowly returning to careers in education as a small population increase creates a teacher shortage - a turnabout from a decade earlier when there were more teachers than jobs and few people were entering the field, the study found. The researchers also reported that while the majority of the freshmen still considered themselves middle-of-the-road politically, they had what it called liberal views on disarmament, military spending and other matters. The 164-page report made public today was compiled by the Cooperative Institutional Research Program. It was sponsored by the American Council on Education and the graduate school of education of the University of Californa at Los Angeles. One of the most surprising discoveries was the drop in interest in computers and engineering. Only 4.4 percent of the freshmen indicated they intended to pursue careers as computer programmers or analysts, down from 6.1 percent in 1984 and a high of 8.8 percent in 1982. In engineering, the drop was less severe, declining to 10 percent in 1985 from 10.4 percent the previous year and a peak of 12 percent in 1982. Freshman interest in the biological and physical sciences also waned slightly, while the humanities gained. Business remained the most popular major with 24.8 percent, up from 24 percent a year earlier. The survey found 6.2 percent planned on teaching careers, as against 5.5 percent in 1984 and an all-time low of 4.7 percent in 1982. The peak was 23.5 percent in 1968. The number of students indicating it was essential or very important to be financially well off declined slightly, to 70.9 percent, reversing 15 years of increases. In 1984, the percentage was 71.2 percent. But the new rate still remained far above the record low in 1970 of about 39 percent. Also, 28.6 percent favored more military spending, as against 32.5 percent a year earlier and 38.8 percent in 1982. Two-thirds feel the Government should do more to promote disarmament. In addition, 73.3 percent believed the wealthy should pay more taxes, up from 69.7 percent in 1984 and reversing a decline that began in 1976. Seventy-eight percent felt the Government was not doing enough to control pollution, up slightly from previous years, and 54.9 percent supported legal abortion, an increase of 1 percent from the previous year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What Due Process Meant to Potter Stewart,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/opinion/l-what-due-process-meant-to-potter-stewart-051886.html,"To the Editor: In your front-page obituary of Associate Justice Potter Stewart of the United States Supreme Court (Dec. 8), you define substantive due process as ''a lawyer's term for judges' substituting their personal values for those of the legislature.'' You seem to suggest by this that Justice Stewart supported judicial activism of this type. Where did this definition come from? It's not one that Justice Stewart would have accepted, nor would anyone else but the most cynical, conservative of lawyers. The suggestion that substantive due process involves usurping the legislature's function in favor of personal values - those are fighting words in most law schools, and should not be passed off as an uncontroversial definition. In fact, substantive due process is a lawyer's term for the idea that judges are empowered to articulate fundamental values not explicitly protected by the Constitution, which the Government may not impinge without meeting a high standard of justification. (I paraphrase here the standard constitutional law text by Prof. Gerald Gunther of Stanford Law School, page 502.) Fundamental values do not necessarily have anything to do with a judge's personal values. Nor does the activity of articulating those values necessarily have anything to do with the legislature. In his concurrence in Roe v. Wade, Justice Stewart criticized the Texas abortion statute at issue. But his reason was that it infringed on a long line of Supreme Court cases that clarified that ''freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.'' To suggest that Justice Stewart's concurrence was based on a capricious desire to enshrine his own values in the law of the land does this careful, competent Justice a great disservice. MARTHA F.

He proclaimed Sunday as National Sanctity of Human Life Day, and he noted that on Jan. 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that guaranteed women access to abortion. On that day, the President said, the Supreme Court ''struck down our laws protecting the lives of unborn children.'' ''Each year,'' he said, ''remarkable advances in prenatal medicine bring ever more dramatic confirmation of what common sense told us all along -that the child in the womb is simply what each of us once was: a very young, very small, dependent, vulnerable member of the human family.''

SHOULD FARMERS GO COLD TURKEY?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/weekinreview/should-farmers-go-cold-turkey.html,"Perhaps the most important event in the postwar drive to modernize the raising of farm animals, most authorities now agree, was the discovery in 1949 that antibiotic drugs cause chicks to gain weight quickly. The finding forever changed how farmers produce beef, pork, poultry and eggs. The drugs, mixed into feed, not only cause farm animals to grow to record weights in record time, but also protect them against deadly bacterial diseases. Antibiotics were the first of what has turned out to be a flood of new drugs and food supplements that have kept animals healthy and hungry, helping American farmers achieve extraordindary gains in production efficiency. In recent years, however, scientists, consumer groups, members of Congress and their staffs have begun raising questions about the use of animal drugs and feed supplements, and whether residues of these substances left in food are a threat to human health. A new sense of urgency was added to the safety debate last week by a Congressional study that severely criticized the Federal Food and Drug Administration's ability to oversee the $2 billion-a-year animal drug industry. The study charged that the agency had failed to remove from the market more than a dozen widely used animal drugs its own scientists have said cause cancer and other illnesses. Residues of these and many other potentially dangerous substances, the report said, have been identified in meat, poultry, milk and eggs. The report, prepared by the House Government Operations subcommittee on intergovernmental relations and human resources, also detailed instances in which dangerous drugs are routinely fed to farm animals, even though the chemicals have never been approved by the agency for use in the United States. In other cases, the report said, farmers are using harmful drugs illegally - for instance, administering to beef cattle powerful drugs approved only for poultry. The report said the agency seemed unwilling to do anything about the problem, though it poses a grave risk to consumers. ''The F.D.A., for too long, has been placing the concerns of livestock producers ahead of concerns for health,'' said Representative Ted Weiss, the subcommittee chairman and a Democrat of Manhattan. ''Under the agency's own statutes, this is flagrantly illegal behavior.'' F.D.A. officials, while agreeing with many of the findings, fired back a few salvos of their own. ''The report says we don't care about consumers. That's just real hard for me to swallow,'' said Dr. Gerald Guest, acting director of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine. ''This is a sweeping indictment. But it's full of gross statements that just aren't accurate.'' The use of drugs and feed supplements for livestock and poultry is widespread. From birth to death, farm animals are vaccinated, inoculated, fed and implanted with an astonishing array of substances, many of them extremely toxic. Pigs, for example, are fed antibiotics in combination with sulfa drugs to help them gain weight and prevent pneumonia-like infections. They are routinely treated with arsenic compounds for intestinal infections and other powerful drugs to cure parasitic diseases. 'Withdrawal' Periods Cattle and sheep are regularly given natural estrogen, a female hormone, to promote growth. And farmers use synthetic sex hormones to bring entire herds into heat at the same time and to induce spontaneous abortions. ''When these drugs are used properly, they will not leave unsafe residues,'' said Maryln Cordle, acting director of the residue division in the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. ''The concern is when farmers don't use these drugs according to label directions.'' Her department spends $362 million each year to inspect meat and poultry and test for 110 drugs in roughly 40,000 food samples. And the F.D.A. has ''withdrawal'' periods for most drugs, requiring farmers to remove an animal from the drug for a specified length of time before slaughter. But the Congressional study said between 20,000 and 30,000 drugs and feed supplements are in use, and many producers do not abide by the withdrawal-period rules. Livestock producers insist that the drugs are vital. A sick animal represents a substantial loss, they say, in an industry that survives on narrow profit margins. ''We'd go broke without these products,'' said Dr. Wes Bonner, a veterinarian and general manager of Veribest Cattle Feeders Inc., in Veribest, Tex. ''I think nothing would tickle cattlemen more than if we could throw all these products out the window. But there's no way it's going to happen unless the poultry industry does it, too.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LONG ISLAND JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/nyregion/long-island-journal-429686.html,"THE LAW AND THE MALL THE recent New York State court ruling regarding leafletting at the Smith Haven Mall brought national media attention to the Lake Grove shopping center, according to its vice president and general manager, Abe Zitren. ''We had TV out here and everything,'' he said. But, he added, there's been no reaction from the Long Island public, those most affected by the decision. Last month, the State Court of Appeals ruled that the New York Constitution permits privately owned shopping centers to ban the distribution of handbills, pamphlets and other types of politically oriented literature on their premises. The decision overturned a 1982 state court ruling that required the Smith Haven Mall to designate areas for groups to hand out their materials. ''I let everyone in after the 1982 ruling,'' Mr. Zitren said, ''the Hare Krishnas were here, all sorts of groups.'' He would have accepted politicians, too, he said, but none asked. Now he will not automatically bar everyone, but look at requests on a case-by-case basis. ''It depends on the group,'' he said. The general manager of the Sunrise Mall in Massapequa, Nicholas Peragine, also said he would not immediately ban all leafletting. ''We'll use our discretion,'' he added. Long Island's largest shopping center, Roosevelt Field in Garden City, has been doing just that for years, according to Alice Rosen, the director of marketing. Roosevelt Field, Mrs. Rosen said, is one of the few malls on Long Island that have a ''community booth'' for groups interested in reaching the public. The booth was set up about five years ago, she said. It may be rented by any Long Island group for up to three days at a time, at $25 a day, but the group must have a million dollars' worth of insurance. The League of Women Voters, animal protection groups and the Vietnam Veterans of America are just a few of the organizations that have rented it, she added. The recent court ruling, Mrs. Rosen said, will not effect the community booth nor the mall's policy regulating it. ''No group can use it more than once every six months,'' she said, ''which allows all to get a chance.'' 9 ROOMS, WILL TRAVEL THEY'RE giving away a house in Amityville. ''It's a real classic,'' said Charles V. Powell of Amityville's American Legion post. ''It's a very attractive house. It has a lot of character.'' The post, according to Mr. Powell, bought the 65-year-old, 9-room, 2 1/2-story colonial 7 years ago, but it remained vacant. Since the post still has no need for the structure, it is willing to give it away ''free and clear,'' Mr. Powell said. The house can be yours for the taking - literally - because it doesn't come with any land. The property it currently sits on will be used for a parking lot for the new American Legion building now under construction. So if you want the house, you've got to take it, and the moving could be a bit tricky. The house is in the incorporated Village of Amityville, ''but it's north of the railroad trestle,'' Mr. Powell said. ''A few people were interested in it, but they wanted to move it south. The house-movers said they'd have to chop off the top to get it under the railroad trestle, and the movers weren't going to put the top back on'' if they did get it under the Route 110 bridge. One interested party, Mr. Powell said, was given an estimate of $20,000 by the Long Island Lighting Company to disconnect lines so the house could be moved. It would cost the post $3,000 to demolish the house, Mr. Powell said. So if it can be given away, they'll save money and someone will get a free house. Anyone interested in the building can call Mr. Powell at 795-4218. So far, Legion officials have advertised the free house in local papers in Amityville and Massapequa. ''I'm amazed at some of the responses we've gotten,'' Mr. Powell said. ''One person called and wanted to know if the house was haunted. He thought it was the 'Amityville Horror' house. It's not.'' SEX AND THE STUDENT THE figures are in on which sex-education course at Lindenhurst High School is the most popular - and given the controversy over the courses in recent months, the results might surprise some people. Sex education has been the subject of debate in the community for more than three years. For this school year, a compromise was struck with community members who didn't want certain subjects taught, like contraception and abortion. But, it would seem, it is those subjects that the majority of students want to learn about. With parents' consent, juniors can choose between two sex education courses. One is ''Family Life,'' which discusses contraceptives and other sex-related subjects. The other is ''Sexuality, Commitment and the Family,'' which stresses abstaining from sex rather than other methods of birth control. A third option is also available, a course that teaches the life cycle from birth to old age but with no discussion of sex at all. The three-week courses are part of the school health program. The first semester ended a few weeks ago and students signed up for the spring semester last week. According to Lee McLaughlin, the director of physical education and health courses at the school, of the 331 students who took one of the three courses last semester, 75 percent chose the more liberal course, 18 percent took the more conservative course and 7 percent took the third choice. Mr. McLaughlin added, however, that students who did not choose one of the courses, or did not get permission from a parent to take sex education, were placed in the life-cycle course. ''It's not as if 7 percent chose not to take sex education,'' he said. This semester, estimates are that 60 percent will take the more liberal course, 35 percent will take the conservative course and 5 percent have not chosen either. ''The whole subject is very sensitive,'' Mr. McLaughlin said, ''but the three choices certainly add a new dimension to the program.'' TO TASTE OR NOT TO TASTE FEWER popping corks will be heard in Long Island schoolrooms this year. Registration for adult education courses in area school districts starts this week, and residents of Huntington and Seaford will be able to sign up for wine-tasting courses. Great Neck residents, however, will not. According to Robert D. Sholiton, Great Neck's director of adult education, it was decided that holding wine-tasting courses in public school buildings presented potential legal problems and sent the wrong signals to students. This will be the first session in 10 years that wine courses will not be offered in the North Shore community. ''I always thought of Great Neck as avant garde,'' said Seaford's adult education director, Paul V. Pepe. ''But now, personally, I think they're overreacting. Nobody's ever walked out of one of our courses tipsy.'' Mr. Pepe said Seaford has been offering wine-tasting courses to adults for more than 12 years, first in the public library and for the last five years in a former elementary school building. ''It's not just a party,'' he said. ''It's educational and instructive.'' Huntington's adult education director, Roberta Polinger, agreed. ''I'm not concerned,'' she said. ''They don't drink that much - it probably equals one glass of wine an evening.'' Huntington is offering a 10-week course on Long Island wines. Class members bring their own glasses, Mrs. Polinger said, and for $60 they will taste some of the Island's finest products. Mrs. Polinger and Mr. Pepe will probably sample a little of the grape, too, they acknowledged. As directors of the adult education programs they observe the various courses, and the wine-tasting courses are ones they especially like. ''Wine tasting, Chinese cooking and belly dancing,'' Mr. Pepe said. ''Those are my favorite courses to observe.'' ON THE MEDIA FRONT SOME news last week for Long Island media watchers: WCBS-TV, Channel 2, named a new Long Island news correspondent. Josh Mankiewicz, a former ABC-TV correspondent, will begin covering the Island in the middle of February, according to a station official. And also last week, WSNL-TV, Channel 67, ended all local production. Joan May of Glen Cove, who was the news director for the Central Islip station, said all local programming - a daily half-hour news show and a daily half-hour public affairs program - ended as of Friday. The station will be be broadcasting only music-video programs originating from a sister station in New Jersey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMOCRATS' HOPES UP IN CAROLINA SENATE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/us/democrats-hopes-up-in-carolina-senate-race.html,"The Democratic Party's chances of winning a United States Senate seat in North Carolina has taken on a new dimension with former Gov. Terry Sanford formally beccoming a candidate. Mr. Sanford, 68 years old, recently retired after 15 years as president of Duke University. He was immediately regarded by political specialists as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in a field of four candidates, none of whom has a statewide political base. The state primary will be May 6. The seat is now held by Senator John P. East, a Republican, who is suffering from a thyroid disorder and is not seeking a second term. James T. Broyhill, a 22-year member of the House of Representatives, and David B. Funderburk, former Ambassador to Rumania, who is backed by the political organization of Senator Jesse Helms, are competing for the Republican nomination. Mr. Funderburk's campaign has already begun sponsoring television commercials charging that Mr. Broyhill voted to support positions favoring abortion rights and the Democratic budget proposal in the House. Mr. Broyhill has argued that his record shows him to be a genuine conservative, and he has picked up the backing of the old-line regulars in the state Republican Party. With the incumbent not seeking re-election and with the prospect of a divisive Republican primary, the national Democratic Party initially made North Carolina a target in its effort to recapture control of the Senate. And yet, for the five months before Mr. Sanford announced his move this week, the state Democratic leadership looked in vain for a major figure to run for Mr. East's seat. Former Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., who lost a bruising race to Mr. Helms in 1984, decided not to run. So did Representative Charles G. Rose 3d; Wade Smith, a former state party chairman, and William C. Friday, president of the University of North Carolina. Search for Fresh Face In September, Mr. Sanford announced his intention to run, but he withdrew after a few days. At that time party leaders were looking for a fresh candidate and did not rally to him. Mr. Sanford was Governor from 1961 to 1965 and has not held elected office since then. In 1972 and in 1976 he sought the Democratic Presidential nomination. In 1972, he was defeated in North Carolina's primary by Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama. Several candidates had entered the Democratic race for the Senate nomination but had not attracted broad support from the party activists. Those who have filed and remain in the race are T. L. Odom, a Mecklenburg County Commissioner; William I. Belk, a Charlotte department store executive who is former president of Young Democrats of America; Betty C. Wallace of Raleigh, a state education official, and Katherine H. Harper, president of Harper Companies International of Charlotte. Two days after Mr. Sanford filed his candidacy, Marvin K. Blount Jr. of Greenville, a former state judge who had begun television commercials for his Senate candidacy, dropped out and endorsed Mr. Sanford. D. M. Faircloth, a former State Commerce Secretary, was also preparing to enter but stepped aside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO ASSERTS HE IS VICTIM OF ETHNIC BIAS BY COLUMNISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/nyregion/cuomo-asserts-he-is-victim-of-ethnic-bias-by-columnists.html,"Governor Cu''increasing references to my ethnicity,'' declared today, ''If anything could make me change my mind about running for the Presidency, it's people talking about, 'An Italian can't do it, a Catholic can't do it.' '' Mr. Cuomo said he was referring to natilysts who he said were contending that ''there's no way Cuomo can win - Italians from the Northeast can't win.'' The only people he named were the columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. The Governor, who has consistently denied being a candidate for the Presidency and licly hinted that he might be, said in an interview that he had ''a powerful feeling'' about the issue of ethnic bias, which he called ''a very important subject that I will discuss over and over and over.'' 'I Am Going to Speak Out' ''I don't mind the Republicans licking their chops and saying, 'That's just what we want him to do, because people won't vote for Italians,' '' the Governor said, evidently referring to a possible campaign for the Presidency. ''Even though reporters will take out of context some of the things I'm saying, even with that absurdity, I am going to speak out.'' Last month, after Mr. Cuomo asked reporters not to use the word ''Mafia'' to describe organized crime because he said it was a slight against Italian-Americans, national Democratic leaders were reported to have urged him not to emphasize his ethnicity. Asked about that, Mr. Cuomo said, ''I think a popular political opinion is, 'Mario, when you underscore the Italian part of your package and allow discussion of 'Mafia,' that produces no pluses.' ''They say the Mafia subject is an unpleasant one and that any association with an unpleasant subject is bad for you,'' the Governor added. ''Well, that's what they said about abortion, about tax deductibility. When you have a powerful instinct, you go with it. I had a powerful instinct about tax reform, about abortion, and I have a powerful instinct about this.'' The Governor has been a leader in the fight against the Reagan Administration's efforts to end the deductibility of state and local taxes from Federal income taxes. And he has challenged leaders of the Roman Catholic Church who have suggested that Roman Catholics in public office have an obligation to apply the church's teachings in carrying out public policy. Over the years, Mr. Cuomo, who was born to immigrant parents in a blue-collar neighborhood in Queens, has mentioned from time to time discrimination against Italian-Americans that he said had kept him out of the best schools and the best law firms. But in the last month or so, he has talked more and more about bias. ''As I have gotten older,'' Mr. Cuomo, who is 53 years old, said last month, ''this has become more significant to me.'' Major Address Planned The Governor's comments today came only hours before he left for San Antonio, where he was to give a speech tonight at a national Democratic gathering. His aides said he was planning to make a major address soon on the issue of discrimination against not only Italian-Americans but also against blacks and other ethnic groups. ''This goes way beyond Italians - it affects blacks, Jews,'' Mr. Cuomo said, although for the most part he concentrated on Italian-Americans. Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son and one of his top political advisers, said Mr. Cuomo was concerned about an array of factors that seemed to rule out certain people for the Presidency, such as geography or ethnicity or religion. ''When Governor Cuomo's name is mentioned for the Presidency,'' Andrew Cuomo said, ''very often one of the first issues is his ethnicity. Don't you hear it? Someone says, 'Cuomo for President.' Then someone else says, 'Can an Italian from the Northeast be elected President?' '' ''Well, is that how it's decided?'' he said. ''Shouldn't the questions be about intelligence and ability, not ethnicity?'' In the interview today, he specifically referred to a Jan. 8 column by the syndicated writers Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. In the column, they referred to Mr. Cuomo's ''ethnic difficulty.'' And one paragraph read: ''Cuomo's political problem is described by a liberal member of the Democratic National Committee from the Deep South: 'Between Richmond and Houston, there are no Cuomos and damn few Marios.' '' There was no answer at Mr. Evans's office in Washington, at his home there or at his country house. The Washington Post, which syndicates the column, said Mr. Novak was traveling in the Middle East and that a telephone number was not available for him there. The Governor also mentioned today a sign held by a protester yesterday who was opposed to his granting of clemency to Gary McGivern, who was convicted of killing a deputy sheriff. ''Kill a Cop, Get Paroled by the Wop,'' the sign said. Discussing the Mafia ''I am not being hypersensitive to this - it's there,'' Mr. Cuomo said about his overall impressions. And of the national political writers specifically, he said: ''I do notice an increasing interest in my ethnicity. And one has to wonder about that.'' The Governor drew wide publicity last month after he criticized news organizations for using the word ''Mafia'' to describe organized crime. The thrust of his comments - in an emotional 45-minute discussion with reporters in his office - was that there was a Mafia, but that it was only one faction of organized crime. But twice during the conversation, he seemed to imply that there was no Mafia at all. At one point, he said, ''You're telling me that Mafia is an organization, and I'm telling you that's a lot of baloney.'' At another point, asked what the Mafia was, the Governor said, ''It's nothing - it's a word that somebody made up.'' Since then, Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly tried to clarify his remarks, and today he repeated again, ''Of course there is a Mafia.'' He said he was simply trying to convey the notion that ''every time you use the word 'Mafia,' you suggest to people that all organized crime is Italian - it's an ugly stereotype.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CATHOLICS OPEN STATE DRIVE AGAINST MEDICAID ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/20/nyregion/catholics-open-state-drive-against-medicaid-abortion.html,"The Roman Catholic bishops of all eight dioceses in New York State asked their congregations yesterday to take and sign postcards urging Governor Cuomo to end Medicaid financing of abortions. ''It is time to stop the shedding of innocent blood in our society,'' John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, said at the 10 A.M. mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral. ''We must fill out cards asking legislators to put an end to the slaughter of humans. Civilized people cannot stand by and tolerate such injustice.'' The cards, circulated to parishioners at mass, were timed to coincide with the anniversary on Wednesday of the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision that upheld women's right to abortions. Tax Issue Raised The postcards say: ''Please do not force me to pay state and local taxes for Medicaid abortions in your '86-'87 state budget. I will hold all elected officials accountable who do not support my conscientious objections.'' Parishioners were asked to sign the cards and return them to parish officials for mailing in bulk to the Governor. Cardinal O'Connor drew a contrast between the nationwide celebration today of the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., which he praised, and the anniversary Wednesday of the Supreme Court ruling, which he called ''a day of shame.'' The Cardinal said 17 million abortions had been performed in the 13 years since the ruling. He said that while the Federal Government paid for 293 abortions in 1984, and then only if they were ''medically necessary,'' New York State paid for 45,000 abortions on demand at a cost to the taxpayers of $16 million. 'Boggles the Mind' ''The destruction of human lives on such a massive scale boggles the mind,'' the Cardinal said. New York is one of 14 states still allowing the use of Medicaid funds to subsidize abortions after the Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that the Federal and state governments were not obligated to pay for them, according to the Archdiocese of New York. Only eight states, including New York, finance them willingly; the rest are under court order to do so while lawsuits are pending, according to a spokesman for the New York State Right to Life Committee, Barbara Meara. Mr. Cuomo has long held that since abortions are legal in the United States, it would be discriminatory to deny the procedure to people who are too poor to pay for them. Abortions are among health-care services reimbursable under Medicaid, the Federal-state health insurance program for the poor, said a spokesman for the Governor, Thomas Conroy. 'No Problems' With Cards In response to the petition drive, another spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Kathleen Meehan, said that while the Governor had not yet seen the cards, he ''welcomes the free expression of ideas - he has no problems with the sending of the cards.'' The Roman Catholic Church in New York has distributed petition cards in the past for mailing to local representatives, but this is the first time a concerted petition effort has been directed at the Governor, according to Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese. Many congregation members who received cards said they hoped that legislators would be swayed by the political pressure. There are 6.6 million Roman Catholics in New York State. While many Catholics interviewed supported the church's position, some said they did not believe such a view should be imposed on everyone. At the Church of the Epiphany on 22d Street and Second Avenue, one woman said the bishops should seek to limit the financing of abortions to those during the first three months of pregnancy, rather than a complete ban. Under Medicaid, abortions are allowed until the 24th week of pregnancy. ''When you get to three and a half months,'' the parishioner said, ''you feel something inside you living and kicking - you have life. But if you go back further than that, I don't know.'' Groups supporting abortion rights assailed the postcard drive. ''If we believe in women's freedom, we have to believe that women have the right to make their own moral choices,'' said Ruth Imbesis, acting coordinator of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights in New York City, an advocacy group of 31 denominations, including New York State Catholics for a Free Choice. ''There are no references in the Bible that say abortion is a bad thing,'' she said. ''I am appalled at people in positions like the Cardinal who choose to make it that kind of an issue.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLUES TO BEHAVIOR SOUGHT IN HISTORY OF FAMILIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/science/clues-to-behavior-sought-in-history-of-families.html,"IN their search for the causes of human behavior, some psychologists find themselves drawn ever deeper into the past, beyond the history of any individual and toward that of the whole family. They discern across many generations of families the development of a kind of subculture, complete with myths, expectations and foibles, that can explain some of the more baffling aspects of life. In this pursuit they are attempting to codify themes familiar in Greek tragedy as well as in modern literature. One of the new tools in this effort is called the genogram, in which the interplay of generations within a family is carefully graphed so that repetitive patterns of behavior can be clearly identified. Because the rapidly growing popularity of genograms had led to a lack of agreement on what symbols to use, a task force of therapists and physicians recently proposed standard guidelines for constructing these psychological family trees. ''You're the product of millions and millions of human generations, and you've got to understand what goes on in a family in that grand perspective; you understand too little about a person if you look just at his inner life or immediate family,'' said Murray Bowen, a psychiatrist who is generally credited with originating the multigenerational approach to therapy. While family therapists were the first to use this generational framework for treating psychological problems, the orientation is spreading to those in other disciplines, such as history and family medicine. The psychological legacy of past generations is of course not a binding influence on the descendants. It seems to diminish as time goes on, and those in later generations come under the sway of many other psychological influences. And the patterns of previous generations matter little to those who have little awareness of or no contact with their forebears. Also, the patterns that are revealed are by no means always negative. In Alexander Graham Bell's family tree, for example, there is a three-generation preoccupation with problems in speaking and hearing, which presaged his invention of the telephone. Bell's paternal grandfather was an actor and elocutionist who wrote a classic book on phonetics and invented a cure for stammering; his father and uncle devoted themselves to teaching their father's technique. Bell's mother and his own wife were both deaf, and Bell himself taught the deaf, studying in great detail the mechanics of speech. It was his father's suggestion to Alexander that he develop a talking machine that set him on the path that led, eventually, to the telephone. The notion that the traumas and triumphs of one generation can reverberate through successive ones is, of course, as ancient as the biblical warning that ''the sins of the fathers will be visited upon the children'' for seven generations. As a plot twist it was familiar in Greek tragedy -''Oedipus Rex,'' for example - and in Shakespeare's family epics, including ''King Lear'' and ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Modern novelists from Faulkner on have chronicled the intertwined fates of families over generations, as soap operas like ''Dallas'' do. The Adams Family ''Looking at multple generations helps you see how deep the problem is,'' said Edward Friedman, a family therapist who has written extensively on the topic. ''When you have a deep problem in a family, one that gets passed on over generations, it is more effectively handled if you take more than one generation into account.'' Among those outside the field of therapy who have turned to the approach is David F. Musto of Yale, a psychiatrist and historian who is studying the papers of four generations of the eminent Adams family. The Adamses produced not only two American presidents but also several ambassadors and literary figures. In Dr. Musto's view, the Adams family passed on a destructive family myth about its own place in history, a myth that contributed to serious psychological difficulties, including a suicide, over successive generations. The myth was created and propogated by Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams, the second American president. According to Dr. Musto, during the Revolutionary War Abigail Adams was left to suffer loneliness and hardships in Massachusetts during the years her husband rose to fame in Philadelphia and Europe. ''She justified her sacrifice by glorifying her husband and the cause for which he fought,'' seeing him as the key figure in American independence, Dr. Musto writes in an article in ''New Directions in Psychohistory.'' From that point on she had grand ambitions for her children, particularly John Quincy Adams, who she felt was destined to be ''a hero and statesman.'' Impossible Expectations While that expectation proved true long before John Quincy Adams became the sixth American president, in Dr. Musto's view the family myth also contained extremely idealistic and unrealistic standards which were to prove a burden to later generations of Adamses. According to the family self-image, an Adams was to be morally superior and find blazing success while remaining aloof from the shabby reality of business and politics. This myth, Dr. Musto argues, created an impossible situation for the Adamses in later generations. While some of the Adams family in later generations actually did rise to eminence - John Quincy Adams's son Charles Francis Adams was America's ambassador to Britain in the Civil War, and came close to a Presidential nomination - others were decided failures. Another of John Quincy's sons, George Washington Adams, a heavy drinker, was said to be so disheartened by his failure to uphold the family standards of success that he committed suicide at 28. It was not until the third generation after Abigail, Dr. Musto claims, that the Adams family gave up her inflated vision of the family's destiny as the leaders of the American Republic. Writing in a recent issue of The American Scholar, Peter Shaw notes two contrasting types over several generations in the Adams family. On one hand, he says, there were self-deniers who never deviated from their sense of duty. On the other were self-indulgers who seemed bent on disappointing family expectations. Tracking Legacies by Genograms The ''genogram'' was developed by family therapists to track such legacies systematically, using sets of of symbols on a family tree to show psychologically significant events: Abortions and stillbirths, separations and divorces and extramarital affairs, for example. In addition, the genogram allows the noting of psychological alliances or distance between family members, as well as unusually close or estranged relationships. The net result is a family tree that reveals not just the usual relationships, but also, more significantly, the emotional turbulence that is inevitable in a family. Moreover, it shows this turbulence not just in the present, but also as it has survived over generations. For example, a genogram of the family of Eugene O'Neill shows a pattern of estrangement between father and chldren over three generations, according to Monica McGoldrick, a clinical social worker in the Department of Psychiatry at Rutgers, who headed a task force that developed standard guideline for genograms. ''Both Eugene and his oldest brother Jamie felt estranged from their father, and all of them blamed each other for the mother's drug addiction,'' according to Professor McGoldrick. ''In the next generation, the playwright was totally estranged from his oldest son and had nothing to do with his daughter, Oona, after she married Charlie Chaplin.'' ''Biographers should find the technique useful,'' Professor McGoldrick said, ''because it offers a systematic way to analyze the psychological influences of past generations on a person.'' Insights Into Hidden Patterns The approach reveals not just tendencies toward problems in a family, Professor McGoldrick says, but also offers insights into hidden patterns that influence choices people make in life such as that of career. For example, she says, students of Carl Jung and his theories would do well to take his family background into account in understanding the sources of his ideas. Jung was from a family in which, for three generations before him, virtually all the males had been either physicians or ministers. Many members, including his mother, also had strong beliefs in the supernatural. A cousin was a medium, and Jung attended her seances in his youth. ''Jung's becoming a physician with a profound interest in the supernatural and religion fit right into the predominant patterns in his family,'' Professor McGoldrick said. Such cross-generational influences on identity are more common than most people realize, Professor McGoldrick said. ''If you look back in your family, you are often able to find a psychological twin or near-twin. For example, a patient of mine thought of herself as a total oddity in her family, because she is gay and has a wry sense of humor in a family that is otherwise straightlaced and tightlipped. But she recently found out about a grand-aunt who was rarely mentioned by the family. The grand-aunt had the same sort of sense of humor, and lived all her adult life with another woman, with whom she 'shared a bed,' as her family put it.'' ''Since family patterns can be transmitted from one generation to the next, recognizing such patterns can often help families avoid repeating unfortunate patterns or transmitting them into future generations,'' Professor McGoldrick said. The guidelines for using genograms to plot family trees are outlined in ''Genograms in Family Assessment'' (Norton), which Professor McGoldrick wrote with Randy Gerson. Generations Involved in Therapy ''The generational approach offers perhaps the most highly developed theory in family therapy, a field stronger on technique and practical problem-solving than on theory,'' said Richard Simon, a family therapist in Washington, D.C., and editor of the Family Therapy Networker, the major trade journal in the field. There are several family therapists who have proposed theories about the psychological dynamics at work in families over generations. Apart from the efforts of Murray Bowen and his students, the major work of this kind has been done by Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, a psychiatrist at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute in Philadelphia, and his colleagues. Family therapists who take this approach often hold therapy sessions at which are present not just the person with a psychological problem, but also his parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and sometimes even cousins. Dr. Boszormenyi-Nagy, for example, writing in ''Invisible Loyalties'' (Harper & Row), describes treating a family in which both parents physically abused their 4-year-old daughter. The sessions included the child, the parents and both sets of grandparents. The problem was finally resolved when the parents of the child were each able to talk to their own parents about feeling neglected in their own childhoods, resentments they had harbored in silence for years. Some families seem to be far more marked by generational patterns than are others, the theorists say. In such families, for example, there may typically be a continuing pattern of women martyred by husbands who have mistresses, or generation after generation in which there is incest or physical abuse. But in almost all families, the theorists say, there are more subtle ways in which one generation leaves its psychological mark on successive ones. In almost every family, for example, each generation has a psychological loyalty to the past one, a sense that the child has a set of commitments to his parents to transmit their values and outlook to his children. That transmission, according to Dr. Boszormenyi-Nagy, repays a psychological debt to earlier generations. It is in this sense that ''every marriage is actually two families that are trying to reproduce themselves - his and hers,'' said Carl Whitaker, a family therapist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN EXHORTS FOES OF ABORTION AT CAPITAL RALLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/us/reagan-exhorts-foes-of-abortion-at-capital-rally.html,"President Reagan told thousands of opponents of abortion today that he was proud to join them in ''the long march for the right to life'' as they rallied here on the 13th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortions. ''We will continue to work together with members of Congress to overturn the tragedy of Roe v. Wade,'' the President said, referring to that Court decision. ''Every child about to be born is a unique, unrepeatable gift,'' he added, speaking from the White House to the protesters by a telephone and loudspeaker hookup. ''Every child who escapes the tragedy of abortion is an immeasurable victory.'' The President's words brought cheers from the crowd that gathered on the Ellipse behind the White House before marching up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Supreme Court and the Capitol, where they dispersed to lobby members of Congress. The police estimated the crowd at 36,000 people, about half last year's estimate. A police spokesman said there were 10 arrests for demonstrating at the Supreme Court and 31 stemming from abortion protests at two health facilities in Washington earlier in the day. From early morning the ranks of foes of abortion swelled as buses poured into this city from around the country for the 13th annual ''March for Life.'' This was the second consecutive year that the President has addressed the rally. 'We Have Been on a Roll' Throughout the day, leaders of the movement against abortion said they were confident that the tide was turning their way in American politics. In a news conference before the march, Dr. John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said, ''We believe in this past year, we have been on a roll.'' Advocates of legalized abortion countered with equal conviction that the mainstream of public opinion supported their position and only needed to be mobilized. ''We're beginning to organize the majority in, we hope, bigger and bigger numbers,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, which plans a march in Washington this spring in support of legalized abortion and contraception. A spokesman said NOW received increased reports of picketing and harassment today at clinics offering abortion services. After his speech to the rally, the President met with about 25 leaders of the movement against abortion. Paul Brown of the American Life League, one of the leaders at the meeting, said he had raised the issue of ''pro-life people'' in jail for violence or demonstrations against abortion clinics. Mr. Brown said that while he opposed violence and was not ''in any way justifying their actions,'' some of those people serving long sentences ''were very young, naive, well-meaning kids.'' He said he asked the President if he would some day consider a pardon in some cases, and said Mr. Reagan had indicated he ''might someday review them on a case-by-case basis.'' ''I did not hear him say that,'' said Albert R. Brashear, a spokesman for the White House who was in the meeting. Mr. Brashear said the President had been told about a specific case, and replied, ''Well, I may get a review on this.'' Dr. Willke, who was at the meeting, agreed that the President had simply indicated ''he would like more information'' on that specific case. ''It would be a gross misinterpretation to say the President responded in the affirmative to any suggestion of pardoning these people,'' Dr. Willke said. The President told the leaders that their movement would benefit by an end to the violence against clinics, Dr. Willke said. Songs, Prayers and Pledges The anti-abortion rally, initiated and led by Nellie Gray, a retired Federal employee who is a lawyer, was marked by patriotic songs and prayers and pledges of support from numerous members of Congress. Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York said, ''The success of this movement is assured, not only because it's predicated on those Judeo-Christian values upon which American was founded, but because it is pro-people.'' Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, received some of the warmest applauses of the day. ''No matter how long it takes, right will eventually prevail,'' the Senator told his audience. The crowd was dotted with banners, flags and signs, some of which said, ''The time for the choice is before conception'' and ''Jesus was a fetus.'' Points of origin included Pennsylvania, Maine, Missouri and Wisconsin, and, organizers said, virtually every other state. Barbara Yasko, of Waunakee, Wis., said she rode 22 hours on a bus to attend the rally. ''I decided I wanted to step out and activate what I believe in,'' Miss Yasko said. ''Faith without activism is dead.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BEHIND CUOMO'S ACTIONS: INSTINCT AND CALCULATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/nyregion/behind-cuomo-s-actions-instinct-and-calculation.html,"Governor Cuomo questioned whether there was a Mafia. He summoned the Legislature into special session, only to see lawmakers reject all but one of his proposals and go home the same day. He granted clemency to a convicted murderer, but later a panel of his own Parole Board decided that the prisoner was unfit to be released into society. And last week, the Governor said he might be willing to run for President, if only to prove wrong those who say an Italian-American cannot win. These actions by the Governor over the past month or so have drawn outrage from some people, praise from others. But for the most part, they have left many people perplexed, wondering just what he is up to and why. The actions - some of them planned, some done in the heat of the moment - say much about Mr. Cuomo, about his style of governing, about a man who says he sometimes acts because of ''powerful instincts,'' about a man who fights so hard to win that he can at times, according to even his own aides, bring about his own defeat. ''If a lot of intelligent people tell me not to do something, I think about it and take their advice,'' the Governor said in an interview. ''But the popular opinion of intelligent people can be off. When you have a powerful instinct, you ought to go with it.'' It was such an instinct, Mr. Cuomo said, that led him, despite the advice of national Democratic leaders, to confront speculation that an Italian-American could not win the Presidency. But while that and other actions by the Governor may have originated as instincts, many also appear to be calculated political risks aimed at increasing his popularity. There are indications that he has been served well by the previous times he has confronted controversial issues because of his strong personal feelings. The Governor's approval rating in public-opinion polls has risen over the last three years from 57 percent to about 70 percent. Despite advice from his aides not to oppose a popular President, Mr. Cuomo led the fight last year against the Reagan Administration's plans to eliminate Federal income-tax deductions for state and local taxes. So far,he has succeeded - an important victory that has increased his national prominence. Likewise, the Governor was warned the year before not to get involved in a dispute with John Cardinal O'Connor over whether Roman Catholic elected officials, in executing public policy, had an obligation to apply the church's teachings against abortion. Yet Mr. Cuomo, a Catholic, turned the dispute to his advantage, speaking eloquently about separation of church and state. ''What I came to know about the Governor,'' said Michael J. Del Giudice, his former chief of staff, who is now an investment banker, ''is that his sense of the body politic, if you will, is very keen. He reads constantly, he talks to people, he samples the mail. He is able to see patterns as they're developing -before others see them - and to make a judgment and move on them.'' But some of the Governor's more recent controversial actions have not so much been carefully thought-out decisions on major policy as they have been spur-of-the-moment political slips. When asked last month whether he would take action to save New York City's 90-cent transit fare, for example, Mr. Cuomo dismissed the issue, saying only that it was not on his agenda. Later, he acknowledged that his comment had been perceived as flip and that it had been a ''mistake.'' Others of his actions came after careful deliberation. His granting of clemency to Gary McGivern, a convicted murderer, was something he had been considering for three years. When he announced it this month, it drew an outcry from state Republican leaders and law-enforcement groups. The Governor, who said he had acted ''out of conscience,'' went out of his way to point out that the White House had talked with state Republican leaders about making the clemency an election issue. And he acknowledged that ''McGivern hurts me politically.'' A key reason for his success in taking on politically controversial issues, according to both his aides and his critics, has been his ability to structure each debate so he is portrayed as the principled underdog, fighting against public opinion and powerful institutions. He did just that in his fight with the White House over the deductibility of state and local taxes. He did it in his battle with the Cardinal over abortion. And he is doing it in his fight against what he says is discrimination against Italian-Americans, portraying himself as the victim of widely held bias and as the lone voice against it. ''He uses the ploy,'' said Anthony J. Colavita, the state Republican chairman, ''of making an issue out of something, of being the one to create the issue, then turning it around to make it look as if he didn't create it and is simply the victim who has to defend himself against the big boys. But he's the big boy, he's the Governor.'' But while both the Governor's aides and his critics agree that one of his strongest political talents is his ability to identify an issue and a method of attack, they also agree that, on occasion, his personality leads him to get carried away. They say he is still the athlete and the trial lawyer, a man with a fierce will to win who is compelled to hammer away in an effort to score every debating point. His aides acknowledge that there is no better example of how, when carried to extreme, such aggressiveness can hurt him than his comments about the Mafia. Twice in an interview last month in which he talked about bias against Italian-Americans, Mr. Cuomo denied the existence of the Mafia, whose name he believes unfairly links all of organized crime to Italian-Americans. The Governor knows that there is a Mafia, of course - he implied so during the interview and has repeatedly said it outright since then. But he so wanted to prove why the word should not be used that he let his emotions and anger run away with him and denied the group's very existence. ''I think the people are not like us,'' the Governor said of those in the Albany political arena. ''They don't react to the things we react to here. They react to an overall perception of honesty and to a sincere effort of fighting for the state.'' David Garth, the political media consultant, who talks with the Governor from time to time, said: ''If a candidate feels very strongly about an issue, then my experience has been to let him run with it. What the public reacts to is not so much the message as the sincerity. If a candidate isn't sincere, the public will be able to sense that.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Men Emerging As Leaders In NOW Ranks,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/garden/men-emerging-as-leaders-in-now-ranks.html,"THE recent election of Dr. Robert Seidenberg as the first male president of the Greater Syracuse Chapter of the National Organization for Women inspired an editorial-page cartoon in a local newspaper. It showed a bearded man, wearing a dress and high-heeled pumps, being sworn into office by a woman in a man's pin-striped suit. The significance of the cartoon was lost on its subject, he recalled, until the paper ran a letter to the editor noting that robes are worn by judges, priests, professors and others in offices of prestige. ''So,'' Dr. Seidenberg said, ''it was fitting that I be in women's robes.'' . This 65-year-old psychiatrist, an early and active feminist, is among a handful of men moving into leadership positions in NOW's 800 local chapters. The exact number of chapters headed by men is unknown, since the leadership roster of 1,500 names is not broken down by sex, but it is thought to be about 10. Many more NOW chapters, including its two largest, New York and Los Angeles, have elected men to vice presidencies and other high offices. Men have always made up between 5 and 10 percent of NOW's membership, which stands currently at 173,000. Yet, according to longtime members like Frances Kolb, who is writing a history of the 20-year-old organization's first decade, men have not always been welcome in its inner circle. In the beginning, '' said Dr. Kolb, an Ashland, Mass., historian, ''we felt it was good to have men in the women's movement because it showed that we were fair and equitable and that we believed men and women should have good relationships.'' As a result, at least one male face appeared on the national board until the early 1970's when the election process changed and when, she said, ''active hostility against men surfaced in NOW and other feminist organizations.'' While traces of hostility persist, Dr. Kolb said, ''now we just don't care about that kind of thing.'' ''But no men have been national officers, '' she added. ''Nor, I guess, are they likely to be.'' Some feminist leaders, notably Betty Friedan, a founder of NOW, advocate recruiting men as one cure for what she calls the ''profound paralysis'' of the women's movement. ''It's passe,'' she has said, ''for feminists now to see men only as the enemy, or to comtemplate separatist models for emotional or economic survival.'' ''Sex roles and stereotypes are as deterimental to men as to women,'' said Karen De Crow, a former president of national NOW and a board member of the 200-member chapter headed by Dr. Seidenberg. ''We want to get rid of sexism and the way to that is men and women side by side.'' Despite such encouragement, some men leading NOW chapters say they hesitated at first to run for office, even when pressed by nominating committees. It was not that they feared the ridicule of other men, they said, though there has been some of that. Nor was it the criticism of women, though there has been some of that too. As Dr. Seidenberg, who took office last month, put it: ''I felt it would resonate too boringly with the image of the male taking over. That's why I served as secretary for several years: to break stereotypes.'' For some male leaders, joining NOW was a logical outgrowth of civil rights activities. Others were inspired by women in their lives, usually wives and friends, but also mothers and sisters. Gerald Blum, a 42-year-old nuclear engineer in Pittsburgh, became a member of the national organization 12 years ago, during a second divorce. He said the experience ''awakened in me a realization of sex roles and stereotypes.'' For two years Mr. Blum did no more than pay dues to NOW, read the newsletter and write letters to legislators. After joining the local South Hills chapter, however, he found himself picketing the White House, traveling to conferences and defining feminism before the Lions Club and other male audiences. In talks to men's groups, Mr. Blum, former president of the 160-member chapter and now co-president, is often asked whether he encounters reverse discrimination. ''Occasionally I do,'' he acknowledged, ''from a small minority of members. You have to understand there are many women who have been treated badly by a few men in their lives and have difficulty not generalizing negative feelings to other men.'' By contrast, the Rev. Tony Larsen, pastor of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Racine, Wis., spoke of only positive reaction to his three years as chairman of the 20-member NOW chapter there. It meets in the church, which has a history of concern with women's rights. ''At first,'' said the 36-year-old minister, now the chapter's vice chairman, ''I worried that maybe I wasn't the right person for the job, but now I see that it probably is neat to have men in some leadership positions.'' Among the activities that stand out in Mr. Larsen's mind are marches against rape; an escort service for women who are being harassed outside abortion clinics; a protest that led a department store chain to lift a ban on the wearing of slacks by female employees, and a so-called sexorcism. In it, feminists read aloud from slips of paper containing sexist passages from the Bible and other religious writing and then burned the papers. ''It was an effort to show that sexism is prevalent, not just in the Judeo-Christian tradition, but in all religions,'' said Mr. Larsen. Dr. Seidenberg, too, mixes feminism with professional life. He said he has observed the emotional damage caused by sex discrimination in male as well as female patients. ''Everyone suffers when the game's not played on a level field,'' the psychiatrist said, adding that men tend to justify their ''unwon advantages'' in one of two ways. Either they work twice as hard to prove their superiority and suffer psychosomatic disorders, he said, or they become authoritarian figures, again to justify the superiority. ''Hobson's choice,'' he said. Dr. Seidenberg and his wife, Faith, a lawyer who was once an officer of national NOW, are both longtime feminists. He has won respect in feminist circles by challenging the assumption that depressed women should be given pills and testifying to that effect before Congressional committees. ''Twice as many women are on tranquilizers as should be,'' he said. ''Every medical magazine targets women as patients to be drugged.'' While women have generally cheered his election, he said, men do not always take it seriously. His barber, for example, joked that he was using his office to meet women. ''The sexual fantasy is that a guy joins NOW for sex, and the contrary thing is they're a bunch of lesbians,'' Dr. Seidenberg said, with a chuckle. ''Well, you can't have it both ways.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Church Expels Parenthood Aide,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/24/us/church-expels-parenthood-aide.html,"The Diocese of Providence has excommunicated the head of the state's Planned Parenthood organization for what it called activities causing ''the sinful termination of human life.'' But Mary Ann Sorrentino, whose excommunication in June was made public this week, said the church's decision would not affect her work or her religious beliefs. ''I am a Catholic and I will always be a Catholic,'' Miss Sorrentino said. ''Whether they give me communion or bury me in their church isn't going to change that.'' The president of Planned Parenthood, Faye Wattleton, today called the church's action ''political and religious persecution.'' Miss Sorrentino, 43 years old, has been executive director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island for nine years. The organization provides counseling on birth control and pregnancy and performs abortions. ''I consider it is a discriminatory attack,'' Miss Sorrentino said, contrasting herself with Senator Edward M. Kennedy and former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, both Catholics who support abortion rights. The Rev. Salvatore Matano, vicar of administration for the diocese, said the church's ouster of Miss Sorrentino ''is a logical consequence of her position. None of those is the head of an agency which in fact performs abortions.'' Word of the excommunication came when a Rhode Island priest described her on an antiabortion program seen on several cable television outlets as ''public enemy No. 1 of all babies being killed in the womb in Rhode Island.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHURCH CALLS EXCOMMUNICATED CATHOLIC ABORTION 'ACCOMPLICE',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/25/us/church-calls-excommunicated-catholic-abortion-accomplice.html,"The Diocese of Providence has ruled that the director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island excommunicated herself from the Roman Catholic church by acting as an ''accomplice'' in abortions. Several religious experts said the ruling against someone who has not directly participated in abortions was highly unusual. ''I have not heard of that being done elsewhere,'' said the Rev. James H. Provost, executive coordinator at the Canon Law Society, a professional association of church lawyers. The diocese made the determination in the case of Mary Ann Sorrentino, who has been director of the agency for nine years. Mrs. Sorrentino said that her agency operated a clinic that performed a thousand abortions a year. In a letter to her dated June 14, 1985, the diocese's Vicar for Administration, the Rev. Salvatore R. Matano, quoted Canon 1398 of the Church's Code of Canon Law, ''A person who procures a successful abortion incurs an automatic excommunication,'' and Canon 1329, ''Accomplices who are not named in a law or in a precept incur an automatic penalty attached to an offense if it would not have been committed without their efforts.'' The letter said that Mrs. Sorrentino had incurred automatic excommunication ''by reason of the position'' of director. Excommunicated Catholics are not permitted to receive communion, make confession or go to Mass. Priest Discloses Ruling The ruling was not made public at the time but was divulged by a priest on a Rhode Island cable television program about abortion, which was shown Jan. 22, the eve of the anniversary of the 1972 Supreme Court decision that struck down state anti-abortion laws. ''Of course it means a great deal to me personally,'' Mrs. Sorrentino said today in a telephone interview. ''I have been a Roman Catholic Italian-American woman for 42 years. I feel very strongly about my roots. People like me will understand, in my culture, my religion is very much a part of my life. I will always be a Catholic in my heart.'' ''The closest that I have been to abortions, and I am not apologizing,'' she added, ''is I have been in the operating room suite, holding the hands of women who have had abortions. She noted that she was trained as a social worker and had accompanied patients from time to time ''to experience the experience of our patients.'' ''I have found that's some of the most rewarding work I've done,'' she added. Mrs. Sorrentino said that the issue of her status arose in May, two days before her 15-year-old daughter was due to be confirmed. Church officials demanded that the girl be ''interrogated'' about her own position on abortion, Mrs. Sorrentino said. Only after the individual interview did they allow her daughter to be confirmed, Mrs. Sorrentino said. The girl was previously interviewed by a parish priest, along with the 75 other members of her confirmation class, Mrs. Sorrentino said. ''They waited until the dress was bought, the caterer hired, and the relatives were ready to go,'' she said. ''The cruel thing of bringing in a child, with mother and father there, asking her to say to a priest, 'I hate what my mother stands for and I think she's a cruel person,' that wasn't wasted on us,'' Mrs. Sorrentino said. Calls to the diocese yesterday afternoon were referred to Father Matano, who did not return a message. She said that her agency did not advise women to have abortions, but it answers their questions about the procedure and about alternatives and refers women to prenatal care if they decide to complete their pregnancies. Several experts said that the action by the Rhode Island diocese was unusual. ''A reasonable person would not have assumed that the canon would apply to the executive director of the organization,'' said the Rev. Richard McBrien, chairman of the department of theology at Notre Dame University in South Bend, Ind. ''Most Catholics would believe it applies to the woman. Many Catholics would think it applies only to the woman.'' Another complicating factor would be whether it was clear beforehand to Mrs. Sorrentino that the penalty for her role was excommunication, he said. ''The code of canon law says if you've got these kind of doubts, there's a pretty good basis for saying it's not automatic,'' Mr. McBrien said. ''It's not that you can't kick her out; it's that you've got to have a process.'' ''If a person is a director of a hospital in which abortions are performed, the person who directs is not considered to incur excommunication; the person who performs is,'' Mr. Provost said. ''Much would depend upon how the local situation in Rhode Island is set up.'' He added that individuals ''usually are not considered directly involved unless they make a specific referral themselves.'' Mrs. Sorrentino said that she could appeal the church's ruling, but ''in the current climate it isn't worth the postage to request a hearing.'' The Code of Canon Law lists seven offenses for which automatic excommunication is the penalty, of which four apply to laymen: participation in an abortion, an attack on the Pope, desecration of the Holy Eucharist and defiant heresy. The others are violating the confidentiality of the confession, granting absolution to an accomplice in a sex crime and the illicit ordination of a bishop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BUSH SALUTES FALWELL CONSERVATISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/25/us/bush-salutes-falwell-conservatism.html,"Vice President Bush, intensifying his political courtship of Republican conservatives and religious fundamentalists, said today that ''America is in crying need of the moral vision'' he said the Rev. Jerry Falwell and his followers had brought to the political process. ''Let me say, go for it,'' Mr. Bush declared in urging a gathering of state leaders of Mr. Falwell's Liberty Federation to become more politically active. The federation is a political organization formed recently by the founder of Moral Majority to mobilize conservatives who support his views on domestic and foreign issues. Moral Majority has become a subsidiary of the federation. Mr. Bush, who already has Mr. Falwell's endorsement for President, urged the leaders of the federation not to let critics who have denounced their movement as ''moral McCarthyism'' drive them out of the political process. ''America is in crying need of the moral vision you have brought to our political life,'' the Vice President said. At another point, Mr. Bush said, ''What great goals you have!'' Endorsement of Its Issues Mr. Bush was cheered and applauded as he endorsed the main issues on the organization's agenda, including opposition to abortion, a call for prayer in public schools, American aid to rebel groups fighting to overthrow the governments of Angola and Nica= rauga, and support for President Reagan's proposed space-based missile defense system., ''That was good preaching,'' Mr. Falwell said after the Vice President sat down, drawing scattered ''Amens'' from the audience. Mr. Bush's salute to the Falwell organization came less than 24 hours after he made one of his strongest political speeches to date. Speaking at a fund-raising dinner of the Conservative Party of New York Thursday night, Mr. Bush accused Governor Cuomo of being soft on crime and of ''pitting one American against another'' by raising the question of ethnic bigotry in national politics. Ignored a Rival At the New York event, the Vice President ignored one of his chief rivals for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination, Representative Jack F. Kemp of Upstate New York, and instead directed sharp words at Governor Cuomo, who is considered a potential Democratic Presidential contender in 1988. Mr. Bush's political advisers contend that any challenge to the Vice President will have to come from the Republican right, and a key element in their strategy for the nomination is for Mr. Bush to move early to try to lock up that element of the party. But some analysts say that while that strategy may work in the nomination battle, it could saddle Mr. Bush with some heavy ideological baggage in a general election campaign against a moderate Democrat. In the coming weeks both the Mr. Bush and Mr. Kemp are scheduled to increase their visibility before conservative audiences. With the exception of Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the former Senate majority leader, all of the Republican Presidential hopefuls are scheduled to address the 13th Annual Conservative Political Action Committee Conference, a major gathering of conservative activists that will convene Jan. 30 in Washington. Question of Effectiveness The lineup of Republican Presidential hopefuls at the conference includes Mr. Bush; Mr. Kemp; Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader; former Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware, and Pat Robertson, a television evangelist. Mr. Bush's political strategists were calling the back-to-back events in New York and Washington a political success, some of Mr. Kemp's forces contended that the Vice President's combativeness in the New York speech would yield only short-term political gains. One Kemp adviser, who asked not to be identified, called Mr. Bush's attack on Governor Cuomo ''injudicious and baffling,'' especially since Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, and the Governor, both Italian Americans, have a good working relationship. A top Bush strategist, who also insisted on anonymity, rejoined: ''Kemp might as well have not been at the New York dinner. Look at who made the news.'' This strategist contended that Mr. Bush was steadily gaining support among conservatives without ''any seepage in his traditional base,'' and added that Mr. Bush was not concerned about any criticism for his overtures to conservatives. Paul Weyrich, a leading conservative activist, said today that he thought the political punches the Vice President threw at Mr. Cuomo could improve the perception of Mr. Bush's political character. ''Two of Bush's problems are that he is perceived as not being a true believer and as being a weak political individual,'' said Mr. Weyrich, who heads the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress. ''I think attacking Cuomo can help make those things less of an issue if he keeps it up.'' Mr. Weyrich said Mr. Kemp was in ''good shape'' among conservatives, but added that ''I've been surprised Jack hasn't wrapped up more hard core conservatives than he has.'' Vice President Bush, he said, ''is going to be hard to beat.'' Another conservative activist, Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus Political Action Committee, said Mr. Bush was benefitting at the moment from the reluctance of conservatives to ''criticize Reagan policies,'' and in ''this vacuum of a debate on the issues,'' he added, Mr. Bush is enjoying the advantages of his incumbency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHY ITALY IS SURPRISINGLY HOSPITABLE TO FEMINISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/weekinreview/why-italy-is-surprisingly-hospitable-to-feminism.html,"Italian men are famous the world over for their aggressive affronts to female dignity and other sins against equality between the sexes. So it might have come as something of a surprise this month when Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and Marisa Bellisario, the managing director of Italtel, the state communications company, announced plans to improve the status of women in Italy's workplaces. Mr. Craxi, a Socialist who leans toward the political center, declared flatly that Italy is a place in which ''the man is privileged and the woman is discriminated against.'' Yet the announcement did not strike many younger Italian women as anything extraordinary, an indication of how out-of-date is the world's view of the way Italy treats women. After all, they note, the country passed its equivalent of the American equal rights amendment years ago. Alida Castelli, a leader of the working women's section of the Communist Party, pointed to measures designed to protect the jobs of pregnant women, insure women's property rights and expand parental leave after the birth of a child to cover fathers as well as mothers. From a different political perspective, Federica Olivares founded a group called Women in Careers, an organization of managers and entrepreneurs aged 27 to 40. ''You remember the old boys' network?'' Mrs. Olivares said. ''Well, we are the young girls' network.'' In the early days, the women's movement in Italy and in other West European countries was more radical than that in the United States and less concerned with day-to-day issues, many women here say. ''As a result,'' Mrs. Olivares said, ''we are five to seven years behind our American cousins.'' But in the long run, Mrs. Olivares said, Italian women may be better off, in part because Italian men, despite their reputation, may have ''always had a better image of women'' than other men. The Italian mother of popular lore, she noted, was always a strong figure. At one time, conservatives in Italy and other heavily Roman Catholic countries won elections partly because large numbers of devout women voted for them. In Italy, they were the backbone of the vote for the long-dominant Christian Democrats. But the European left has made inroads in the last decade by winning away younger women with promises of greater opportunities. In referendums on divorce and abortion, Italians voted overwhelmingly in favor of liberalized laws - against the wishes of both the Vatican and the Christian Democrats. In France, the governing Socialists have made a big play to women through a variety of actions, including at one time appointing a Government Minister who was dedicated to women's rights. In light of this, Mr. Craxi's recent so-called ''Women and Technology'' initiatives are hardly radical. The experiment amounts to a limited affirmative action program that will be tried in Mrs. Bellisario's company, by the regional government of Lombardia, where Milan is, and by the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the state-owned bank and Italy's largest commercial bank. The project at the bank will study why young university-educated women do not move ahead faster, and it will seek ways to help them along. Most of the attention will be directed at the new high-technology industries - a pragmatic choice, some women said, because it is easier to prevent barriers from being erected than to tear down the ones that exist. ''The majority of the developing activities linked to the new technologies have a 'woman dimension' totally unknown in the old productive processes,'' said Mr. Craxi in a statement that might make some feminists wince. High-tech industries are also more likely to offer flexible hours, he noted, which are attractive to working mothers. Mrs. Bellisario has no illusions that the proposals will dramatically improve opportunities for women. She said pointedly that she hoped they would encourage action by ''the big private-sector companies who are not represented here.'' The country's workforce is still dominated by men, with women making up only about a third of it. In industry, the figure is about one-fourth. For all the improvements here, women are still vastly underrepresented at the top, she and Mr. Craxi said. As might be expected, the women's movement is generally far stronger in the cities than in the countryside, and in the modern north than in the more traditional south. But Mrs. Castelli, who was named to the board of the ''Women and Technology'' project, noted that the differences between north and south are not always as clear cut as they seem. Recently, she said, two factories - one in Milan and one in Aquila, farther south - were forced to lay off workers. When the time came for the workers to go back full time, women in Aquila could take up their jobs immediately. ''The women in Aquila were able to take advantage of the extended family - their grandmothers -to take care of their children,'' Mrs. Castelli said. ''For the women in Milan, it was more difficult to reorganize their family life.'' In Italy, she seemed to say, even tradition sometimes works in women's favor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A NEW LOOK AT 'NOBLE SUFFERING',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/books/a-new-look-at-noble-suffering.html,"''PRAY, my dear . . . have you not forgot to wind up the clock?'' asks Mrs. Shandy at the crucial moment of Tristram's conception, and three-and-a-half volumes later when, face blackened and nose squashed, Tristram finally makes a precarious entry into the world at the clumsy hands of Dr. Slop, we witness the first descriptive childbirth scene in English fiction. Old rake of an English clergyman that he was, in ''Tristram Shandy'' Laurence Sterne found child-birth, like all of life, subject for satire. Dickens, in turn, would put upon it his customary stamp of morbid pathos: Oliver Twist's birth in a typically awful English workhouse, attended by a gin-imbibing pauper woman and an indifferent parish surgeon, would necessarily conclude with the death of the pretty young mother. Only one major novelist of the 18th and another of the 19th century attempted to write of childbirth. Both were men; both wrote in extremes of literary idiosyncracy. Nowhere on either side of the Atlantic was there anything approaching Tolstoy's naturalistic portrayal of birth in ''Anna Karenina.'' By the early part of this century, male novelists - Galsworthy, Wells, Forster, Lawrence, among others - were portraying childbirth, but from the comfortable orientation of the fictional father. And nowhere did a woman novelist of note assert feminine rights to the subject. I think the somewhat belated involvement of women writers in the description of childbirth was prompted partly by the general avoidance in the 19th and pre-Joycean 20th centuries of dealing with bodily functions and concerns, but more by the reluctance of women writers to stretch their luck by tak-ing what must have seemed to them too great a step into forbidden realms. Perhaps they felt it was audacious enough for them to write at all, and to write so well, and to write of passion and the occasional fruits of passion, the illegitimate child. Then, too, until after the first quarter of this century, no celebrated woman novelist in the English language had had a child. Jane Austen was not only childless, but almost surely lived out her life a virgin. Of the three Brontes, Charlotte did marry and have a child, but not until just before her death. George Eliot's connection with George Henry Lewes was (apparently by design) without issue. Nineteenth-century exceptions that come to mind - Mrs. Gaskell, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Olive Schreiner, Kate Chopin - cannot really be counted major novelists. MATTERS remained much the same in the early 20th century. Edith Wharton had no children; Virginia Woolf, no children; Willa Cather, no children. Woolf incorporates childbirth in ''Orlando'' and again in ''Flush,'' but obliquely. Cather approaches it in ''My Antonia,'' but pulls up short. What a loss! If only the sun-browned Antonia had borne one of those wonderful children on stage instead of in the wings. The situation was bound to change as the sheer number of women novelists proliferated toward the middle of the century. My own earliest experience of childbirth in fiction came during my adolescent reading (no Judy Blume then) of Pearl Buck: the bent bodies of Wang Lung and his wife, O-lan, in the rice fields, she well along in pregnancy but matching him row for row until that afternoon she has to stop early to give birth to their first child, alone. That was ''The Good Earth.'' The heroine of ''Pavilion of Women'' is the elegant, purposeful Madame Wu, who renounced all matters of the flesh on her 40th birthday (at 12 I thought that reasonable) and arranged for a concubine for her husband. Madame Wu is sent for to try to save the life of her childhood friend, the fat and inelegant Madame Kang, already mother of many, now dying in childbirth. Madame Wu insists that Kang be present to observe the desperate straits to which he has brought his wife; by the time the baby is at last delivered, Kang is a weak-kneed wreck. Pearl Buck was my introduction to life - not only childbirth, but lust, greed, starvation, violence, sodomy. (How have the producers of mini-series overlooked her?) I think Pearl Buck, writing in the 1930's and 40's out of her observations of women not of her culture, served as a bridge between the symbolic approach of male novelists and the intimate, immediate tone of women who more and more began to portray childbirth as they experienced it. Inevitably, when men included a birth scene in a novel, the woman's ordeal precipitated a change in the man - an awakening, a rite of passage from B to C. Even Tolstoy, with his inimitable descriptive powers, evokes the scene that he himself saw when his wife, Sonia, gave birth to their first child, and allots Kitty a secondary role. Levin has all the good lines. Anais Nin's story ''Birth,'' published in 1948, is the earliest naturalistic presentation of childbirth I know of in our literature - the first time we are not looking over the father's or the doctor's or the midwife's shoulder, but lying stretched out on the table with the laboring woman, feeling her pain, her exhaustion, her rage. Connecting labor with anger is, I think, unique to women writers. There was certainly pain before - fear, resignation, sometimes irony - but never before were these noble sufferers betrayed by having their anger described for an audience that was supposed to be witnessing them at their most saintly moment. In the childbirth literature of the last half century, however, there is often anger. It is sometimes submerged, sometimes surfacing, usually caused by the helplessness regularly experienced by women in this country in the late 40's and 50's. The struggle between mother-right and medical authority took on momentum in those years. In Nin's ''Birth,'' the woman knows that her baby, premature, is already dead, but there is a part of her that does not want to deliver the child, because it is hers, her flesh, and with its birth she will lose it forever. She resists the doctor as long as she can. At last, she expels the child and immediately a new struggle is initiated. The nurses do not want to show it to her. It isn't done. Primitive instinct battles against practicality, mother-right against authority. Which is not to say that all women knew as well as Nin's character what they wanted. Most of them learned as they went along. In the early 1950's Doris Lessing offered us in ''A Proper Marriage'' what was surely the lengthiest and most self-examined literary pregnancy up to that time, culminating in a minutely described labor and delivery followed by a prolonged lying-in. Martha Quest is 19 years old, conventionally married, part of the middle-class white society of southern Africa. When she finally goes into labor and enters a nursing home, we share her indignation when she must make do with a hard delivery-room table; share her rage when, during the agony of the contractions, she cannot remember the intervening painlessness, and during the intervals of rest, cannot recall the pain. She is scolded when she screams. She hears herself call to God and to her mother, both of whom she has repudiated in a more rational hour, and is only eased when the scrubwoman, washing the floor, lays her black hand on her stomach and croons, ''Let the baby come, let the baby come, let the baby come.'' There is resolution in the natural that has been lost to the sophisticated state. IT was this conflict with an obdurate authority that was reflected by the women writers of the 1940's, 50's and into the 60's, in both childbirth and postpartum scenes. The villain was the hospital system; a new mother's wishes were inconsequential. Poor anxious little Priss Hartshorn in ''The Group'' by Mary McCarthy, lying there in New York Hospital in the mid-1930's, torn between her pediatrician-husband's infant feeding theories (pro-breast) and hospital policy (pro-bottle), forced to conform to a schedule that left her baby howling for much of the day and night, feeling even when he was brought to her that he had no real connection to her, but was just a piece of hospital property temporarily placed in her custody. Almost no one writes favorably of giving birth in the 1950's, at least not in this country. In her autobiographical ''Of Woman Born,'' Adrienne Rich suggests that both the woman who was unconscious and the conscious woman attempting to surmount her pain in natural childbirth were rejecting the ''passive suffering'' of an earlier time, but had little sense of being in command. Esther, in ''The Bell Jar'' by Sylvia Plath, watches a ''normal'' - that is drugged - hospital delivery with her medical-student boyfriend and wonders afterward if there is any other way to have a baby. She is not appeased by his explanation that the drug would make the groaning woman forget the pain. ''I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent,'' she says, ''and she would go straight home and start another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been.'' Our literature bears out, then, that for the average woman of the 1940's and 50's, giving birth was little different from anything else in women's experience. Men were still in charge. The system remained; its code was not yet broken. The woman in labor, the woman expelling her child, the woman whose newborn sucked from her breast, was still just a woman. The Pill brought a new maneuverability. In ''The Women's Room,'' Marilyn French's heroine looks back at the pre-Pill era and says, ''I don't know what it is like to be pregnant voluntarily. I assume it's a very different experience from that of the women I know.'' Marilyn French reminds us that the helplessness did not begin when the woman went into labor in unsympathetic surroundings; it began nine months before. And a woman who feels victimized by her pregnancy may or may not be a good mother. Most of the women I knew who had unplanned, often unwelcome pregnancies in the 50's and 60's were, like Marilyn French's women, pretty good mothers. Others were less so. Martha Quest loved her child, but left her when still a baby. Meridian, in Alice Walker's novel of that name, loved hers ''impersonally,'' as she might the moon, or a tree, loved him enough to give him away because she was afraid that in her anger she might kill him. Felicitas, in ''The Company of Women'' by Mary Gordon, did not love hers until years later. Are these fictional extremes, or are they honest expressions of how a woman may feel when a child disrupts the direction of her life? Our literature also reflects, of course, the alternative method of dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. In fiction the decision for abortion is seldom an easy one, seldom made and forgotten. The heroine who coolly assesses her options, acts and moves on is rare. Do our novelists exploit the situation for the drama and self-searching inherent in it? Or are they reflecting precarious stretches of emotional uncertainty that lie below the surface in us all? Given a heroine's equivocation, given pre-1973 surreptitious arrangements involving nondescript rooms and faces, I always want the heroine to cut and run. Escape while she still can. I could hardly refrain from cheering when Mary Gordon's Felicitas, waiting her turn in the plastic reception room in the Bronx, does a quick double take and ducks out. I wanted Maria, Joan Didion's heroine of ''Play It as It Lays,'' to do the same. It makes no sense for Felicitas, uncertain who is the father, or Maria, whose lover is married to another, to bear these children. If I, and others similarly affected, are at heart pro-woman, perhaps pro-choice, why are we tense with anxiety? Why do we so fervently want our heroines to reconsider? Because, I think, we know how much the choice entails. We are afraid for their psyches. We would be, have been, afraid for our own. Today women have more life choices than ever before; the nuances have shifted. When we hold our potential maternity in our own hands, we have to listen to the voices of our deeper consciousness. In her book ''In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens,'' Alice Walker describes being ''terrified of having children,'' feeling ''fractured'' by the experience. She compromised on - and strongly advocates -one child. Alice Walker is not alone in considering motherhood. We have Erica Jong to thank for reminding us (in a letter to The Book Review two years ago) who among our contemporary women have written on the subject of childbirth and motherhood: besides those already mentioned, and herself, they include Toni Morrison, Marge Piercy, Rosellen Brown, Penelope Mortimer, Anne Roiphe, Susan Fromberg Schaffer, Tillie Olsen, Grace Paley, Muriel Rukeyser and Anne Morrow Lindbergh. Colette Dowling, Anne Tyler and Nora Ephron are three more, and quite recently, Alice Hoffman. Not surprisingly, when we consider the dimensions of our current involvement, we are now being offered novels in which pregnancy, childbearing and parental emotion are the whole story. In ''Fortune's Daughter,'' which exactly spans the nine-month gestation period in a young woman's life, Alice Hoffman intertwines Rae's fate with that of Lila, an older woman who, a generation before (that is, back in the evil 50's), bore an illegitimate child and gave her up. In contrast to the heart-wrenching account of Lila's delivery and the quarter of a century of agonized recriminations that follow, Rae's pregnancy becomes, for the reader, an increasingly pleasurable experience. Although unmarried and abandoned by her boyfriend, her pregnancy gives her confidence, a new control over her life. She is no victim; there is no anger. At the book's end, Rae, the prodigal boyfriend (returned), Lila, and Lila's husband all leave for the hospital and what will apparently be a very communal delivery. We know we are part of a brave and highly satisfactory new world. WITH ''The Cider House Rules'' by John Irving, we come full circle. A male novelist has returned to the fray, and we are back looking over the doctor's shoulder, the shoulder of Wilbur Larch ensconced in his remote Maine orphanage. Larch divides his time between delivering babies to unmarried mothers, performing abortions on women who would otherwise resort to the butchery of quacks, and sniffing ether. But for all his courage and humanity, Wilbur Larch is part of the medical authority that Anais Nin and Mary McCarthy, among others, rejected. Mr. Irving makes that clear. At times Nurse Angela - one of Larch's two saintly helpmates - wondered ''if Dr. Larch knew how he tended to overlook women; she wondered if this was an occupational hazard among obstetricians, or if men with a tendency to overlook women were drawn to the obstetrical field.'' John Irving marks a major re-entry of the male novelist into the world of childbirth and obstetrics, a world that women writers have recently so dominated. He has also shown himself willing to join the dialogue on abortion. Others will follow. They can provide an appropriate and welcome addition to the graphic, the gritty, the intimate vision of our contemporary women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONGRESS ENVISIONS A YEAR TO FORGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/weekinreview/congress-envisions-a-year-to-forget.html,"When Republican leaders had breakfast at the White House last week, they listened quietly as President Reagan sketched out a budget proposal that would slice deficits solely by reducing domestic programs. Lower defense spending and higher taxes were ruled out. No voice was raised in opposition to the President's plan, but later in the day Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi joked that it was a good thing none of the Republican leaders had been asked to take lie detector tests. By week's end, at another White House meeting, Congressional Republicans began to lose patience with Mr. Reagan. Participants in the meetings said they had warned him that unless he showed more flexibility and leadership on budget matters, the Republican Party could splinter and lose its Senate majority next fall. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader in the House, stressed after the meeting: ''We are headed for some kind of negotiated settlement. Something has got to give.'' This tension between Republican leaders and the White House summed up the dominant mood on Capitol Hill as the lawmakers returned for the second session of the 99th Congress. They are looking forward to the year with all the relish usually accorded root canal work. And the main reason is the fear and uncertainty so many feel over the implications of the new law that requires them to balance the budget in annual steps over the next five years. If those steps are not taken, automatic cuts will go into effect, and many lawmakers agree with Representative Silvio O. Conte, a Massachusetts Republican, when he calls the measure ''a disastrous piece of work.'' The legislators got a taste of that disaster when James Miller, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week that if the automatic cuts are implemented in the next fiscal year, military spending will drop 18 percent, and domestic outlays by 25 percent. Any deficit-reduction plan that could forestall the automatic cuts, many Congressman think, must include new taxes and lower defense spending. But as long as the President is adamantly opposed to both elements, the lawmakers will remain frozen by indecision. This paralysis is only aggravated by the elections now less than 10 months away. Twenty-two Republican Senate seats will be up, and a net gain of only four slots would put the Democrats back in control next January. Accordingly, Senate Republicans are eager to move forward on a bipartisan compromise as fast as possible, so voters will have time to forget the President's proposals before they go to the polls. ''We want to prove that we can govern,'' said Mr. Cochran, the secretary of the Republican conference. ''We can blame some of our problems on the Democrats, but not all.'' In his weekly radio address yesterday, the President, perhaps providing a preview of Tuesday's State of the Union message, said he needed ''the help of Republicans and Democrats in the Congress if we are to solve the serious problems confronting our nation.'' For now, the Democrats seem ready to blame most of their problems on the Republicans. Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House, is in no hurry to form a bipartisan coalition and shift the spotlight away from the President's budget, which is due next week. The Democrats reason that Mr. Reagan's plan for extensive cuts in domestic programs will prove wildly unpopular, and they want to make sure everybody knows about it. While Congress seems fixated on the budget issue, the President is likely to use his State of the Union message to re-emphasize his interest in overhauling the income tax code. A 1,400-page revision was adopted by the House late last year, and under pressure from the White House, the Senate Finance Committee is taking up the issue. The Senators show little enthusiasm for the project but see no way out of it. If a bill does finally clear the Senate, perhaps next summer, it is likely to be more favorable to business than the House version, and it could well include new revenues to help trim the deficit. International trade is another issue likely to crowd the Congressional agenda and cause problems with the Administration. Mr. Reagan believes that sanctions against America's trading partners would invite retaliation and lead to a spiraling economic war. But many areas of the country are suffering from foreign imports, and Democrats see the issue as the best way to attack the Reagan economic record. Accordingly, Congress is likely to adopt some form of legislation that cracks down on unfair trade practices abroad. Among the items left over from last year is a rewriting of the immigration laws. A storm blew up around the issue last week as an Administration report asserted that restricting the flow of immigration would impose heavy burdens on the economy. At week's end, however, the White House said it still wanted Congress to deal with the issue this year. After five years of the Reagan presidency, the legislative agenda of many conservatives also remains unfinished. Protesters demanding an end to legalized abortion crowded the capital last week. Mr. Reagan reiterated his support for their cause, but Congress seems in no mood to reverse the court decision that permitted women to terminate pregnancies. On the foreign policy front, White House officials said last week that Mr. Reagan would soon request $100 million in new aid to the insurgents fighting the Government of Nicaragua; more than half would be for military help, which is now banned by Congress. The White House hopes that repressive policies by Managua have switched Congressional sentiment in favor of military support, but Democratic leaders predicted that the House would still reject the measure. The Administration faces an even tougher battle if it tries to sell sophisticated new weapons to Jordan or to aid rebels fighting the Government of Angola.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On Language; Secs Appeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/magazine/on-language-secs-appeal.html,"DO YOU KNOW WHAT secular humanism is?'' asked Norman Lear a few months ago, subtly knocking the term in a letter to what he called ''a number of well-known educators, artists, and public officials like yourself.'' Myself, I prefer like you, and don't know exactly which direct-mail category applies to me, but I will try to illuminate and aggravate the controversy about the phrase. A spokesman for Mr. Lear's People for the American Way says, ''Trying to define secular humanism is like trying to nail Jell-O to a tree.'' (Good metaphor, often used; would the coiner step forward?) In making the point that the phrase has different meanings to different people, the organization sought to show that the phrase has no widely accepted meaning and thus did not belong in legislation. Definitions do vary. Secular humanism, to the evangelist James Kennedy, is a ''godless, atheistic, evolutionary, amoral, collectivist, socialistic, communistic religion'' posing a threat to schoolchildren. To Michael J. Rosenberg, editor of Near East Report, ''Secular humanist has become the new label employed to indict anyone who opposes school prayer, believes in evolution, or disagrees with the religious right's views on abortion.'' Roy R. Torcaso, an outspoken atheist who was plaintiff in the 1961 case in which the phrase was popularized and is still one of the few people who calls himself a secular humanist, cites the definition given by Corliss Lamont in his book ''The Philosophy of Humanism'': ''. . . joyous service for the greater good of all humanity in this natural world and advocating the methods of reason, science, and democracy.'' I would describe most secular humanists as ethical atheists who try to do good without believing in God. But that is not ''the'' definition, as many humanists are agnostics, and some who accept the label are churchgoers. No pop lexicographer can lay down the law on what the phrase means; I can only report what disputants say it means, and put forward a definition that encompasses its different senses. People in the word dodge can, however, trace the history of a term, and the etymon teaches us where the attacker or defender is coming from. (Not comes from, which means ''place of origin''; is coming from, which uses the present progressive is coming instead of the simple present comes to show continuing action, is colloquial English meaning ''the context or experience in which the speaker has reached his conclusion,'' and should prove useful enough in time to become Standard English.) (The preceding is a parenthetical remark.) (Both preceding parenthetical remarks constitute a tangent.) In 1984, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah wrote a paragraph in an education bill saying that Federal money for magnet schools may not be used ''for courses of instruction the substance of which is secular humanism.'' Last year, the United States Department of Education decided not to define the term, but to leave its definition up to local schools. That raised a further ruckus. Senator Hatch's spokesman explained the intent of the original phrase in the legislation was to make sure that magnet schools improve their curriculums and not get into ''soft stuff'' such as personal values or courses in life styles; the controversial phrase was dropped in the current legislation. The civil-liberties groups, and Mr. Lear, won this round. The phrase was probably taken from a footnote in the decision written in 1961 by Justice Hugo L. Black in Torcaso v. Watkins, which in turn was taken from an amicus brief in that case written by Joseph L. Blau, professor emeritus of religion at Columbia University. The footnote's point: ''Among religions in this country, however, which do not teach what would generally be considered belief in the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism and others.'' Go back further, to 1952, and an essay by C. Wright Mills: ''Liberals have repeatedly articulated a secular humanism, stressing the priceless value of the individual personality. . . .'' The first citation in Merriam-Webster's files is from a religious work in 1933, William G. Peck's ''The Social Implications of the Oxford Movement,'' in which secular humanism is opposed to Catholicism: ''In face of this secular humanism, the return of the Oxford leaders to Catholic doctrine and practice necessarily signified a criticism of the secular standpoint, and the provision of a positive alternative.'' If you have an earlier citation, join the fun. How does this etymology help us understand the furor raised by the phrase? Secular is an adjective that means ''worldly, not religious or other-worldly''; humanism is ''a concern for the human condition.'' The modifier secular emphasizes the nonreligious character of the fuzzy noun humanism. I think the phrase was construed by a growing number of clergymen, especially evangelicals, to be a euphemism for atheism. No doubt, a goodly number of secular humanists are atheists; to them, however, the phrase subsumed atheism in a much broader philosophy of ethical values stressing individualism, acting rightly unmotivated by the fear of God or promise of Heaven. That broadening made secular humanism an even more inviting target to preachers than atheism, because ''godlessness'' had been denounced so heatedly for so long. Here was a way to slam opposition to prayer in schools, to castigate sex education in schools, to blast abortion - all potent social issues - while mixing in disapproval of the drug culture, permissiveness, pornography, short skirts and live-in lovers, and tying all these in to a rejection of belief in God. The target was Heaven-sent, or heaven-sent, as you prefer. People who disagreed with many fervent religionists on one or more of the social issues but who firmly believed in God, resented being lumped in with atheists and all the others. They saw secular humanism as a linguistic bludgeon, a chance to beat over the head all who oppose ''the religious right'' with a club incorporating all the issues. That's what the fight over a phrase is about. Secular humanism may be defined as: 1. a philosophy of ethical behavior unrelated to a concept of God; 2. a characterization of an emphasis on individual moral choices as having the common denominator of atheism; 3. an attempt to besmear political opponents by impugning their faith in God. It's a bare-knuckles fight, and etymology, lexicography and semantics are right in the middle of it. Flakes Will Fall PRESIDENT REAGAN IN A news conference called the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi ''flaky.'' This is not one of your regular diplomatic terms of art, like intransigent; next day, from the highest levels of the White House came this urgent call: ''What is the derivation and current meaning of flaky?'' Frankly, I had been awaiting a different query: How come there is no u after the Q in Qaddafi? (Answer, on the back of my tongue: a Q without a u is intended to represent the velar sound of k.) Although Shakespeare used the adjective in ''Richard III'' to describe the breaking of dawn - ''and flaky darkness breaks within the east'' - the word, in its current slang meaning of ''off-beat, eccentric,'' was first reported by Leonard Koppett in The New York Times in 1964. Baseball players like Joe Pepitone, Jim Bouton and Phil Linz were said to be flaky. The term appears to have replaced kook as a synonym for ''nutty,'' although, as Mr. Reagan pointed out, it is not used to mean ''mentally deranged,'' a more serious affliction. It is sometimes spelled flakey, to insure pronunciation with a long a, to differentiate it from flak, an acronym for ''Flieger Abwehr Kanone,'' meaning ''criticism.'' The last time flaky was used politically was in derogation of Gov. Jerry Brown of California, who responded vigorously by denouncing those in favor of building bigger nuclear power plants: ''They are the flakes.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING; Let's Poll All the Lawyers,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/27/us/briefing-let-s-poll-all-the-lawyers.html,"The old political saw that the Supreme Court follows the election returns is probably a good deal less valid than the idea that the Justices' decisions reflect the views of most lawyers. As a result, there is considerable interest in how lawyers see the issues now before the High Court, enough interest so that the American Bar Association has engaged a public opinion research firm, Kane, Parsons & Associates of New York, to take the profession's pulse. For example, the Justices are now pondering two cases that impelled the Justice Department to propose a reversal of the decision in 1973 that recognized a constitutional right to abortion. The finding of one of the bar association's polls, published in its monthly magazine, was than 53 percent of American lawyers favor the original decision, 22 percent want it overruled, and 10 percent would modify it. In another case, the Administration is defending Federal regulations designed to force life-prolonging treatment for severely handicapped newborns over parental objections; the poll shows 57 percent of lawyers disagreeing with that position. The Court is also weighing the question of the obligation a criminal lawyer owes a client who says he plans to commit perjury. A forthcoming poll shows 71 percent favor the lawyer's withdrawal from the case, 17 percent would tell the client that the lawyer would disclose any perjury, and 7 percent would inform the judge after such perjury. The polls involve telephone interviews with a random sample of 600 lawyers around the country, regardless of membership in the association. The surveys and are subject to a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Contempt for Abortion, and Tolerance",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/27/opinion/contempt-for-abortion-and-tolerance.html,"Last week marked the 13th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, and Washington was once more the scene of the ''March for Life'' rally. The crowd was only half what it was last year, but the enthusiasm was the same - and so was the host. ''We will continue to work together with Congress,'' President Ronald Reagan told the crowd, ''to overturn the tragedy of Roe v. Wade.'' The Supreme Court decision does not endorse abortion; it leaves up to a woman and her doctor the choice to continue a pregnancy, at least during the first trimester. It allows some limitation on abortion in the second trimester and even greater limitation in the third. Nonetheless, many Americans oppose the decision, some so strenuously that they line the entrances to abortion clinics harassing and hissing the patients. Often, by letter and telephone, they threaten bombs and arson. Sometimes they follow through. The abortion argument didn't begin with Roe v. Wade, however. It has divided humankind for centuries, and probably always will. One side of the debate finds abortion a morally indefensible destruction of life; the other finds forcing a woman to incubate a fetus against her will an equally immoral invasion of her right to control her body. Roe v. Wade made clear that however passionate the debate, neither side has the superior moral claim. Instead, Justice Blackmun held that a woman's rights must be weighed against the fetus's growing potential for life. From this he reasoned that the state's interest in protecting life increases as the fetus grows closer to term. That profoundly humane effort to accommodate deep moral conflicts was in the finest American tradition of tolerance. Mr. Reagan's long opposition to abortion made predictable his welcome to the demonstrators, followed by his advice, quoted by a member of the National Right to Life Committee, that an end to violence would earn their movement ''a lot of brownie points.'' Surely millions of Americans hoped for something more from a President, especially one whose fondest promise was to get the Government off people's backs. This was, after all, the anniversary of a Supreme Court decision that gave practical voice not to abortion or to its foes but to tolerance and liberty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

REAGAN URGES CONSERVATIVES TO UNITE AND PRESS AGENDA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/31/us/reagan-urges-conservatives-to-unite-and-press-agenda.html,"President Reagan urged conservatives tonight to press ahead with their agenda of domestic and foreign policy issues, saying ''the tide of history is all but irreversibily turned our way.'' But he warned that conservatives could face a ''costly tactical defeat'' in this year's Congressional elections unless they pull together. Speaking before the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Reagan said conservatives should thrust their issues to the front of this year's political debate. Mr. Reagan said, ''We must tell the American people that the progress we made thus far is not enough; that it will never be enough until the conservative agenda is enacted, and that means enterprise zones, prayer in the public schools and the protection of the unborn.'' Meese on States' Rights Speaking before the same conference earlier today, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said true conservatives should support the rights of the states to pass liberal abortion laws, restrict sales of pistols or take other steps that are opposed by the Reagan Administration and many of its supporters. Mr. Reagan, echoing many of the themes of his 1984 Presidential campaign, said the outcome of this year's Congressional elections ''will decide whether the days of high taxes and higher spending, the days of economic stagflation and skyrocketing inflation, the days of national malaise and international humiliation, the days of 'Blame America First' and 'inordinate fear of communism,' will all come roaring back at us once again.'' The President said liberal Democrats knew that unless they delivered ''a telling blow'' against Republicans in November, the 1988 Presidential race will be dominated by conservatives in both parties. Liberals 'Hiding' and 'Waiting' ''My fellow conservatives,'' he added, ''let's get the message out loud and clear: The Washington liberals and the San Francisco Democrats aren't extinct - they're just in hiding, waiting for another try.'' Many of the conservatives in the audience were among Mr. Reagan's earliest and most zealous supporters in his long campaign for the White House. While celebrating his Presidency, they will spend much of their time here looking over most of the potential Republican candidates who will be bidding to succeed Mr. Reagan. In the next two days the conference will hear from Vice President Bush, Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate majority leader, and former Gov. Pierre S. du Pont 4th of Delaware. Mr. Bush is scheduled to speak Friday night at the conference's dinner honoring Jonas Savimbi, the leader of rebel forces fighting to overthrow the Marxist government of Angola. Conservatives have made American support for Mr. Savimbi one of their principal foreign policy battles. Although Mr. Reagan has publicly suggested channeling covert aid to Mr. Savimbi's forces, many conservatives are unhappy with the position Secretary of State George P. Shultz has taken against openly providing any financial assistance to the rebels. Baker Shuns 'Cattle Show' The only prospective Republican Presidential candidate missing from the conference program is Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the former Senate majority leader. David Spear, a spokesman for Mr. Baker, said the former Senator had declined an invitation to speak because he was scheduled to be traveling in the Middle East. The trip was subsequently canceled. He said Mr. Baker would be making his case for conservative support, but added, ''We're not going to partake of every cattle show that comes down the pike.'' In his address, Mr. Meese said issues of ''public or civic morality,'' such as abortion, were best decided by the states. ''The toughest political problems deserve to have full and open debate,'' he said. ''Whether the issue is abortion, pornography or aid to parochial schools, there is no constitutionally explicit reason why people within the several states may not deliberate over them and reach a consensual judgment.'' ''What this means, to put it bluntly, is that federalism would allow states the freedom to make choices which we as conservatives may very well disagree with. For example,'' Mr. Meese continued, ''federalism properly understood means that states or localities may ban handguns. Also, they may ban pornography, as Minneapolis recently tried to do. ''Or they may enact liberal abortion laws that even go beyond Roe v. Wade,'' he said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. Two Pending Court Cases The Justice Department has urged the High Court in two pending cases to overrule that decision and rule that states have the power to regulate or prohibit abortion. That was consistent with what Mr. Meese said today, but his speech marked the first time that he has explicitly endorsed the rights of states to enact liberal abortion laws. By the same token, the Attorney General seemed to be asserting the right of states to restrict abortion, prosecute pornography or remove restrictions on the sale of pistols, according to the wishes of the state's citizens and independent of Federal authority. Mr. Meese also elaborated on the implications of one of the most fundamental political themes of the Reagan Presidency, the call for a substantially smaller Federal Government. ''The objective is not simply less government overall, although that may happen, but less government at the national level,'' he said. ''The happy result will be better government at the state and local levels, levels where the government is closer to the people.'' Limits to State Power Noted The Attorney General acknowledged that the power of states was not unlimited, noting, for example, that they cannot invalidate contracts, coin money or discriminate on the basis of race. But he said that beyond these limits, the Constitution granted states broad authority. ''To deny the right of people to choose certain substantive ends,'' he said, ''is not to deny them the right to choose any substantive ends.'' Mr. Meese said he expected that his speech would irritate many people, even some conservatives. ''To argue for federalism as one of our most basic constitutional principles surely will not please everyone,'' he said, ''not even all conservatives.'' But he said ''true conservatism'' was more a dedication to a set of processes of constitutional government than an endorsement of a particular set of positions on government policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESSAY; Go For It, Henry",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/opinion/essay-go-for-it-henry.html,"This is the year in which famous people have been saying ''not me.'' Jeane Kirkpatrick was too busy to take the nomination for the Maryland Senate seat held by the departing Charles Mathias, and Geraldine Ferraro could not bear the abuse in store if she ran against Alfonse D'Amato for the Senate in New York. Ted Kennedy, despite a plea in this space to remain in contention for the Presidential nomination and thereby make the world safe for conservatism, decided not to let the media kick him around anymore. Comes now Henry Kissinger, who is thinking out loud about running against Mario Cuomo this year for governor of New York. As one long wired in to Henry the K, not always voluntarily, let me read the questions on his mind and suggest answers. Wouldn't I be sure to lose, and wouldn't that make me a laughingstock? You would enter the race so far behind in the polls as to make the quest seem ludicrous. National columnists have hooted with derision and news magazine bureau chiefs pronounced your candidacy ''ridiculous.'' Perfect. Release the polls showing the gap enormous, the race seemingly unwinnable, the naive amateur against the experienced political pro. Then run an underdog campaign; the gap will surely close. If you lose, you will have astounded one and all with the respectability of your showing against an overwhelming favorite, and it will be a valuable learning experience for you. If you win - but more about that later. My life has been foreign affairs, national security; although New York does have a long border with Canada, will my experience seem not germane to the job of governor? You worked for Governor Rockefeller and so did your wife; his lifelong interest in foreign affairs did not hamper his effective running of the state government. You could get briefed on sewers and subways and budgets in a hurry, but that is not what campaigns are really about: Voter issues are capital punishment and abortion, education aid and economic development, and you could argue those intelligently on television from day one of the campaign. Besides, why shouldn't the governor of a great state have a say on national policies affecting war and peace? But what would be my conceptual framework, the credible strategy that would attract major contributors? You will be the only candidate running for the job of governor. Mario Cuomo will be running for the title of governor, but everybody knows he would immediately start running for the nomination for President, and a national candidacy is a full-time job. If you do not know every jot and tittle about state bond rates, at least you would be there at the governor's desk in Albany to find out; your opponent would be an absentee governor for the first two years even if he is not nominated, and gone for the entire term if he wins. Thus, the choice for the voters is not Cuomo or you, but you and the nonentity he puts up for lieutenant governor. (And he pushed out the last lieutenant governor - the job is vacant, and nobody notices.) Only if Mario Cuomo panics will he agree to an iron-clad pledge to serve his term - and then you can exploit that panic. But you're right to ask about the money: If New York Republicans cannot come up with a $5 million campaign chest, they're not serious - tell them to forget it. But I'd really like to be Secretary of State - would I enjoy being governor? You bet you would. Forget the trappings, the planes and state troopers and vast staff, and raise your sights: Because a defect in the Constitution discriminates against naturalized Americans, governor is the highest elective post to which an immigrant can aspire. Your candidacy would trigger the movement to amend the Constitution and eliminate that inequality. And elective power is real power, not dependent on princes' favors. If you knock off the Cuomo threat, Gary Hart is the Democratic nominee; that's what terrifies your liberal friends. You would go to the Republican convention as kingmaker - not, as in 1980, to attempt a coup behind Jerry Ford and to be shut out by Reagan. Jack Kemp will labor mightily to get votes for you this year in Buffalo; George Bush would promise you Secretary of State. Ignore the counsels of fainthearted friends and nail-nibbling liberals, Henry; scorn this year's ''not me'' trend, read Shakespeare's ''Coriolanus'' for advice on how to be a candidate, and - go for it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ending Medicaid for Abortion Punishes the Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/opinion/l-ending-medicaid-for-abortion-punishes-the-poor-999086.html,"To the Editor: The petition drive to end Medicaid funds for abortion that has been undertaken by the Roman Catholic dioceses of New York creates political pressure to which New York State's elected officials should not, and cannot constitutionally, succumb. Described by Cardinal O'Connor as an effort to persuade legislators to ''put an end to the slaughter of humans,'' the move to exclude abortion selectively from the Medicaid program represents an attempt to impose one religious viewpoint on everyone. As a practical matter, the effort to delete abortion from Medicaid amounts to an attack on poor women. For the issue is not whether abortions will be performed at all; the constitutional right to choose abortion over childbirth, established in 1973, cannot be overturned by our State Legislature. The only question is whether the poor - and the poor alone - will be able to exercise that right. Since Medicaid covers the expenses of childbirth, a cutoff of funds for abortion would push many poverty-stricken women to have children even if they are unprepared or unable to undertake the added parental responsibilities. A cutoff of Medicaid funds for abortion would be antithetical to the humanitarian tradition that has characterized New York State. Indeed, it might, for this reason, violate our State Constitution, which prohibits the state from categorically denying assistance (such as Medicaid) for criteria that do not relate to the financial ''neediness'' of the individual. All women, rich and poor, deserve the freedom to choose for themselves whether or not to bear a child. Concession to the church on this matter would offend the mandate of governmental neutrality on the ''morality'' of abortion, which is at the heart of the constitutional guarantee of choice. And it would do so in a particularly offensive way - by selectively penalizing the poor.

RISE IN COCAINE ABUSE POSES THREAT TO INFANTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/nyregion/rise-in-cocaine-abuse-poses-threat-to-infants.html,"In the special care nursery at the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, a 3-week-old girl squalled and twitched, her cries fitful and her limbs stiff. Lifted from the crib by Dr. Jing Yoon, the child failed to settle into the warm folds of an adult embrace - a sure sign, the doctor said, of cocaine withdrawal. In Dr. Yoon's nursery one recent afternoon eight babies were withdrawing from drugs, seven of them born to women who said they had used cocaine either alone or in combination with other toxic substances. These mothers are among the two million women who, experts estimate, regularly use cocaine. Physicians fear that many women underestimate the dangers of cocaine, and that their babies, like those of the heroin addicts who preceded them, will suffer developmental and neurological problems. Brain Damage Feared ''It's a very important problem that needs to be described so people in the streets know it and refrain from doing it,'' said Dr. Herman Mendez, a pediatrician at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn who recently saw two cocaine-affected babies with such protracted tremors that he assumed they would have ''long-lasting brain dysfunction.'' ''Our greatest concern is that cocaine use somehow affects the fetal nervous system and may lead to long-term deficiencies we have yet to define,'' said Dr. Arnold M. Washton, the director of addiction research and treatment at Regent Hospital on East 61st Street in Manhattan and Stony Lodge Hospital in Ossining, N.Y. ''I'm afraid these children will show up disproportionately in the ranks of the learning disabled.'' Poor Are Mainly Affected While cocaine is generally considered the drug favored by middle-class and wealthy abusers, doctors who treat both rich and poor say the babies of the poor seem disproportionately affected. The doctors believe that well-to-do, educated women are more likely to understand the risk of cocaine abuse in pregancy and to discontinue its use, just as they more often stop smoking or drinking during pregnancy. ''Affluent people are incredibly caught up in being healthy during pregnancy,'' said Dr. Bruce Greenwald, who sees patients from across the economic spectrum as chief pediatric resident at the municipal Bellevue Hospital Center and the New York University Medical Center, a voluntary hospital. Disagreement Over Symptoms Doctors who treat the babies of addicts disagree about the precise effects of cocaine. Some report symptoms peculiar to this drug, while others say the effects are like those of heroin or methadone in babies. In describing the difficulty of isolating the effects of cocaine, these doctors note that babies are rarely exposed to just one toxic substance, since few cocaine abusers limit themselves to one drug. But despite this confusion, the doctors are unanimous in their belief that more and more pregnant women are exposing their unborn children to a dangerous drug that they do not seem to take as seriously as heroin. 'The Myth of This Drug' ''The traditional assumption among women using cocaine is that it's short-acting and doesn't get to the fetus,'' Dr. Washton said. ''That is part and parcel of the myth of this drug - that it is not addictive and not harmful to the body.'' At the nursery at Bronx-Lebanon, Dr. Yoon characterizes withdrawing infants by the drug their mothers say they have taken. In 1982, 24 percent reported that their babies had been year that figure had soared to 74 percent. Such data, however, seems unreliable to Dr. Yoon, who said that women admitted abuse of cocaine more readily than heroin. ''They think cocaine is benign, so they tell us,'' she said. ''They don't tell us the other things because they're afraid we'll take their babies away from them.'' ''Let's put it sociologically,'' said Dr. Lorraine Hale, executive director of Hale House in Harlem, a home for the children of addicts. ''Heroin is considered a black drug, and therefore it's bad. Cocaine is considered a white drug, so the perception is it can't be bad for you.'' It is in the clinics and wards of public hospitals that doctors most frequently treat withdrawing babies, who are jittery, cranky and unresponsive. ''We call this under control, barely,'' said Dr. Yoon at Bronx-Lebanon as she held the 3-week-old baby.''All of them go through at least this. She's beautiful, right? How dare mothers give them this trouble!'' Dr. Yoon treats the babies with decreasing doses of phenobarbitol, while other doctors use Valium or tincture of opium. Even if medication is not necessary, or after it is discontinued, the babies remain intolerant to cuddling, inattentive to cooing and have difficulty making eye contact. At Hale House, for instance, a 10-month-old boy and a 7-month-old girl - both the children of cocaine abusers - recently were not responding to Clara Hale, the 80-year-old founder, or to her daughter, Dr. Hale. ''There's kind of a coldness,'' Dr. Hale said, tickling the chin of the baby girl but failing to coax a smile. The doctors, despite disagreements and a dearth of controlled studies, report a variety of other problems. The most commonly cited difficulties during pregnancy are early onset of labor and frequent miscarriage caused by a sudden separation of the placenta. After birth, many doctors report high infant mortality, low birth weight and behavioral problems. Doctors speculate that all of these problems are caused by cocaine's constriction of the mother's blood vessels, which deprives the fetus of oxygen and makes the drug more damaging to the central nervous system than heroin or other opiates. Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff of the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago is the author of a study recently reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that involved only 23 women but is generally considered the most controlled research to date. Dr. Chasnoff did not note low birth weights, findings reported by both Dr. Nesrin Bingol at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx and Dr. Loretta P. Finnegan at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. He did, however, report one case of suspected sudden infant death syndrome, one baby who had suffered a paralyzing stroke while in his mother's uterus and one case of severe malformation of the kidney and genito-urinary tract in an infant whose mother had taken a heavy dose of cocaine in the fifth week of pregnancy. Several of the dozen doctors interviewed also report parental behavior among cocaine users that is completely unlike that associated with heroin, which depresses rather than stimulates the nervous system. Dr. Hale, for one, said mothers who use cocaine were more likely to abandon their babies or to be obstreperous when visiting them. Six months ago, she said, Hale House was forced to change ''our whole style of operation,'' denying parents the right to visit children at the brownstone at 154 West 122d Street. Some doctors say they are troubled about what to tell women who used cocaine during the early weeks of pregancy when they were unaware they were pregnant. Dr. Washton said he answered women directly. ''I tell them what what I'd tell my daughter if she was old enough to get pregnant,'' he said. ''Yes, have an abortion, because if you've used cocaine during the first trimester, you're playing Russian roulette.'' At a cocaine abuse clinic at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Dr. Jeffrey S. Rosecan responded more cautiously. ''We run a fine line here,'' he said. ''I don't want to take a 'reefer madness' tack and exaggerate, because women will have unnecessary abortions. At the same time, I don't think we should be too cavalier.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIBYA'S WOMEN: ERA OF CHANGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/style/libya-s-women-era-of-change.html,"Fawzia Abdullah is a 21-year-old first lieutenant at the Women's Military Academy, an extraordinary institution in the Arab world. Like most of her male counterparts, she has been trained to fire Russian-made surface-to-air missiles, to dismantle and reassemble Kalashnikov rifles in less than a minute and to handle recoilless antiaircraft guns. She also plays the bagpipes in the marching band. Her makeup is impeccable, her short fingernails painted with bright crimson polish. She wears fishnet stockings under medium-high-heeled miniboots, and solid gold-drop earrings offset her jet black hair. Her goal, she says, is to win an extra star and become a captain in the Libyan Army, which no Libyan woman has yet accomplished. But, she added with a giggle, ''I would also really like to get married.'' Some things have not changed in revolutionary Libya. Symbol and Reality The military academy - which has trained 7,000 women since its opening in 1978 - is the most prominent symbol of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's drive to make women and men equal, but women in Libya, as elsewhere, remain vastly underrepresented at the top of virtually every part of society. Most women here are still housewives and mothers; few hold prominent jobs in politics or finance. At the same time, Colonel Qaddafi has made considerable strides in improving the status of women in his country and has challenged many of the laws and traditions that have held women back in Arab countries, according to Libyans and other Arab and Western residents here. Women have won considerable rights since Colonel Qaddafi and a small group of junior officers overthrew the monarchy of King Idris in an almost bloodless military coup over 16 years ago. Gains in Education For example, Goverment statistics show a fivefold increase in the number of women enrolled in universities, although male students still outnumber the women three-to-one. Girls and boys now attend primary and preparatory schools in roughly equal numbers. Child brides have been banned, and the minimum legal age for marriage has been set at 18. Women and men now have roughly comparable rights in demanding a divorce. Colonel Qaddafi is pressing the Basic People's Congresses, the units through which Libyans theoretically run their own affairs, to discourage polygamy, which is tolerated by most Arab Islamic countries, by limiting each family to one home. ''These are all radical changes in Arab societies,'' Colonel Qaddafi asserted in a recent interview. Diplomats, Libyans and Western residents say, however, that resistance to such changes remains stubborn in this tribal, male-dominated and highly patriarchal society. ''It's going to take a very long time to change people's ideas,'' said Khadijal el-Jahmy, a former teacher, journalist, Libya's first female newscaster and magazine publisher and a leading and ardent feminist. Like many Libyan women, Mrs. Jahmy, who is 65, could still be considered traditional in a Western sense. She believes strongly that a woman's primary role in life is as a wife, homemaker and mother, she said, and that education makes women more productive and effective in these tasks. To this day, women are vastly underrepresented in the People's Congresses, the cornerstone of Colonel Qaddafi's ''state of the masses,'' and in the General People's Congress, the higher decision-making body to which delegates are elected. In fact, there are no women in a position of authority in this nation of 3.5 million people, half of them women. Colonel Qaddafi's wife, Safiya, shares the disdain of many Libyan women for politics. Halfway through a recent long interview in which Colonel Qaddafi was elaborating on his political views and foreign policy, she grew visibly bored and left the room. But she was not given much chance to participate. Her husband answered almost every question directed in English or Arabic to his wife. A student nurse and only 15 years old when she met the young leader of the revolution in a hospital where he was recovering from appendicitis, Mrs. Qaddafi chose to pursue the traditional Libyan woman's role of wife and homemaker rather than her nursing career. With seven children, she has time for little else, she said. Colonel Qaddafi, on the other hand, wants his children, especially his only daughter, Aisha, to become doctors and perpetuators of his revolution. The Libyan leader has faced the stiffest resistance of all to his vision of mobilizing every woman, as well as men, in the defense of the country. Libyans have been openly hostile to mandatory military training for high school girls and to the military academies in particular. ''Libyans simply don't want their daughters running around in pants and toting AK-47 rifles,'' one diplomat said. Many Libyan families have even refused to send their daughters to high school to avoid compulsory military training, he said. A Religious Obstacle Another source of resistance to the colonel's revolutionary ideas about the status of women is Islam. Many Libyans, still a deeply religious people, believe that women must cover their heads for modesty as required by the Koran and be subservient to the heads of their households. Even Colonel Qaddafi has been wary of challenging the conservative sexual mores of his people, rooted partly in their interpretation of Islam. Adultery in Libya is punishable by public flogging. An unwed mother is sent to prison if the father of her child refuses to marry her. Abortion is illegal and contraception discouraged. ''We need more children in this vast country,'' Mrs. Jahmy asserted, vehemently defending restrictions on a woman's control of her body, which is a hallmark of the feminist struggle in the Western world. Aggravated by repeated rebuffs from his traditional citizens, Colonel Qaddafi has focused most of his revolutionary proselytizing on the young. At many public appearances, he surrounds himself mainly with gun-toting female revolutionary guards. One Dedicated Activist ''He's just given up on the older folks,'' one Libyan asserted. ''But kids now 17 and under are far more malleable. They don't remember a life before the revolution.'' It is from the young that Colonel Qaddafi has formed his revolutionary committees and guards, an elite who constitute what he has dubbed the vanguard of the revolution. The colonel has come increasingly to depend on them as the hope for his Government, residents say. One such activist is Fatiya Zakkah, 32, the mother of three. She is an unpaid worker in Colonel Qaddafi's office. She was 15 when the revolution came, she said. Inspired by its goals and dreams, she joined the Arab Socialist Union at school, where she was noticed by Colonel Qaddafi, who asked her to work for him. She is totally devoted to Mr. Qaddafi, Arab socialism and the victory of ''progressive democracy.'' For her, there is no contradiction between Islam and the colonel's revolution. Although she does not cover her head, as do many Libyan women, even those of the military academy, she has made the haj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that every pious Moslem must make at least once. ''I dress modestly for Islam,'' she said. ''But I would willingly take off all my clothes and run naked into battle in defense of my country.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Defeat the Homosexual Rights Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/opinion/defeat-the-homosexual-rights-bill.html,"The homosexual rights bill under consideration in the New York City Council would be, if passed - and the chances are said to be good - a dangerous assault on our families and our values. America is experiencing a civil war, in which traditional morality is pitted against a rising tide of teen sex, prostitution, adultery and pornography. Leading the charge toward radical change and decadence are the homosexualists - advocates of special, protected, minority status for homosexuals. Some 75 American communities, including the state of Wisconsin, have passed sexual orientation ordinances similar to the New York bill: These are the first dominoes to fall, but all our values are at risk. Homosexuals claim that they need such laws to protect them from discrimination. I see little evidence that they are unfairly singled out. Their political clout, financial status, the coverage they receive in the media -all are better than average. In fact, now that the courts have decriminalized sodomy, discreet homosexuals are better protected than adulterers, who are still ''discriminated'' against by the law. Besides, homosexual activists want more than protective laws: They want society to accept their behavior as the social and moral equivalent of heterosexuality. They want legal recognition of same-sex marriages and sex education courses that teach that the homosexual life style is just as valid as the nuclear family. The American Civil Liberties Union of Los Angeles is already suing the Big Brother organization for not allowing overt homosexuals to counsel and befriend 6-year-old boys. Militants have already pressured the New York City Parks Department to display three life-size statues that celebrate homosexuality. Imagine, then, what might happen if we passed a homosexual rights bill. Religious and moral people must oppose this legislation, which can only pave the way for a general breakdown of family values and moral responsibility. It can only make it easier for everyone - not just homosexuals, but anyone who feels constrained by the rules that hold our families together - to say: ''If it feels good, we'll do it.'' Like pornography and abortion, if homosexuality becomes legal this year, it will become ''moral'' the next. This is, of course, exactly what the homosexual activists want. Just as liberal divorce laws and looser attitudes toward fidelity have encouraged adultery, so laws that remove the stigma of homosexuality will encourage sodomy. Just as homosexuality flourishes among prisoners, so it will flourish in society at large if we lift the taboos that protect our families. We will see increased experimentation with bisexual and homosexual life styles by young people and others who are suffering from psychosexual problems, insecurity and sexual identity problems. Like millions of Americans, I believe that homosexual activity is as unequivocably wrong as adultery -in all circumstances and without exception. I also believe that it is society's right to discriminate in the hiring of overt homosexuals - and open adulterers - in camps, schools, youth centers and anywhere else where it is part of the job to act as a role model for students, clients or even co-workers. The bill before the City Council denies us that right. If it were passed, a teacher who solicited homosexual sex could be fired, but not a gym instructor who discussed his sexual ideology or love life with his students - something that homosexuals, looking for social acceptance, are surely more apt to do than heterosexuals. Proponents of the bill say that it is not a form of affirmative action. In fact, it would prohibit quotas, which are probably unconstitutional anyway, but not ''goals and timetables,'' which are surely just as dangerous. Supporters also make much of the fact that the bill would not require religious institutions to hire homosexuals. In fact, such institutions are already constitutionally excluded from civil rights legislation, But why should only ''corporate religions'' be exempt from the law, while religious people outside the church are not? If I can't tell a militant homosexual to keep his sexual practices in the bedroom, he certainly cannot force me to keep my religion in the synogogue. Homosexuality, a moral wrong, cannot be the basis of a civil right. Society doesn't make allowances for alcoholics, murderers or rapists, even if they are biologically predisposed to do what they do. Why should we have to lower standards for homosexuals?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"POVERTY'S CHILDREN IN CHESTER, PA.",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/movies/poverty-s-children-in-chester-pa.html,"IT is not a cheerful subject but it is there - poverty in America, a poverty that causes malnutrition and diseases of the body and mind. ''Growing Up Poor,'' this week's edition of ''Frontline'' (tonight at 10 on WNET/Channel 13), delivers the story in a strong documentary style. The scene is Chester, Pa., a half-dead city that once flourished with smokestack industries. When the big companies departed, they left behind unemployment and public welfare as a way of life. In the past, ''Frontline,'' produced by David Fanning and Edward Gray, reported on how joblessness and abortion clinics affected adults in Chester. This time, Mark Obenhaus, the director and senior producer, returned to Chester to report on how the cycle of poverty affected those least able to do anything about it - infants and children and unmarried mothers. With the exception of one couple -high-school dropouts with a child to care for - fathers are missing in the film. It would have been interesting for the producers of ''Frontline'' to track them down, or say that they tried to. What we do see is a grandmother, abandoned herself, living with her husbandless daughter and a child that suffers from what a visiting nurse describes as ''malnourishment.'' A visiting nurse on the program opens up a kitchen cabinet and finds only spaghetti and cans of beans. One mother smiles and says that she eats ''ice cream, candy bars and potato chips.'' Before the Thursday when the welfare check arrives, infants have little to sustain them. Nobody has learned to budget for one week. The heroines of the program are the nurses, caseworkers and other counselors who provide the help and affection missing in these households. A teen-age mother has to be taught how to use a thermometer. In the most telling line on the program, a visiting nurse says: ''You can't teach maturity.'' The pattern of poverty, semiliteracy and welfare is fixed from one generation to the next. Physical and alcoholic abuse are major causes of family troubles. A teen-age child wears braces on her teeth while looking in bewilderment at her child. A caseworker says that the babies giving birth to babies find this the only way to be wanted and loved. The lack of mental health and pediatric health is linked - for mothers and children. Judy Woodruff, the program's host, gives the startling statistics: ''In this, the wealthiest nation, almost one out of four of our children lives in poverty, approximately 14 million - an increase of over 50 percent in the past 10 years. One-half live in families without fathers and race is a factor -nearly one-half of all black children and one-third of all Hispanic children are poor.'' Miss Woodruff points out that the elderly can lobby and vote, and therefore have been less affected by cuts in social programs, but ''children cannot lobby for themselves, and our society may have left its children the most vulnerable and unprotected.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Advertising; A Citicorp Account To Smith,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/business/advertising-a-citicorp-account-to-smith.html,"SMITH/GREENLAND, facing a field of nine competitors, has emerged victorious to become agency for the worldwide operation of the Citicorp Investment Bank. The ''multimillion-dollar'' assignment was formerly with Homer & Durham, which was in the competition and which remains agency for another Citicorp assignment. Elizabeth Allen, vice president and director of marketing communications for Citicorp Investment Bank, was at the agency yesterday and said two of its accomplishments had really been crucial in deciding to include it in the race. Those two factors were the agency's consumer research into the differences between the drinkers of Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch and the more expensive Johnnie Walker Black and the ad that Smith/Greenland did for Planned Parenthood of New York explaining abortion to men. The Johnnie Walker work showed the agency's strength in research, she said. A friend, who first brought Smith/Greenland to Mrs. Allen's attention, told her it was one of the most interesting things he's seen in a long time. As for advertising creativity, the Planned Parenthood ad impressed Mrs. Allen with the clarity with which it explained complex issues. ''Investment banking and family planning, they both have practical and emotional elements,'' she said, noting that any agency that can make the abortion issue clear can do the same for investment banking. ''This agency,'' she said, ''does gutsy but appropriate advertising. Citicorp is gutsy, and we want to take some risks.'' Leo Greenland, chairman and chief executive of the agency, contributed the objectives of the agency's advertising: * ''To position the bank as a leader in global investment.'' * ''Highlight its unique products and services on a local and worldwide basis.'' * ''Demonstrate Citicorp's leadership and innovation in many areas.'' * ''Take advantage in advertising of the good qualities of Citicorp people.'' Smith/Greenland's assignment will be to create both an image campaign, which is Mrs. Allen's sphere of influence, and product advertising, both to be used worldwide. Citicorp Investment Bank has its own representatives in about 40 countries and can be served by Citibank people in at least 50 more. The advertising that Smith/Greenland does will be used in domestic and international publications, while the advertising it creates will be copied locally in different countries for form and content. As far as image advertising goes, Mrs. Allen knows what she wants. Her goal is a campaign that captures the personality of Citicorp Investment Banking and does it as well as Morgan Stanley's corporate advertising captures that firm's personality. However, it may be 1987 before she gets to see such material from Smith/Greenland. Before anything goes on paper, the agency team headed by Bert Rosenberg, executive vice president, management supervisor, must digest all the material Mrs. Allen is giving them about the unit's far-flung activities. And while the agency is doing that, the Citicorp Investment Bank will continue to use the ''global edge'' campaign from Homer & Durham, which has been using traditional customers of investment bankers to illustrate the services of Citicorp. That campaign has been running in The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and, occasionally, in The International Herald Tribune, while its domestic magazine schedule called for four-color bleed ads in Business Week, Forbes and Institutional Investor, all aimed at reaching a target audience of chief executive officers and chief financial officers. ''I would love to get into television,'' Mrs. Allen said, ''but it's perceived to be too expensive. And my charter is image advertising for the investment bank worldwide.'' However, the book is still open. The direction the future advertising takes is largely dependent on the research by the agency and its recommendations. Why, Mrs. Allen even wants the agency to look into the value of the time-honored tombstone ad and discern whether or not people are really reading them and if the bank might do better with a different format. ''One of the things I like about Smith/Greenland,'' Mrs. Allen said, ''they don't come in with a preconceived notion about what is right in business-to-business financial services advertising.'' Unlike Homer & Durham, which continues as agency for Citibank Industrial Credit, Smith/Greenland will be doing some tombstone work but will not totally replace Albert Frank-Guenther Law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Morality Test for South Africa's Opposition,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/opinion/a-morality-test-for-south-africas-opposition.html,"To earn popular support in America, third world resistance leaders must pass a kind of test. They must offer some reasonable prospect that their triumph will lead to a humane, democratic regime - and not a greater despotism. As they plead for greater support from the West in the form of sanctions, the leaders of the South African opposition now face precisely that challenge. Boiled down to one question, the test is: Will you hold honest free elections? As evidence, resistance leaders should be ready to reject, actively and explicitly, extremists of the right or left who do not share their democratic commitment. That is why South African Bishop Desmond M. Tutu's recent American tour was such a disappointment. True, some useful publicity was generated, a commodity in short supply since the South African Government imposed strict limits on the Western media. Even an oft-told story deserves retelling when it's as cruel as apartheid. But few Americans oppose sanctions against South Africa because they are uninformed about, or numb to, apartheid. In fact, few Americans oppose sanctions: Even President Reagan, Representative Jack Kemp and columnist William Safire approve of some, limited measures. The stakes in the debate have changed. The issue in South Africa is not whether the forces opposed to apartheid will triumph. They will, as Bishop Tutu confidently asserts. The question is, which forces - a broad, democratic opposition or a small clique of undemocratic Marx-ists, willing to ape apartheid's ruthlessness? The undemocratic forces within the resistance pose a clear threat. Several leaders of the African National Congress are avowed Marxists who may well prefer class war to balloting. Their numbers are small, but then so are those of many Marxist groups that have nevertheless managed to seize control of what were once democratic movements. Much of the African National Congress's money is raised in America and Europe. Here in the United States this month, Bishop Tutu solicited funds for the African National Congress with leaflets extolling such ''freedom fighters'' as Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua. Bishop Tutu himself warns that if economic pressure is not applied to the apartheid Government soon, South African blacks' resentment may bubble over and give tyrants of the left a chance to seize control. His American supporters echo these prophecies. If cited as a possibility by so many longtime opponents of apartheid, the danger of a Marxist dictatorship must be something other than right-wing fantasy. Yet this month, in a long speech at Stanford University, and in similar addresses at Atlanta and across the country, Bishop Tutu offered no plans for dealing with this danger. In fact, he scarcely referred to it, dismissing such concerns as evasion of the ''real issue.'' In Atlanta, he chided Americans for being so late to recognize that South Africa has a succession problem - and he suggested that the reason might be our ill motives. Asked what sort of government should follow apartheid, the Bishop said that South Africa's ''legitimate leaders'' would have to get together and do some ''horse-trading.'' In other words, the Bishop's attitude, and that of his American supporters, has been to take offense if one so much as raises the question of undemocratic infiltrators within their movement. ''You are either for us or against us,'' Bishop Tutu told his campus audience. An important issue is thus treated with contempt. Other freedom fighters - the contras in Nicaragua, the opposition in Cambodia and the Government of El Salvador - have had to answer similarly difficult questions, and to purge some of their own ranks, in order to win increased American aid. Indeed, all three of these groups are still on a sort of moral probation in the United States. Even if they find it demeaning, freedom fighters looking for American support are wise to answer such concerns. In her campaign against Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, Corazon A. Aquino has confronted head-on charges that her party is riddled with Communists. She has benefited, projecting an image of confidence and putting the Marxists on notice that only democrats are welcome in her opposition. To ask for similar signals from apartheid's opponents is not to demean them. It is the essence of democracy. In the same way, we expected, say, the Democrats to denounce student hecklers who would not allow the former chief delegate to the United Nations, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, to speak at their college, and we expected Ronald Reagan to swiftly chastise fanatics who bombed an abortion clinic in the name of human life. In a like way, Bishop Tutu and his supporters should denounce non-democrats in the African National Congress - should denounce them loudly and by name. Instead, they have skirted the issue. Apartheid's opponents have made it difficult for people like Ronald Reagan and George Bush to support them, impugning the Administration's motives for applying sanctions (much tougher than any from Europe) and for sending Mr. Bush to Atlanta when Bishop Tutu was hon-ored there recently. Apartheid's opponents should make it easy, not hard, for late-comers to jump on the bandwagon. If they do not, they will betray those of us in the United States who have broken ranks with our own party to support them. To date, that support, by a handful of House Republicans and newspaper columnists, has rested mainly on hope - a gamble that leaders like Desmond Tutu will not allow the recent white dictatorship to be replaced by a black one. If, on the other hand, Bishop Tutu and others can make some hard choices about membership in their own movement, our faith will be justified. And the apartheid opposition will tap into something strong: a moral consensus, on the part of a powerful and generous people, that South Africa's freedom fighters deserve our support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION BATTLE SHIFTS TO AID FOR FAMILY PLANNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/05/us/abortion-battle-shifts-to-aid-for-family-planning.html,"Abortion has been a flashpoint in American politics, often dominating elections and polarizing debate over domestic programs. In recent years, however, activists in the fight against legal abortion have increasingly turned their attention to a new front: United States Government assistance for family planning programs abroad. And they are winning significant victories, with population planning organizations saying they see a fundamental shift in Federal policy. Over the last 18 months, under lobbying pressure by opponents of abortion, the United States has eliminated money for one major international population planning organization and sharply reduced money for another. In both instances, the abortion issue was central to the decision. But some anti-abortion activists are also focusing on the type of family planning services offered with United States support. The Agency for International Development has dramatically increased its spending on birth control that relys on periodic abstinence from sexual intercourse. Rule Was Overturned Last year, in a move strongly supported by some Roman Catholic activists, the agency also tried, unsuccessfully, to change its rules so that counselors on this form of family planning could receive Federal money without having to give their clients information or referals on other forms of birth control. That rule change was later overturned by Congress. International population planning programs ''are now being questioned, and they must be defended in a way their proponents didn't have to 10 years ago,'' said Robert G. Marshall of the American Life League. Advocates of population control see things in a considerably different light. ''We're seeing what I would consider a reprehensible retreat from reality by the present Administration,'' said Werner Fornos, president of the Population Institute. At a time when many developing countries are most eager for population assistance, Mr. Fornos added, the United States is ''crippling'' some of the organizations best able to provide it. Mr. Fornos and others also assert that these recent developments may be only the first round in a battle over Government support of artificial contraception. They Deny 'Smokescreen' Leaders of the largest anti-abortion organization reject the notion that the abortion issue is being used as a ''smokescreen'' to attack contraception programs. ''We think that's a scare tactic on their part,'' said Douglas Johnson, the legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee. Officials of that committee say they are trying to halt the ''exporting'' of abortion policies and practices to developing nations by groups that receive American money. They also say they are trying to keep the United States from supporting programs in countries that coerce abortion. But while the National Right to Life Committee takes no position on contraception, other elements of the anti-abortion movement do. For example, the American Life League, whose officials were among those who met with President Reagan last month, argues that the Federal Government should cease all assistance for contraception programs at home and abroad. ''We don't think the Government should fund these things - artificial means of birth control,'' said Mr. Marshall, director of research for the organization, based in Stafford, Va. ''They lend themselves to coercion and centralized control over family life.'' Agency Caught in Middle As these international population programs become entangled in the abortion debate, the Agency for International Development increasingly finds itself in the middle. The agency's administrator, M. Peter McPherson, argues that family planning programs help prevent abortion. Activists on both sides of the issue trace the agency's policy shift to the 1984 world population conference in Mexico City. The United States had barred the use of its money for abortion services abroad since 1973; at Mexico City, the Reagan Administration announced a new prohibition. Henceforth, no Federal money would be provided to private organizations operating abroad that ''perform or actively promote'' abortion, even if those services were paid for by other sources of money. As a result, the International Planned Parenthood Federation lost all Federal money last year, an amount estimated at $11.5 million, although affiliates that comply with the new abortion policy still receive money, according to A.I.D. U.N. Group Is Affected In the United States, private organizations that provide abortion services can still receive Federal money for family planning clinics, although the Federal dollars cannot be used for their abortion services. Last summer, anti-abortion activists won another victory on the international front, when Congress approved an amendment that banned all Federal aid for groups that ''support or participate in the management of'' Government population programs that coerce abortion or sterilization. That amendment, which stemmed from reports of coercion in China's population program, resulted in a $10 million cut in Federal aid for another major group, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. Chinese officials have denied repeatedly that their program includes coerced abortion or sterilization. Still at issue is whether that amendment will lead to a total withdrawal of United States support for the United Nations group this year. Anti-abortion activists and their supporters in Congress are calling for such a cutoff unless the group pulls out of China. Lobbying Imbalance Cited Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, a strong supporter of international population assistance, said she feared a steady erosion in support for family planning abroad. Those programs, she said, do not have ''a driving, immediate constituency'' on Capitol Hill, as opposed to the activists who oppose them. ''Everything's in serious danger'' with the deficit reduction law on the scene, she said. ''Foreign aid is never particularly popular, and if you have a domestic group that's lobbying hard, and Gramm-Rudman coming from the other side, it's very hard to figure out how you're going to sustain it.'' Mr. Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee said that if organizations ''persist in the linkage of abortion and contraception, they will suffer.'' ''If they're not engaged in abortion-related activities,'' he said, ''we don't care how much they get, because they're out of our purview.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BUSH STANDS BY ATTACK ON CUOMO BUT CONCEDES THAT IT WAS HARSH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/us/bush-stands-by-attack-on-cuomo-but-concedes-that-it-was-harsh.html,"Vice President Bush says he stands by ''the concept'' behind his recent attack on Governor Cuomo of New York, but he acknowledges that he should have chosen his words more carefully. And Mr. Bush's advisers say his political activities will be carefully managed in the coming months to avoid incidents that could reinforce the negative reactions that emerged from the Cuomo episode and other recent events. In an interview aboard Air Force Two on Wednesday as he flew to Alabama and Mississippi for a series of Republican fund-raising events, Mr. Bush said that he had been stung by the harsh reaction to some of his recent political statements. But he insisted that it had not damaged him politically, saying, ''This, too, shall pass.'' Cuomo Remark, Bush Reaction Last month Mr. Cuomo said in an interview that ethnic prejudice lay behind assertions some people had made that he, as an Italian-American, would have a hard time being elected President. Mr. Cuomo said he was tempted to run just to show that a person of his heritage could win. A few days later, at a dinner given by the Conservative Party of New York, Mr. Bush responded by accusing Mr. Cuomo of ''divisiveness,'' adding: ''He's telling us to ignore the millions of blacks, Jews, Irish, Italians, Latins and Poles who shattered the bonds of discrimination and built this great land.'' In the interview Wednesday, Mr. Bush said he was particularly ''surprised'' by the ferocity of the ''very personal'' attack on him in a syndicated newspaper column by George F. Will, a conservative commentator. Reacting to Mr. Bush's charge that Mr. Cuomo was trying to divide the country along ethnic lines, the columnist accused Mr. Bush of lying and called him a ''lapdog.'' 'I'm Responsible for What I Say' ''Nobody likes to be attacked in a very personal way, especially by someone he respects,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but I'm responsible for what I say, and all this speculation about why I said it has no relevance. Certainly the people who were there for the most part seemed to think it was all right. But did it turn out the way I wanted? Obviously, no.'' He added: ''I'm not going to spend a lot of time worrying about it. I'm sure we're going to take other shots, but you're talking about a guy who took on Ferraro and survived.'' He was referring to former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens, the 1984 Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, with whom Mr. Bush engaged in a sharp nationally televised debate. The 'Cop Killer' Issue Mr. Will called the Vice President's characterization of Mr. Cuomo's remarks not only ''gibberish'' but also ''a lie.'' The ''low point'' of Mr. Bush's performance, Mr. Will wrote, was his attempt to portray Mr. Cuomo as lenient toward ''cop killers'' for granting clemency to Gary McGivern, a convict who has served 18 years in prison for his involvement in the killing of a police officer. At the conservatives' dinner, Mr. Bush had said, ''Gov. Ronald Reagan kept cop killers in jail.'' Mr. Will suggested that Mr. Bush's combativeness toward Mr. Cuomo was a clumsy attempt to curry favor among party conservatives. He wrote: ''The unpleasant sound Bush is emitting as he traipses from one conservative gathering to another is a thin, tinny 'arf' - the sound of a lapdog.'' Mr. Bush said he did not understand why he was being accused of pandering to conservatives when he was doing no more than most other potential Presidential candidates appearing before conservative gatherings. He said that, with few exceptions, his remarks to these groups were no different from what he had been saying to other audiences around the country. Bush Sees Some Misconceptons ''I'm not being asked to give up anything or to forswear my values,'' said Mr. Bush. ''I can think of some evolution in my views over the years, but I don't think there have been any radical shifts.'' Mr. Bush said some conservatives, including the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who has already endorsed him for President, may have ''misconceptions'' about some of his views. For example, he said not all conservatives liked his position on abortion. Unlike some people in the anti-abortion movement, Mr. Bush said he does not oppose abortion when pregnancy results from rape or incest or the mother's life is in danger. And he said he would never be a part of what he called ''the absolutely outrageous'' effort by some conservatives to make a political ''litmus test'' of their hostility toward Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Asked in the interview why he had made the attack on Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Bush responded: ''I think the speech spoke for itself. I think the whole concept of opportunity for everybody is what I was trying to say in one reference, and that we are concerned about the victims of crime and less concerned about those who commit crimes was the other point.'' Mr. Bush said he had ''no regrets'' about ''the concept'' of his speech, but he added, ''Maybe a better choice of words, I can't argue with that, but the whole theme, no, I stand by that. I thought it was a good way to focus on the strong beliefs within our party on how to approach these various issues.'' Calm First Reaction to Attack The day Mr. Will's column appeared, according to one Bush aide, Mr. Bush called in some of his closest advisers and told them ''not to let it get us down.'' Mr. Bush, the aide added, expressed confidence in the members of his political team and urged them not to blame themselves or one another. His political advisers admitted that they were stunned by Mr. Will's reaction, which one Bush aide said ''defined the New York dinner'' in a politically damaging way. They said their concern now was that Mr. Bush not do anything that could strengthen a negative perception of him. With a few exceptions, they said, he will stay out of political fights and focus his political energy for the rest of the year on campaigning for Republican candidates for the House and Senate. A Move to Upstage Kemp Bush strategists acknowledged that the remarks about Mr. Cuomo were part of a plan to upstage Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, one of Mr. Bush's chief rivals for the Presidential nomination, on his home turf. They said the Kemp forces had hoped to use the New York event and a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington a week later to establish Mr. Kemp as what one Bush adviser called ''the sentimental favorite of the conservatives.'' The adviser added, ''That didn't happen, and Jack Kemp won't have another chance like that for the rest of this year.'' Some Republican analysts say that although Mr. Bush could pay a heavy price in the general election for deciding to move early and aggressively for the support of party conservatives, the strategy appeared to be moving him through a crucial phase of his battle for the nomination. ''Bush's main concern had to be that he would be savaged by the people on the right who hate him and that they would rally behind an alternative candidate,'' said Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst. ''That has not happened. He seems to have defused their ideological compulsion to beat him, even though it has put him through a demeaning period.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ESSAY; The Speech That Failed,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/opinion/essay-the-speech-that-failed.html,"In his superbly delivered, warmly applauded joint session show, Mr. Reagan failed to step up to his own historic mission. His idea was to present a short, thematic address about the hard choices made in this year's budget. Fine idea; but the theme chosen was then weighted with boilerplate and sunk in a swamp of schmaltz. The theme was that the credit for the prosperity belonged to the American people, not to government; that the political philosophy shifting responsibility toward localities and individuals had been proved right; that one great hurdle of spending cuts was left. This was in direct contrast to Jimmy Carter's ''malaise'' approach, which tried to blame the people for the lack of will in the Government. The mission of the address was not to enhance Mr. Reagan's popularity but to advance his priorities. Despite doomsayers, he had parlayed tax cuts and a defense buildup into prosperity without inflation - now how was he going to apply that successful formula to eliminating the deficit? That answer is in his budget: maintain defense increases, protect Social Security and reach the Grudman deficit-cutting targets by cutting the rest of the nondefense budget without raising taxes. Granted, legerdemain is in his solution: by counting on a higher rate of economic growth than we have today, he pretends to see less of a deficit. Even so, he has his own way to deal with the monster, which deserved strong advocacy and fair hearing. That way is to cut spending radically in areas that have long been sacrosanct. By reducing taxes, and by letting the deficit mushroom until Congress was willing to put itself in a straitjacket, Mr. Reagan has after five years reached the moment of truth: with more borrowing denied, government must either cut spending or raise taxes. He is for cuts; now was his chance to rally the people to join in the pleasure of doing the painful. But a funny thing happened on the way to the lectern. There was this pitch to be made for the line-item veto, a new Presidential power that never did Jefferson Davis any good when enshrined in the Confederate Constitution. And a plug for tax reform was called for, and a word against protectionism, and a half-speed ahead for an international monetary conference. Then while he was at it, Mr. Reagan felt he had to boost vouchers for education, push government-sponsored prayer in schools and enlist again in anti-choice abortion ranks. And after five full years, he had to appoint committees to look into welfare waste and illness insurance, ''charging'' them to write reports in a year or so. And don't forget space, and ''Star Wars,'' and the freedom fighters, and now it's time for the four heroes of the American dream. That's all, folks. No time left for the purpose of the speech: to show the American people, who deserve all this credit for their own prosperity, how they can reduce the deficit threatening them by reducing the Federal role in their lives. Theme, shmeme; they can read that in the fine print of the Budget Message submitted the next day. But the fine print is where the battle is; without that laundry list, there will be no laundry. The ''revolution'' is in the details, and if the President is unwilling to get down in the trenches by letting the names of the sacrifices pass his lips, nobody will join him on the publicity ramparts. When it came to the dirty work, pointing out the ''hard choices,'' where was Ronald Reagan? He refused to risk political capital by calling on railroad passengers to forgo Amtrak subsidies, or to offend farmers by espousing an end to crop insurance. He did not explain to students why college loans should be cut, or persuade owners of small businesses why they should no longer look to Washington for credit, or tell veterans why they should meet their own medical needs. With the nation's eyes riveted on him in prime time, and with both houses of Congress his captive audience, Mr. Reagan could not bring himself to say why the states, not the Federal Government, should handle their own highway and mass-transit and sewer needs. That unhappy stuff, although vital to the development of his theme, might lose viewers and cost popularity points. If a President chooses to ignore the constitutional requirement for a report on the state of the Union, and prefers instead to mobilize support for his philosophy, his speech should spell out the sacrifices he expects for the benefits he promises. That is his job, nobody else's, and it requires political courage. In his hodgepodge speech, President Reagan flinched.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JUDGE ASSERTS HE IS SUBJECT OF FALSE BRIBERY ALLEGATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/08/nyregion/judge-asserts-he-is-subject-of-false-bribery-allegation.html,"Judge Vito J. Titone of the State Court of Appeals said yesterday that he believed a disbarred lawyer convicted of drug charges has told authorities that the judge accepted bribes in two cases a decade ago. Judge Titone emphatically denied any wrongdoing. Judge Titone, in an interview in his chambers in Albany, said he understood that the lawyer, Martin Light, had ''named me'' to the President's Commission on Organized Crime. The judge said he thought this might have been done to ''give them a big fish'' and obtain a recommendation from the commission for a reduced sentence. ''A guy facing 15 years might do anything,'' Judge Titone said. ''A judge in my position cannot protect against it.'' Mr. Light received a 15-year sentence last February after a conviction for heroin trafficking. Allegations About 2 Cases Mr. Light, who appeared at a public hearing of the commission on Jan. 29 to discuss the corruption of the criminal-justice system by ''mob lawyers'' and is now said to be in the Federal witness protection program, was a Staten Island resident who has known Judge Titone professionally and socially since the early 1970's. Judge Titone said he had not been officially informed of the accusations, which have not been substantiated but are believed to be under investigation by state officials. The allegations by Mr. Light relate to two cases, one when Judge Titone was a State Supreme Court justice on Staten Island in 1973 and 1974 and the other when he was a justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 1976. The judge was nominated by Governor Cuomo to the seven-member Court of Appeals, the state's highest tribunal, last April. The first case, according to law-enforcement officials who are familiar with the details, involved Edward Lino, who pleaded guilty to third-degree assault before Justice Titone in 1973. The judge sentenced Mr. Lino, who was then 31 years old and had been convicted twice before, to three years' probation. Mr. Light represented him. In October 1974, after Mr. Lino said he wanted to move to Florida and the city's Probation Department recommended that he be allowed to go, Justice Titone ended his probation. The judge said this week that he was simply following the practice of the Probation Department to cut its workload when warranted. The State of Florida, he said, was not interested in supervising probation for a misdemeanor offender from another state. According to law-enforcement sources, who asked not to be identified, Mr. Light has told the commission that Justice Titone received something of value, other than cash, for his ruling. The authorities are said to be focusing on a stove and refrigerator that Justice Titone had in the summer house that he purchased in the mid-1970's on Shelter Island. Judge Titone said that shortly after he bought the summer place with a friend - the judge could not immediately recall the exact date - Mr. Light mentioned to him that he himself was buying some appliances and could get some for the judge ''wholesale.'' The judge said that he paid either Mr. Light or the distributor for the refrigerator and stove. He said the transaction had nothing to do with Mr. Lino's or any other case and that, to his knowledge, he had never met Mr. Lino, now a defendant in a Federal drug case. Revocation of License The second case brought up by Mr. Light concerned Dr. Eliezer Shkolnik, an abortion specialist who, in the early 1970's, was medical director of the Central Women's Center at 331 East 29th Street. In 1974 state and city officials accused Dr. Shkolnik of gross ineptitude at the clinic and, after a hearing, the State Board of Regents revoked his medical license on Aug. 10, 1976. Dr. Shkolnik was represented, on appeal, by Stanley M. Meyer, a partner of Mr. Light in the Brooklyn law firm of Preminger, Meyer & Light. On Aug. 19, 1976, Justice Titone, then sitting on the Appellate Division for the Second Department, in Brooklyn, signed an order staying the revocation and requiring the Board of Regents to show cause within three weeks why the revocation should be sustained. The matter was then routinely referred to the Appellate Division in Albany, which upheld the revocation. Mr. Light, according to law-enforcement authorities, has said that Justice Titone received a cash bribe for issuing the stay order. The sources said Mr. Light had indicated that Mr. Meyer was present when the money was paid. Lawyer Denies Impropriety Judge Titone said this week that he did not remember the Shkolnik case but that, like other judges, he had handled hundreds of show cause orders. Mr. Meyer said in an interview that the Shkolnik matter was handled in a normal fashion. He denied that a bribe had been attempted or paid. Dr. Shkolnik was shot to death on Dec. 3, 1980, in the lobby of his apartment house at 67-76 Booth Street in Forest Hills, Queens. The murder was not solved, but investigators believe it was unrelated to the license troubles. Mr. Light became an informant for the President's Commission soon after his sentencing by Federal District Judge Eugene H. Nickerson in Brooklyn last February. But it was not until last fall, invesigators said, that he first implicated Judge Titone. The commission staff was said to have passed along the charges to Federal officials in the Eastern District and to state officials. The executive director of the commission, James D. Harmon Jr., declined to discuss the matter. But, in recent weeks, Judge Titone said, he learned that investigators were requesting documents relating to at least the Lino case. When Mr. Light appeared at a commission hearing on Jan. 29, he was asked whether he had been a witness to instances of corruption by judges or prosecutors or police officials. Each time he said yes, but he was not asked to identify the officials publicly. Statute of Limitations Ordinarily, a felony in New York State may not be prosecuted after a lapse of five years. In the case of corrupt activities by a public official, however, the statute of limitations may be extended to 10 years. Judge Titone, in the interview, described Mr. Light, who is 50 years old, as an affable person and ''a great story teller'' whom ''you could not help but like.'' But he said the former lawyer was also a ''criminal buff.'' ''I'm not afraid of what Light's saying now,'' the judge said, ''because I have nothing to hide.'' The judge said he met Mr. Light around 1972 when the lawyer appeared before him. Later, he said, Mr. Light had other cases in his courtroom. Judge Titone said that Mr. Light lived near him on Staten Island and, after the judge joined the appellate bench, he would occasionally give the lawyer a lift to the latter's office. Sometimes at Christmas, the judge said, Mr. Light may have given him small presents - he could not recall any, however. And the judge said he may have helped Mr. Light's daughter, who was applying to schools, or the lawyer's ailing father. Parting of Ways The judge said he had a parting of the ways with Mr. Light after he was indicted on drug charges in 1984. Mr. Light had been indicted on three narcotics charges and was acquitted on two. He said he had been ''framed'' by Federal agents, but on Dec. 14, 1984, he was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute it. At his sentencing on Feb. 21, 1985, he appealed for leniency. At one point, he told the judge that it was ''so easy for anyone facing trouble'' like himself to ''say anything'' he wanted. For example, Mr. Light said, he could become a Government informant and lie about paying off public officials, including judges. ''I can give a report that I spoke to the judge and paid the judge,'' he said. But, in reality, he added, ''It would be untrue absolutely, never happened.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Is Permitted Into Third Trimester,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/08/opinion/l-abortion-is-permitted-into-third-trimester-391586.html,"To the Editor: ''Contempt for Abortion, and Tolerance'' (editorial, Jan. 27) was misleading. You state that the Supreme Court decision ''allows some limitation on abortion in the second trimester and even greater limitation in the third.'' The key word is ''allows.'' The wording in Roe v. Wade is so ambiguous as to make abortion permissible, for almost any reason, up to and including the third trimester. In the words of the Court: ''the State may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.'' It strains credibility to say that there are over one million abortions annually in the interest of the mother's health or life. While, technically, it is correct that the Supreme Court does not endorse abortion, the result of Roe v. Wade has been to give us the dubious distinction of having the most permissive abortion laws of any nation in the Western world. (Rev.) CHARLES F.

SOOTHING RHETORIC AND A HARD SELL ON THE BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/weekinreview/soothing-rhetoric-and-a-hard-sell-on-the-budget.html,"THERE is no pithier summary of President Reagan's view of government than his own, the one embedded in the set speech he gave all over the country in the late 1950's and early 1960's. ''The truth is,'' he used to say, ''that outside of its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector.'' From the moment he took office on Jan. 20, 1981, with the declaration that ''Government is the problem,'' Mr. Reagan has worked to reshape it and redirect its energies into what he considers the appropriate channels. He was at it again last week, an unusually busy seven days during which he put his views to the Congress and the nation five times - in his fifth State of the Union Message, in a budget for the 1987 fiscal year, in an Economic Report, in a legislative message he termed an Agenda for the Future, and in his radio address yesterday. More than any other modern President, Mr. Reagan believes, as he said in the State of the Union address, that ''defense - keeping America, strong, free and at peace - is Government's prime responsibility.'' Not regulating business, as Theodore Roosevelt might have argued; not ending unemployment, as Franklin D. Roosevelt suggested, but creating and maintaining strong military forces. To that end, he proposed an 11.9 percent increase in military spending, the one vivid exception to a budget of extreme stringency. His Strategic Defense Intiative, ''Star Wars,'' is the biggest single item -as characteristic, in its way, of Mr. Reagan's awed optimism about the capacities of technology as the allocation for development of a plane that would carry passengers from Washington to Tokyo in two hours. Military outlays would account for 28 cents of every Federal dollar spent in 1987, up from the less than 25 cents he requested for 1982. All other outlays, except for interest payments, would account for 57 cents, down from almost 64 cents five years ago. But Senator Sam Nunn, the influential Georgia Democrat, spoke for many of his colleagues when he said that Mr. Reagan's request this year ''may very well be in tune with the threat and the need, but it is not in tune with what is going to happen.'' The best the White House will do, he added, is a 3 to 4 percent Pentagon increase over the next few years. If military spending is to grow at all, given the new budget-balancing act - the constitutionality of which is under challange - most other expenditures must shrink. The law requires that the the deficit be trimmed in a single year from more than $200 billion to $144 billion. For the President, that provided a happy conjunction of preference and imperative. The Administration proposed to sell some of its assets, such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve. It proposed to charge fees for some heretofore free Government services, such as meat and poultry inspections. It proposed to cut deeply into health care programs for the elderly. And it proposed to eliminate altogether more than two dozen other programs. Mass transit grants would go, for example, because, ''the construction, maintenance and operation of state and local transportation facilities are primarily state and local responsibilities.'' Amtrak subsidies would go because the subsidies ''provide unfair competition'' against air and road transport. Free legal services for the poor would go because the same function could be filled if every private attorney gave 20 free hours a year. Inevitably, much of the burden would fall on already- beleaguered state and local governments, which would get only limited Federal help with their new responsibilities, on individuals and on charities. One prominent mayor forecast glumly last week that ''the ghettos of this country will grow under this budget.'' ''The United States is, and was intended to be, governed by a Federal system,'' Mr. Reagan wrote in his Agenda, driving home the philosophical point made implicitly in the budget. ''During the 1970's, state and local governments were often bypassed. As government became farther and farther removed from the people, it became less efficient and less responsive.'' It is doubtful whether the President, who remains more popular than any other in the last half-century at a comparable point in his tenure, has the backing of the people for what he proposes to do. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll showed that sizable majorities thought the Government should spend more, not less, on the environment and aid to the poor, and that only 17 per cent of the public favored increased military outlays. ''Private values,'' Mr. Reagan said at another point in the State of the Union address, ''must be at the heart of public policies'' - which to him means, among other things, that the Government, like the family, must live within its income. He argued that the new deficit-reduction act was not enough, and called, as he has before, for the authority to veto individual spending items, for a Constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget and for a new Congressional budget process. A public policy consonant with private values, in Ronald Reagan's view, also means a Government less intrusive in some ways and more intrusive in others. It means, for example, a Government that would permit prayer in schools, but sharply restrict abortion. Finally, Government should be hortatory, and the White House should be used for the national pulpit it can be. Mr. Reagan never shrinks from mounting the steps. Twice last week, in the State of the Union message and in his Agenda, Mr. Reagan used the same words, brimful of confidence: ''America believes, America is ready, America can win the race to the future, and we shall.'' Another President often talked like that. Here is Teddy Roosevelt at the 1900 Republican National Convention: ''The young giant of the West stands on a continent and clasps the crest of an ocean in either hand. Our nation, glorious in youth and strength, looks into the future with eager eyes and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.'' At 75, Ronald Reagan, too, rejoices, but the race that faces him in the weeks and months to come will be full of hurdles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/books/no-headline-423986.html,"THE HANDMAID'S TALE By Margaret Atwood. 311 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. $16.95. SURELY the essential element of a cautionary tale is recognition. Surprised recognition, even, enough to administer a shock. We are warned, by seeing our present selves in a distorting mirror, of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue. That was the effect of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four,'' with its scary dating, not 40 years ahead, maybe also of ''Brave New World'' and, to some extent, of ''A Clockwork Orange.'' It is an effect, for me, almost strikingly missing from Margaret Atwood's very readable book ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' offered by the publisher as a ''forecast'' of what we may have in store for us in the quite near future. A standoff will have been achieved vis-a-vis the Russians, and our own country will be ruled by right-wingers and religious fundamentalists, with males restored to the traditional role of warriors and us females to our ''place'' - which, however, will have undergone subdivision into separate sectors, of wives, breeders, servants and so forth, each clothed in the appropriate uniform. A fresh postfeminist approach to future shock, you might say. Yet the book just does not tell me what there is in our present mores that I ought to watch out for unless I want the United States of America to become a slave state something like the Republic of Gilead whose outlines are here sketched out. Another reader, less peculiar than myself, might confess to a touch of apathy regarding credit cards (instruments of social control), but I have always been firmly against them and will go to almost any length to avoid using one. Yet I can admit to a general failure to extrapolate sufficiently from the 1986 scene. Still, even when I try, in the light of these palely lurid pages, to take the Moral Majority seriously, no shiver of recognition ensues. I just can't see the intolerance of the far right, presently directed not only at abortion clinics and homosexuals but also at high school libraries and small-town schoolteachers, as leading to a super-biblical puritanism by which procreation will be insisted on and reading of any kind banned. Nor, on the other hand, do I fear our ''excesses'' of tolerance as pointing in the same direction. Liberality toward pornography in the courts, the media, on the newstands may make an anxious parent feel disgusted with liberalism, but can it really move a nation to install a theocracy strictly based on the Book of Genesis? Where are the signs of it? A backlash is only a backlash, that is, a reaction. Fear of a backlash, in politics, ought not to deter anybody from adhering to principle; that would be only another form of cowardice. The same for ''excessive'' feminism, which here seems to bear some responsibility for Gilead, to be one of its causes. The kind of doctrinaire feminism likely to produce a backlash is exemplified in the narrator's absurd mother, whom we first hear of at a book-burning in the old, pre-Gilead time - the ''right'' kind of book-burning, naturally, merely a pyre of pornographic magazines: ''Mother,'' thinks the narrator in what has become the present, ''You wanted a women's culture. Well, now there is one.'' The wrong kind, of course. The new world of ''The Handmaid's Tale'' is a woman's world, even though governed, seemingly, and policed by men. Its ethos is entirely domestic, its female population is divided into classes based on household functions, each class clad in a separate color that instantly identifies the wearer - dull green for the Marthas (houseworkers); blue for the Wives; red, blue and green stripes for the Econowives (working class); red for the Handmaids (whose function is to bear children to the head of the household, like Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid in Genesis, but who also, in their long red gowns and white wimple-like headgear, have something of the aura of a temple harlot); brown for the Aunts (a thought-control force, part-governess, part-reform-school matron). The head of the household - whose first name the handmaid takes, adding the word ''of'' to show possession -''Offred,'' ''Ofwarren'' - is known as the Commander. It is his duty to inseminate his assigned partner, who lies on the spread thighs of his wife. THE Commanders, presumably, are the high bureaucracy of the regime, yet they are oddly powerless in the household, having no part in the administration of discipline and ceremonially subject to their aging wives. We are not told how and in what sense they govern. The oversight perhaps accounts for the thin credibility of the parable. That they lack freedom, are locked into their own rigid system, is only to be expected. It is no surprise that our narrator's commander, Fred, like a typical bourgeois husband of former times, does a bit of cheating, getting Offred to play Scrabble with him secretly at night (where books are forbidden, word games become wicked), look at his hoard of old fashion magazines (forbidden), kiss him, even go dressed in glitter and feathers to an underground bunny-type nightclub staffed by fallen women, mostly lesbian. Nor is it a surprise that his wife catches him/ them. Plusca change, plus c'est la meme chose. But that cannot be the motto for a cautionary tale, whose job is to warn of change. Infertility is the big problem of the new world and the reason for many of its institutions. A dramatically lowered birth rate, which brought on the fall of the old order, had a plurality of causes, we are told. ''The air got too full, once, of chemicals, rays, radiation, the water swarmed with toxic molecules.'' During an earthquake, atomic power plants exploded (''nobody's fault''). A mutant strain of syphilis appeared, and of course AIDS. Then there were women who refused to breed, as an antinuclear protest, and had their tubes tied up. Anyway, infertility, despite the radical measures of the new regime, has not yet been overcome. Not only are there barren women (mostly shipped to the colonies) but a worrying sterility in men, especially among the powerful who ought to be reproducing themselves. The amusing suggestion is made, late in the book at a symposium (June 25, 2195) of Gileadean historical studies, that sterility among the Commanders may have been the result of an earlier gene-splicing experiment with mumps that produced a virus intended for insertion into the supply of caviar used by top officials in Moscow. ''The Handmaid's Tale'' contains several such touches of deft sardonic humor - for example, the television news program showing clouds of smoke over what was formerly the city of Detroit: we hear the anchorman explain that resettlement of the children of Ham in National Homeland One (the wilds of North Dakota) is continuing on schedule - 3,000 have arrived that week. And yet what is lacking, I think - what constitutes a fundamental disappointment after a promising start - is the destructive force of satire. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' had it, ''A Clockwork Orange'' had it, even ''Brave New World'' had it, though Huxley was rather short on savagery. If ''The Handmaid's Tale'' doesn't scare one, doesn't wake one up, it must be because it has no satiric bite. The author has carefully drawn her projections from current trends. As she has said elsewhere, there is nothing here that has not been anticipated in the United States of America that we already know. Perhaps that is the trouble: the projections are too neatly penciled in. The details, including a Wall (as in Berlin, but also, as in the Middle Ages, a place where executed malefactors are displayed), all raise their hands announcing themselves present. At the same time, the Republic of Gilead itself, whatever in it that is not a projection, is insufficiently imagined. The Aunts are a good invention, though I cannot picture them as belonging to any future; unlike Big Brother, they are more part of the past - our schoolteachers. But the most conspicuous lack, in comparison with the classics of the fearsome-future genre, is the inability to imagine a language to match the changed face of common life. No newspeak. And nothing like the linguistic tour de force of ''A Clockwork Orange'' - the brutal melting-down of current English and Slavic words that in itself tells the story of the dread new breed. The writing of ''The Handmaid's Tale'' is undistinguished in a double sense, ordinary if not glaringly so, but also indistinguishable from what one supposes would be Margaret Atwood's normal way of expressing herself in the circumstances. This is a serious defect, unpardonable maybe for the genre: a future that has no language invented for it lacks a personality. That must be why, collectively, it is powerless to scare. ONE could argue that the very tameness of the narrator-heroine's style is intended as characterization. It is true that a leading trait of Offred (we are never told her own, real name in so many words, but my textual detective work says it is June) has always been an unwillingness to stick her neck out, and perhaps we are meant to conclude that such unwillingness, multiplied, may be fatal to a free society. After the takeover, she tells us, there were some protests and demonstrations. ''I didn't go on any of the marches. Luke [ her husband ] said it would be futile, and I had to think about them, my family, him and her [ their little girl ] .'' Famous last words. But, though this may characterize an attitude - fairly widespread - it does not constitute a particular kind of speech. And there are many poetical passages, for example (chosen at random): ''All things white and circular. I wait for the day to unroll, for the earth to turn, according to the round face of the implacable clock.'' Which is surely oldspeak, wouldn't you say? Characterization in general is weak in ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' which maybe makes it a poet's novel. I cannot tell Luke, the husband, from Nick, the chauffeur-lover who may be an Eye (government spy) and/ or belong to the ''Mayday'' underground. Nor is the Commander strongly drawn. Again, the Aunts are best. How sad for postfeminists that one does not feel for Offred-June half as much as one did for Winston Smith, no hero either but at any rate imaginable. It seems harsh to say again of a poet's novel - so hard to put down, in part so striking - that it lacks imagination, but that, I fear, is the problem. The Lady Was Not for Hanging he dedication of ''The Handmaid's Tale'' -''For Mary Webster and Perry Miller'' - holds clues to the novel's roots in our Puritan past. ''Mary Webster was an ancestor of mine who was hanged for a witch in Connecticut,'' Margaret Atwood explained. ''But she didn't die. They hadn't invented the drop yet'' - the part of the platform that falls away - ''so they hanged her but she lived.'' The author's studies in early American history under the Harvard scholar Perry Miller also informs her theme of religious intolerance. ''You often hear in North America, 'It can't happen here,' but it happened quite early on. The Puritans banished people who didn't agree with them, so we would be rather smug to assume that the seeds are not there. That's why I set the book in Cambridge,'' said the Canadian author, who lives in Toronto and has traveled widely in the United States. Like many of her fictional women (she has written poems, essays and novels, notably the feminist classic ''Surfacing''), she is wryly unpolemical. ''Feminist activity is not causal, it's symptomatic,'' she said of the book's antiwoman society. ''Any power structure will co-opt the views of its opponents, to sugarcoat the pill. The regime gives women some things the women's movement says they want -control over birth, no pornography - but there's a price. If you were going to put in a repressive regime, how would you do it?'' Despite the novel's projections from current events, Margaret Atwood resists calling her book a warning. ''I do not have a political agenda of that kind. The book won't tell you who to vote for,'' she said. But she advises, ''Anyone who wants power will try to manipulate you by appealing to your desires and fears, and sometimes your best instincts. Women have to be a little cautious about that kind of appeal to them.

HISPANIC CATHOLICS FOUND TO HEW TO TRADITON,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/us/hispanic-catholics-found-to-hew-to-traditon.html,"Hispanic Roman Catholics in the United States overwhelmingly support the traditional beliefs of their faith, but, as with other immigrants, the tenacity of these beliefs appears to fade as they become more rooted in this country, master English, become more educated and increase their income, a new national study has concluded. The study also found that about eight out of every 10 Hispanic Catholics were being approached for conversion by Pentecostals, Evangelicals and other sects and that a majority of Hispanic Catholics had a favorable view of these groups, a possibly worrisome trend for the Roman Catholic Church. The study, ''The Hispanic Catholic in the United States,'' was based on a survey of 1,010 Hispanic Catholics from all parts of the country. The findings were disclosed in New York Friday by the Northeast Pastoral Center for Hispanics. Retain Folk Practices The study suggests that Hispanic Catholicism is quite different from the Catholicism of other ethnic groups. Hispanic Catholics, seeking more intimate and tangible ways of relating to the sacred, the study says, cling to folk practices such as the giving and asking of parental blessings, having home altars, praying to saints, using holy water in the home and making religious deals with God. At the same time, they are often not aware of major institutional trends. More than half the respondents said they had never heard of the Second Vatican Council or the American bishops' pastoral letter on war and peace, and three out of four said they did not know of ''liberation theology,'' the movement centered in Latin America that blends faith with the achievement of social and political goals. The Rev. Roberto O. Gonzalez, who conducted the study with Michael La Velle, said the findings suggested the church must improve efforts to communicate news of itself to Hispanic Americans and find better ways of holding Hispanic Catholics as they become better educated and earn more income. The appeal that Pentecostal and other evangelical sects have for Hispanic Catholics, he said, also suggests that the church must place more emphasis on regular Bible reading. #14.6 Million Hispanic Americans The survey is the first national study of the beliefs of Hispanic Catholics, although many of its finding are comparable to one done in 1982 of Hispanic Catholics in the New York City area. The 1980 census found that there were 14.6 million Hispanic Americans and the new study estimated that about 85 percent were Catholic. The study found that 83 percent of Hispanic Catholics considered religion to be very important in their lives. But first-generation immigrants were far more likely than their children or subsequent generations to feel this way. To the surprise of Catholic officials, the study found that Hispanic Catholics born in the United States had a clear preference for worship in English. Hispanic Catholics showed a high level of support for the tenets of the church. Virtually all respondents indicated they believed Jesus was divine, and about 75 percent believed that ''saints can intercede with God in our name.'' But the percentages of Hispanic Catholics affirming these beliefs generally declined by generation, income and age. Two out of three respondents said they believed abortion was always wrong, a sharp contrast to the beliefs of non-Hispanic Catholics. A 1984 survey by Planned Parenthood of New York found that 73 percent of Catholic respondents supported a woman's right to choose an abortion. Only about 40 percent of those in the new survey, however, supported the church's opposition to birth control. One of the more surprising findings of the study was a relatively high level of attendance at mass. The conventional wisdom within the church, the study said, is that the attendance rate among Hispanics Catholics is about 25 percent. But 48 percent of the survey's respondents said they attend mass on Sundays and holy days. Still, a substantial minority, one out of four, said they rarely attend mass, the study found, and 87.6 percent do not involve themselves in parish activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STATES SAID TO BE ILL-PREPARED FOR TEEN-AGE PREGNANCIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/10/us/states-said-to-be-ill-prepared-for-teen-age-pregnancies.html,"One million teen-agers will have unwanted pregnancies each year in the foreseeable future, and state and local governments are ill-equipped to deal with the problem, according to a Congressional report made public yesterday. Despite the expenditure of billions of dollars annually to deal with problems related to teen-age pregnancy, the study found, government agencies still depend on inadequate data and poorly coordinated programs. As a result, it said, there is little likelihood of any significant decrease in the number of births to teen-age mothers. ''America will continue to experience the epidemic of babies having babies into the next decade,'' said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, which conducted the study. ''We see an incredible failure by policy makers to dedicate the resources necessary to reduce the incidence of teen-age pregnancy.'' States Were Surveyed The bipartisan report, ''Teen Pregnancy: What Is Being Done? A State by State Look,'' was described by the committee as the most extensive information compiled to date on the problem. The report was based on a survey mailed in February 1985 to the Governors of each state. The birthrate for teen-agers, as for women generally, has been declining since the early 1970's in the United States - from 61.7 births per 1,000 teen-age females in 1972 to 51.7 in 1983. But the report said the nation should expect one million teen-age pregnancies, 400,000 abortions and one-half million teen-age births annually. Nearly 55 percent of those babies will be born to unmarried adolescents, the report said. Of the 450,000 families with children who had teen-age parents in March 1984, the report said, 85 percent had only one parent present. The infants of teen-agers are at far greater risk of having a low birthweight and of dying in infancy, the report said, and the mothers are at greater risk of being in poor health because of inadequate health care and poor nutrition. Further, the report found that teen-age mothers and fathers are far more likely to drop out of school and to be unemployed. Spending on Teen-Age Households According to a SRI International study conducted in 1979 and cited by the report, Federal, state and local governments are estimated to spend an average of $18,700 throughout childhood in additional health and welfare expenditures on the first child born to a teen-ager. Another study, conducted by the Urban Institute in 1975 estimated that the Federal Government spent more than $8.5 billion on households where the mother was a teen-ager. Nonetheless, 26 of the states acknowledged in the survey that prevention and assistance services were inadequate. They said that services were fragmented, not comprehensive and that the states lacked adequate data on such issues as what programs existed to help teen-agers, who in the population was at risk of becoming pregnant and what sources of funds were available for local programs. In many states, the report said, programs tended to center on teen-agers who were already pregnant or had children, rather than on prevention. The report found, however, that several states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, California, Michigan, Colorado and Illinois were trying to improve their stategies and to gather more complete data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congress; A Dissertation on the Mail,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/14/us/congress-a-dissertation-on-the-mail.html,"Hundreds of millions of letters arrive on Capitol Hill every year, most of them requesting assistance of some sort or urging members of Congress to take some particular legislative action. Do they have any effect, especially when it comes to how members vote? Orval Hansen, a former Republican member of the House from Idaho, has just completed a detailed study of Congressional mail and concluded that the answer, for most members, depends upon length of service on Capitol Hill. The longer the service, Mr. Hansen reports, the more confident members become in their own judgment and the less attention they pay to the mail, which may or may not represent a cross section of their constituency. Of Influence and Feelings ''A freshman or a newer member who's confronting an issue for the first time is much more likely to be influenced,'' said Mr. Hansen, who served in the House from 1968 to 1974 and now is director of the Washington-based Columbia Institute for Political Research. On the other hand, he adds, a legislator ''who feels strongly, or is an expert, will tend to go with his feelings.'' But while senior members may heed their mail less, they read more of it, Mr. Hansen says, a fact he attributes to force of habit. For instance, he says, Melvin Price, a Democrat of Illinois who has served in the House more than 40 years, still reads his mail conscientiously. ''When Mel came to the Congress back in 1945, there wasn't much mail,'' Mr. Hansen said. ''He just got in the habit of reading it, and so he still does.'' By contrast, he continued, freshman members today arrive in Washington to find their offices ''already half-full with mail.'' #200 Million Pieces of Mail More than 200 million pieces of mail are directed to Capitol Hill each year, according to some extimates, with computerized mass mailings swelling that figure almost daily. Although the growth of mass-mail organizations has diluted some of the impact of individual letters, Mr. Hansen says, he also cites several recent issues, such as like abortion and gun control, on which some members say the mail, even though mass-produced, played an important part in determining how they voted. On legislative proposals concerning gun control and registration, for instance, Mr. Hansen reports, the National Rifle Association has proved effective at marshaling its supporters and getting them to write their Congressman. The association's successes, he adds, are the result of its cohesive membership and its demonstrated effectiveness at participating come election time. After he left Congress, in 1974 -''for reasons of health,'' he says, ''the voters got sick of me'' - Mr. Hansen started the research institute and began pursuing a doctorate in political science. His dissertation, which looks at the effects of the mail on Congress, is now complete, and it draws on interviews with 21 members as well as Congressional staff workers. Mr. Hansen's final conclusion on Congressional mail is that while members may vary the attention they pay to letters and cards, none dares go so far as to ignore them altogether. ''They all get very complete information about what their constituents are saying,'' he said. ''They can't afford not to.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Judge in Protest Case Says He Joined in March,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/15/us/around-the-nation-judge-in-protest-case-says-he-joined-in-march.html,"To the consternation of prosecutors, a Superior Court judge here who is hearing a case involving nine people arrested in an anti-abortion protest has acknowledged that he took part in the protest. Just after the first witness began testifying Thursday, the judge, Michael Hannon, said he participated in the annual March for Life demonstration Jan. 22 at the Supreme Court to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. But Judge Hannon said he stopped short of the Supreme Court Building, where the nine were arrested for carrying the demonstration onto court property. The 67-year-old judge, who is trying the case without a jury, did not explain why he waited until after the trial began to disclose his activities. If Judge Hannon had disclosed his participation earlier, prosecutors could have asked him to step down. But because the judge did not disclose his participation in the protest until after the first witness had testified, his withdrawal would bar a retrial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO VISITS NEW ROCHELLE TO DEFEND BUDGET PLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/nyregion/cuomo-visits-new-rochelle-to-defend-budget-plan.html,"GOVERNOR Cuomo came to Westchester last week to defend his proposed budget and to warn organization leaders and elected officials seeking extra funds that they will either have to do without or find the money at the county or national levels. Addressing an audience at New Rochelle High School of more than 1,000 students, city officials, politicians and others, the Governor, a Democrat seeking re-election, answered questions for nearly three hours. He drew frequent applause and laughter from the audience. The topics addressed by questioners ranged from the New York City Parking Violations Bureau to the proposed docking of the nuclear battleship Iowa at Staten Island, from the state's role in job training and solving the homeless problem to the Governor's views on the death penalty and abortion. Mr. Cuomo, who is mentioned frequently as a possible Presidential candidate in 1988, criticized President Reagan's proposed budget, saying that while the President himself ''is loved as a controlled, gentle, strong, unflappable, never cantankerous and never belligerent'' leader, his budget ''kills us.'' The President ''cut the heart out of what was left of the jobs program, took money away from education, from child care'' and from other areas, Mr. Cuomo said. County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, in an interview later, seemed to agree with the Governor. Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican, said, ''I do not think we are going to keep much in the way of Federal funding because of the pattern of Federal disassociation from local government, and I don't see the state coming to help us.'' ''One state representative told me that they would not help us because that would validate the Reagan budget,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. He estimated that $130 million in Federal aid to Westchester would be affected, citing losses in revenue-sharing, mass transportation and aid to students. Mr. O'Rourke was especially irritated over the Federal government's ''duplicity'' in cutting back on funds while continuing the obligations that programs, especially in the areas of human care, be maintained. ''I'd say that if you're not going to send the money, don't send the mandates,'' he said. Both leaders suggested that the Federal and state budgets faced serious hurdles before being approved. Mr. Cuomo defended his support for education, saying that education aid was increasing throughout the state, but local school officials told him that most districts in Westchester would lose money under his proposed formula. Dr. James R. Gaddy, Superintendant of New Rochelle schools, said the state's decision to cut special-aid financing to small-city school districts - known as Hurd aid -by 15 percent for the next school year, represented ''the most serious problem in the history of the school district.'' A New Rochelle homeowner, he said, pays a typical tax bill of $5,700 and should not be asked to pay more. He said that ''a quarter of our citizens are senior citizens living on fixed incomes,'' that property taxes were already high, and that 28 percent of the city's property was tax-exempt. Mr. Cuomo, citing a theme he would return to repeatedly, asked Dr. Gaddy, ''Where will I get the money?'' The Superintendant suggested that the state lottery might represent a source. But the Governor said that all of the money, except for lottery prizes and administration, already goes for education. ''All of it,'' Mr. Cuomo repeated. ''Ask our Republican State Controller,'' Edward V. Regan. ''Should I raise income taxes,'' asked the Governor, whose election-year budget combines the second year of a tax cut with a 7.5 percent increase in spending. He said that 61 cents out of every dollar the state collects goes back to localities. ''We picked up county expenses for Medicaid; if we hadn't done that your taxes would be 15 percent higher,'' Mr. Cuomo asserted, adding that ''we get the burden for taxing while they get the credit for spending.'' Dr. Gaddy said he was not seeking an increase in state aid; ''we simply would like to maintain the level we actually have.'' He said that 12 percent of the school aid, or $7.1 million, came from the special aid. The cut in Hurd aid would represent a loss of $1.06 million next year and $2.45 million the following year, when the cut goes to 35 percent. Mr. Cuomo, who sought to link his responses to the county, asked at one point, ''Isn't registration down in Westchester?'' a reference to school enrollment. Dr. Gaddy said ''not in New Rochelle, certainly.'' The Governor was seeking to make the point that state assistance should go to those who need it most. He was attacking the so-called ''hold harmless'' educational system, which insures that school districts with declining enrollments, including the majority in Westchester, neverless get the same amount of aid as they did the previous year. Mr. Cuomo said the Legislature routinely restores the cuts he makes in ''hold harmless'' aid ''and we expect it to happen again.'' He suggested at another point that the same results often followed the actions of local legislators, whose own bills occasionally gain legislative approval. He was responding to a question by M. Paul Redd, president of the Westchester-Putnam Affirmative Action Program, who was seeking restoration of $300,000 in state funds for job-training programs. Mr. Cuomo said he would consider doing so, but if not ''you've got Ron Tocci,'' referring to Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci, ''and Suzi Oppenheimer,'' the State Senator from the area, to introduce their own legislation. The Governor sought also to put complaints and requests in his own terms, often referring to his mother and late father. He did so when Arlene Kramer, head of the New Rochelle Board of Education, cited rising home values as a major problem. ''In 1966, a house assessed at $20,000 paid $2,300 in taxes, in 1986 the same assessment paid $3,800 and a home assessed at $30,000 in 1986 pays $5,700,'' she said. Mr. Cuomo's response to that was to refer to his 84-year-old mother's home in Queens, where taxes also are rising. ''She pays a real property tax that assumes she's getting wealthier and wealthier,'' he said. He referred to his parents several times, quoting his father as asking why he was getting into politics when ''you've been honest all your life.'' His mother, he said, reacted to his being elected Governor by saying, '''That's nice, but when are going to be a judge?'' a line he delivered with slight trace of Italian accent. Mr. Cuomo was asked by Joan Weber of the Saw Mill River Association, a group of homeowners in the three towns to resist building ramps and underpasses where the Saw Mill River Parkway goes through Hastings-on-Hudson, because they would be ''unnecessary'' and would ''change the character of our communities.'' The Governor said nothing would happen until he approved it and ''if you're right, it won't happen.'' He said he disagreed with Mayor Koch's calling former Queens Borough President Donald R. Manes ''a crook'' because ''if you tried politicians in the court of public opinion, we'd all be convicted.'' Mr. Cuomo said that most politicians spend their lives working honestly in public service. Mr. Cuomo said he favored berthing the nuclear ship Iowa at Staten Island because it would bring jobs to the region and because Mayor Koch favored it. He agreed that more state help should be provided for alcohol-abuse prevention and counseling programs, telling representatives of each that more funds might be forthcoming. Charles Cola of Yonkers, a former vice mayor, asked for state support for a plan that would rehabilitate housing as a ''permanent solution'' to the housing problem. ''Why not get the county to put up the money; I heard it had a terrific year, with a $15 million surplus,'' Mr. Cuomo replied, but said he too would look into it. A similar pledge of support was offered to the Rev. Vernon Shannon of St. Catherine's A.M.E. Zion Church of New Rochelle, who had asked for Albany's assistance in solving the shortage of housing that helped create the plight of the homeless. Mr. Cuomo said he would set up a meeting with Mr. Shannon's group to explore underutilized state housing plans. The Governor said he favored ''real'' life imprisonment to the death penalty, which ''doesn't deter or make anyone safe.'' He reiterated his position on abortion, saying he opposed it personally ''but the law gives women a choice.'' Thus, he said, he will continue to favor continued financing of abortions for poor women. ''I would put more emphasis on prevention,'' he said. ''We should better educate young people, some of whom are having children because they have nothing else.'' Addressing the many young people in the audience, he said, ''You don't have to jump into bed to prove you're a man, or a woman.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prosecutors said today that a new trial before another judge has been set for April 24 now that Superior Court Judge Joseph Michael Hannon has removed himself from the case. Judge Hannon, who had been presiding at the nonjury trial, removed himself from the case Friday, saying he felt his presence raised questions about the ''appearance of justice.'' On Thursday, the judge rejected a prosecution request that he remove himself.

O'CONNOR'S WAY: ASSERTIVE AND HEARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/17/nyregion/o-connor-s-way-assertive-and-heard.html,"John Cardinal O'Connor has brought a fresh assertiveness to the role of Archbishop of New York and has expanded the influence of the Roman Catholic Church on the life and politics of the city, government and church officials say. In his less than two years as Archbishop, these officials say, the Cardinal has reversed the image of reticence the church had acquired during the previous 15 years and has heightened its political impact. He has done this, the officials say, by means of a forceful personality and a remarkable gift for engaging the media. Whether by intuition or by a shrewd understanding of contemporary political dynamics, the Cardinal has used this gift to gain significant leverage in a world where the ability to capture the media's attention translates into political power. A Formidable Adversary As a result, government leaders such as Mayor Koch see the Cardinal as a formidable adversary in matters on which they disagree. In an interview at his residence at 452 Madison Avenue, near 50th Street, the 66-year-old Cardinal implicitly acknowledged the impact he has had. But he attributed his success to his outspokenness on the moral teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, and not to any covert influence. ''Any relationship I have with the city is by way of my public appearances,'' he said. ''I have no intent of trying to develop a hidden network that one could call a power base. My tendency is to do things in the open.'' 'Mobilizing Public Opinion' Church officials express pride that the Cardinal has strengthened the church's image in the public arena. ''He's mobilizing public opinion within the church and outside the church,'' said Bishop Patrick V. Ahern, an auxiliary bishop in the archidiocese and the vicar of Staten Island. ''He's carrying his message to everybody, the same as the Pope is.'' ''The Pope is not an in-house man,'' Bishop Ahern said. ''He speaks to the world, and Cardinal O'Connor in the same way speaks to the world. The people sitting in front of the tube are not just Catholics.'' Opposing Homosexual Rights The Cardinal, a man of orthodox Catholic convictions on matters of faith and morals, has made his views widely known on abortion, housing for the homeless and other issues. And in far more vigorous fashion than his predecessor, Terence Cardinal Cooke, he has mobilized the archdiocese's 411 parishes and its prominent lay members to oppose abortion and to fight a bill in the City Council that would forbid discrimination against homosexuals. Government leaders generally express admiration for the Cardinal and his leadership. They see him as an effective ally on issues on which they agree. But they also foresee the chance of alienating Catholic constituents should they oppose an outspoken and media-wise Cardinal on a particular issue, such as the homosexual-rights bill that the City Council is to vote on next month. Daniel Wolf, a special adviser to the Mayor, said of the Cardinal: ''I think he'll solidify the views of Catholics who are the most traditional Catholics, and I think he may well have scared the hell out of a few members of the City Council on the homosexual issue. There were people who had no doubts on how they would vote, and now he has made it extremely difficult for them. He has not given them an out.'' Most observers say, however, that the Cardinal has a legitimate right to embroil himself in political concerns that are of importance to the church, a right, they point out, that is exercised by Jewish and Protestant leaders as well. A Decline In Influence Almost no one sees a return to the days less than three decades ago when the Archbishop's residence was known as ''the Powerhouse'' by those who believed that it exerted influence over many city policies and the appointment of some city officials. Even if that legend were true then, government and church officials say, the city and its politics have changed too much and the Catholic Church itself no longer commands the same unswerving loyalty from its members. Like political organizations, labor unions and many other institutions, the archdiocese lost considerable influence in the turbulent social changes of the last three decades. But it retained the bedrock of its influence in the city - its role as a spokesman for 1.8 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven upstate counties, and its huge institutional presence. The archdiocese operates 16 hospitals, 330 schools and more than 200 social-service agencies - services the city could not afford to duplicate - and owns $820 million in tax-exempt real estate. That inherent influence has been bolstered by the Cardinal's new assertiveness, officials say. ''I think he's enhanced the image of the archdiocese in the public perception and in fact,'' Mayor Koch said in an interview. ''He's a smart man who has a commitment to withstand whatever pressures are out there. ''I don't happen to agree with him on some matters, but I sure respect him.'' The Mayor prides himself on his friendship with the Cardinal and meets frequently with him, dining with him at Chinese and Italian restaurants. But he also describes him as a ''tough, very effective'' adversary when they disagree, as they have on homosexual rights. ''I think that if you identify with an issue that he has taken on as a cause in a very public way, and if you're on the other side, that has some impact, and I think people worry about it, and they should,'' the Mayor said. ''And there's nothing wrong about that. It depends on whose ox is being gored.'' The importance of the Cardinal's friendship with the Mayor in expanding the archdiocese's political strength is suggested by two incidents, which the Cardinal himself freely talks about. Many Catholic churches shelter homeless people overnight and they normally are reimbursed by the city for their heating expenses. Last spring, the Cardinal said, some city officials tried to block the reimbursements because the archdiocese had refused to abide by Executive Order 50, a mayoral directive, since voided by the courts, that prohibited discrimination against homosexuals by organizations doing business with the city. The Cardinal complained to the Mayor and the city officials were overruled. ''When I got to Mayor Koch,'' the Cardinal recalled, ''he said that was absolutely ridiculous and the whole thing was called off.'' The Cardinal said that some officials, again citing Executive Order 50, had also tried at the last minute to block the archdiocese's use of Yankee Stadium in May 1985 for a youth rally and prayer service attended by 40,000 youngsters. The Cardinal said he had told his staff to tell the city officials, ''If they want, I'm going to call the Mayor and the media and tell them we can't use the stadium.'' The city officials, the Cardinal said, changed their minds. Governor Cuomo Feels the Pressure Governor Cuomo knows what it is like to feel pressure from the church. Last month, Cardinal O'Connor and the seven other New York State bishops called on Catholics to send postcards to the Governor appealing for him to end Medicaid financing of abortions. ''I will hold all elected officials accountable who do not support my conscientious objections,'' the cards said. More than 50,000 have been received so far by the New York State Right to Life Committee, which plans to present them to the Governor in March. Nevertheless, Governor Cuomo understands the importance of having the Cardinal as an ally and has asked the Cardinal to support his housing programs as they go through the legislative process. ''In the end that's going to make a big difference, because they respect him, they know he's not trying to win a race, he's trying to help people,'' the Governor said. The role of Archbishop of New York, perhaps the most important church post in the United States, is primarily one of spiritual and moral leadership. But exercising this leadership has often taken Cardinal O'Connor into the public arena in quite political ways. On Jan. 9, the Cardinal met with 200 leaders of lay organizations to ask that they join in fighting a City Council bill that would forbid discrimination in employment and housing based on sexual orientation. The Cardinal has said he is opposed to the bill because it would ''legitimize a life style that stands in direct contradiction to the teaching of the Catholic Church.'' In his interview, the Cardinal said he had told the lay leaders that he wanted only to make clear the church's teachings, and would leave political strategy to them. ''You're going to have to determine whether, in accord with the mandates of the Second Vatican Council, you as lay persons are going to assume your role in public-policy issues,'' the Cardinal recalled saying. Some Council members contend at least one of the lay leaders went too far. During last month's contest for majority leader of the City Council, William D. Fugazy, chairman of Fugazy Express, the transportation company, and a board member of several archdiocesan organizations, called a half-dozen Council representatives to tell them of his support for Peter F. Vallone, the eventual winner. He also spoke of his concerns about the homosexual-rights bill. Some Council members thought he was expressing the Cardinal's position on the voting, though Mr. Fugazy said later that he was not calling on behalf of the Cardinal and had not invoked the Cardinal's name. However, Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democratic Councilwoman who represents parts of Manhattan and the Bronx, said Mr. Fugazy did use the Cardinal's name when he called her and linked the issue of the Council leadership with the Cardinal's opposition to the rights bill. ''He danced around the Cardinal issue,'' Mrs. Maloney said. ''He mentioned that Vallone was opposed to the legislation and the Cardinal was opposed to the legislation.'' Mr. Fugazy, told of Mrs. Maloney's account, said she misinterpreted their conversation. Cardinal O'Connor has since said that he authorized no one to speak on his behalf on the issue. Captivating Gestures And Tough Talk The Cardinal has most clearly altered the church's role in the city's life by being an energetic spokesman. After 31 years in the military chaplaincy - four of them as a bishop -and eight months as the bishop of Scranton, Pa., he was installed as the city's Archbishop on March 18, 1984, in a stately ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He immediately showed New Yorkers a dry wit and a flair for captivating gestures by donning a New York Yankee baseball cap in the pulpit of St. Patrick's and gently ribbing Mayor Koch with the question: ''Your honor, how am I doing?'' Since then, he has repeatedly spoken out against abortion, tangling with Mr. Cuomo and Geraldine A. Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, when he said he could not understand ''how a Catholic in good conscience can vote for a candidate who explicitly supports abortion.'' Both the Governor and Mrs. Ferraro said it was their duty in a pluralistic society to support the court-affirmed right of women to have abortions. As Archbishop and, after May 1985, as Cardinal, Mr. O'Connor has testifed at Congressional and other hearings on a range of issues, supporting more housing for the homeless and questioning the need for the MX missile. Unlike his last two predecessors, he preaches regularly at the 10 A.M. Sunday mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and his sermon is broadcast that night by WMCA radio. After the mass, he often meets with reporters. Cardinal O'Connor defends his assertiveness as perfectly appropriate within the traditional conduct of American political life. ''I get increasingly distressed that when Catholics express their views as citizens, there is in some sectors, a claim that we are attempting to impose our views on the rest of society,'' the Cardinal told Catholic New York, the archdiocesan newspaper, in an interview Jan. 13. ''But when other communities demand legislation that may be in conflict with church teaching,'' he said, ''this seems at times to be considered appropriate. Catholics are not second-class citizens.'' The teachings of the church, he said in another interview, will ''always jar with contemporary culture'' and so the church must often play an adversarial role. At the same time, he said, government officials have a duty to ''resist what they might see as encroachment by the church in their areas of responsibility.'' The church, the Cardinal suggested, should not abuse its intrinsic influence. ''I abhor the concept Powerhouse,'' he said, ''because it smacks of the use of money, manipulative approaches, threats, rewards, of knowing big people, prominent people who are able to bring leverage to bear, to punish and reward.'' ''If I wanted to carry out this thing called the Powerhouse, I don't have that background, I don't have those contacts,'' he said, pointing out that he came to the city from Scranton without the ties to influential New Yorkers that his two predecessors had. 2 Predecessors With Different Styles An appreciation of the role of the archdiocese today requires a comparison between Cardinal O'Connor's tenure and the robust era of Francis Cardinal Spellman and the more muted one of Cardinal Cooke. Cardinal Cooke, burdened for 20 years by the knowledge that he had cancer, was, according to former aides, a leader who preferred to work through the parishes and through his own bureaucracy rather than in the public arena. He was never comfortable with the press. Even church officials who served during the Cooke era, from 1968 to 1983, say he did not cultivate the kind of open relationship with City Hall that Cardinal O'Connor shares with Mayor Koch. Joseph A. Fallon, an assistant to former Mayor John V. Lindsay, whose term overlapped with the Cooke era, said that under Cardinal Cooke ''the archdiocese never used as much influence'' as it could have to take advantage of money for such social programs as drug education. Cardinal Spellman, on the other hand, was perceived as an extraordinarily powerful churchman who could seek assistance from influential friends in business and politics. Many city and church officials say that much of the aura of power that enveloped the Cardinal was a matter of perception rather than reality. Cardinal Spellman, they say, was essentially a shrewd manager and financial administrator who, from his installation as Archbishop in 1939 until he died in 1967, built scores of schools, churches and hospitals that continue to serve the city well. Yet others point to events in the Spellman era that gave his reputed power some credence. The book, ''The Power Broker,'' a biography of the public planner Robert Moses written by Robert Caro, tells of how Mr. Moses in 1955 turned over six acres of former slum housing on the edge of Lincoln Center to Fordham University, a Jesuit institution, ''virtually as a gift.'' Mr. Moses, the book contends, depended on the archdiocese for favors in getting his highways, bridges, tunnels, parks and housing projects built. But such accounts have been challenged as distorted. Msgr. Harry Byrne, who was in charge of the archdiocesan housing program under Cardinals Spellman and Cooke, recalls that the housing clearance that preceded the building of Lincoln Center wiped out much of the parish of St. Paul the Apostle Church at 415 West 59th Street. ''You got the impression,'' he said, ''that in view of this loss to the institution, maybe the Fordham campus would be a quid pro quo.'' A Different Church For Different Times The Rev. Edwin F. O'Brien, a former secretary to Cardinals Cooke and O'Connor and now the rector of St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, argues that the church's relationship to politics is distinctly different today from earlier eras. ''In the days of ward politics,'' he said, ''there were certain channels everyone went through if they wanted something, and the church was tied into those channels. It was done right in the neighborhoods.'' Those who remember the power the church once exerted can reel off the list of Catholic mayors and Democratic Party leaders until the mayoralty of John V. Lindsay in 1965. Many prominent Catholic laymen were active in church fund-raising and in the city's political and business life. City agencies like the Police and Sanitation Departments were dominated by Catholics, who were often discriminated against in private industry. But now, officials say, the political rules have changed and power is more diffuse. Politicians, using television, more often run their own campaigns independent of local political machines. Tickets for major elective offices are less frequently balanced along ethnic lines. The city and its bureaucracy are more diverse and standards on such moral issues as pornography have changed dramatically. The church that Cardinal O'Connor leads is also not the same church since the democratizing currents set free by the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65. Catholics today are more independent, willing to examine questions such as birth control or divorce according to their own consciences and the practical needs of their lives. ''Years ago, the bishop would be able to tell his people, 'Don't vote for so and so, because he voted this way,' '' said Gerald M. Costello, editor of Catholic New York. ''I can't imagine anyone doing that today.'' The Catholic population has also changed. Many Irish and Italian Catholics have left the city and been replaced by Hispanic and black Catholics who, one city official said, have not yet involved the church as vigorously in their political life. A Bigger Budget Than Most Cities The archdiocese's influence, however, is still rooted in its massive institutional presence in the city. ''That's why you respond to it just as you would to the head of Citibank,'' said Joseph A. Fallon, a Democratic district leader in the Yorkville section of Manhattan. If all the institutions affiliated with Catholic Charities are included, the archdiocese has an annual operating budget of $1.225 billion, larger than most cities. In running its institutions, the archdiocese and the city share a complex and symbiotic relationship. Like other religious groups, the Catholic Church depends on government to license and sometimes audit its institutions, to let doctors from its medical schools run city hospitals and to get the money its agencies are entitled to under various government programs. For example, about $17 million in Federal aid for remedial reading and other services for 10,000 parochial school students flows first through the Board of Education. At the same time, the city relies on the archidiocese for essential services. It pays the archdiocese more than $80 million a year to take care of foster and other children. The archdiocese educates 120,000 school children, a number that if forced to go to public schools, would overwhelm the city's school system. ''The city couldn't possibly deliver all the services they deliver,'' said Mayor Koch. ''They deliver it better than the city agencies could because I believe the extra element of religiosity that fills the bodies of men and women who work on behalf of the church is an extra positive dimension.'' Monsignors and priests in charge of hospitals or schools for the archdiocese regularly sit down with their city counterparts. Their dealings as one professional to another suggest that those who demand strict separation of church and state are unacquainted with the facts of life in a complex and diverse city. In its search for new political approaches, the Archdiocese has made some small but calculated thrusts to support community activism. In the sagging parishes of the Lower East Side and East Harlem, where still-imposing churches stand amid the desolation of abandoned housing, the archdiocese is helping residents rebuild 15 buildings forsaken by landlords and now owned by the city. The primary aim is housing. But there is a secondary purpose, one that also has the Cardinal's support. ''What we're doing is not just bricks and mortar,'' said the Rev. Donald Sakano, a 41-year-old social worker who directs the archdiocese's Office of Neighborhood Preservation. ''We're building people who can exert leadership in their communities, which has a ripple effect throughout the whole neighborhood.'' A former city commissioner who has observed the movement says that by taking such a role, the church is also giving itself more muscle in the city's political life. ''I'm not saying their primary motive isn't the Gospel,'' he said, ''but it also serves the purpose of remaining a major force in the city.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"TV REVIEWS; ABC PRESENTS 'CHOICES,''' DRAMA ABOUT ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/17/arts/tv-reviews-abc-presents-choices-drama-about-abortion.html,"TACKLING the volatile issue of abortion, ''Choices'' visits the playing fields of the very rich where, presumably, momentous decisions needn't be muddled by crass materialistic considerations. The ''ABC Theater'' presentation, at 9 this evening, carefully touches on the weightier arguments against and in favor of abortion rights, and then, in typical television-movie fashion, ends up squarely in the middle of things, with a smidgen of consolation for all sides. Commercial television is still squeamish about antagonizing potential consumers of any stripe. ''Choices'' stars George C. Scott as Evan Granger, a former judge who, even as he retires at age 62, ''still sits on every board in town.'' Evan lives quite grandly on Fifth Avenue, just below the Guggenheim Museum, with his second wife. Played by the always striking Jacqueline Bisset, Marisa, 38, is a former concert pianist and now a tour guide at the Whitney Museum. This Robert Halmi production, written by Judith Parker and directed by David Lowell Rich, positively trembles with culture. Evan and Marisa, blissfully happy for the nine years of their marriage, have a sumptuous country house and are planning to live in Greece for four months in a Corfu rental with six bedrooms and a pool. Life can indeed be comfortable. The trip has to be postponed, however, when Evan's 19-year-old daughter, Terry (Melissa Gilbert), arrives home from school and discovers that she is pregnant. The father is Scott (Steven Flynn), a medical student who spends most of his spare time playing croquet in East Hampton. Not wanting to force Scott into marriage, she decides to have an abortion, especially after he admits he is ''seeing'' someone else. Marisa is sympathetic, believing that the choice is Terry's. Evan, however, is furious, talking about the ''sanctity in a sexual relationship that produces a child.'' And Scott, when he finds out about the pregnancy, decides he wants to marry Terry even though he doesn't love her. The sides are thus neatly drawn -the two women against the two men - when the clear-cut issue is shattered with another development. Marisa becomes pregnant, and once again Evan is furious. In this instance, though, he argues for abortion, pointing out that he and Marisa had agreed never to have children. ''I am done with school plays and birthday parties for 2-year-olds,'' he fumes. Will Terry give in to her formidable father and marry the somewhat sappy Scott to have their baby? Will Marisa listen to her adamant husband and have the abortion to save their marriage? Will Evan be exposed as nothing more than a selfish and pompous hypocrite? Only one thing is certain: television will try to have it all ways. Mr. Scott keeps popping up in the movie like a guest star whose availability for the filming is limited. It feels as if the production was carefully shot around the actor to minimize demands on his time. One result is that much of the story is carried by Miss Bisset and Miss Gilbert, both of whom are impressively effective even as they grapple with the slippery script. Despite all the pretty outdoor shots of New York, incidentally, much of the film was made in Montreal. The cultural veneer of Manhattan is one thing; costs are another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO OPPOSES CARDINAL ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/17/nyregion/cuomo-opposes-cardinal-on-abortion.html,"Governor Cuomo and John Cardinal O'Connor are still at odds over abortion, the issue they clashed over during the 1984 Presidential campaign. ''I flat out think he's wrong,'' the Cardinal said in an interview. ''I don't think that makes him evil. It makes him wrong. He's made a serious effort to theologize his way through it, and I think he's been unsuccessful.'' Governor Cuomo said that ''some obvious misunderstandings'' have been cleared away, but that he has not changed his belief that a Catholic government leader in a pluralistic society should not impose his personal religious opposition to abortion on those he governs. Some political leaders who have followed the disagreement, such as Mayor Koch, suggest it may be more than philosophical. Asked to describe the Cardinal's relationship with the Governor, the Mayor said, ''I would characterize it as strained.'' A Statement and a Reply The conflict surfaced after Cardinal O'Connor said in a televised news conference on June 24, 1984, ''I don't see how a Catholic in good conscience can vote for a candidate who explicitly supports abortion.'' The issue grew in importance when Geraldine A. Ferraro, a Catholic who said she would uphold legalized abortion, was named the Democratic candidate for Vice President. Five weeks after the Cardinal spoke, Governor Cuomo publicly challenged him, saying the Cardinal was suggesting that no Catholic could vote for him, Mayor Koch or Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan - ''anybody who disagrees with him on abortion.'' The Cardinal replied that he was only making church teachings clear and letting voters decide whether a candidate's views were in accord with those teachings. On Sept. 13, Governor Cuomo defended his position in a speech at the University of Notre Dame, saying Catholic public officials know that ''to assure our freedom we must allow others the same freedom, even if it occasionally produces conduct by them which we would hold to be sinful.'' Medicaid Abortions Debated The best thing Catholics could do to diminish abortions, he said, would be to set an example for others through programs that help women avoid abortions. The Cardinal and the Governor have met on several occasions since, but have never resolved their argument. In a recent interview, the Cardinal said the Governor ''has a great deal to offer on other issues,'' but is misguided about abortion, which the Catholic Church compares to the taking of an innocent life. What especially troubles him, Cardinal O'Connor said, is that the Governor has not forcefully spoken out against the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and that he supports the state's financing for abortion through Medicaid ''without any constitutional requirement to do so.'' The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1980 that states have no obligation to pay for abortions. Governor Cuomo has said it would be discriminatory to deny women access to the procedure simply because they were poor. The Governor, in a telephone interview, said that while he agreed with the Catholic teaching against abortion, it was his ''prudential political judgment'' that a constitutional amendment barring abortions would only lead to illicit abortions and a contempt for law similar to that displayed during Prohibition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most U.S. Abortions Are in First Trimester,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/20/opinion/l-most-us-abortions-are-in-first-trimester-241486.html,"To the Editor: The Rev. Charles F. Kiloski's criticism of an editorial on abortion (letter, Feb. 8) was misleading because it created the impression that more than one million abortions are performed annually in the United States in the third trimester. He accomplishes this result by first citing a section of the Supreme Court's abortion decision regarding regulation of third-trimester abortions and then stating, ''It strains credibility to say there are over one million abortions annually in the interest of the mother's health or life.'' Apparently, Mr. Kiloski wants us to lose sight of the fact that 91.3 percent of all abortions in the U.S. are performed in the first trimester. His lament that the U.S. ''has the most permissive laws of any nation in the Western world'' is questionable. For instance, while Italy's liberalized abortion laws permit elective abortion only in the first trimester, any Italian woman over 18 is entitled to a state-funded abortion. Moreover, the 1.5 million abortions performed annually in the U.S. is a tiny fraction of the approximately 55 million performed annually throughout the world. In any event, I believe that no American woman should ever have to look to another country and ask when she will have the same rights as women there. STACY R.

High-Tech Babies: a Growth Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/21/opinion/hightech-babies-a-growth-industry.html,"Technological baby-making is increasingly being merchandised just like any other consumer product. State-of-the-art physicians, high-powered lawyers and fast-lane entrepreneurs are all working to make high-tech coupling big business. But the whole enterprise has created a mountain of legal and ethical questions. The nation must pause to address them. Artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, surrogate mothering and embryo transfer are old hat, of course, to animal breeders. They use them to improve livestock: faster horses, more productive cows, beefier cattle. A relatively small group of American fertility specialists now uses these techniques to make human babies. Unlike animal breeders, fertility specialists are producing ''wanted'' babies, not ''better'' ones. Their customer-patients are couples who have lost in nature's lottery and cannot conceive or carry a pregnancy to term. We can understand the desire of infertile couples for children and can sympathize with their desire to have children with whom they share some genetic identity. When in vitro fertilization combines the egg of the wife with the sperm of the husband and the embryo is reimplanted in the wife, genetic identity is not a problem. This situation is the easiest to accept because it has few legal, moral or psychological complications. However, when a pregnancy is induced with either a sperm or an egg that does not belong to the infertile couple, the identity of the baby's ''real'' mother or father becomes more problematical. When, as is pos- sible, the end-product baby involves five different adults, (two genetic parents, one gestational mother and two rearing parents), then the words ''mother'' or ''father'' becomes entirely inadequate. But questions such as these have not inhibited the entrepreneurs. Devices are patented, protective laws sought from state legislatures, marketing strategies prepared. Fertility services involve substantial amounts of money ($5,000 to $25,000) for each pregnancy. And the potential rewards are tempting. By some estimates, the market for reproductive technologies may involve as many as two million couples in the United States alone. Moreover, the increasing infertility seen among 20-year-olds (a rate that has tripled in the past 20 years) means that the market can only grow. But as the baby business is booming, legal and ethical questions are also multiplying. For example, embryos can be frozen for some period of time and then defrosted and implanted in a receptive uterus. While those embryos are outside the body, who decides what is to be done with them? Do they belong to the genetic parents or the entrepreneurs who provide the service? Do they belong to the state? And if we do not have an answer to the relatively simple question of who, if anyone, owns the embryo, the question of the moral status of the embryo is far more complex. Does it have rights? Do we have duties toward it? Do we owe an embryo an opportunity to develop so that it can go on to become a child? More questions arise. Are women entitled to make a profit for gestating a baby? Can unmarried men or women avail themselves of the new technology, thus having babies without creating families? Is using a women's sister or best friend as a surrogate or an egg donor better or worse than involving an anonymous third person? If the baby is born physically impaired or retarded, who has the responsibility? If the abnormality is detected by amniocentesis during gestation, should abortion be an option, and who should decide? Finally, how are the parties to this transaction to think about their actions? Is the child ever to know about the method of its birth? If so, how much information should the child have - only that which is deemed to be essential health-related data, or all of the other biographical information about its heritage that most of us value? Whose interests, whose preferences, whose needs count here? Born into a society that is already fragmented by divorce and confused about alternative life styles, morals and sexual choices, the child may well have serious identity problems at a later time. Does such a possibility have to be seriously considered by those who want to undertake unusual reproductive methods? What's wrong with technological baby-making is not just that couples are desperate and thus willing to act now and encounter the consequences later; not just that physicians are frustrated by their inability to meet patients' needs, and therefore embrace the new technology; and not just that businessmen are embarrassingly eager to make a profit on babies. What's wrong is that the law is unclear, the ethics controversial, the psychology uncertain. The interests and well-being of the baby-to-be-made seem to be the last issues considered, and sometimes (for example, when physicians promise anonymity to the donor or parents require it of the surrogate) seem not be be considered at all. Individuals contemplating in vitro fertilization, especially in its more complex variations, ought not only to seek out technical information but also give careful thought to the implications of reproductive technologies. It is important to clarify and weigh the varied and potentially conflicting interests - those of the doctors, clinics, parents, the state and the children-to-be. And it's important to think through possible outcomes, including less happy ones, to be able to assess rationally the risks and benefits of undergoing the procedure. There are approximately 125 infertility clinics now in business throughout the United States. Who should make policies concerning their practices? In Britain and Australia, national commissions have made recommendations and some laws have been passed. But the commissions did not always agree, for instance in their proposals about the use and control of frozen embryos. In the United States, we have had inadequate public discussion about appropriate legal policies, moral guidelines and medical practices. The new Biomedical Ethics Board and Biomedical Ethics Advisory Committee established by Congress under the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 have not yet named their members. When they do, reproduction technologies should be one of the first topics addressed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURSES AND DATA FOR WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/21/style/courses-and-data-for-women.html,"New York City's Commission on the Status of Women has issued two booklets that encompass women's interests. One is an updated version of the ''Guide to Women's Studies'' and the other is ''Legislative Achievements for Women in New York State: A 20-Year Retrospective.'' The spring 1986 issue of ''Guide to Women's Studies,'' now in its 14th edition, is, according to officials, the most comprehensive volume yet. The 83-page booklet lists more than 300 credit and noncredit courses of special interest to women, available from 60 institutions in the New York area from Columbia University to the 92d Street Y. There are some differences from previous editions. ''What's new is that we've been giving financial aid information, as well as a resource list on financial aid,'' said Maxine Gold, the director of public information for the commission, which advises the mayor on women's issues. The list of courses includes study of the feminine perspective of male-female relationships (at Medgar Evers College), women's lives as seen in modern film (the New School for Social Research) and a course on the myths and realities of Soviet women (Barnard College). One course, offered by Marymount Manhattan College, will provide a series of ''dinner dialogues'' with two authors, Kate Simon and Jane Howard. ''Some of them are purely feminist studies and very theoretical,'' Miss Gold said. ''Others are far more practical, like conflict management, effective leadership and women as managers. It really runs the gamut, from the sublime to the feet-on-the-ground, from the celestial to the terrestrial.'' Originally the plan for the publication on legislative achievements for women was to have covered 10 years, Ginny Vida, editor of the book, said, but the period covered was extended back to 1965, the year when the state added sex to the list of prohibited categories for discrimination. Offering a look back at a time when women were refused co-ownership of mortgages unless they could prove they were unable to bear chidren, when girls were not permitted to deliver newspapers, when women and not men had to pay to use public restrooms, the booklet gives the history of women's rights advocacy in the state. Laws enacted by the State Legislature during the two decades described in the book include ones related to civil rights, employment practices, maternity leave and pregnancy disability benefits, displaced homemakers, discrimination in education, exemptions for jury duty based on sex, credit, insurance, equitable distribution in divorce, child and spousal support enforcement, abortion and family planning, teen-age pregnancy, rape law reform and prison reform. The booklet also includes discussion of goals, including enactment of a state equal rights amendment, state grants for sex education that would help decrease teen-age pregnancy, efforts to increase day care services and insurance reform to abolish sex-based rates and benefits discrimination. Both volumes can be obtained from the commmission by sending a check or money order (the women's studies guide is $1.50; the legislative history is $5) to CSW Fund Inc., 52 Chambers Street, Suite 207, New York, N.Y. 10007.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV WEEKEND; 'BLOOD AND ORCHIDS' TO BE SHOWN ON CBS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/21/arts/tv-weekend-blood-and-orchids-to-be-shown-on-cbs.html,"THIS Sunday, the networks are again pulling out their big-production guns as their ratings skirmishes continue. At 8 P.M., NBC is offering a three-hour doomsday scenario called ''The Fifth Missile'' on Channel 4. At 9, ABC begins a glossy Hitler-cum-melodrama mini-series based on the Danielle Steel novel ''Crossings'' on Channel 7. And also at 9, on Channel 2, CBS will broadcast the first half of ''Blood and Orchids,'' a four-hour movie that will be concluded Monday night. For sheer old-fashioned theatrics, spiked with social significance and including Jane Alexander in a role that Joan Crawford would have envied, ''Blood and Orchids'' is by far the juiciest concoction in the lot. Norman Katkov's script, based on his novel of the same name, is an impressively deft cautionary tale about greed, one of the seven deadly sins that has been enjoying some brazen popularity in certain privileged sectors of the contemporary scene. The story takes place in 1937 in the United States Territory of Hawaii. Four Hawaiian men, ranging in age from 18 to 22, are finishing a night of partying when they come upon a badly battered Hester Murdoch (Madeline Stowe). They take her to a hospital. But when questions are asked, they panic and flee, fearing they will be blamed for the attack. The viewer knows from the opening scenes that Hester has been beaten by a Navy lieutenant, Bryce Parker (Matt Salinger), the best friend of her husband, Lieut. Lloyd Murdoch (William Russ). Hester had told Bryce that she was pregnant by him. He became infuriated when she refused to have an abortion. Unfortunately for the four Hawaiian Samaritans, Hester's mother is Doris Ashley, probably the richest and most influential denizen of Honolulu's haole, or white, establishment. That's where Miss Alexander comes in, warning her daughter that ''you are not going to destroy me with a scandal.'' She insists that Hester charge the four Hawaiians with rape. The supposed plight of the poor Navy officer's wife enrages not only the local establishment but also a good number of mainland bigots. Caught in the middle of this nasty affair is Curt Maddox, a bachelor police detective with a reputation for being a loner. He is played with down-to-earth toughness by Kris Kristofferson, who is aging nicely into what looks like a puffy, somewhat bruised Robert Stack and sounds like John Wayne. Maddox is pressed by powerful interests to bring the Hawaiians quickly to trial, but when the detective begins having doubts about their guilt, he finds himself threatened. Meanwhile, the accused have found a lawyer, Tom Halehone (James Saito), a seemingly timid Hawaiian who is thought too weak to battle powerful interests. With the battle lines drawn, ''Blood and Orchids,'' directed by Jerry Thorpe for Lorimar Productions, robustly roots for the underdogs as it exposes the diseased underbelly of power and exploitation. While Doris and her friends chat only half jokingly about governing through ''divine right,'' the Hawaiian Princess Luahine (Haunani Minn) speaks bitterly of how exploitation by the sons of white missionaries has reduced her people to one big work force of cheap labor. Sunday's episode ends with a shocking development, neatly calculated to bring viewers back Monday, when Jose Ferrer arrives as a lawyer for the establishment with Sean Young playing his young wife, whose affair with the dour Maddox will be no more convincing than his affair with a waitress (Susan Blakely) in the first part. But TV movies, evidently, must have their love interests, no matter how pointless. Still, ''Blood and Orchids'' captures a remarkably authentic sense of period and Miss Alexander, coldly elegant in her relatively small role, creates a scheming villain with an aplomb that leaves Joan Collins looking like an amateur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOOKS OF THE TIMES; A Playwright's Journal,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/22/books/books-of-the-times-a-playwright-s-journal.html,"AN UNNATURAL PURSUIT & OTHER PIECES. By Simon Gray. Illustrated. 244 pages. St. Martin's Press. $15.95. No doubt few American readers have seen Simon Gray's play ''The Common Pursuit,'' which had a few weeks' run at London's Lyric Theater, Hammersmith, a year and a half ago, and which has as yet received neither a West End nor a New York production. Inspired in part by the experiences of Mr. Gray's friend Ian Hamilton, who once ran a small but influential literary magazine, the play examines the unraveling lives, ambitions and dreams of five gifted Cambridge students, who leave behind the university, and their high-minded intellectual ideals, for the more pragmatic rewards and frustrations of the London literary world: talk-show appearances, petty journalistic assignments, lucrative book offers, as well as ''the routine stuff of English social comedy'' - ''love affairs, abortions, adulteries, treacheries, compromises, lingering deaths, sudden deaths.'' While working on the show, Mr. Gray decided to keep a running account of his impressions - spoken, each night, into a tape recorder -and the edited result, garnished with a few additional essays, is this book. The journals start on the day that Mr. Gray finished writing ''The Common Pursuit'' and end nine months later with the closing of the show; and while such a format makes for occasional patches of dullness - the casting sessions, for instance, tend to blur together into a repetitious morass of trial and error - the volume, for the most part, resembles the play: It's witty, episodic and, even for the reader unfamiliar with the actual show, highly entertaining. ''An Unnatural Pursuit,'' after all, not only furnishes a detailed account of the travails involved in a specific production - from negotiating with reluctant producers to fine-tuning actors' accents and inflections - but in doing so, also provides the reader with a wonderfully palpable sense of what it's like to work in the English theater and what it's like to be a writer in London today. The dynamics of financing and producing a show, the process of rewriting and shaping a play during rehearsals, and the emotional parabolas experienced by the company and cast prior to and following opening night are all chattily sketched in by Mr. Gray in quick subjective strokes, as are his more personal concerns, such as not being able to find a cab in London and avoiding trendy restaurants filled with other writers. Besides being a memoirist with a gift for making the reader see everything from his own point of view, Mr. Gray is, of course, an inveterate playwright - as skilled, it turns out, at dramatizing his own dilemmas and worries as those of his fictional creations. In a charming essay included at the end of this volume (titled ''My Cambridge''), he describes himself as a young man who was a ''total liar'' - a phony esthete, a ''fraud, of ever-increasing fluency,'' who had ''polished opinions on novels, poems, plays, films and all pieces of music, including those I hadn't read, seen or heard.'' And that same impulse toward self-mocking caricature animates the self-portrait in the journals. Indeed, Mr. Gray tends to come across here as one of his own put-upon heros - at times, an unkempt Butley, egotistical, manic and frustrated by the sheer intractability of the world; at times, a more detached Simon (in ''Otherwise Engaged''), clever, successful, but nonetheless besieged by upsetting people and events. By turns self-deprecating and demanding, petulant and apologetic, Mr. Gray vacillates wildly between feelings of entitlement (''Surely people understand that when one hands them a script, one expects them to read it within minutes, and comment on it both profoundly and favourably for weeks afterwards'') and rejection (could it be, he wonders, ''that actors had been turning us down not only because none of the parts was a star part but also because they don't like the characters?''), his emotions ricocheting off the slightest hint of trouble or indifference. The producer Michael Codron fails to call him back immediately after reading his play, and Mr. Gray spends a night fuming, ''then attempted to exonerate him on comforting grounds, i.e. his plane had crashed, he'd been mugged.'' The play's director, Harold Pinter, suggests that Mr. Gray's picture be cut out of the program in order to include one of an actor, and the playwright has a fit of indignation, made all the worse by Mr. Pinter's ''boiling reasonableness.'' A run-through ends earlier than expected, and Mr. Gray starts wondering ''does that mean the play is too short? Will we have to stretch it out with heavy pauses, long and complicated moves, numerous curtain calls?'' Needless to say, by opening night the playwright is something of a wreck - his impatience has given way to paranoia, his anxiety to self-recrimination, fatalism and a general sense of dread. Given Mr. Gray's tendency to italicize his own emotions, the reader is inclined to take all this in with a sort of bemused curiosity, already convinced, as Mr. Pinter writes in a foreword, that the playwright's ''not nearly such a pain as his self-portrait would have you believe.''

THE CHANGING WOMEN'S MARRIAGE MARKET,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/22/style/the-changing-women-s-marriage-market.html,"Women who defer marriage to go to college and pursue a career are finding that by the time they decide to marry, the marriage market has, in effect, evaporated, according to a new study by two Yale sociologists and a Harvard economist. College-educated white women who have not married by the time they are 25 years old have only a 50 percent chance of marrying, according to the unpublished study, which analyzes census data from 70,000 households. Just 20 percent of the women who reach the age of 30 without marrying can be expected to marry, 5 percent of those who reach the age of 35 without marrying will marry, and for those beyond 40, ''perhaps 1 percent'' will marry, the study showed. And in general, a lower percentage of the total population of women are marrying these days, the study showed. Yale Sociologist's Analysis ''I think people up until this point have suspected that well-educated women were deferring marriage,'' said one of the sociologists who conducted the study, Dr. Neil G. Bennett, an associate professor of sociology at Yale University. ''However, it appears from this analysis that much of this marriage deferral is translating into marriage forgone.'' ''Many women are investing a lot of time in higher education and pursuing careers, and in the process they're deferring marriage,'' he added. ''We are finding out that it reaches a point eventually where the marriage market in effect falls out from under them.'' Dr. Bennett said the reasons that fewer women are marrying are complex. Essentially, the study showed that many women, after deferring marriage, find that by the time they want to marry, there are fewer available men to choose from. Those available are either not the kind of men the women want to marry, or the men prefer women who are younger, not as highly educated or not as successful. Sociologists and psychologists who were asked about the results of the survey said that although it was impossible to verify its statistical conclusions until it was published, the results seemed to bear out some current theories about marriage patterns. ''The cultural pattern is still for men to choose women who are not their equals, even though women are increasingly becoming their equals in their careers and their education,'' said Dr. Laurel Richardson, a sociology professor at Ohio State University who has written a new book on single women and their options, ''The New Other Woman'' (The Free Press, $17.95). Dr. Richardson said that her research had found a dearth of available men for older women in the United States. For example, for every 223 unmarried women in their 40's, there are only 100 unmarried men in their 40's, she said, and for every 10 women 40 to 49 years old with a college education, there are only 3 single men who are older and better educated. The new Yale-Harvard study showed that in part because of this imbalance, the number of college-educated women who marry has dropped significantly, Dr. Bennett said. ''Whereas only 9 percent of college-educated women born in the mid-1930's never got married, it appears that 22 percent of college-educated women born in the mid-1950's can be expected to never marry,'' he said. These results were especially striking, Dr. Bennett said, because in most other subgroups of the population, 90 percent of the women married at some point. The 37-page study was conducted over the past year by Dr. Bennett, Dr. Patricia H. Craig, another Yale sociologist, and Dr. David E. Bloom, an economics professor at Harvard. It examined the data gathered from the Census Bureau's June 1982 Current Population Survey and drew on several other surveys that reflect changes in current marriage patterns. The researchers used a mathematical device called a parametric model that, based on past and present marriage patterns, is supposed to project what proportion of the women covered by the survey would marry and at what age. The model also estimated what percentage of women would never marry. A Matter of Choice? The study did not establish why women surveyed did not marry. It did not show, for example, if the women chose not to or if they could not find suitable husbands. ''It could very well be that many women who reach age 30 having not married are quite content never to marry,'' Dr. Bennett said. ''For some group of women, just as with some group of men who never marry, there will be some lack of emotional fulfillment, but we just don't know, by virtue of our data, just how much heartache there is out there.'' ''Also, it may well be that men are continuing to make unrealistic demands of well-educated, career-oriented women, demands to which men themselves would never accede,'' he added. ''And that may be why many of these women are not marrying.'' The report offers a number of explanations for its results. Dr. Bloom, the Harvard economist, attributed what he called the ''huge decrease'' in the number of women who marry primarily to their increased participation in the labor market. About 55 percent of the women over the age of 16 are in the labor force in 1986, compared with 34 percent in 1950 and 36 percent in 1955. ''The fundamental point is both marriage and work are very time-intensive,'' Dr. Bloom said. ''Essentially, it's hard to do both.'' ''It turns out that a lot of those women who thought they were delaying marriage subsequently find out that their marriageability declines,'' he added. ''They find it difficult to find a marriageable partner, and they themselves become less interested in marriage because of the life style they develop.'' There are also fewer reasons for a woman to marry, Dr. Bloom said. Women are more financially independent. Contraception and the legality and growing acceptance of abortion have also ''freed women from the child-bearing function to an extent that is unprecedented in history,'' he added. ''Women don't have to get married to have children, and they don't have to avoid marriage in order to avoid having children.'' Historically, Dr. Bennett said, women expected to marry someone with ''higher accomplishments'' and higher educational attainments than themselves, and, conversely, men in the past expected to marry women who ''weren't quite their equals and were willing to stay home and take care of the household and take care of the kids.'' ''These expectations are changing and must change further,'' he added. ''In effect, there has to be a meeting of the minds; otherwise many more people will go unmarried.'' The study did not examine men and their marriage patterns because, Dr. Bennett said, the Census Bureau's data supplied by men were untrustworthy. ''It appears that when men are asked about their marital status on surveys, if they are actually divorced, they may say they have never been married,'' he said. ''This is presumably because many men do not pay their child support, and they're afraid that the government will pursue them if this was found out.'' The study also showed that, contrary to what is commonly thought, women are not getting married much later than they used to. Dr. Bennett said the average marrying age of college-educated white women born in the mid-1930's was 23. The average age of women from the same group born in the mid-1950's was 24. A handful of single women who were asked about the results of the survey said they found them ''depressing.'' A few said there was a genuine scarcity of men. But others said they believed the survey did not reflect a lack of opportunity for women as much as their increasing selectivity. Similar Education and Goals ''I don't want to sound like a snob, but if you're college-educated and pursuing a career and trying to achieve something, right away half the men in the world are no longer interesting to you,'' said Liza Gaynor, a 26-year-old Yale graduate who is starting her own company in Manhattan. ''You want a man who is as educated, as ambitious and as interested in achieving something as you are.'' ''I think the main point is that women are refusing to lower their standards,'' said Elizabeth Boucher, a 26-year-old Wall Street stockbroker. ''There are plenty of guys out there who want to get married, but it's a question of whether it's the kind of guy you want to marry.'' And, as Miss Boucher pointed out, women also said they felt little pressure to get married, either for economic or emotional reasons. ''I think women are much less frightened of going out and being alone,'' she said. ''They get so much satisfaction from other parts of their lives that they don't rely so heavily anymore on the man in their life.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE FRON RUNNER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/magazine/the-fron-runner.html,"IN THE EVENING DARKNESS, WITH his latest mission for President Reagan behind him, George Bush stares across his private cabin aboard Air Force Two as its four powerful engines roar in the background. The Vice President has the wary look of a marathon runner just before the biggest race of his life. Though the primaries are two years off, Mr. Bush is clearly running for his party's nomination, and the words that tumble out of his mouth, like his expression, reinforce the notion. After five years in Ronald Reagan's shadow, Mr. Bush has launched a drive to succeed the President, and he has done it with intensity. For the record, Mr. Bush is playing it close to the vest because he officially becomes a candidate only when he declares. But no one should get the impression that he doesn't want to be President. ''America faces many challenges,'' he says, sounding very much like a campaigner. ''So long as I may be considered qualified to meet those challenges I am eager to do so. It's just as simple as that.'' Mr. Bush, party insiders say, is the clear front-runner for the Republican nomination. ''Right now, it's his to lose,'' says an aide to President Reagan. It is also clear Mr. Bush is determined to hold that position. He is gathering a trusted and savvy staff around him, has formed a political action committee to raise money and spread the word, has installed operatives in key primary states, and in the last few months has gone on a vigorous speech-making offensive aimed at broadening his support in the Republican Party's conservative ranks. The Vice President has also furthered his cause by serving the President with unflagging loyalty and energy. He has logged more than 750,000 miles preaching the Reagan gospel, and has taken it upon himself to defend his boss's most controversial ac-tions - for instance, Mr. Reagan's visit last year to a German cemetery where S.S. officers are buried. White House officials say that Mr. Reagan would anoint Mr. Bush without hesitation as the one most suited to carry his conservative revolution into the next decade, were it not for the President's role as party leader and his desire to stay above the political fray. It is clear that Mr. Bush has made inroads into the party's conservative factions, which have in the past regarded him with suspicion. In fact, several recent surveys by Republican organizations showed that he is the first choice of party conservatives, that he is preferred by more Republicans than the combined percentage of those likely to oppose him in a primary, and that he is also rated above any of the most frequently mentioned Democratic contenders. Sitting in the cabin of his plane after discarding his dark business-suit jacket for the more personal flight jacket with ''George Bush Vice President'' on it, Mr. Bush told a visitor: ''I feel fairly comfortable with where I stand. That isn't to say that I can't do better personally or I can't pick up support in one area or another where I might not have it right now. But I'm relaxed with myself.'' Within the political community, however, a suspicion lingers that Mr. Bush, who lost when he sought the Republican nomination for President in 1980 and was a loser twice while running for the United States Senate from Texas, stands to become the Walter F. Mondale of 1988. That is, the party front-runner, with the money and organization, but without a message that voters are seeking. Beyond support for the Reagan agenda, in fact, it is unclear exactly what Mr. Bush's message is. Both the Vice President and his aides concede this, but contend that Mr. Bush most definitely has a message. But to spell it out now would risk upstaging Mr. Reagan, they say. What is more, in an apparent attempt to be all things to all Republicans, Mr. Bush has created an identity problem. In one recent week, for example, despite the concerns of some conservative supporters, he joined civil-rights leaders for an emotional tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, joining in their cry of ''We Shall Overcome.'' Three days later, he was among several hundred cheering at a dinner of the New York State Conservative Party. The day after that, he appeared in Washington before the Liberty Federation and praised its founder, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, for his ''moral vision'' for America. What is clear in any detailed assessment of his chances to hold the lead, is that his most formidable opponent is not necessarily one of a scattering of potential challengers, but George Herbert Walker Bush himself. HE JOURNEY THAT THE 61-year-old Vice President has embarked upon, at perhaps the most critical point in his career, is being taken without a complete road map. The strategy that he and his aides have devised involves a series of tactics rather than a detailed plan. ''The two major elements of the strategy in 1979 were to build upon George Bush's broad Government experience and experience in Republican politics and to concentrate on early and in-depth organizational efforts in the early primary and caucus states,'' says Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, who was then Mr. Bush's campaign manager. This time, aides believe that Mr. Bush can garner the nomination on the strength of an appeal to all elements within the Republican Party and then win the general contest with a similar multifaceted approach. Moreover, they believe that Mr. Reagan's policies, and Mr. Bush's strong identification with them, will provide an important election benefit. ''Front-runner is a very precarious situation, but if you know how to proceed, it's the best place to be,'' said Lee Atwater, the director of Mr. Bush's political action committee and a former top political adviser to Mr. Reagan. Mr. Bush's plans call for following the script he used in the 1982 midterm elections, when he traveled the country vigorously campaigning for Republican candidates and serving as Mr. Reagan's stand-in. About 150 such trips are planned this year, roughly the same number taken four years ago. On the advice of Mr. Baker, one of a small core of behind-the-scenes advisers for the Vice President, and other strategists who are publicly working for Mr. Bush, some other tactical decisions have been made. Gone, for example, are most of those who served in staff positions during Mr. Bush's first term as Vice President, such as retired Adm. Daniel J. Murphy, his chief of staff; Peter Teeley, press secretary, and J. Steven Rhodes, chief domestic policy adviser. They have been replaced by a team operating out of two locations. Craig L. Fuller, who worked for Mr. Reagan, now serves as the Vice President's chief of staff in the Executive Office Building, and Marlin Fitzwater, another Reagan staff alumnus, is press secretary. There is also a group of strategists at Mr. Bush's political action committee that includes Mr. Atwater, Helen Cameron, who was in charge of voter registration in the 1984 Reagan campaign, and Ron Kaufman, special assistant to Mr. Atwater. Mr. Bush also receives advice from such longtime associates as the poll-taker Robert Teeter; Dean Burch, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Nicholas Brady, a former New Jersey Senator . The forward-sounding Fund for America's Future has its headquarters on the third floor of a Washington office building eight blocks from the White House. Large color pictures of Mr. Bush dot the walls, and about 20 paid staff members and numerous volunteers are hard at work there. Since its creation by Mr. Bush last May, the fund, which has representatives in each of the 50 states, has raised more than $3.9 million through direct-mail solicitations, contributions from supporters and fund-raising events. The money is slated for the campaigns of Republican candidates in Senate, House and state races this November. The Vice President can expect this generosity to be repaid politically. The fund can also easily shift gears and raise money for Mr. Bush's own election. Mr. Bush has taken other steps, including the establishment of an office in Michigan, and the dispatching of staff workers to New Hampshire and Iowa, where key early primaries will be held. He has also visited Michigan, the site of precinct delegate contests that are viewed as the start of the primary process, five times since the 1984 election and plans another trip next month. But the major tactic in Mr. Bush's quest for the nomination involves his relationship with Mr. Reagan. At almost every stop on his travels, this point is made in introductions of Mr. Bush: that he is loyal and that he is close to the President. The ability of Mr. Bush to present himself in such a manner has greatly enhanced his political standing, his aides say. Although the relationship between the two men is largely private, aides for both say there is a geniune closeness, even affection, between them. Last February, Mr. Reagan, in what came close to an endorsement of Mr. Bush as his successor, called him the ''finest Vice President I ever have any recollection of.'' ''The President would endorse him in the minute,'' said one top Reagan aide, noting that he has a longstanding pledge against taking sides in intraparty contests. Although the interplay between the two men and the advice Mr. Bush provides in weekly lunches between the two and during daily national security briefings is secret, aides to the Vice President point to several incidents to describe the relationship between him and the President. They tell of how genuinely upset Mr. Bush became last spring - the angriest they have ever seen him - when word leaked about his advice to the President on retaining special tax breaks for oil and gas exploration during the development of the tax-simplification plan later offered to Congress. ''He wanted the President to know that he wasn't going to suddenly start to find a way to put into print what he was recommending in small and private meetings,'' Craig Fuller recalls. Aides also mention Mr. Bush's decision to wade into the controversy last May surrounding the President's visit to Bitburg cemetery in West Germany. The Vice President decided to act after his wife, Barbara, told him she had received criticism of the visit while speaking in New York. Marlin Fitzwater recalls that, ''He said, 'I have been stewing at home and worrying about it and I'm damn tired of people not sticking up for the President.' '' Mr. Bush then typed a speech in defense of the President that was later delivered, with few changes, to the United States Chamber of Commerce. The relationship with Mr. Reagan has given Mr. Bush acceptance among Republican conservatives and hard-liners who, in recent years, have been the party's most active element. They range from Mr. Falwell and Congressman Robert K. Dornan of California on the far right to Angela M. Buchanan Jackson, who served as treasurer of two Reagan Presidential campaigns and is considered in the mainstream of the conservative ranks. ''George Bush has had a historical problem with the right wing of this party,'' says Mr. Atwater. ''The type of problem that deprived Bush of being able to win in 1980 when he knocked Reagan down,'' he said, referring to Mr. Bush's upset victory in the Iowa primary. ''That problem is by and large behind him.'' But, the aide continued, ''Is he the hero of the right or is he going to get a hundred percent?'' ''No,'' the aide answered, reflecting the prevailing view of the political community. I T IS THE POTENTIAL candidacy of Representative Jack Kemp of New York, who Mr. Bush refuses to criticize even in private, that generates the most concern within the Vice President's camp. Some advisers believe that, unlike other possible challengers, such as Senator Bob Dole of Kansas or former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, Mr. Kemp can mount a strong campaign as the ideological heir to the President and also has a base on the right from which to launch an assault on Mr. Bush. A desire to prove his conservative mettle was the prime motive for Mr. Bush's appearances at a number of conservative gatherings in recent months in which he promoted his credentials in sharp language. In a speech in New York, he blasted ''every two-bit punk with a knife or a gun who mugs a cleaning lady.'' At a gathering of Mr. Falwell's Liberty Federation in Washington, he hailed the evangelist. ''America is in crying need of the moral vision you will bring to our political life,'' the Vice President told Mr. Falwell. In December, Mr. Bush even spoke at a tribute to the late William Loeb, the staunchly right-wing New Hampshire publisher who bitterly opposed him in the 1980 campaign. These speeches have come at a critical period in which Mr. Kemp is seeking to gain a foothold of his own. The Bush plan is to cut off any possible confrontation with Mr. Kemp in the months ahead and focus instead on campaigning for Republicans and serving as Mr. Reagan's surrogate. But Mr. Bush has already run into a barrage of pointed - and unexpected - criticism. After the Vice President's speech in New York, the conservative columnist George F. Will wrote, ''The unpleasant sound Bush is emitting as he traipses from one conservative gathering to another is a thin, tinny 'arf' -the sound of a lap dog.'' Mr. Bush said he was ''surprised'' by the personal nature of the Will attack, and aides say privately that they believe it was an isolated incident that will quickly be forgotten. Yet it underscores the doubts some conservatives have with the Vice President and the danger that can occur to a politician, even when venturing into what appear to be safe waters. ''The lesson we learned is that we have to be careful and view all that the Vice President does from the perspective of 1988,'' said Mr. Fitzwater. Mr. Bush said recently of the speech: ''Certainly, the people who were there for the most part seemed to think it was all right. But did it turn out the way I wanted? Obviously, no.'' While not disputing the breadth of Mr. Bush's support within the Republican Party, strategists for some potential opponents question its depth. Moreover, they explain, their own main tactic for now is to depend heavily on Mr. Bush stumbling badly. ''If this guy falters some place early, what does he fall back on?'' said a top strategist for one rival, who did not want his name to be used. A S MR. BUSH DIS-cusses such a flap, the words that come out are not just defensive, they are downright exasperated. George Bush has grown weary of explaining his motives and his political philosophy. Any ''fair-minded'' analysis of his record, Mr. Bush argues, would show him to be a conservative. ''In the first place, my appearances before the Conservative Party aren't something new,'' he says. ''There seems to be a new focus on it in certain quarters, but I think that has to do with speculation about '88 and not the reality. ''Similarly, with Falwell,'' he says, ''I've done events with Falwell. So what we are seeing is a continuation of what I've been doing, not just with the right wing but with other constituencies. What I say is what I believe, whether it is at a moderate forum or a conservative forum.'' It is not so much what Mr. Bush says before groups of various Republican persuasions, however, as it is the tone of his remarks, which reinforces the notion that he is playing to the audience more than stating a strong political belief. For example, at a dinner in Washington last July given by the Ripon Society, a moderate Republican organization, Mr. Bush -whose appearance was opposed by some of his own staff - argued for tolerance within the party ranks. ''It's because of our ability to debate reasonably with one another, because of the solid foundation of common principles that pulls us together, because of the fermentation of thought that this combination of unity, diversity and tolerance within our ranks has fostered - it's because of all this that in the last decade our party has become the party of ideas in America,'' he told Ripon Society members. At a memorial service in Atlanta last month, on the first legal holiday for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Bush told an overflow crowd: ''We will work to let freedom ring throughout the earth so that we may carry forward the legacy of Martin Luther King, so that America's message of freedom, hope and democracy is heard wherever men and women can hear, and so that governments of the people, by the people and for the people -the only sure and ultimate guarantees of justice - come to characterize all the earth.'' Next to Mr. Bush on the podium in Atlanta was Anglican Bishop Desmond M. Tutu of South Africa, who Mr. Falwell had branded as a ''fraud.'' In the battle for the party's right, Jack Kemp's supporters have argued that their man is a purer conservative than Mr. Bush because he was an early supporter of Mr. Reagan's economic program, while Mr. Bush - then an opponent - lambasted it as ''voodoo economics.'' They say that Mr. Bush voted for gun-control legislation while a Texas Congressman in the late 1960's. They point to Mr. Kemp's co-sponsorship of a human-life amendment against abortion. Mr. Bush's position on abortion has, by his own admission, not been consistent. In 1980, he supported abortion when pregnancy results from rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger - a stance clearly at odds with Mr. Reagan's. By 1984, when Mr. Bush came out against abortion, he at first claimed that he could not recall his earlier position. During the televised debate with Geraldine A. Ferraro, he said that there had been an ''evolution'' of his thinking as the result of 15 million abortions since 1973. ''I support the President's position - and am comfortable with it, from a moral standpoint,'' he said. But the level of his conservative ''purity'' is only one of the major issues facing the Vice President in his journey. Another, and perhaps more fundamental one, is whether Mr. Bush has a vision or message to galvanize public support. Not since the 1980 campaign has he had to answer that question. And even then, aides acknowledge, what Mr. Bush stood for never fully reached the public. Ron Kaufman, who in 1980 was head of his Massachusetts organization, had this observation: ''When he ran in 1980, the first part of the campaign was to establish the George Who, and I think he did a good job. We never changed gears quickly enough to the George What. That perhaps made George Bush kind of muddled.'' ''You need an independent identity and it's tough to do when your stock in trade is loyalty to the Administra-tion,'' says a leading Republican strategist who hasn't made a choice for 1988. ''It's not impossible, but he needs a message, a message that looks forward optimistically, the way the President does better than anyone. That's the missing link.'' Another Republican Party loyalist working in the White House sums up Mr. Bush this way: ''He strikes me as one who wants to keep on keeping on.'' Aides to Mr. Bush say that he does have a message and that it will emerge when the timing is more appropriate. ''I don't think that he is unwilling to let people know where he stands,'' said Craig Fuller. ''But he doesn't want to do it in a way that will ever cause the President to question their relationship. He is very comfortable with an operating style that maximizes his effectiveness as a Vice President, even if, at times, it might not work to his long-term political advantage.'' Robert Teeter says: ''There is no question in my mind that in 1988, George Bush has got to tell the country what he thinks and where he will lead. But for an incumbent Vice President, it is not the thing to do. There is no reason.'' M OST MODERN American political leaders have been clearly defined. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were seen as being driven by the cold pursuit of power; Jimmy Carter as a populist who evolved from humble origins. And Ronald Reagan - the clearest of all - as a dynamic figure motivated by strong ideological tenets. To the public, Mr. Bush seems to lack this sharp definition. ''Basically, he is an achiever in this sense - he has lofty goals and reaches for them and once he obtains them moves on,'' says Mr. Teeley, the Vice President's former press secretary and now a Washington-based consultant who continues to serve as an adviser to the Mr. Bush. According to Nicholas Brady, one of Mr. Bush's most trusted confidants: ''He's not an ideologue in any sense. His philosophy centers around what's fair and what's appropriate and a right sense of proportion.'' Friends and associates describe Mr. Bush as being driven by different motives. Some assert that he is ''mission-oriented.'' Others cite a strong sense of public duty and patriotism. Still others point to a willingness to take risks and a strong sense of compassion. Mr. Teeley notes, for example, that as a child Mr. Bush's nickname was ''Have-half,'' derived from his practice of sharing half of whatever he had with friends. What perhaps makes Mr. Bush difficult to define is that he is a product of several vastly different experiences. He grew up in Greenwich in an atmosphere that one aide described as ''good family, good education and good manners.'' He was the son a United States Senator from Connecticut, Prescott Bush, and a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. After World War II, from which he returned a decorated Navy pilot, Mr. Bush attended Yale, where he was captain of the baseball team and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in economics. He then settled in Texas, where he became a self-made millionaire in the booming oil business. In 1964, Mr. Bush, in effect, retired from business to pursue a career in politics and public service. He ran for the United States Senate that year and lost. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1966 and 1968 before losing a second bid for the Senate in 1970. He subsequently served as chief United States delegate to the United Nations; as chairman of the Republican National Committee; as head of the United States liaison office in Peking, and as Director of Central Intelligence. In public, Mr. Bush projects aspects of all three ''lives.'' Privately, he shows a sensitivity to what he calls the ''myths'' that they have spawned, including the one he resents the most - that he is a preppy. When asked about where he buys his suits, he is quick to point out that they are not from Brooks Brothers, but from Arthur A. Adler in Washington and Norton Ditto in Houston. ''You think of me as wearing button-down shirts,'' he said on a recent flight from Florida to Andrews Air Force Base. ''Well, I haven't owned a button-down shirt in 10 years. You think of striped ties - I might have, I don't want to be going into much depth on my wardrobe but I'd say, 3, possibly 2 percent of the ties I've got are striped. ''Gucci shoes?'' he asks, removing a shoe to read the label inside. ''Is that your basic Gucci shoe? It's your basic 11D, very sensible-looking, Middle American shoe.'' Mr. Bush has other image problems. Unlike the President, he is not a man for the cameras. In front of them, he seems to lack assurance. When making a key point, his voice can rise to the point of shrillness, and occasionally - as in his debate with Geraldine Ferraro, when he appeared to be lecturing his opponent - he comes across as a bully. While contending that it did him no lasting harm, Mr. Bush says now of his performance throughout the campaign: ''Should I have been more pleasant? Yes. I should have continued to smile and that's one of the things I would have done differently.'' Aides have also begun working with Mr. Bush to overcome his habit of ad-libbing in speeches, a result of trying to maintain eye contact with the audience. In doing so, he often strays from the text and ends up paraphasing the words, thus losing some of their impact. In recent months, he has been using a Teleprompter and taking a larger role in the preparation of his speeches. On the Bush staff there is no Michael K. Deaver, Mr. Reagan's much-touted image man, who recently left the Administration to start a public relations business. That role is largely Mr. Bush's own, although Mr. Fuller and Mr. Fitzwater provide advice. ''I can't imagine Mr. Reagan without a Mike Deaver and I can't imagine Mr. Bush with a Mike Deaver,'' says one Bush adviser. Sitting by a pool during a major Western swing that Mr. Bush made last fall, a senior adviser recalled how the Vice President had once donned a pair of contact lenses and had rejected them with an ''I can't live with them.'' ''That's the way he is,'' the adviser said, ''take it or leave it.'' Mr. Bush enjoys verbal sparring with the press corps. Yet when he does, only a few insights emerge, a few pieces of a mosaic rather than a complete picture of the man. As a child, the Vice President says, he had no interest in politics. As a young adult, fresh out of the Navy and Yale, he struggled on an income of $300 a month. But still he preferred taking his chances in the risky oil-field supply business in Texas to a more comfortable position in New York. The Bushes - she, the daughter of the publisher of McCall's magazine; he, a Navy flier on leave - were married in 1945 in her hometown of Rye, N.Y. They have five children: George, 39, of Midland, Tex.; John 33, of Miami; Neil, 31, of Denver; Marvin, 29, of Alexandria, Va., and Dorothy Bush LeBlond, 26, who lives in Cape Elizabeth, Me. While Barbara Bush is influential in her husband's decisions, friends say, it is not in the manner of Rosalyn Carter, who served as an adviser to Jimmy Carter, or Nancy Reagan, who serves as a protector to her husband. Barbara Bush declines to discuss her views on key issues, saying that she is not the candidate. When asked if she would play a role in Mr. Bush's decision about his political future, she would only say: ''It would not be a family war council that makes the key, or some of them, domestic decisions. They evolve.'' The Bushes appear very much at ease together. While returning to Washington from a brief visit to Houston last fall, they sat comfortably on the Vice President's plane, eating yogurt, trading good-natured banter. Has her husband changed over the years, Mrs. Bush is asked. ''No, but I keep hoping,'' is the response - and they reminisced about their early, bittersweet days in Midland. ''Midland was new people, new faces, new ventures,'' said Mr. Bush. He had come to the west Texas town in 1948, fresh out of college. ''I helped to start the Y.M.C.A., was a director of the bank and helped raise money for a theater. We were participating in the wonderful expansion of a wonderful community. It was a tremendous experience.'' But one of the Bushes' most difficult years occurred in that period, when their daughter Robin died of leukemia in 1953, at the age of 3. ''It was the most agonizing period of our lives,'' the Vice President said, as tears formed in his wife's eyes. ''But it drew us together.'' ''I remember going into the bank holding Robin's hand and they asked me where the little girl was who was sick,'' recalled Mr. Bush, who commuted from Texas to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York while Mrs. Bush remained by their daughter's side. ''And here she was, three months before her death. Today, given the advances of medical technology, she might still be alive. ''We couldn't understand why this child - we went through all of that as anybody does,'' the Vice President said. ''What's God's message? Why? We went through all of that and came out with a strong sense of faith. If the ending would have been different, it would have been the greatest experience of our lives.'' A S AIR FORCE TWO GLIDES home from a more recent trip and Mr. Bush prepares for arrival in Washington and his next mission for Mr. Reagan, his thoughts are on the future. His close identity with the President, now his strongest asset, could turn out to be a drawback as Mr. Reagan's budget and tax plans, as well as other policies, run into stiff opposition. Mr. Bush concedes that ''I am identified with the President's policies and will be identified with them and I am not going to change from being identified with them. If they are looking good, it will be an asset. If they are looking lousy, it will be a detriment.'' And while no one would discount the impact of an endorsement from Ronald Reagan, tacit or otherwise, there is also the knowledge that the Reagan Presidency is based more on his enormous personal popularity than it is on the strength of his policies. At this point, no one can predict how much of Mr. Reagan's glow will rub off on George Bush. Yet friends and advisers to the Vice President contend that he has the ability to be very much his own man. His experience in the 1980 campaign reinforced his resolve, they say. ''It's as if someone says to you, you can't be the champ, but you say, 'Yeah, but I'm a better boxer,' '' Mr. Teeley recalls of that year. ''You feel that you are better and that you can win and that you are being prevented from trying as hard as you possibly can.'' Shirley Green, a longtime friend of Mr. Bush's who has served on his staff, says: ''I would suspect that he probably feels that his whole life, or at least the last 15 years or more, has been one of preparation for the Presidency. Not to aspire to it at this stage would be illogical based on the preparation he has had. It would be like a runner working up to a marathon and not doing it.'' For now, Mr. Bush is content to strike a familiar note. ''I want everybody to be for me that can be, absolutely,'' he says. ''More importantly, I want people who share my views more than any individuals. I disagree with Jerry Falwell on some things, just like I'm sure he disagrees with me on some issues. Of course, I want him for me. I've never been one who believed that you should start narrowing down your support,'' says Mr. Bush, who Mr. Teeter describes as ''the one guy to keep all the Republicans in the tent.'' ''I could probably think of a group or two that I won't want support from,'' says the Vice President. ''But if it's under this broad umbrella that is the Republican Party, yes, I want it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FOLLOW- UP ON THE NEWS; Fight to Wipe Out Rubella in U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/us/follow-up-on-the-news-fight-to-wipe-out-rubella-in-us.html,"RUBELLA, highly dangerous for pregnant women and their babies, was reported on the ropes in the United States. Last year the National Centers for Disease Control said that in 1984 there were 752 cases of the disease, commonly called German measles. This was the lowest total reported since a rubella vaccine became available in 1969. The Federal health agency said it was opening a drive to eradicate all traces of the disease. Further gains have been made. ''The provisional total for 1985 was 604 cases, and that represents a 20 percent decrease from the 1984 total,'' reports Dr. Stephen Preblud, chief of the child and adult immunization section at the disease control centers. ''It's a 99 percent decrease from the year with the great number of cases ever reported. That year was 1969, and the number of reported cases was 57,686.'' ''Our expectations are that as long as rubella vaccine gets used by the general population, rubella and Congenital Rubella Syndrome will continue to decline,'' Dr. Preblud says. The syndrome, which can be one effect of maternal infection, may lead to a stillbirth, a spontaneous abortion or birth defects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Issue That Seems To Defy a Yes or No,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/weekinreview/one-issue-that-seems-to-defy-a-yes-or-no.html,"The political fight over abortion, which once provoked hopes and fears of a constitutional amendment and a Government more concerned with and involved in the morality of its citizens, has settled into trench warfare. The troops still assemble regularly. Last month, 36,000 foes of abortion marched on the Supreme Court to protest the anniversary of its decision in Roe v. Wade and next month, the decision's supporters hope to gather as many or more of their partisans at the Lincoln Memorial. But neither side hopes for recent triumphs and a recent New York Times Poll suggests that a key reason for the shift in atmosphere is that Americans do not see abortion in anything like the clear, black-and-white terms discerned by activists on the issue. In Washington, there is no longer an imminent prospect of a constitutional amendment forbidding or limiting abortions - a fact that represents a strategic success for the groups that call themselves pro-choice. President Reagan regularly renews his calls for an amendment, but it has become clear that he will not spend serious political capital on the fight. Instead, for organizations such as Planned Parenthood or institutions such as the District of Columbia government, which advise or pay for abortions using funds from other sources, the battle is over Federal money for abortions themselves. And there the recent record is one of tactical victories for the groups that oppose abortion, and call themselves pro-life. Peter Gemma, head of the National Pro-Life Political Action Committee, agrees that in the last few years ''there have been no dramatic gains'' for his side. But he contends that more judges who oppose abortion are being appointed and that his allies have realistic hopes of ''cutting off Federal appropriations for anyone who does consultation on abortions.'' On the other side, Ann F. Lewis, executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, is optimistic because she sees politicians competing for younger voters and concluding that a rigid anti-abortion stance is a sure way to discourage them. Root Conflicts But The Times Poll indicates two deeply felt conflicts in the public that make unlikely solid support for sweeping changes in either direction. First, 56 percent of the public said they did not approve of the present legal situation, with 40 percent saying they wanted abortion legal ''only in such cases as saving the life of the mother, rape or incest,'' and 16 percent saying it should not be permitted at all. But only three-fourths of them, or 41 percent of the population, said they wanted the Constitution amended to make their belief the law of the land. Other important conflicts showed up. Fifty-five percent of the public said they believed that ''abortion is the same thing as murdering a child,'' but 66 percent said they agreed with the statement that ''abortion is sometimes the best thing in a bad situation.'' Twenty-seven percent of the public - 23 percent of the men and 31 percent of the women - believed both of those statements. The margin of sampling error in the survey was plus or minus three percentage points. On both sets of questions, it was clear that people with higher incomes and more education were least hostile to abortion. For example, 50 percent of those with family incomes of less than $12,500 but only 27 percent of those with incomes of $50,000 or more wanted an amendment to change the law. Similarly, 64 percent of those who did not have a high school education but just 36 percent of those with college or advanced degrees believed that abortion was the same thing as murder. Age mattered more on the issue of the legality of abortion than on questions about what the procedure means morally. Forty-five percent of those 44 or younger said the practice should be legal, as it is now; only 25 percent of those 65 or older agreed. Southerners and Midwesterners were especially hostile to abortion; people from the Northeast were least antagonistic. The history of polling on abortion has consistently shown that the wording of a question had a tremendous impact on the responses. To public opinion specialists, that is a clear indication of uncertainty and conflict. To an angry Connie Marshner, head of the National Pro-Family Coalition, the recent New York Times' poll's findings that abortion is seen as both murder and the best thing in a bad situation were ''incredible.'' She said: ''Those people who agree with both statements haven't got a leg to stand on when it comes to criticizing Hitler. They are saying murder is all right.'' But to Carol Gilligan, associate professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the author of ''In a Different Voice,'' the figures reflected a pragmatic approach to a ''very complicated moral argument'' comparable to one that upholds killing in wartime. ''People can imagine themselves in situations like that,'' she said, ''and can't be quite sure what they would do, and so don't want to impose their views on others.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIFE LAY BEYOND THE BRONX,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/books/life-lay-beyond-the-bronx.html,"A WIDER WORLD Portraits in an Adolescence. By Kate Simon. 186 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $14.95. THERE are stories so crucial for their audience that each fresh telling, and perhaps especially each fresh revision or debunking, only heightens the story's power. The American immigrant success story, for many of us, is such a story, as Kate Simon has demonstrated before in her previous autobiographical volume, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' This new book picks up where that one ended, as the author passes from childhood in the late 1920's. ''A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence'' continues into the Great Depression, and ends with harsh, even bitter emblems of rebirth and survival. ''Bronx Primitive'' was widely read and admired, justly, for its vivid picture of immigrant life in New York and for its author's distinctly individual perspective on that life. This perspective governs her clean and unpretentious prose style, her aristocratic disdain for cant, her frank worldliness and the unforced breadth of reference that compares the elevated subway service barns of 180th Street in the Bronx to early Renaissance palaces, or teases the reader with a forward leap to ''an experiment with hallucinogenic mushrooms in Mexico, many years later.'' Unsentimental, judgmental, passionate in dislike and in loyalty, coolly meticulous of eye, she has applied to her own early life the practical, writerly poise developed in a long career as the author of excellent guidebooks. (Possibly the best known is ''New York, Places and Pleasures.'') That poise, in itself, gives us confirming evidence of the success story, while Miss Simon in every episode of her autobiography reminds us, without exaggeration or flinching, of the casualties and the costs. Some of these can be seen as ugly corollaries of uprooting, overcrowding, the survival of old repressions amid new pressures: for example, the casual though furtive sexual use of the child's body by adults of both sexes, including relatives more or less fresh off the boat, put up for a few weeks in the tiny family apartment. The ironic counterpoint to these low-grade molestations is the repressive badgering of his daughter by the vain, puritanically accusing father. His simultaneous rejection and thwarted efforts at controlling her, Miss Simon implies, were more traumatically humiliating than anything she endured at the hands of his friends and relations. WHEN the child demands freedom to roller skate, to play with Italian friends, simply to run, the father predicts she will wind up a prostitute (as some neighborhood children in fact do) and a derelict. What he seems to sense and fear is that she is becoming an American woman. And whatever that phrase means, it seems more threatening to him, she feels, than that she be fondled at the movies by a widowed uncle, or used for masturbation by his niece from Poland. When his dream of forging her into a concert pianist who will make him rich dies, his anger settles into hatred and sexual accusations. The expensive, spurned piano embodies his rage. The school authorities force him to let her attend high school, escaping his cultured, patriarchal, stifling grip for good. This is not the nostalgic world of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' or ''Golden Boy.'' But neither is it tinted by self-pity or lament. Miss Simon's main note is reportorial relish. Her straightforward writing strips away blurry expectations from such familiar material as the immigrant family's struggle from greenhorn status, the family's internal and external conflicts, the waves of cousins from the old country. Even the very settings are familiar: the neighborhood of ''Bronx Primitive'' divided into strips and sectors that are northern Italian, southern Italian and ''Jewish-German-Polish-Greek-Hungarian-Rumanian''; later, the City College and Hunter College, ''advanced'' summer colonies, Harlem and Greenwich Village of ''A Wider World.'' But Miss Simon makes her times and places new, convinces us that we are seeing them and their inhabitants from close up. HERE is the cool, intelligent, somewhat mischievous observer, working as nanny for a ''cultured'' couple who invite her to meet a celebrated friend: ''I [ was ] often treated as a guest, invited to listen to the poetry readings of Mr. Essen, a director, and a failed poet. The Yiddish of his verse was simple enough to understand. What was difficult were his narrow fields of simile: children, women's eyes, small flowers, were all ziggalach, young goats - a disconcerting dullness as I made unfair comparisons with the great Romantic poets.'' The same couple provide a more exciting entry into the Cafe Royale, gathering place for the luminaries of the Yiddish theater: ''The deep, wide room was dazzlingly lit, as noisy as a market and as brilliantly, gaudily colored as a Gypsy camp. We recognized a few of the actors as Essen guests and as Second Avenue billboard posters, all of them in full stage makeup, cheeks hectic, eyes blazing. Several of the women wore large, embroidered Spanish shawls. . . . One famous tragedienne wore a tall, blaring-red turban; another, with heavily kohl-circled eyes, sported a yellowed ermine capelet, her hands buried in its matching Anna Karenina muff. . . . Davy and I made our way through the darting bodies, the tassels, the furs, the dashing hats and billowing neckerchiefs to the crowded table of a quiet, smiling group listening to one droll-faced man. He was the famous journalist . . . who could maintain a conversation or a long monologue on almost any subject in rhymed couplets in Yiddish, quite a feat. He was adroit, funny, and gracious enough to invent a lilting set of couplets for us 'rosy baby lovers.' '' The reference to poetry, and to English poetry in particular, is important because it represents one of the avenues that lead to the ''wider world'' of the book's title. Three American institutions helped the bright, willful child defy the confining expectations that threatened a female, poor, Jewish immigrant. These three ways out and up, profoundly democratic and successful, were: the movies, with their glamorous intimations not only of luxury but of an intrepid, powerful womanhood; the public library; and public education, embodied by Hunter College and P.S. 58, but above all by the English department of James Monroe High School. ''The English Department, small, talkative, dedicated, material. . . . The indulgent English Department loved all of its promising children with a springtime faith, to the point of freeing them from ordinary curriculum rigidities. Thus some of us were excused from the routine English classes and permitted to gather as poetry groups, as drama classes, as classes in Shakespeare.'' May all harried and dedicated high school teachers of literature take heart from this gratitude of a writer who, looking back across five or six decades, finds in the words ''English Department'' a Samarkand of imagination, richness and color. I hope there are still public schools as demanding, stringent, ambitious and nurturing as James Monroe appears to have been at its best. Miss Simon's ability to ''knock off an essay on almost any subject easily and fairly well'' led to encouragement by one teacher that she become a music critic, the suggestion of another that she continue with further research her essay on the games, ballads and street songs of the Bronx. The school linked intellectual seriousness and study with personal and social scope, a vital process for one ''who had it dinned into her that Jewish goals had to be modest and those of a Jewish woman more modest still.'' However, sustained and patient work held no attraction for Miss Simon, who drifted into a more bohemian, less scholarly persona made up from books, pierced ears, a raffish costume based on instinct, the movies and garments like a Borsalino hat discarded by well-off baby-sitting customers. The scholarly direction of the school did not pull this self-made figure into its current, nor did the passionate, semi-informed radicalism of rent strikes and parents who changed their children's names from Solly and Benny to Marxele and Trotskele. New York City itself, with its appetite for charm and excellence and its impersonal ability to discard them, exerts the strongest force as Miss Simon moves from James Monroe to Hunter College in the early 30's. Her terrain becomes the city of Carnegie Hall and the Lower East Side, Ukrainian groceries and Moroccan restaurants, mansions in Brooklyn Heights and Czechoslovak craft shops, the columns of Heywood Broun and Alexander Woollcott. Against this background, representative figures embody the world that welcomes and often callously uses the author's gifts: women teachers who take up the precocious child and introduce her to the world, then drop her abruptly out of sexual jealousy or sexual rejection; the black man who sends her back to the Bronx from a Harlem nightclub, as too innocent; the older man who shows her the city of flower markets, bridges, views; the ''cultivated'' dermatologist whose captive wife, immensely less liberated than the tough immigrant Jewish and Italian women of the Bronx, prepares for him and his male friends the exact feast served a 14th-century Archbishop of York on his visit to Durham Cathedral. Meanwhile, the wife picks at scraps in the kitchen, a sympathetic, successfully victimized embodiment of the world of Miss Simon's father. Working for this couple, the author first hears ''names like O'Keeffe, Varese, Picabia, Bodenheim, James Joyce.'' The falseness and oppressiveness of the household, like the exploitative quality in the friendship of some of her teacher-patrons, appear matter-of-factly, accepted as tuition costs in Miss Simon's education. The immense appetite for sophistication, for worldliness in its least culpable sense, subsumes the desires for love, money, or education, which become forms of that larger quest. THE Hunter girls who as part of this quest struggle with poverty - occasionally going without food or heat for the prize of a drink in a real bar, a movie ticket or some other token of class -are stranger creatures, in this narrative, than I would have imagined. Though they are committed to ''advanced'' thought of every kind, these young women dream a fascinating and partly atavistic construct of womanhood, hodgepodge in detail, but emotionally, in a way even ideologically, coherent: ''Some of us English majors had been sufficiently seduced by books to dedicate ourselves to dreams of lives that echoed the 'infinite variety' of Cleopatra; withering and staling as our grandmothers and mothers did were to be avoided at the profoundest costs. We would live heroic sorrows and great pleasures as we learned them in Shakespeare, in Greek dramas and French novels, as we learned them from the daring, tough, begging-for-the-knife-in-the-bodice Carmen. And there were the lush toothsome Belle Epoque women, all pearls, plumes, and rose satin, as introduced to us by the Goncourts and Proust. If not the Odettes, the gallant unfortunates, semi-loved and thoroughly discarded, of Zola and Dreiser, and, closer to our own time, the burners of candles at both ends: Edna St. Vincent Millay, Genevieve Taggard, Elinor Wylie.'' This list is a moving report from its place and time: ''another universe'' as Miss Simon calls it. What is most surprising about these romantic, well-read members of the Young Socialist League is how little they know about sex and particularly birth control. One young woman in this fast, bohemian set offers to share the latter on a Friday afternoon: ''Anna, of the mischievous face: 'Who wants my pessary? I haven't got a date this weekend,' running around from table to table offering her supreme and rare gift. Since most of us were too inexperienced to wonder about fit and general usability, she frequently found takers.'' This is startling, and not merely funny: Kate Simon's mother, a sophisticated woman who spoke excellent English, who had contempt for housework and started her own successful business, had 13 abortions while having her three children -about four per year! One of the few entirely benign, altruistic figures in these two books (another is Mr. Brandon, chair of the English department, at James Monroe High School) is ''Dr. James'': ''a New England aristocrat whose mission, now that he was retired from ordinary practice, was to perform abortions for immigrant women at no fee or little.'' For all their Shakespeare, Marx and Isadora Duncan, the Jewish immigrants were American urban poor, exiled as far out of the world's amenities of knowledge as any ethnic group. When Miss Simon as a college student runs a high fever, neither she nor her City College boyfriend has the least idea that hospital emergency rooms exist. (With St. Vincent's and Bellevue nearby, they stagger through subways, stairs and platforms to his mother's apartment.) In the closing episodes of ''A Wider World,'' Miss Simon describes two abortions of her own: a cheap one, in a sinister setting, which serves its purpose, and an expensive, Irving Place one in a nice office that nearly kills her. (The smooth young doctor after his work kisses her on the mouth and strokes her breast, then leaves her in the closed office unconscious and bleeding heavily.) The implied point of these incidents, repeatedly, is Kate Simon's present control and independence: she has come through, she is writing, confirming, with some understated bitterness, an important national legend. In that story, pluck, talent and desire carry the disinherited child from helplessness up through trials to join a graceful American aristocracy of merit that draws the deserving toward itself. The costs and defects of this process propel works as diverse as ''The Great Gatsby,'' Francis Coppola's ''Godfather'' films, ''My Antonia'' and ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass.'' Kate Simon's modest, distinctive and feminist account may be all the more essentially American precisely because the transitional climb is a matter not of heroic determination or overwhelming genius, but of shining intelligence, good luck and a tough, likable vitality. SHE CAME FROM WARSAW AND CONQUERED To Kate Simon there is little difference between the sharply detailed travel books for which she is well known and her two evocative memoirs of growing up as an immigrant daughter between the two world wars. ''I must have started being a travel writer when we first came to America,'' said Miss Simon, who emigrated from Warsaw with her mother and younger brother at age 4 and quickly became a keen observer of her small Bronx community. ''The places I had to get to know very quickly, the languages I couldn't understand. And all that peeping in places and climbing up on the roof is part of the very primitive beginnings of that kind of curiosity. It was as if, 'How can anything happen without my being there to witness and report it?' '' Both ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood'' and its sequel, ''A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence,'' are laced with images of almost dreamlike clarity. Miss Simon did not keep a journal. ''But what I remember is extraordinarily vivid to me,'' she said in the living room of her East Side apartment, filled with clear winter light and the sound of ''Turandot.'' ''This too is part of the travel thing - the responses, the gathering in.'' ''A Wider World'' paints a portrait of an unusually plucky and courageous teen-ager. What gave the young Kate Simon the impetus to escape - spiritually and physically - from the confines of her upbringing and culture? Perhaps most of all there was the lure of adventure. ''Any child given the kind of responsibility I had at 4 and 5 must be very precocious in the need for independence. I was extraordinarily ambitious to learn the world and to try myself. I was not taught that I had to be happy. Also, I learned endurance. Unless you had a fever, you went to school.'' Though ''A Wider World'' describes some harrowing experiences, the author remembers her coming of age as a golden time. ''I was going through what you might equate with a very young knighthood. I had stations - places to go and to test and to conquer. It was not formal, not conscious, but it was my own rites of passage.'' - Constance Rosenblum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"W,HAT DID THE FOUNDING FATHERS INTEND?",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/magazine/what-did-the-founding-fathers-intend.html,"THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE 200 years old on Sept. 17, 1987, and a Bicentennial commission -headed by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger (whose birthday felicitously falls on that date) - is under way, formulating plans for ''Constitution Day'' festivities. The celebratory air notwithstanding, recent discussions of constitutional values seem to reveal more conflict than shared pride. Some examples: Last summer, in remarks before the American Bar Association, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d criticized the Supreme Court's recent decisions reaffirming the First Amendment requirement that government maintain a ''strict neutrality'' toward religion. The Attorney General castigated the Court for ignoring the ''intent of the framers'' and stated that the Philadelphia Convention would find the doctrine of ''a strict neutrality between religion and nonreligion . . . somewhat bizarre.'' In an undelivered portion of his text, the Attorney General seemed to question the applicability of the Bill of Rights to state governments. In an address last fall, Justice John Paul Stevens responded to the Attorney General's criticisms by stating that ''some uncertainty may attend an effort to identify the precise messages'' of the framers. Speaking at Georgetown University last October, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. rejected the ''arrogance cloaked as humility'' of those relying on the ''facile historicism'' inherent in the original-intent theory. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which it will decide whether the right of privacy includes consensual adult homosexual conduct. Critics contend that no right of privacy is men-tioned in the Constitution or was envisioned by our Founding Fathers. In the ongoing debate over original intent, almost all Federal judges hold to the notion that judicial decisions should be based on the text of the Constitution or the structure it creates. Yet, in requiring judges to be guided solely by the expressed views of the framers, current advocates of original intent seem to call for a narrower concept. Jurists who disregard this interpretation, the argument runs, act lawlessly because they are imposing their own moral standards and political preferences on the community. As a Federal judge, I have found it often difficult to ascertain the ''intent of the framers,'' and even more problematic to try to dispose of a constitutional question by giving great weight to the intent argument. Indeed, even if it were possible to decide hard cases on the basis of a strict interpretation of original intent, or originalism, that methodology would conflict with a judge's duty to apply the Constitution's underlying principles to changing circumstances. Furthermore, by attempting to erode the base for judicial affirmation of the freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment (no state shall ''deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws''), the intent theory threatens some of the greatest achievements of the Federal judiciary. Ultimately, the debate centers on the nature of judicial review, or the power of courts to act as the ultimate arbiters of constitutional meaning. This responsibility has been acknowledged ever since the celebrated 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison, in which Chief Justice John Marshall struck down a Congressional grant of jurisdiction to the Supreme Court not authorized by Article III of the Constitution. But here again, originalists would accept judicial review only if it adhered to the allegedly neutral principles embalmed in historical intent. In the course of 36 years on the Federal bench, I have had to make many difficult constitutional interpretations. I have had to determine whether a teacher could wear a black armband as a protest against the Vietnam War; whether newspapers have a nonactionable right to report accusatory statements, and whether a school system might be guilty of de facto segregation. Unfortunately, the framers' intentions are not made sufficiently clear to provide easy answers. A judge must first determine what the intent was (or would have been) - a notoriously formidable task. An initial problem is the paucity of materials. Both the official minutes of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 and James Madison's famous notes of the proceedings, published in 1840, tend toward the terse and cursory, especially in relation to the judiciary. The Congressional debates over the proposed Bill of Rights, which became effective in 1791, are scarcely better. Even Justice William Rehnquist, one of the most articulate spokesmen for original intent, admitted in a recent dissent in a case concerning school prayer that the legislative history behind the provision against the establishment of an official religion ''does not seem particularly illuminating.'' One source deserves special mention. ''The Federalist Papers'' - the series of essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay in 1787 and 1788 - have long been esteemed as the earliest constitutional commentary. In 1825, for example, Thomas Jefferson noted that ''The Federalist'' was regularly appealed to ''as evidence of the general opinion of those who framed and of those who accepted the Constitution of the United States.'' ''The Federalist,'' however, did not discuss the Bill of Rights or the Civil War amendments, which were yet to be written. Moreover, the essays were part of a political campaign - the authors wrote them in support of New York's ratification of the Constitution. The essays, therefore, tended to enunciate general democratic theory or rebut anti-Federalist arguments, neither of which offer much help to modern jurists. (In light of the following passage from ''The Federalist,'' No. 14, I believe Madison would be surprised to find his words of 200 years ago deciding today's cases: ''Is it not the glory of the people of America that . . . they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity . . . to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense . . .?'') Another problem with original intent is this: Who were the framers? Generally, they are taken to be the delegates to the Philadelphia Convention and the Congressional sponsors of subsequent amendments. All constitutional provisions, however, have been ratified by state conventions or legislatures on behalf of the people they represented. Is the relevant intention, then, that of the drafters, the ratifiers or the general populace? The elusiveness of the framers' intent leads to another, more telling problem. Originalist doctrine presumes that intent can be discovered by historical sleuthing or psychological rumination. In fact, this is not possible. Judges are constantly required to resolve questions that 18th-century statesmen, no matter how prescient, simply could not or did not foresee and resolve. On most issues, to look for a collective intention held by either drafters or ratifiers is to hunt for a chimera. A reading of the Constitution highlights this problem. The principles of our great charter are cast in grand, yet cryptic, phrases. Accordingly, judges usually confront what Justice Robert Jackson in the 1940's termed the ''majestic generalities'' of the Bill of Rights, or the terse commands of ''due process of law,'' or ''equal protection'' contained in the 14th Amendment. The use of such open-ended provisions would indicate that the framers did not want the Constitution to become a straitjacket on all events for all times. In contrast, when the framers held a clear intention, they did not mince words. Article II, for example, specifies a minimum Presidential age of 35 years instead of merely requiring ''maturity'' or ''adequate age.'' The First Amendment is a good example of a vaguer provision. In guaranteeing freedom of the press, some of our forefathers perhaps had specific thoughts on what publications fell within its purview. Some historians believe, in light of Colonial debates, that the main concern of the framers was to prevent governmental licensing of newspapers. If that were all the First Amendment meant today, then many important decisions protecting the press would have to be overruled. One of them would be the landmark New York Times v. Sullivan ruling of 1964, giving the press added protection in libel cases brought by public figures. Another would be Near v. Minnesota, a case involving Jay Near, a newspaper publisher who had run afoul of a Minne-sota statute outlawing ''malicious, scandalous and defamatory'' publications. The Supreme Court struck down the statute in 1931, forbidding governmental prior restraints on publication; this ruling was the precursor of the 1971 Pentagon Papers decision. The Founding Fathers focused not on particularities but on principles, such as the need in a democracy for people to engage in free and robust discourse. James Madison considered a popular government without popular information a ''Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy.'' Judges, then, must focus on underlying principles when going about their delicate duty of applying the First Amendment's precepts to today's world. In fact, our nation's first debate over constitutional interpretation centered on grand principles. Angered at John Adams's Federalist Administration, advocates of states' rights in the late 18th century argued that original intent meant that the Constitution, like the Articles of Confederation, should be construed narrowly - as a compact among separate sovereigns. The 1798 Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, which sought to reserve to the states the power of ultimate constitutional interpretation, were the most extreme expressions of this view. In rejecting this outlook, a nationalistic Supreme Court construed the Constitution more broadly. The important point here is that neither side of this debate looked to the stated views of the framers to resolve the issue. Because of his leading role at the Philadelphia Convention, Madison's position is especially illuminating. ''Whatever veneration might be entertained for the body of men who formed our Constitution,'' he declaimed on the floor of Congress in 1796, ''the sense of that body could never be regarded as the oracular guide in expounding the Constitution.'' Y ET, I DOUBT IF STRICT proponents of original intent will be deterred by such considerations. Their goal is not to venerate dead framers but to restrain living judges from imposing their own values. This restraint is most troublesome when it threatens the protection of individual rights against governmental encroachment. According to current constitutional doctrine, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment incorporates key provisions of the Bill of Rights, which keeps in check only the Federal Government. Unless the due process clause is construed to include the most important parts of the first eight amendments in the Bill of Rights, then the states would be free, in theory, to establish an official church or inflict cruel and unusual punishments. This doctrine is called incorporation. Aside from the late Justice Hugo Black, few have believed that history alone is a sufficient basis for applying the Bill of Rights to the states. In his Georgetown University address, Justice Brennan noted that the crucial liberties embodied in the Bill of Rights are so central to our national identity that we cannot imagine any definition of ''liberty'' without them. In fact, a cramped reading of the Bill of Rights jeopardizes what I regard as the true original intent - the rationale for having a written Constitution at all. The principal reason for a charter was to restrain government. In 1787, the idea of a fundamental law set down in black and white was revolutionary. Hanoverian England in the 18th century did not have a fully written, unified constitution, having long believed in a partially written one, based on ancient custom and grants from the Crown like the Magna Carta. To this day, the British have kept their democracy alive without one. In theory, the ''King-in-Parliament'' was and is unlimited in sovereign might, and leading political theorists, such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, agreed that governments, once established by a social contract, could not then be fettered. Although not a Bill of Rights, the Magna Carta -King John's concessions to his barons in 1215 - was symbolic of the notion that even the Crown was not all-powerful. Moreover, certain judges believed that Parliament, like the king, had to respect the traditions of the common law. This staunch belief in perpetual rights, in turn, was an important spark for the Revolutionary conflagration of 1776. In gaining independence, Americans formed the bold concept that sovereignty continually resided with the people, who cede power to governments only to achieve certain specific ends. This view dominated the Philadelphia Convention. Instead of merely improving on the Articles of Confederation, as they had been directed to do, the framers devised a government where certain powers -defined and thereby limited - flowed from the people to the Congress, the President and the Federal judiciary. Alexander Hamilton recognized that the basic tenets of this scheme mandated judicial review. Individual rights, he observed in ''The Federalist,'' No. 78, ''can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.'' Through a written constitution and judicial enforcement, the framers intended to preserve the inchoate rights they had lost as Englishmen. The narrow interpretation of original intent is especially unfortunate because I doubt that many of its proponents are in favor of freeing the states from the constraints of the Bill of Rights. In fact, I believe the concern of many modern ''intentionalists'' is quite specific: outrage over the right-of-privacy cases, especially Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion. (The right of privacy, of course, is not mentioned in the Constitution.) Whether one agrees with this controversial decision or not, I would submit that concern over the outcome of one difficult case is not sufficient cause to embrace a theory that calls for so many changes in existing law. S OME OPPONENTS of strict interpretations of original intent, too, have been guilty of taking an extreme position. Some, for example, have suggested that invoking the framers is only a cloak to hide more modern and malevolent intentions. This view, however, ignores the threat of abuse of power posed by a life-tenured judiciary. Unless restrained in some fashion, judges are capable of usurping authority better left to the democratic branches. Judicial critics often refer to the 1907 comment of Charles Evans Hughes (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) that ''We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.'' The power of judges to declare laws unconstitutional does appear at odds with majority rule. Why should a handful of Supreme Court Justices - or any Federal judge - appointed for life, be able to invalidate the will of the people's elected representatives, as expressed in a duly enacted statute? How does one reconcile this power with our commitment to democracy? As Hamilton foresaw in ''The Federalist,'' No. 78, and Chief Justice Marshall established in Marbury v. Madison, review of legislation by nonelected judges is, in fact, justified by their mandate to enforce the entirety of the law including, when there is any conflict, the ''supreme law of the land'': the Constitution. If judicial decisions are based on political notions instead of legal principles, that imprimatur is lost. One can, therefore, understand why a clear guide to constitutional interpretation is thought necessary. History tells us of grave abuses of power when judges feel unrestrained. Consider, for instance, the infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857. Dred Scott was a slave whose mas-ter had taken him into the Louisiana Territory and, under the terms of the Missouri Compromise, was thus made a free man. Scott, however, later was taken to the slave state of Missouri. With the aid of abolitionist lawyers, Scott brought a suit in Federal court to obtain his freedom on the grounds he had been emancipated. On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled against him. Hoping to settle the slavery issue through judicial fiat instead of political compromise, the High Court decided blacks were not citizens and Congress could not regulate slavery in the territories. After noting the subjugation of blacks at the time of the Constitution's adoption, Chief Justice Roger Taney concluded ''they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.'' The opinion was vociferously denounced in the North. ''The Court has rushed into politics,'' raged The New York Tribune, ''without other purpose than to subserve the cause of slavery.'' Instead of healing sectarian strife, the Court's exercise of power most likely hastened the Civil War. The Justices likewise suffered ultimate defeat when they attempted to halt the advent of the modern welfare state. The Federal judiciary in the early decades of this century regularly invalidated social legislation, such as child labor statutes and minimum wage/maximum hours laws. Claiming that the due process clause embodied economic liberty, judges relied on the rubric of ''substantive due process'' to impose their own views on the nation. This period is known as the ''Lochner era,'' after a famous case in which the Supreme Court struck down a New York statute prescribing a 10-hour workday for bakery employees (Lochner was the owner of a bakery who was prosecuted for violating the statute). The Justices believed that the government lacked the authority to interfere with private contractual arrangements. In a powerful dissent, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes denounced the Court's imputation of laissez-faire capitalism to the Constitution: ''The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics.'' The Lochner era came to a close when the Supreme Court ultimately accepted President Roosevelt's New Deal programs. These examples indicate the need for judicial impartiality and restraint, but if original intent is an uncertain guide, does some other, more functional approach to interpreting the Constitution exist? One suggestion is to emphasize the importance of democratic ''process.'' As John Hart Ely, dean of the Stanford Law School forcefully advocates, this approach would direct the courts to make a distinction between ''process'' (the rules of the game, so to speak) and ''substance'' (the results of the game). Laws dealing with process include those affecting voting rights or participation in society; the Supreme Court correctly prohibited segregation, for example, because it imposed on blacks the continuing stigma of slavery. Judges, however, would not have the power to review the substantive decisions of elected officials, such as the distribution of welfare benefits. Basically, such an approach makes courts the guardians of democracy, but a focus on process affords little help when judges decide between difficult and compet-ing values. Judicial formulation of a democratic vision, for example, requires substantive decision-making. The dignities of human liberty enshrined in the Bill of Rights are not merely a means to an end, even so noble an end as democratic governance. For example, we cherish freedom of speech not only because it is necessary for meaningful elections, but also for its own sake. T HE TRUTH IS THAT no litmus test exists by which judges can confidently and consistently measure the constitutionality of their decisions. Notwithstanding the clear need for judicial restraint, judges do not constitute what Prof. Raoul Berger, a retired Harvard Law School fellow, has termed an ''imperial judiciary.'' I would argue that the judicial process itself limits the reach of a jurist's arm. First, judges do not and cannot deliberately contravene specific constitutional rules or clear indications of original intent. No one would seriously argue or expect, for instance, that the Supreme Court could or would twist the Presidential minimum-age provision into a call for ''sufficient maturity,'' so as to forbid the seating of a 36-year-old. I doubt, in any event, that Federal judges would ever hear such a question. The Constitution limits our power to traditional ''cases'' and ''controversies'' capable of judicial resolution. In cases like the hypothetical one regarding the Presidential age, the High Court employs doctrines of standing (proving injury) and ''political question'' to keep citizens from suing merely out of a desire to have the government run a certain way. Moreover, the issues properly before a judge are not presented on a tabula rasa. Even the vaguest constitutional provisions have received the judicial gloss of prior decisions. Precedent alone, of course, should not preserve clearly erroneous decisions; the abhorrent ''separate but equal'' doctrine survived for more than 50 years before the Warren Court struck it down in 1954. The conventions of our judicial system also limit a jurist's ability to impose his or her own will. One important restraint, often overlooked, is the tradition that appellate judges issue written opinions. That is, we must support our decisions with reasons in-stead of whims and indicate how our constitutional rulings relate to the document. A written statement is open to the dissent of colleagues, possible review by a higher court and the judgment, sometimes scathing, of legal scholars. In addition, the facts of a given case play a pivotal role. Facts delineate the reach of a legal decision and remind us of the ''cases and controversies'' requirement. Our respect for such ground rules reassures the public that, even in the most controversial case, the outcome is not just a political ruling. Judges are also mindful that the ultimate justification for their power is public acceptance - acceptance not of every decision, but of the role they play. Without popular support, the power of judicial review would have been eviscerated by political forces long ago. Lacking the power of the purse or the sword, the courts must rely on the elected branches to enforce their decisions. The school desegregation cases would have been a dead letter unless President Eisenhower had been willing to order out the National Guard - in support of a decision authored by a Chief Justice, Earl Warren, whose appointment the President had called ''the biggest damned-fool mistake I ever made.'' Instead of achieving the purple of philosopher-kings, an unprincipled judiciary would risk becoming modern King Canutes, with the cold tide of political reality and popular opprobrium lapping at their robes. My revered predecessor on the Court of Appeals, Judge Learned Hand, remarked in a lecture at Harvard in the late 1950's that he would not want to be ruled by ''a bevy of Platonic Guardians.'' The Constitution balances the danger of judicial abuse against the threat of a temporary majority trampling individual rights. The current debate is a continuation of an age-old, and perhaps endless, struggle to reach a balance between our commitments to democracy and to the rule of law. Although my office forces me to take a very direct part in the ongoing dialogue, all Americans have a stake in what my judicial colleagues and I say about the Constitution. At bottom, the debate is the consequence of our experiment, now two centuries old, in giving our fundamental ideals written expression in a Constitution. And that is cause for celebration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING; Smeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/25/us/briefing-smeal.html,"After a month of skirmishes at Catholic University, a speech by Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, is finally set to occur tonight, having been moved off-campus by law students. And the student chapter of the National Lawyers Guild has proclaimed today ''Eleanor Smeal Day'' to protest what it says is a curtailment of academic freedom. The conflict began when undergraduates invited the women's rights advocate to speak on campus Jan. 28. Pressure from students who believed the address would focus on abortion led to a withdrawal of the invitation. The law students promptly renewed the invitation, but the administration, saying they had filed notice too late to comply with procedural guidelines for appearances open to the entire student body, ruled that the speech could be heard only by law students, with undergraduates and the press explicitly barred. The law students rescheduled the address to Feb. 25 to comply with rules for all-campus events, but university officials then said that in no event would university facilities be made available. The address, ''Women's Issues in the Eighties,'' will be given at the Capital Hilton, 16th and K Streets, at 7:30 P.M., with the speaker waiving her $1,500 honorarium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONGRESS; Wheels Are Spinning Over the Senate's Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/26/us/congress-wheels-are-spinning-over-the-senate-s-rules.html,"Capitol Hill is used to rebellions. For more than a decade junior lawmakers have been demanding more power from their elders and often getting it. But now the Senate is confronted with a counterrevolution, and the furor is coming from the front benches, not the back ones. Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, and Senator Robert C. Byrd, the minority leader, have co-sponsored a package of changes in rules that would make it easier for the leaders to set the legislative schedule and harder for individual members to get in their way. ''It's pretty hard to set the agenda over here,'' Senator Dole said today. ''The leadership is powerless unless members are willing to give them authority.'' ''The Senate has 100 separate power centers,'' added Senator Daniel J. Evans, a Washington Republican who backs the changes. ''I'm afraid the Senate has splintered as a result. It's outrageous that the majority leader doesn't have the opportunity to set the schedule of the Senate without thought of a filibuster.'' But the proposed changes have drawn a bombardment of criticism from lawmakers who say the changes will alter the basic character of the institution. In their view, the ability of even one senator to thwart and frustrate the leadership is an essential ingredient of the American system and a critical guarantee against the ''tyranny of the majority,'' as Senator John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican, put it. Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, added, ''Most of the criticisms of the Senate I consider to be virtues of the Senate.'' As a result, the leaders are trying to negotiate a compromise with their critics, and the outlook for the changes is still uncertain. This sharp-edged collision over the nature and purpose of the Senate actually developed by accident. Earlier this month, the chamber started debating a proposal to change the rules to allow its proceedings to be broadcast on televison and radio, but many lawmakers began to realize that exposing their arcane customs to the viewing public might open them to embarrassment and ridicule. As Senator Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, put it: ''The Senate doesn't work very well. My gosh, if we let people see what's going on here, we've got to make it work better.'' This concern about the Senate's television image played into a longstanding view in some quarters that the legislature's rules were being abused by a small group of members who were more interested in making political points than in passing bills. Accordingly, the two party leaders decided that they could use the television issue to force through changes in the rules that they had been contemplating for a long time. One of their main proposals would make it impossible to conduct a filibuster against a motion to take up a bill. Such delaying tactics often frustrate the leaders' efforts to bring a particular bill to the floor. But Senator William L. Armstrong, a Colorado Republican, argues that by blocking a bill from reaching the floor, a lawmaker can force others to negotiate a compromise that eventually produces better legislation. A second proposed change would severely curtail the ability of a lawmaker to continue a filibuster after the Senate has voted to end it. Under current rules, an ingenious and determined lawmaker can keep a filibuster going almost indefinitely. Senator Evans maintains that this unlimited delaying tactic is an abuse of the rules and the original purpose of the filibuster. Members should be allowed to slow down the debate and make sure an issue is subjected to close scrutiny, but they should not be allowed to kill it, in Mr. Evans's view. ''Ultimately,'' he said, ''the majority in any body has to have the right to conduct its affairs.'' Senator Helms responds that it would be a ''tragic mistake'' to erode the filibuster in any way. ''This is the only legislature in the world,'' he said, ''where a minority of one can get up and oppose a proposal as long as his stamina permits.'' A third major proposal would bar all nongermane amendments from a particular bill if three-fifths of the body agreed to do so. Under current rules, virtually any amendment is in order on any bill, and members complain that they are forced to vote repeatedly on unpalatable issues by colleagues who want to embarrass them politically and raise campaign contributions from special interest groups. ''We have to vote on abortion 4,000 times around here,'' said Senator Chiles. But Mr. Armstrong says many major bills have passed only because they were attached to unrelated measures. The latest example, he said, was the legislation adopted last year mandating a balanced Federal budget. It was added as a rider to a measure raising the national debt ceiling. Underlying these specific arguments is a basic philosophical disagreement. Some say it is necessary to sacrifice a few rights now enjoyed by individual members so as to make the entire body more efficient and responsive. ''People utilize the rules in ways that they were never intended to be used,'' Senator Evans said. ''They use them for personal concepts and ideas and issues. It's created such chaos in the Senate that we can't get anything done. We're approaching gridlock, and that was not intended by the Founding Fathers.'' But opponents of rules changes say that the rights of the individual senator are paramount and that the chamber can always do its work if it mirrors the public will. ''When the country is ready for legislation,'' Senator Armstrong said, ''when the Senate is ready for legislation, we can pass something here with breathtaking speed.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MANILA AFTER MARCOS: VATICAN VIEW; CHURCH ACTIVISM RAISES QUESTION OF POPE'S STAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/27/world/manila-after-marcos-vatican-view-church-activism-raises-question-of-pope-s-stand.html,"Vatican officials said today that the vocal part played by the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines had raised difficult questions about the church's political role and about Pope John Paul II's campaign to distance priests from political activity. But the Vatican generally welcomed the outcome of the struggle, in which President Ferdinand E. Marcos was deposed. ''At the end, the thing was for the best,'' a high Vatican official said. ''Up to this moment, I think everyone in the world has a feeling of relief.'' The only official comment today came from the Pope himself, whose statements on the conflict had been remarkably cautious. Doesn't Mention Marcos or Aquino In a brief address to 7,000 pilgrims and tourists at his regular weekly audience today, the Pope once again chose prudence, avoiding the exultant statements of many Western leaders. He did not mention either Corazon C. Aquino, the opposition leader who became President on Tuesday, or Mr. Marcos. ''In the past few days, I expressed my sentiments for the beloved Philippine people, inviting prayers that in that difficult and worrying situation, a peaceful and just solution, without recourse to violence, might be reached,'' John Paul said. ''Today I want to repeat to those people that I continue to be close to them with affection, and I wish that all again find unity of hearts in pursuing the true good of the nation,'' he said. ''I entrust my wish to most holy Mary, who is so venerated by the Philippine people, asking her to protect and sustain it in the not easy course of its national history,'' he said. Vatican officials said the caution of the Pope's remarks was especially striking in view of the central role played by the Philippine church -especially Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Archbishop of Manila - in overthrowing Mr. Marcos. John Paul's statements, the officials said, reflected his discomfort with an overt political role. The Philippine church showed no such reluctance, the officials noted. The important steps it took included the Catholic bishops' call for resistance to Mr. Marcos in a statement in which they described the Feb. 7 presidential elections as ''unparalled in the fraudulence of their conduct.'' Catholic Radio Voiced Opposition The Catholic station Radio Veritas became the main voice of the opposition. After Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Lieut. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos rebeled against Mr. Marcos, Cardinal Sin told Radio Veritas listeners: ''Our two good friends have shown their idealism. I would be very happy if you could support them now.'' The Cardinal's call was crucial in galvanizing the opposition to Mr. Marcos and bringing demonstrators to the military base where the two men had established themselves. ''It has never happened that the church has put itself to the service of a revolution in this way,'' a Vatican official said. Mr. Marcos, a Catholic, was so enraged by the church's role that at one point he denounced the bishops for using ''priests and nuns not only to help the opposition but to destroy the electoral process.'' Vatican officials acknowledged that the overt role the church played seemed to clash with the Pope's criticisms of political activism by priests, particularly in Nicaragua, where the church has barred four priests in the leftist Sandinista Government from exercising sacral functions. Differences Noted An influential Vatican official said: ''I have already been asked the question: How can the Pope be against the priests in Nicaragua and tolerate Cardinal Sin?'' The Vatican offers several answers to this question. Officials note that the priests in Nicaragua held political office, while Cardinal Sin and the opposition priests sought no political offices. Moreover, the activist Catholics in Nicaragua were allied with Marxists and against the Archbishop of Managua, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo. In the Philippines, priests allied with the Communist New People's Army are a tiny minority. The vast majority of activist priests and nuns are arrayed behind Cardinal Sin and in support of moderate, peaceful change. Vatican officials said that the Pope had great confidence in Cardinal Sin and that the Cardinal had succeeded in defending a moral position and upholding the church's interests in his battle with the Marcos regime. 'Always on the Right Side' ''Sin was a key man,'' said a Vatican official, reflecting the views of other Vatican officials. ''He has always managed to be on the right side.'' The officials also noted that the church had played an important role in the opposition elsewhere - with the Pope's support. One case, they said, was Haiti, where Jean-Claude Duvalier was driven from power this month. In a trip through Central America and the Caribbean in March 1983, the Pope strongly attacked social injustice and political repression in Haiti. The attack, which emboldened the church to intensify its criticism of Mr. Duvalier, included an explicit defense of the church's right to speak out against ''misery, hunger and fear.'' ''The church has a prophetic mission in this field, inseperable from its religious mission,'' the Pope said. Some Unease Acknowledged Still, officials here acknowledged that there was some unease in the Vatican over the extent to which the Philippine church had assumed a leading role in the political struggle. The first clear response came on Feb. 16, when the chief Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro Valls, issued a carefully worded statement expressing support for the Philippine bishops. Coming a day after the bishops had denounced the elections as fraudulent, the statement was interpreted as supporting their action. But over the next week, Vatican officials sought to discount the idea that the Pope himself was endorsing wholeheartedly every aspect of the bishops' statement. The Pope's own comments on Feb. 17, a prayerful call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, supplanted the Saturday statement as the main declaration of Vatican policy. As intense consultations between the Philippine church, the Marcos Government and the United States continued over the next week, the Vatican became increasingly reluctant to make any further public statements. Divisions in Philippine Church Vatican officials also noted that there were divisions within the Philippine church, and a Vatican official said the Marcos family was close to some Filipinos in the Curia, the Vatican's central administration. ''There was a kind of Vatican-Filipino circle that was very plugged in, very pro-Marcos,'' a Vatican official said. ''Imelda Marcos had also cultivated a number of Cardinals.' The official said the Marcos family had emphasized its ''fight against abortion, divorce and Communism.'' In the end, Vatican officials said the events in the Philippines underlined the extent to which the church's political activities are often beyond the direct control of Rome. A Vatican official, asked about why the church had acted as it did in the Philippines, smiled and said with a touch of irony: ''It's a local problem. Cardinal Sin should know why. You should ask him.'' Perhaps most striking, officials said, is the extent to which the hierarchy - once regarded as a reliable supporter of conservative forces - is now willing to align itself with movements for social change. Vatican II Cited They trace the change to the social teachings of the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) and of Popes John XXIII and Paul VI. And they note that despite John Paul's reputation for conservatism on religious issues and his opposition to Communism, he has spoken out often on human rights and social justice. Msgr. William F. Murphy, the undersecretary of the Pontifical Commission on Justice and Peace, argued that there was an inevitable tension between the church's desire to speak out on moral questions - which inevitably involve government policies - and to avoid direct involvement in politics. ''The fundamental fact is that the church has to proclaim certain values that have repercussions in the social sphere,'' Monsignor Murphy said. ''The announcement of these values themselves may indict certain governments and certain regimes. ''We cannot meddle in politics,'' he added, ''but that doesn't mean we can retire to the sacristy.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CATHOLIC PRESS RIGHT TO DISSENT WITHIN CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/us/catholic-press-right-to-dissent-within-church.html,"Many of the same Roman Catholics who placed a 1984 advertisement advocating the right to hold diverse views on abortion have reserved a second full-page advertisement in The New York Times Sunday that criticizes the church hierarchy for its ''reprisals'' against those who dissent. The new advertisement, signed by more than 1,000 Catholics, including five priests and 40 nuns, says some of the 97 signers of the first advertisement have been threatened with dismissal from religious orders and have lost teaching positions and speaking engagements at Catholic institutions. ''We believe that Catholics who in good conscience take positions on the difficult questions of legal abortion and other controversial issues that differ from the official hierarchical positions act within their rights and responsibilities as Catholics and citizens,'' it says. The new advertisement is regarded as provocative even by some liberal Catholics. The editors of The National Catholic Reporter, for instance, warned Catholics not to sign it because it was a ''deceitful, dishonest and divisive effort'' that could exacerbate conflict. #3 Nuns Among New Signers The first advertisement, which some saw as clouding the church's unequivocal prohibition against abortion, touched off a furor. The Vatican demanded that the 24 nuns and four priests who signed it ''publicly repair the scandal'' or face expulsion from the priesthood or their religious orders. At least seven nuns have taken undisclosed steps that successfully resolved the Vatican complaints against them, and the four priests have publicly retracted their action. Frances Kissling, executive director of Catholics for a Free Choice, who is on the steering committee that originated both advertisements, said three nuns who had signed the first advertisement had also signed the one scheduled to run Sunday. She said she had pledged not to identify the three before its publication. In addition, 12 nuns who signed the first advertisement have prepared a statement, to be made public Sunday, applauding the courage of the current signers and advocating ''the right to responsible dissent.'' Both advertisements again focus attention on what constitutes dissent from church teaching and what steps the church should take to assert its teaching authority. 'Solidarity' Is Affirmed In an interview several weeks ago, after plans to run the new advertisement were announced, Russell Shaw, a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said, ''It's off the wall to assert that dissent from church teaching on something as serious and clearly taught as the immorality of abortion is an acceptable position for a Catholic.'' ''It simply is not,'' he said. But he said he was relieved the latest advertisement did not ''put that ridiculous, confusing assertion on the table that somehow dissent from church teaching is just as legitimate a position as acceptance of church teaching.'' He suggested Vatican officials had been particularly angered because the first advertisement implied that approval of abortion was a legitimate Catholic position. The new advertisement carries a headline saying, ''We affirm our solidarity with all Catholics whose right to free speech is under attack.'' It goes on to recall the 1984 advertisement, which appeared a month before the national election while Geraldine A. Ferraro, a Catholic who was the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, was being assailed for supporting abortion in her role as a public official. Chill on Speech Asserted ''Since that time,'' the new advertisement says, ''many of the signers and their families have been penalized by segments of the institutional Roman Catholic Church.'' ''Such reprisals, consciously or unconsciously, have a chilling effect on the right to responsible dissent within the church, on academic freedom in Catholic colleges and universities and on the right to free speech and participation in the U.S. political process.'' Miss Kissling said that among the most recent incidents that prompted the $36,137 advertisement was the excommunication of the director of Planned Parenthood in Rhode Island. ''We feel that the purpose of the Vatican reprisals against women religious and other reprisals is to frighten Catholics into being silent,'' she said. ''It is therefore important that we send a strong and clear message that we will not be silent and that such reprisals on the part of the church will lead to more speaking out, not less.'' Breaking of 'Higher Law' The members of the Committee for Concerned Catholics, which arranged the advertisements, include the novelist Mary Gordon; Rosemary Radford Ruether, who is professor of applied ethics at Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary, and Mary Buckley, a professor at St. John's University, The Catholic bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities, chaired by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, said the church's teaching on abortion is ''binding not only because the church says so, but because this teaching expresses the objective demands placed on all of us by the inherent dignity of human life.'' ''A Catholic who chooses to dissent from this teaching, or to support dissent from it, is dissenting not only from church law but from a higher law which the church seeks to observe and teach,'' the panel continued. ''Such dissent can in no way be seen as legitimate alternative teaching.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FIRST FAMILY'S FOIBLES: A DRAMA IN TWO ACTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/style/first-family-s-foibles-a-drama-in-two-acts.html,"When Patti Davis, elder child of President and Mrs. Reagan, signed a contract to write a semiautobiographical novel about coming of age as the daughter of a Republican with ''hardy good looks and a persuasive voice'' who becomes Governor of California and then President of the United States, she did not mention the fact to her parents. ''Actually, they found out in the press,'' the 33-year-old author was saying the other day. ''Five minutes after I got a book deal I read about it, and so did everybody else.'' Now Miss Davis is embarking on a publicity tour for ''Home Front'' (Crown, $15.95), the revealing book she has written with Maureen Strange Foster. The tour opens in New York on Monday and winds up three weeks later in Seattle, with no scheduled stops in Washington. 'I Still Haven't Heard' Weeks have passed since she wrapped a copy of the book and mailed it to her parents, she said, ''but I still haven't heard whether they read it or not.'' Then, realizing the irony, she laughed and said, ''I'll probably find out in the press.'' After years of shunning the White House limelight, both of the Reagans' children, Patti and Ron, have gone public in their father's last term with irreverent impressions of the First Family. Both have been accused of capitalizing on family connections; the daughter denies the charge, the son cheerfully pleads guilty. ''People are saying, well, this is just an autobiography and all she did was change the names, but that's not true at all,'' Miss Davis said in a telephone interview from Santa Monica, Calif., where she lives with her husband, Paul Grilley, a yoga instructor. No Tear Gas Like the book's heroine, she has differed with her parents on significant issues, including nuclear power, abortion, premarital sex, marijuana and the Vietnam War. But unlike the heroine, she said, ''I was too young to be in an antiwar-movement demonstration, and I've never been around tear gas, ever.'' Describing her book as ''a blend of fact and fiction,'' she said her technique was ''to take conflicts and dilemmas I went through in speaking at antinuclear rallies and opposing my father'' and superimpose the antiwar movement. ''Suddenly,'' she said, ''the conflicts become less ominous, easier to handle when I gave them to another character. I could have her deal with them in ways that maybe I hadn't.'' Miss Davis, who uses her mother's maiden name in her acting career, said her agent was discussing the possibility of a television movie based on the book, with her in the starring role. ''As an actress,'' she said, ''it's the best role that's come my way, and I'd be a fool to give it up to somebody else.'' Asked about reports that she and her co-author received a six-figure advance for the book, Miss Davis sighed and said: ''I don't really talk about money. I just think that's so private.'' In any case, she said, her motive in writing the book was not money. Nor was it an attempt to capitalize on her position. ''The way to capitalize would have been to write an autobiography and sort of an expose. This is a part of my life, and I haven't done anything sensational with it. I hope I've done something creative and entertaining.'' By contrast, her 27-year-old brother Ron, a ballet dancer turned contributing editor of Playboy magazine and correspondent for ABC Entertainment, publicly boasts about trading on the family name. But he disapproved of ''trashing my folks in a mean way,'' he has said. In his opening monologue as a guest host of NBC's ''Saturday Night Live'' a couple of weeks ago, he joked that he was there ''because my father is President of the United States'' and went on to take part in several skits that poked fun at his parents. One skit, a takeoff on the movie ''Risky Business,'' showed him dancing through the White House in shirttails and skivvies after a telephone call in which he assured his mother and father, played by two male comics, that nothing untoward would occur while they were away at Camp David. The following Monday there was a review from the White House. A spokeman quoted the Reagans as saying: ''He was funny. He was at ease. We enjoyed it.'' After a press conference on Tuesday, the President was asked about his younger son's acting debut and replied, ''Like father, like son.'' There has been no White House review of ''Home Front,'' although the First Lady's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, has been asked about it on two occasions. Mrs. Reagan has the book but has not read it, she replied. ''Home Front'' is described on its jacket as a ''candidly autobiographical novel about growing up in the public eye during the other Vietnam War - the war at home.'' Two of its central characters are a ''genial but ideological father'' and ''a strong-willed woman fiercely loyal to her husband's dream: the Presidency.'' The book's heroine ''becomes not only an estranged daughter but a political libability.'' As the book opens, the First Family is moving into the White House and the young son is saying: ''So this is the company housing they gave you, huh, Dad?'' Ducking in and out rooms to inspect the furnishings, the mother exclaims: ''Good grief, I just can't wait to redecorate.'' 'I Didn't See It' Later in the book, the daughter, unable to express her political views to her father, writes him a poem. ''Poem?'' the father says. ''Gee, you know, there are so many other things on my desk, I guess I didn't see it.'' Miss Davis refused to say how closely fact paralleled fiction. She conceded, however, that she shared the heroine's desire to climb into the limousine's front seat so as to be mistaken for the chauffeur's daughter. She said she also shared the heroine's anger and frustration at not being able to speak out when she disagreed with her father on issues because it would hurt him politically. All four children in the First Family - Patti and Ron as well as Maureen, who is Mr. Reagan's daughter by his first wife, Jane Wyman, and Michael, his adopted son - have publicly differed with their father. But perception in recent years has been one of increasing closeness. One sign that Patti Davis had grown closer to her parents was seen when she was married in Los Angeles in August 1984. It was the first of his children's weddings that Mr. Reagan had attended since being elected President. He was in California when Ron got married in New York in 1980 and at Camp David when Maureen was married in California in 1981. Miss Davis said that she still feels close to her parents and that the book helped her to work through some of the hurts and pains of growing up in the public eye. ''At one part in the book the daughter really clarifies her feelings to her parents,'' she said. ''The father says, 'These people in the movement -they're just using you,' and the daughter says: 'Maybe they are using me, but how is that any different from what you're doing? Either way I'm being treated as an appendage of you. Where do you end and I begin?' '' That, Miss Davis says, is the question the book asks but does not answer completely. ''At the end of 'Home Front' they're all under the same roof and still talking,'' she said. ''They still have their differences, but there's a tolerance there. I very deliberately didn't wrap everything up in ribbons because I don't know that there's any more resolution to these problems than just that.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COALITION SEEKS WIDER PENALTY IN RIGHTS LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/us/coalition-seeks-wider-penalty-in-rights-law.html,"A national coalition of civil rights groups today urged Congress to restore antidiscrimination enforcement powers that were curbed by a Supreme Court decision two years ago. The coalition released two reports charging that in the two years since the Supreme Court decision numerous assertions of sex discrimination were going unchecked by the courts and the Federal Government. Both reports also found growing evidence of discrimination on the basis of race and disabilty. A Pledge to 'Redouble Efforts' Members of the coalition, which includes such organizations as the National Organization for Women, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, pledged at a news conference to ''redouble efforts'' and to employ ''bold new strategies'' to win passage of a bill that would overturn the Court decision. The Supreme Court ruling of Feb. 28, 1984, involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania, narrowed the Federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in schools and colleges that receive Federal financial assistance. The Court held that Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 banned sex discrimination only in specific programs or activities receiving Federal aid and not in the entire institution. At the time, various women's rights advocates, civil rights groups and their allies in Congress predicted the Court's ruling would have broad repurcussions that could undermine antidiscrimination provisions under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which bars discrimination against people with disabilities. Efforts to pass a bill designed to reverse the Court ruling have been stalled by attempts to attach an amendment to the bill limiting abortion rights. The bill, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, would bar all discrimination in schools and other teaching facilities that receive Federal funds. The United States Catholic Conference, which has long been a strong supporter of civil rights efforts, objected to the bill, asserting that some of its provisions could be used to force Catholic hospitals that receive Federal aid to perform abortions. The Catholic group is pushing for amendments that would gurantee no cutoff in Federal aid to Catholic hospitals that refused to perform abortions. The House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Education and Labor approved different versions of the bill last year. But sponsors did not push for floor action because of the abortion dispute. A similar bill is before the Senate. 'Can't Defeat Rights Bill' Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, whose group is a member of the coalition, charged at the news conference that ''members of the radical right are using the bill to push through their own legislative agenda.'' ''They can't defeat civil rights bill on its merits, so they will try to kill it with amendments that have nothing to do with the bill,'' he said. The new coalition wants Congress to move ahead on the bill without any amendment. As part of the strategy to pressure Congress for action, The League of Women Voters today unveiled 15,000 petitions it said were signed by members and supporters urging passage of the bill. A report prepared by the Women's Law Center, a private nonprofit group that is a member of the coaltion, and a separate one prepared by the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund Inc., detailed more than a 100 cases of what the studies said were discrimination based on sex and on disability at colleges and other educational institutions receiving Federal funds. Marcia D. Greenberger, a lawyer at the Women's Law Center, said that since the Grove City decision, ''numerous claims of sex discrimination in education have gone unaddressed because Federal funds could not be tracked directly to the department, professor, or activity accused of discrimination'' even though the school itself received Federal money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REPRIMANDED NUNS PUSH DISSENT ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/02/us/reprimanded-nuns-push-dissent-issue.html,"Two Roman Catholic nuns who signed a second advertisement supporting the right to dissent from the church's teaching on abortion after they were reprimanded for signing the first say they are fighting for a less hierarchical church. ''The issue is whether there's a right to dissent - whether there's a right to dialogue,'' said one of them, Sister Patricia Hussey. ''The issues are control and authority and attempts by the hierarchy to impose themselves in our lives.'' Sister Patricia and Sister Barbara Ferraro said they signed the second advertisement to demonstrate ''solidarity with those who have been oppressed'' for signing the first. They said abortion was not the issue. The advertisement lists their names among 15 in a concluding paragraph reading, ''This ad was coordinated by the Committee of Concerned Catholics,'' Other Catholics, even some liberals, called placing the advertisement provocative. #1984 Reaction by Vatican The women, members of the Sisters of Notre Dame in Charleston, W.Va., were among 24 nuns and four priests who signed an advertisement in October 1984 saying there was a ''diversity of opinions'' among Catholics on abortion. Vatican officials, who felt that the advertisement implied there was more than one Catholic position on the issue, said the nuns and priests had created a scandal and ordered them to retract the statement or face dismissal from the priesthood and from their orders. The priests retracted their statements and seven nuns took undisclosed steps that resolved the Vatican complaints against them. The cases of the remaining 17 nuns have not been resolved. The second advertisement appears in The New York Times today, signed by more than 1,000 Catholics, including five priests and 40 nuns. It accuses the church hierarchy of ''reprisals,'' saying some of the 97 signers of the first advertisement lost teaching positions and speaking engagements at Catholic institutions. 'Rights and Responsibilities' ''We believe that Catholics who, in good conscience, take positions on the difficult questions of legal abortion and other controversial issues that differ from the official hierarchical positions act within their rights and responsibilities as Catholics,'' the new advertisement says. It says reprisals have a ''chilling effect on the right to responsible dissent.'' Among those who signed were Sisters Barbara and Patricia and another nun who signed the 1984 advertisement, Sister Rose Dominic Trapasso, a Maryknoll missionary listed in today's advertisement as being in Peru. ''I don't see any problem with this ad,'' Sister Barbara said in a telephone interview. ''All of us have a right to talk without feeling we are under threat of any kind of oppression from Rome.'' Sister Barbara, who is 42 years old, and Sister Patricia, 36, entered the convent at the time or soon after the Second Vatican Council, 1962-1965, was held in Rome. They say they were heartened by the democratic changes encouraged by the documents from the council, an assembly of the church's bishops. ''We entered when there was talk of superiors,'' said Sister Patricia, who is from Massachusetts. ''Now we have begun to operate in a collegial model of mutuality where we try to make decisions by consensus. This is a model the church can learn from instead of imposing things from the top down.'' 'Church Is the People of God' Sister Barbara said the Second Vatican Council ''clearly called all people to be part of the decision-making process.'' But she said the hierarchy excluded from that process women affected by such issues as abortion and birth control. ''The church is talking about its own hierarchical position, but the church in my understanding is the people of God,'' said Sister Barbara. ''We are very loyal to what the church is about and very Catholic.'' Sister Barbara,said she signed the second advertisement because she was upset that the livelihoods of academics and other lay people who signed the first had been jeopardized. She is not worried about her own livelihood, she said, because, while she is a member of a religious order, she is not employed by the church. She and Sister Patricia are co-directors of Covenant House in Charleston, which has a program for the homeless run by a board of members of many faiths. The directors have told both women their jobs are safe. The two nuns declined to discuss their views on abortion. Concession by Vatican Aides ''The issue has never been abortion,'' said Sister Barbara. ''The issue is a call to dialogue, the right of men and women in the church other than the hierarchy to have the right of free speech.'' After the first advertisement appeared, the nuns were questioned about their actions in telephone calls from their order's headquarters in Rome. Delegates from the order have also met with them in Washington, D.C., and Massachusetts. The delegates, said Sister Patricia, have been supportive and have told them that Jean Jerome Cardinal Hamer, head of the Vatican's Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes, acted harshly in calling for their dismissal. Sister Barbara said she would refuse to sign a statement demanded by the Vatican that says she supports the church's teaching on abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CATHOLICS AND ABORTION: ISSUE IS RIGHT TO DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/us/catholics-and-abortion-issue-is-right-to-dissent.html,"How far can Roman Catholics go in dissenting from the teachings of the church and still consider themselves good and loyal Catholics? That issue has been raised once again by an advertisment in The New York Times yesterday advocating the right to dissent from the church's teachings against abortion. The more than 1,000 signers of the advertisement, including five priests, 40 nuns and several academics, argue that ''Catholics who in good conscience take positions on the difficult questions of legal abortion and other controversial issues that differ from the official hierarchical positions act within their rights and responsibilities as Catholics and citizens.'' But Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, in a statement anticipating the appearance of the ad, said that the church's position that abortion is morally wrong is a ''binding'' one on Catholics because it expresses both church law and the higher natural law of the dignity of human life. Dissent from the church's position on abortion and support of dissent are wrong, he said. In an interview several weeks ago, the Cardinal, chairman of the American bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities, said that Catholics are expected to give their assent to church teaching, ''especially something that has been taught consistently from the very beginning.'' This, he said, was made clear in one of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, ''The Constitution of the Church.'' ''We do have an obligation to give assent,'' he said. Many Theological Wrinkles The issue of dissent has many theological wrinkles. Interviews with theologians indicate dissent from some teachings is less serious than from others. There are some kinds of dissent that could place a Catholic outside the embrace of the institutional church and others that would not. Moreover, while some teachings may be ironclad, there may be legitimate differences over how those teachings can be applied. The Rev. Richard P. McBrien, chairman of the theology department at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, says people fall outside the church when they dissent from a ''defined doctrine'' that has been labeled as infallible or is considered to be so, such as the teaching of the divinity of Christ or the Immaculate Conception. ''If I were to dissent from the papal teaching on birth control,'' he said, ''I might be a disloyal Catholic but it doesn't have the effect of putting me outside the church. If one were to reject a defined doctrine of the church, one could not be a Catholic.'' Abortion, he said, is not a defined doctrine. The Ending of Lives Nevertheless, he said, dissent from the abortion teaching is far more serious than dissent from regular attendance at mass or even the prohibition against the use of contraceptive devices, he said. ''The issue is what is at stake,'' he said. ''If I refuse to have children and use birth control I'm not killing anyone, but if I have three abortions I'm ending three lives, according to church teachings.'' Abortion also carries a harsher penalty within formal church law. Among the handful of violators subject to excommunication in the church's new Code of Canon Law is ''a person who procures a successful abortion.'' The authority of the teaching against abortion is strengthened by the overwhelming agreement among Catholic theologians that abortion is wrong. There is wider disagreement on the birth control teaching. The authority of the birth control teaching, Father McBrien suggested, was muddied after a majority of a papal commission that considered the issue in the 1960's said birth control was acceptable in some cases. While Pope Paul VI effectively overruled the commission's recommendation in a 1968 encyclical, ''the teaching authority of the Pope was in fact hurt,'' the priest said. More Consultation Seen ''The birth control enyclical has changed the landscape more than anything since Vatican II because lots of people who before had never thought about assent or dissent were affected,'' he said. ''You had a new attitude among rank-and-file Catholics where they didn't automatically accept a church teaching.'' Since then, he said, American bishops have been far more careful to consult a broad spectrum of Catholics before emphasizing a teaching. The Rev. Charles E. Curran, a professor of moral theology at Catholic University whose independent stands have drawn Vatican concern, supports the church's position on abortion but believes ''the church has to be big enough that some people within the church can dissent.'' Moreover, he said, one can hold that abortion is completely immoral and still believe it should be permitted as a matter of state or Federal law. ''In the application of principles,'' he said, ''you have to recognize a pluralism of positions, allow prudential judgments.'' Facing the Consequences Father McBrien pointed out that a Catholic may depart from a serious church teaching when, after proper reflection and study of differing viewpoints, the person is convinced the teaching violates his or her conscience. ''Every human being has a duty to follow his or her conscience,'' he said. ''St. Thomas Aquinas said that if you're convinced your conscience is still your proper guide, you have an obligation to act against an official teaching of the church.'' However, he said, Catholics who reach the end of this philosophical road must take the consequences. ''They can't complain if they're not particularly welcome to give talks at major Catholic conventions or to be hired as consultants to bishops or professors at a university,'' he said. The signers of the new advertisement criticized the Catholic hierarchy for reprisals against those who had signed an October 1984 advertisement saying there was a ''diversity of opinions'' among Catholics regarding abortion. The reprisals, the second ad said, included threats of dismissal from religious orders, dismissal from teaching positions and cancellations of speaking engagements. ''Just like Martin Luther King was willing to go to jail, these people can't have it both ways,'' Father McBrien said. ''They can't expect to continue in the Catholic Church with the same access to Catholic institutions that they would have had before.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW GENERATION OF WOMEN'S PUBLICATIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/style/new-generation-of-women-s-publications.html,"Just when the women's movement seemed to be running into trouble, as the political fervor of the 1970's gave way to the pragmatism of the 1980's, a new generation of grass-roots women's magazines and newspapers has emerged around the country. The 1986 edition of the Index/Directory of Women's Media, published last month in Washington by the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press, reflects the strength and diversity of this trend. This year's directory - there has been one every year since 1975 - lists 331 women's periodicals in the United States alone, as well as 81 women's presses and 48 women's bookstores. The first edition of the directory listed 131 periodicals and 22 presses. The editor of the directory, Martha Leslie Allen, says that 75 new women's publications have sprung up every year for at least a decade, although a large number also die. Paula Kassell, a member of the Women's Institute and founder of the newspaper New Directions for Women, published every two months, said, ''There is a never-ending fount of women out there who want to communicate and bring people together.'' Many of these newspapers and magazines have only a few thousand readers, but, Mrs. Kassel said, ''the circulations add up to a fantastic number.'' Number and Variety For Miss Allen, there is something even more important: ''It's not just the numbers that are growing every year, but also the variety of the publications,'' she said. The new periodicals are reaching different kinds of women - working women, religious women, sportswomen and others -until now uninterested in or unenthusiastic about women's issues. Some of the publications call themselves feminist, others do not. Many still emphasize the issues of abortion, equal rights and equal pay that have occupied the feminist movement for more than a decade. Others, while still concerned with women's getting ahead, are giving the word feminism new connotations. ''Some may even be reluctant to use the word,'' Mrs. Kassel said, ''but the driving force behind them all is concern for women's equality.'' The entries in the Index/Directory range from the colorful - Spiritual Mothering Journal, or Fighting Woman News, a quarterly about women's martial arts and self-defense - to the scholarly Women's Studies Review. In a catalogue arranged according to ZIP code, Eidos: Erotica for Women, By Women is listed immediately before the Harvard Women's Law Journal. On Subject of Health Various entries are devoted to health: Consuming Passions Newsletter, for women with eating disorders or suffering from compulsive eating habits; the National Women's Health Network News, and Childbirth Alternatives Quarterly. Several cater to working women, both white collar and blue collar. They range from National Business Woman and The Executive Female to Firework, a monthly newsletter for women who are firefighters, and Tradeswomen Magazine, described as ''the only national publication by and for women in nontraditional, blue-collar jobs.'' Others, such as Broomstick, for women older than 40, show a wry humor in their titles. A number of publications are lesbian-oriented. One striking trend is the growing number of regional publications: L.A. Woman, Woman in Washington and Vermont Woman, to name only a few. ''New papers are coming out all over the country,'' Mrs. Kassel said. ''The South, for example, is waking up; and not just the South.'' Gloria Steinem says that this growth of new publications is because, not in spite of, the setbacks that have frustrated the women's movement in recent years; the defeat of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment, for example, and the rise of a powerful movement opposed to abortion. In her view, the backlash is inevitable, something that happens to all political movements, and ''a tribute to our success.'' Besides, she says, the backlash has encouraged activist women ''by making it clear that nothing will happen automatically.'' In her view, ''This opposition has only increased people's feeling of need for alternative media. Women feel that no one is going to give them anything and they know they have to do it by their own efforts.'' Lack of Communication Southern Feminist, published every two months in Athens, Ga., is in some ways typical of the new publications. Its editor, Sharron Hannon, said that it ''grew out of the E.R.A. ratification effort.'' Working in the early 1980's as a full-time volunteer in the campaign to ratify the equal rights amendment, she was frustrated by the lack of communication among activists and the poor coverage they received. ''Here in the South,'' she said, ''we have a harder struggle. We need to know that there are others out there who are also concerned. It can be very lonely being a feminist in the South.'' Her response, in July 1984, was to put out the first issues of Southern Feminist. Friends and family put up the money; articles came from associates in the ratification movement and the Georgia chapter of the National Organization for Women. She and a friend put together the first issue in her kitchen - they still work there and still receive no salaries - with help from her husband and children. A classified ad in Ms. magazine announced the appearance of the new paper, but there was no money for more publicity. Today, Mrs. Hannon prints 5,000 to 10,000 copies of each issue and just manages to break even. Other feminist writers and editors have reacted to the adverse climate by moving away from the angry, separatist language often heard in the early years of the movement. Martha Leslie Allen sees a marked shift in tone: '' You don't see as much of the kind of personal, we-are-victims type of response. Today it's more: What are we going to do about it?'' Sojourner, which has published in Boston since 1975, is by now a kind of institution among feminist publications, a successful business in its own right with a circulation of 25,000, and a model for many newer regional papers. It is, like most of those publications, a self-consciously grass-roots effort, with an extensive letters section and transcripts of local women's conferences. It is also very much dedicated to creating networks by putting activists in touch with other activists and encouraging recruits to volunteer their time. But like many of the newest magazines, Sojourner reaches beyond the politicized core of the women's movement. Its editor, Shane Snowden, says, ''The younger women coming along want publications that speak to more than the traditional women's issues of abortion, equal rights and equal pay.'' According to Miss Snowden, readers want articles on what she calls ''women's spirituality'' and women's health. They are more interested in literary matters, and need sophisticated advice about careers and personal relations. They are, in short, more ''life-style oriented.'' Some of the newer magazines have gone even further to appeal to a more general audience of women. In some ways, Sherren Leigh's own career mirrors the changes in the women's movement. She calls herself an ''aging flower child,'' but before 1973, when she founded Today's Chicago Women, she was working in an advertising agency. Today, she publishes a well-heeled monthly directed at professional and executive women. Unlike many of her counterparts nationwide, she has a good salary, a secretary and an ample staff. The focus of the paper is on women getting ahead - each issue features a profile of a successful Chicago woman as well as columns of career counseling and financial advice - but it does not shy away from features on fashion, makeup and interior decorating. Miss Leigh seems somewhat concerned by this. Still, she said pragmatically, ''If you're going to sell, you have to look at what the advertisers want.'' This pragmatism is reflected in the pages of her paper, which, like many of the new publications, is filled with practical advice for women who want to help themselves and other women. Some ads, for shops or health care facilities and other services, say explicitly that these services are ''for women, by women.'' Kate Rand Lloyd, editor at large of Working Woman magazine, believes that changes in the women's movement have created a new role and new readership for women's magazines. A decade ago, she recalls, feminists were baffled by the question: ''Why don't women support other women?'' In those days, to her at least, the answer was obvious: ''The powerless never support the powerless.'' Today, however, things are different. 'Successful Women' ''There is,'' Mrs. Lloyd said, ''a growing movement of successful women who are supporting other women, supporting them with investments and campaign contributions, organizing services to help battered women and rape victims.'' Gloria Steinem sees much the same kind of trend. What pleases her most about the new magazines is the readership they are attracting: ''It's no longer just the people who have time to go to the meetings,'' she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S. GROUPS URGE VATICAN TO ACT ON ABORTION AD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/us-groups-urge-vatican-to-act-on-abortion-ad.html,"Vatican officials said today that antiabortion groups in the United States were urging action against the signers of advertisements asserting the right of Roman Catholics to dissent on the issue. The remarks by the officials came in response to questions concerning an advertisement in The New York Times on Sunday. The advertisement, which carried the names of more than 1,000 Catholics, asserted ''the right to responsible dissent within the Church.'' Msgr. Giulio Nicolini, a Vatican spokesman, said the Vatican would have no immediate response. But the officials predicted that the Vatican would take steps this year on the issue. The officials acknowledged that there were differences with American Catholics on the issue of dissent. The Rev. Diarmuid Martin, an official of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said in an interview that Americans were ''so sensitive because they come from a democratic tradition and live in an authoritarian Church.'' He said he used the word authoritarian ''not in a bad sense of authoritarianism, but in the sense of having clear lines of authority.'' Father Martin, who attended a meeting of antiabortion activists here this weekend, said American Catholics opposed to legal abortion were pressing the Vatican to take action. ''They are saying that for the sake of the pro-life movement, the Vatican must bring this question to a conclusion,'' Father Martin said. He said the issues involved transcended the advertisements and covered matters ranging from the role of Catholic universities to the rights and responsibilities of Catholic theologians. The advertisement on Sunday raised the issue of higher education, referring to the ''chilling effect'' that Vatican ''reprisals'' had on academic freedom. Vatican officials said the dispute was likely to affect a current study of the state of American religious orders and a document on the status of Catholic universities around the world. Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco, who heads an ad hoc committee evaluating religious life, is in Rome this week for discussions. The education document, from the Congregation for Catholic Education, is seeking to reinforce the Catholic identity of Church-related universities and to insure orthodoxy in theology, philosophy and cannon law. The document and the discussion surrounding it have bred fear among Catholic scholars that academic freedom could be hindered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BISHOPS RESIST U.S. SUBPOENA OF DOCUMENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/nyregion/bishops-resist-us-subpoena-of-documents.html,"The National Conference of Catholic Bishops said yesterday that it would not comply with Federal court subpoenas asking it to turn over internal documents on its anti-abortion activities, and that it would be willing to risk a citation for contempt of court. The conference, while not a defendant, has been embroiled in a five-year-old lawsuit by a group called Abortion Rights Mobilization and more than 20 other plaintiffs seeking to have the Internal Revenue Service remove the tax-exempt status of the Roman Catholic Church. The plaintiffs contend that the church, in vigorously opposing abortion, has engaged in political activities that are restricted under the tax laws. On Feb. 26, Judge Robert L. Carter of Federal District Court in Manhattan issued subpoenas for a variety of documents of the conference dealing with possible political activities by the church and any anti-abortion activities that might be considered political. Among the documents are those relating to the bishops' Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities, a 10-year-old plan that was substantially revised last year. Deadline Has Passed Yesterday was the deadline for turning over the documents, but the conference - the chief organization of Catholic bishops in the United States - told Judge Carter it would disobey the order. ''The conference was convinced that the subpoenas raised grave constitutional issues of jurisdiction, religious liberty and other First Amendment concerns and that these concerns could affect all religious organizations,'' said William Ryan, a spokesman for the conference, which has its headquarters in Washington. The conference, he said, would rather accept a contempt citation and seek a review of the issues in the Federal appellate courts. Any penalties would be held in abeyance during an appeal. Mr. Ryan said he could not recall another occasion when the conference had refused to honor a subpoena. ''We told the judge that it's not any lack of respect but we felt it had to go to a higher court,'' he said. ''The Catholic conference is not engaged in political activities,'' Mr. Ryan added. ''It is fighting a matter of principle: whether a third-party group can get the Catholic Church to turn over documents.'' Marshall Beil, the attorney for the plaintiffs, argued that Judge Carter had already dismissed questions of religious liberty in authorizing the subpoenas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPREME COURT; BLACKMUN ON SEARCH FOR THE CENTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/supreme-court-blackmun-on-search-for-the-center.html,"Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun is constantly aware that the Supreme Court ruling for which he is best known, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion, could someday be reversed. But ''if it goes down the drain,'' Justice Blackmun recently told some law students in Washington, ''I'd still like to regard Roe v. Wade as a landmark in the progress of the emancipation of women.'' Justice Blackmun's public evocation of a parental interest in an opinion he wrote would have been highly unusual a few years ago. By custom, Justices rarely discuss their work beyond the bench. But the tradition has been breached with increasing frequency of late, notably by Justice Blackmun, who has seemed to enjoy the casual recounting of anecdotes about the Court and its members, almost as if to say, ''So, what's the harm in talking about this?'' 'Hungry for Information' His remarks about the abortion ruling were made last month at George Washington University's National Law Center in a speech in which he also gave his evaluation of the Court's political makeup and discussed how he and his colleagues got along in an atmosphere thick with collegial disagreement. Americans have a surprisingly high level of interest in their courts, he said, particularly the Supreme Court. ''People seem to be hungry for information,'' he added. Justice Blackmun first discussed his view that the Court was moving to the right in a speech at a Washington men's club 18 months ago. The press was not invited, but accounts nonetheless reached the public. The same was true of his talk at the law school, which one student taped. As Justice Blackmun sees the current ideological makeup of the Court, it has become more conservative since Sandra Day O'Connor became the first woman on the Court in 1981. He described his own role as a jurist struggling to maintain the ideological center on a Court that has moved rightward. Critical of Press's Labels Even as he defined the political cast of his colleagues, he cautioned against easy acceptance of the labels of conservative and liberal. He criticized news organizations as trying to fit the Justices into such categories. ''If one likes to classify and to label,'' he went on, four of the Justices are presumed to be Democrats and the five others Republicans. ''But there are other ways, of course, in which labels can be affixed,'' he said. ''Our friends of the press do this when they try to divide between the so-called conservatives and the so-called liberals.'' When a Justice on any given case does not fit the preconceived notion, Justice Blackmun went on, ''the press and the media are troubled and confused.'' But he seemed to use labels himself as he described the Court. ''I, with others, have been trying to hold the center,'' he said. ''I think we've been fairly lucky in how we've come out in the past two years, even though we're short a shoe.'' Before Justice O'Connor replaced Potter Stewart on the Court, Justice Blackmun said that ''I had always put on the left'' Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall and on the right Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Rehnquist. ''Five of us,'' he said, were ''in the middle.'' Current Ideological Breakdown Now, ''I think it is fairly clear,'' he said, that Justice O'Connor ''is on the right and so the division now would be two, four and three,'' breaking the Court down to left, center and right. He offered the caveat that such division did not hold for every case. ''In the criminal field I think Byron White is distinctly a conservative,'' he said. ''One gets into racial problems, however, and Byron is distinctly to the left of center. I think it's the old John F. Kennedy influence, if you like.'' Justice White was in the Justice Department under President Kennedy, who later named him to the court. Justice Blackmun said the Justices worked hard at getting along despite philosophical disagreements. ''There are moments of tension, of course, and I can see some coming up,'' he added. He described one such disagreement, concerning the number of cases the Court agrees to hear. The Chief Justice, he said, feels it is not necessary to take some cases because it is acceptable to allow ''tolerable conflict out there,'' in lower court rulings. ''Justice White feels that no conflict is tolerable,'' Justice Blackmun added. Frequency of Reversals When asked by a student about the 1973 ruling on abortion, Justice Blackmun said he supposed his audience would divide on whether they agreed with it. ''That's fine,'' he added. ''You have convictions. Stay with them. That's what this country is all about.'' But he said he wanted to emphasize that he knew ''any case is likely to go down the drain'' at one time or another. ''We overrule two or three every year,'' he said. Roe v. Wade, he went on, is being ''attacked from every possible direction.'' But ''whatever happens,'' he said, ''it's been on the books for 13 years now.'' ''I think it was right when it was decided,'' he concluded. ''I think it's right now.'' His assessment of the ruling in terms of ''the emancipation of women'' brought a resounding cheer from the students.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LONG ISLAND OPINION; ROLE MODELS, BUT NOT GOOD MODELS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/nyregion/long-island-opinion-role-models-but-not-good-models.html,"MY first reaction to some of the contemporary statistics about teen-age pregnancy is incredulity. I simply find the numbers too difficult to comprehend. Colleagues tease me, suggesting that I abandon my value system and join the reality of the post-1984 world. In spite of myself I cringe when I read that out-of-wedlock births in New York City have reached epidemic proportions. Alas, whatever occurs in the Big Apple somehow filters down to suburbia a few years later. The number of incidents won't be as high, but suburban cases will increase and our statisticians will unanimously agree that the upward curve is mathematically significant. How did it happen? I anguish for the young woman, for the family and for the innocent newborn child. The family, once the sacred pedestal of American values, is disintegrating. Our churches are groping for answers. Because other support systems have failed, our schools are being asked to assume more and more responsibilities in areas that were once outside the educational domain. There is no way to find an instant cure for the ills of society, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't explore means to address the trend. The pendulum that we're told will swing back needs an energy force to reverse its direction. A determined citizen organization should let its voice be heard. The voice should not be extreme but united. The right-to-lifers and those who support the right to abortion, the liberals and conservatives, the Republicans and Democrats, the various ethnic groups all must see their cause as secondary to the preservation of our society. We must develop some united goals and then the objectives to move toward the ideal. Many years ago our professional athletes posed smoking cigarettes, and young people responded to the obvious message. These ads have ceased because of a combination of reasons, and public condemnation was clearly a major factor. We let it be known that it wasn't going to be economically advantageous to a company to use this form of Madison Avenue hype to hurt our children. The outcry succeeded in awakening a sleeping Congress, usually content with the money they gained for their campaigns from the tobacco industry, to ban such advertisements. Thus we have a model for action. Here are some forms of action that should unite most groups that suffer from what I call one-issue blindness: * Couldn't those who favor the right to legal abortions explore along with their adversaries' programs to educate against pre-marital sex? * Couldn't both sides unite to inform the media that publicity about actresses posing with their children born out of wedlock may influence adolescents and add to the staggering rate of teen-age pregnancy? * Couldn't we begin to let the major networks know that we do not want the afternoon soaps to graphically depict simulated sex, drug abuse and X-rated topics during a G-rated time slot? I suspect that there will be an outcry that some of these ideas are violating the First Amendment privileges of our Constitution. I'm merely counseling restraint, not control. Acknowledgment, if not awards, could be given to television stations that honestly adhere to the original intent of the family hour, reduce the illicit sexual subplots of daytime soaps, create G-rated heroes, maximize the air time of good news and wholesome activities, and, finally, downplay the in-depth reporting of violence and those who commit crimes. Good role models are difficult for young people to discover. With ballplayers involved in drug abuse, television hosts joking about getting high, the media accepting and even glorifying the extramarital affairs of entertainment personalities, is it any wonder that our young people are confused about who are the good guys? There are Hollywood marriages that have lasted a lifetime, businesses and politicians who are ethical and moral young people who truly care about others. Maybe it's time to consciously emphasize the good and to limit the air time of the less wholesome aspects of society. We all accept that ''courtesy is contagious.'' So, too, does good news beget good feelings. Let's not be ashamed of our wholesome role models. They truly deserve to have top billing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/nyregion/new-jersey-journal.html,"FLOATING down the runway, they dipped left and right, swaying to the music and striking poses in the classic fashion-show manner. But the fashions were vintage and the theme was feminist politics in ''The Politics of Fashion'' at the Community Services Building in Paramus last Sunday. The event - a look at women's history through style - was a commemoration of Women's History Week. It was sponsored by the Bergen County Commission on the Status of Women, a 13-member advisory group to the county's Board of Chosen Freeholders. Wearing clothes supplied by L.M.L. Fashions of Elmwood Park, the models - in real life, they teach school, nurse patients, practice law, sing songs and tend bar - posed as Gibson Girls, flappers, Rosie the Riveter (complete with rivet gun), 1950's housewives and 1960's ''flower children,'' among other types. Politics was represented, too, as Freeholder Doris Mahalick kicked up her heels to a 1940's beat in a black velvet fur-trimmed coat. On a more serious note, Joan M. Wright, director of the Division on Women of the state's Department of Community Affairs, addressed the group. ''It took 72 years from the convention at Seneca Falls for women to win the right to vote,'' she said. ''It may take another 72 years to get quality, affordable child care in Bergen County, a rape crisis center in Bergen and pay equity in the nation. We may not see these in our lifetime, but we must work toward these goals for our daughters and sons and our grandchildren.'' Janet Burling Manning, a member of the County Commission and coordinator of the event, explained in an interview the rationale behind the style show. ''Fashion is the mirror of society,'' Mrs. Manning said. ''Through the ages, women's styles have provided us with a reflection of the times - political, social and economic.'' After World War I, she said, women began to realize their equality, and the tight corsets that had squeezed their bodies into painful hourglass shapes began to disappear. Along came the flappers, who flouted convention at every opportunity. And, in the 1940's, women went off to factories, frequently in jumpsuits. ''You don't do assembly-line work in a pretty little frilly dress,'' Mrs. Manning said. With the 1950's, she went on, the postwar mentality reflected women's return to the home and clothing took a more revealing, constricted look (tight skirts, high heels and a revitalization of the hated girdle). ''The women's movement raised the consciousness of apparel designers, shoe manufacturers and society in general,'' said Mrs. Manning. ''We went from tight skirts and spike heels that made us wobble to loose, comfortable clothing, refusing to be treated as sex objects and refusing to dress that way.'' Besides revealing women's history through clothing, the fashion show disclosed another fact: Dresses in grandmother's time were much smaller than those of today. Women, in general, appeared to have been more petite. ''There was some difficulty,'' Mrs. Manning admitted, ''in fitting today's woman into yesterday's clothing.'' ''Who am I? What do I want? What do I want to be?'' The dozen or so teen-agers singing these lyrics could be any youths down the block, in anyone's neighborhood, singing lines from a popular song. The words, however, come from personal problems, and the youngsters call Fair Oaks Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Summit, home. The ''Adolescent Outreach Performance Group'' comprises youngsters who have been hospitalized for alcohol or drug abuse, eating disorders, depression or attempted suicides. Their dramatic one-hour program, which they have been presenting throughout the state, is part of their own therapeutic learning experience, as well as an educational tool for adults and other teen-agers. (Appearances by the group are scheduled for March 18 at the Molly Pitcher Inn in Red Bank and April 8 at the Ramada Inn in Rochelle Park. For information about free school and community performances, call (201) 522-7038.) The group was begun by Dr. Gary B. Rosenberg, director of the Adolescent Center at Fair Oaks, as part of a substance-abuse program in the New Providence school system in 1983. ''The idea was to have kids in the hospital talk to kids in the schools,'' Dr. Rosenberg said. ''We thought that it's better to have a peer talk to a peer about his own experiences, to identify with the theme that everyone has worries and problems. And that there is a positive and negative way of dealing with those problems.'' In the 20 or so middle and high schools the group has traveled to, songs, poems and skits about family difficulties are dramatized. Then audience and actors get together in small groups to discuss solutions to the problems presented. ''We found that the kids in the school have similar problems to those in the hospital,'' Dr. Rosenberg said. ''The show really stirs up a discussion among the students afterwards. We tell the school officials to be prepared for this, to follow it up.'' As for the members of the Adolescent Outreach Performance Group, taking their own show on the road is a big part of their learning to cope with the world with growing self-confidence. ''These kids, in reaching out to help other kids, get a real high,'' Dr. Rosenberg said. Women in north-central Morris County will suffer a lack of affordable and available health services because of the recent budget decision of the county's Board of Chosen Freeholders, according to Joyce Bator-Rabinoff of Randolph Township, president of the Morris County chapter of the National Organization for Women. ''The issue is health care for low- and marginal-income women for family planning needs,'' said Mrs. Bator-Rabinoff. What worries Mrs. Bator-Rabinoff and her colleagues in the area is the decision of the county not to increase Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jersey's funds from last year's $10,000 to $20,000 but, instead, to split the money between the family planning agency and two pregnancy counseling groups, Birthright of Dover and the Friendship Crisis Pregnancy Center of Morristown. The county's Human Services Advisory Council, which evaluates grants for human services agencies, opposed financing for both Birthright and the crisis center on the following grounds: proposed financing would be for purposes other than direct services, services would duplicate that of the Morris County District Office of the state's Division of Youth and Family Services and the lack of information or referral for family planning by these groups. Mrs. Bator-Rabinoff said that Planned Parenthood in Morris County served 8,500 women. ''There are another estimated 7,000 women out there not getting services because of lack of funds for outreach and education to them,'' she said. One reason for the increase in women's needing health-care services, she said, was the merger last fall of Riverside Hospital in Boonton Township and St. Clare's Hospital in Denville. Riverside had provided birth-control information and services, abortions and sterilization; St. Clare's, a Catholic facility, has eliminated the services. ''In terms of transportation, it's very difficult for women of the Boonton area to get to Morristown Memorial or Dover General,'' Mrs. Bator-Rabinoff said. ''We have a lot of poor women in this rich county.'' However, Alex DeCroce, director of the Board of Freeholders, said: ''Frankly, this is a moral issue. When you have youngsters going into different agencies and getting all kinds of contraceptives, parents aren't too happy.'' The two pregnancy counseling agencies, Mr. DeCroce said, ''are providing a service that is necessary: shelter homes for pregnant teen-agers.'' (Some of the financing is to aid in the search for such homes.) As for the need for women's health services, he said, ''There are not a large number of poor women in this area. And transportation is a poor argument. They can get to Dover or Morristown from Boonton or Netcong if they have to.'' From April 5 through 9, the Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls becomes a temple of art. Its classrooms are converted into galleries while the children and teachers study their religion next door. And the faithful flock of temple members become art mavens - selecting, hosting, teaching children's workshops, conducting school tours and providing food and drink for visitors. The 16th annual Monmouth Festival of the Arts will have 200 artists and craftsmen, as well as theatrical artists such as a mime and juggler, a theater troupe and a dance company. ''The show is unique,'' said Laurie Lowenstein of Lincroft, chairman of the festival, ''because we're not simply a sales vehicle. It serves as a museum so that people can - and do - come just to look. Of course, it's also the best buy in town.'' (Admission is $3 for adults, $2 for students and the elderly.) Artists whose works will be on display include the painter Sara Eyestone of Ocean Township, designer of the official commemorative plate of the Statue of Liberty; Elisa B. Chalem, a sculptor from Englewood Cliffs, and Irene Koldorf of Springfield, a stone and metal sculptor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIBERALS: THEIR OWN WORST ENEMY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/magazine/liberals-their-own-worst-enemy.html,"BACK WHEN I WAS A KID, AN ENTER-prising 14-year-old at my summer camp decided to conduct a poll, bunk by bunk, on the Presidential race then under way. It was a couple of days after Lyndon B. Johnson had the Democrats assembled in Atlantic City in 1964 nominate him by acclamation. The result of the poll, something like 124 for L.B.J. and one for Barry Goldwater, stunned more than a few of us; we couldn't figure out who had voted for Goldwater. Upon investigation, it turned out to have been a kid who habitually walked around with a deck of washable playing cards and wore a T-shirt bearing an illustration of a fiery car wreck. The camp geek. And, it was additionally ascertained, even his allegiance to the Republican candidate was shaky; it was based on an obscure family connection to William E. Miller, Goldwater's running mate, who, years later, would turn up, fittingly, in one of the early ''Do-you-know-me?'' American Express commercials. I found myself thinking back on that long ago summer - when virtually everyone I encountered seemed to be politically to the left of center and proud of it - one recent Sunday after stumbling upon a depressing little something deep in the morning paper. Headlined ''A Liberal by Any Other Name May Get More Votes,'' it confirmed with actual data what most people had known before only from being alive: that this is a godawful time to be a liberal. Indeed, according to The New York Times/CBS News Poll cited in the article, while the term ''conservative'' elicited a positive reaction among better than two-thirds of those prepared to venture an opinion, the term ''liberal'' made more than half say they ''think worse'' of someone to whom it was applied. How, I wondered over my raisin bran, and not for the first time, had it come to this? How, so quickly, had we liberals gone from society's good guys, on our way to imposing our own moral vision upon the future, to something very like pariahs? How, above all, had it come to pass that right-wing Republicans, of all people, had ended up with a stranglehold on the very issues - those involving moral values and ethical responsibility - that had once been virtually conceded to the left? A large part of what happened, of course, is altogether obvious: history itself. Exactly a year before we junior liberals cast our ballots for L.B.J. at summer camp, many of us had listened, transfixed, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in Washington, articulated a common dream; in 1965, Stokely Carmichael, talking ''black power,'' would expel young whites en masse from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, initiating a fundamental change in the character of the civil-rights movement. In his acceptance speech that summer of 1964, Johnson lingered over the war against poverty; but three weeks before, the headlines had been about the Tonkin Gulf. Quite simply, the convulsions of the late 1960's not only turned liberals against one another, but stripped liberalism itself of the moral certitude that had made it so potent a force in the first place; and, more than that, the upheavals allowed liberalism's adversaries to associate it in the public mind with disorder and chronic naivete, a stigma that has persisted through all the years since. And now - need it even be observed? - we're at the nadir. It's not just that our old adversaries are prospering (the geek in the T-shirt is probably chief executive officer of some corporation by now), but that we ourselves seem so woefully out of sync with the prevailing mood. All around us, not just in the State of the Union address, but on movie screens, in print, in commercials for automobiles and beer and life insurance, we find an unabashed reverence for ''traditional values.'' Yet, for many liberals, these very words, ringing as they do with nostalgia for a time when patriotism, order and the primacy of the nuclear family were unquestioned verities in American life, are suspect, suggesting provincialism, intolerance and meanness of spirit. Faced with a President beloved beyond all rational measure, we sometimes actually find ourselves embarrassed to argue positions that he has managed to characterize as softheaded or softhearted. In liberal circles, all of this has, for years now, been cause for bottomless frustration. We know what the problem is, all right, just as well as we knew it during the time of Nixon and his silent majority - not simply the guy in the White House, but the average boob in the streets unable, or unwilling, to see through him. And what do you do about that? Blaming the unenlightened electorate is, in its odd way, a comforting notion. For what we have been far less comfortable acknowledging, what many of us liberals are loath to deal with even as a theoretical proposition, is: that our predicament might also be of our own making; that, though in the American philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen's definition, liberalism involves the willingness to examine all premises in the light of available evidence, too often we have been prisoners of a dogma at odds with others' day-to-day experience; that routinely there is a gulf between our ideals in the abstract and the specifics of our own lives; that, most directly to the point, our cynicism about ''traditional values'' appears to reflect the kind of insensitivity to the human condition that, in other circumstances, we are the first to deplore. It is, all in all, not terribly surprising that, as Peter D. Hart, the pollster for Walter F. Mondale, puts it: ''For the Democrats, the values issues were never a central agenda item. The perennials tend to be the economy and war and peace.'' Meanwhile, Richard Wirthlin, Hart's Republican counterpart, compiled extensive research data confirming that, as he puts it: ''In voters' minds, those issues frequently override all others. We found a real contrast between Ronald Reagan and the much more loosely defined value structure of Walter Mondale. Occasionally you heard the Democrats talk about values, they'd use the rubrics, but the passion wasn't there.'' Wirthlin pauses. ''You can't mouth values. You've got to feel them.'' Edward J. Rollins, director of the 1984 Republican campaign, sounds very much the same theme. ''What it comes down to,'' he says flatly, ''is that not too many liberals are concerned with those matters themselves - and so truly don't understand how important they are to other people. One of the great mistakes the liberals keep making is in refusing to recognize that Reagan's appeal isn't based just on the fact that he's a charming guy. He also deeply feels things -about right and wrong, about fairness - that an awful lot of other Americans also feel.'' Taking this in, I feel a powerful impulse to begin climbing the nearest wall. This, from the camp that gave us James G. Watt to protect the environment and William Bradford Reynolds to enforce civil rights policy? ''For the right,'' notes Paul Smith, of the Children's Defense Fund, which has lobbied vigorously against Administration cuts in social spending, ''the family is some Darwinian creature expected to make its way alone against all predators. How this can be seen as resurrecting traditional values truly puzzles me.'' But, then, it is worth noting that Ed Rollins is a one-time Democrat himself; in fact, at 42, a Roman Catholic, the son of a local labor leader, he is a veritable prototype of the man that got away. If, in fact, the right has been staggeringly successful in seizing the terms of the debate -appropriating the word ''morality'' as code for its own social agenda and managing, for instance, to identify the American Civil Liberties Union in the public mind as ''the criminals' lobby'' - it is no less true that we liberals have failed to empathize with profound popular concerns. Worries about declining values and standards of behavior have been evident everywhere, from public opinion surveys on crime to Ann Landers's mail. Many people feel that, somehow, things in this society have been spiraling out of control. But we liberals have tended to dismiss those concerns as illegitimate. Once, within memory, liberalism made emotional sense to most Americans - it was not only generous in its larger social vision but it seemed to be responsive, on a gut level, to daily concerns - these days, though, it sometimes seems to demand that we deny fundamental aspects of ourselves. I don't mean to belabor the down side. A case can certainly be made that there is movement among liberals on this score, some of it striking. Mario Cuomo, New York's Governor, for instance, has identified himself as closely with the broad concept of family as any national Democrat in memory. On the local level, liberal politicians -otherwise known, in terminological self-defense, as ''progressives'' - have increasingly been taking the initiative on two of the issues most chronically ceded to the right, crime and the inadequacies of the criminal justice system; at long last some of them are making the case that it is appropriate to empathize above all with the victim. ''For years,'' says Tom Hayden, a founder of Students for a Democratic Society, now the Democratic Assemblyman for California's 44th District and certainly among the most prominent of these politicians, ''in the face of rising crime, liberals acted like social psychologists. That's just not right. Burglary and rape should provoke outrage. So should a juvenile justice system that teaches 17-year-olds that crime does pay.'' The landmark agreement between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers on the company's projected Saturn plant - a pact mandating both worker participation in decision making and salaries partially based on performance - is more than merely a recognition by the bellwether U.A.W. of changed economic times. In an era in which labor is widely perceived as indifferent to the general welfare, it is an affirmation by this most liberal of unions of responsibility to the social whole. ''We've got to break away from the notion,'' as the U.A.W.'s director of public relations, Peter G. Laarman, puts it, ''that labor is a 'bad actor' in the economy. It must be understood that trade unionism is fundamentally rooted in community.'' All of this is immensely heartening. Still, more generally, it remains the case that those liberals who insist on going on about values and personal responsibility tend to be seen by other liberals as somehow tainted by creeping Reaganism. Any such preoccupation is alien to liberals' practical political experience to start with, and it is additionally suspect on the more substantive ground that it is regarded, somehow, as being bound up with religion. Which, in its way, suggests just how far gone we are. Certainly, extreme sensitivity to the church-state question is always in order, and never more so than during the Reagan years. But what liberals seem to have forgotten, what we desperately need to relearn, is that, as Bruce Babbitt, the Democratic Governor of Arizona, puts it, ''there is something called civic morality, a shared body of values, based on the Judeo-Christian and republican traditions, that is the underpinning of our society. Too often lately, we've found ourselves drifting into moral neutrality.'' BILL HONIG HAS DONE MORE THAN just give the matter serious thought; 10 years ago, while teaching elementary school in a lower-class black neighborhood in San Francisco, as a means of sorting out his own feelings, he composed a 100-page paper on the subject: What happened? How was it that we as a society and, most especially, those of us who had historically prided ourselves on our moral rigor, seemed to have grown so alarmingly inattentive to the matter of standards? What he concluded was that not only had the social upheaval of the 1960's and early 70's turned numberless liberals into cynics - that was obvious - but that it had ripped liberalism itself from its intellectual moorings. ''Throughout the 50's,'' he observes, ''the liberal creed was intimately bound up with individual responsibility - one had an obligation to be a consciously good person. But suddenly we found ourselves in a climate, with its emphasis on systems, that belittled moral responsibility. Broad, agreed-upon values were no longer seen as ennobling - they were restrictive and repressive.'' Today, as California's State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Honig is best known in the rest of the country - and among liberals tends to be seen as very nearly heroic - for standing up to textbook publishers who, bowing to fundamen-talist pressure, had made it a practice to underrepresent evolution in biology texts. But on his home turf, Honig, who 15 years ago abandoned a promising career in corporate law to join the teacher corps, is often perceived as conservative; occasionally he is even seen as an ideologue of the extreme right. In a recent book, ''Last Chance for Our Children,'' he writes of his surprise upon learning, after he had spoken before some honor students at the University of California at Los Angeles, that one of the professors had reacted by assigning a paper on ''the hazards of the Moral Majority taking over the schools.'' He laughs about that incident now. ''Isn't that amazing!'' he says. But Honig continues to be much troubled by the mentality it represents. Quite simply, since his surprising 1982 election as head of the nation's largest public school system, following a campaign that stressed back-to-basics, high expectations and the responsibility of the public schools to communicate ethical standards, he has found his most intractable critics on the left. He has tangled with progressives on various aspects of his so-called ''Excellence'' agenda. Teachers' union leaders initially opposed his proposals to grant merit pay and to streamline the firing of ''incompetents.'' Hispanic activists are still upset over his view that bilingual instruction should be a means of integrating students into the regular curriculum, not an end in itself. But he has most often been challenged for his unrelenting emphasis on values. ''These people are constantly saying, 'Give me a consistent conceptual value.' I say, 'honesty,' and immediately they come back with, 'I can think of plenty of times when you shouldn't be honest.' Well, you know what my answer is to that? 'So what? Mostly, overwhelmingly, it's better to be honest than dishonest.' ''And people have got to know that. People have to feel connected to a shared moral community. There is a yearning for morality that, I think, is genetic - and far too many of us in this society have a hole in our souls because, day to day, it just isn't there. ''Why do you read 'Pride and Prejudice'? Just for character and narrative? No, because it's a powerful way of saying 'Here's what noble behavior is - look for the real and watch out for the sham.' '' Honig pauses. ''Look for the real and watch out for the sham.'' In Honig's view, the stakes can hardly be overestimated. ''America is still an experiment,'' he says. ''The jury is still out on whether you can take a huge country, keep it pluralistic, enshrine liberty and individual development and not have it fly apart. That's always been the tension in this society. Can you combine individual push with common social purpose? ''Well, that should be our task, to make sure that it does survive - because we are still a beacon for the rest of the world. I truly believe that we have something remarkable to say about how you form a society and how you live a life.'' THIS KIND OF UN-SELF-CONSCIOUS AFFIRMATION of Americanism continues to make most of us to the left of center more than a little uneasy. Still smarting from our own Vietnam experience, at once too jaded and too mindful of peer expectation to embrace so seemingly sectarian an ardor, we have allowed the right free rein to obliterate the distinction between love of democratic institutions and crude jingoism - a condition that was hardly addressed, let alone resolved, by the ritual flag-waving of the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. ''People are always telling me,'' says Anthony T. Podesta, president of People for the American Way, a liberal organization, ''that they don't even bother to open our direct mail because they assume we're a right-wing group.'' Scott Rains, coordinator of a group called Prolifers for Survival, based in Chapel Hill, N.C., knows all about such liberal assumptions - and the inflexibility of the dogma with which they are so bound up. ''All people on the left have to do is hear our name and they're furious,'' he says. ''Liberals are not inclined to listen to opposing views on any subject, but an opposing view on abortion is seen as outright heresy. The most you're allowed to say is that you have qualms but still support it. Even friends of mine make it very clear that they regard me as a tool of the right.'' In fact, Rains, like a great many of the group's 2,000 members, is a veteran of the antiwar movement, and the members of his organization are as involved in promoting the nuclear freeze and other peace issues as in opposing abortion. ''What we are arguing is moral consistency,'' he says. ''It seems to me that if you're truly in favor of life - against capital punishment and nuclear war - then you've also got to start asking yourself some very, very hard questions about abortion.'' Many of us will, on both philosophical and practical grounds, take serious issue with such an argument. But that in no way justifies the refusal to acknowledge the depth of feeling that prompts it, or the impulse, often a reflex, to cast the author of such a view as an ideological Judas. There is, to cite a particularly striking recent example of that reflex, the matter of Tipper Gore, wife of Tennessee's Democratic Senator, Albert Gore Jr., and the great rock-lyrics controversy. Mrs. Gore co-founded, along with, among others, Susan Baker, wife of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Parents Music Resource Center. The group has campaigned for a labeling system for records aimed at alerting parents to sexually explicit or violent content. A mother of four with a background in psychology, Mrs. Gore has become convinced ''that we as adults are both arrogant and myopic in failing to understand the effects of mass media on the young. All we're saying is, 'Let's look at what we're doing to our children; for heaven's sake, let's look at what we're doing to ourselves.' Is that really so unreasonable?'' ''The issue here,'' she says, ''is limits, recognizing that something has gone terribly wrong in our culture, and trying to address it.'' ''What this is about is censorship,'' responds Danny Goldberg, president of Gold Mountain Records, who has led a counterattack on the Parents Music Resource Center. ''Mrs. Gore is trying to impose her own blacklist. As far as I'm concerned, she's another McCarthy, an agent of the far right.'' For most of us raised in liberal households, Goldberg's assertion packs no small wallop. Three buzzwords in as many sentences! And, in fact, it might well be that Goldberg's absolutist First Amendment stand should prevail on the merits. Even Mrs. Gore, though generally at pains to characterize the labeling proposal benignly, as ''consumer information,'' admits to understanding why so many of her critics might see this particular issue as a constitutional question. But after hearing out both the principals, one is struck less by the specifics of the dispute than by its character; above all, by a defense of freedom on Goldberg's part that seems utterly to preclude a free exchange of ideas. His adamancy notwithstanding, Tipper Gore is hardly of the right; indeed, in philosophical terms, she has much in common with Goldberg himself. Nor, as he asserts, has she undertaken this fight because ''she's married to a Southern Democrat who thinks it's a cool way to appeal to Southern bigots.'' Indeed, rather than ostracize those who ask the difficult questions - who, in one way or another, demand that we bring a more rigorous value system to bear on our view of the social order - liberals ought to recognize them as the resource they are. Ferment, intellectual as well as ethical, has been too long absent in our ranks. If vigorously espousing other such views has been dicey, Glenn C. Loury's challenge to an even more sacrosanct slice of liberal dogma, that part dealing with poverty and race, has been utterly foolhardy. Loury is a black professor of political economy at Harvard and currently a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Lately he has been arguing in print that, while a profound commitment to social justice on the part of government is essential, and that while traditional antipoverty programs are often of enormous benefit, solutions to many of the problems that have come to be seen as intractable cannot, finally, be imposed from without. ''I'm convinced,'' he explains, ''that there is a behavioral dimension to the problems of inner-city crime, unemployment, educational underachievement, teen-age pregnancy and family instability that absolutely necessitates a discussion of values. The position that people are inevitably victims and can't be held to standards - that dysfunctional behavior is basically a civil-rights matter - aside from being condescending on the face of it, has pushed out the possibility of discourse and impoverished the poverty debate.'' The reactions to Loury's views have occasionally been encouraging. ''I recently got a letter,'' he says, ''from a retired black schoolteacher who's worried about the attitudes of black kids today and the attitude of liberal white teachers who are unwilling to push them.'' But most of the response from liberals has been predictable. ''The message,'' he notes dryly, ''is that I'm a mean-spirited, neo-Darwinian, reactionary, Reaganite tool.'' He recognizes that distortion of his positions by both sides is a virtual inevitability, and so he has been obliged to come to terms with it. ''The alternative,'' he says, ''is to be silent about important questions when you think you have something important to say. The history of the last 20 years argues that one should take one's risks.'' IT IS NOT NECESSARILY EMPTY OPTIMISM TO suggest that the present state of affairs among liberals could be readily turned around. By virtually every measure, conservative philosophy in the social arena remains further out of sync with popular sentiment than our own. Even Ed Rollins concedes that Ronald Reagan is the only person with his beliefs who could be elected today. ''If Jack Kemp said the same things about abortion, I seriously doubt he could get away with it.'' And fundamentalist influence within the Republican Party is hardly on the wane. In fact, by 1988, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Liberty Federation, his new political organization, could well emerge as a major political liability for the Republicans. ''When it comes right down to it,'' asserts former Representative John Buchanan, a moderate Alabama Republican who was cut down by the Moral Majority in 1980: ''We Americans are not a mean-spirited people. Ours is a tradition of freedom and pluralism and diversity and, given half a chance, we will reject a doctrine so authoritarian and devoid of compassion.'' But it is not via an ideological version of negative advertising that we can hope to reclaim the public spirit. It will not be enough merely to point up the gap between our adversaries' professed piety and their evident impatience with the niceties of constitutional law. It is not enough even to make the case that, by rendering the success-at-any-cost ethic so harrowingly respectable, the right has itself fostered a nationwide epidemic of precisely the sort of amorality it professes to deplore. It is, rather, for us liberals to assert, on our own terms, that values do matter; to embrace collectively the proposition that an unembarrassed sense of morality is essential both to the formulation of public policy and to the life of the culture itself. L IKE MANY OTHERS who have lately grown impatient with what he calls ''the liberal litmus tests,'' Brooklyn Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman, co-author of the recent New York State law mandating that covers of pornographic magazines be kept under wraps, tends to be outspoken. Last spring, he was among those who flew to Bitburg, West Germany, to protest the President's visit. But he is also enormously attentive to nuances. A former aide to Elizabeth Holtzman when she was a Representative from Brooklyn, the author of a thoughtful volume on governmental reform and a lawyer with a history of defending civil liberties, Feldman angered more than a few of his constituents in 1984 by helping to kill another piece of ''values'' legislation, one intended to keep minors from browsing through pornographic materials. ''I felt then,'' he tells me, ''and I feel now, that that bill created First Amendment problems. This one doesn't.'' This one has, however, created other problems for him. ''Even my father doesn't like the bill. He's 82, and a libertarian, and he has good instincts. We've never disagreed on any issue before.'' He pauses. ''Believe me, it's hardly my idea of a good time, being perceived as some sort of right-wing crazy. But I'll tell you, something like this really drives it home. How in the world did we take up the view that people walking into a grocery store should have to be assaulted by pornography? The Constitution doesn't say that.'' Noticing a stack of uncorrected midterms on the desk before him - he also teaches at a couple of local colleges -he seizes upon an intriguing metaphor: ''Pornography is an elective course. The Constitution protects your right to take it, but it doesn't require you to take it. ''The problem, really, is that we've been so lazy for so long.'' He pauses, then, unexpectedly, smiles. ''Who knows, maybe that's the one good thing that will come of Reagan. Maybe he'll be the one to force us out of our intellectual stupor.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
O'CONNOR WARNS MEDICAL SCHOOL CHOICE IS CHURCH LINK OR ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/nyregion/o-connor-warns-medical-school-choice-is-church-link-or-abortion.html,"The Archdiocese of New York is threatening to drop its support of a medical college that it saved from financial failure eight years ago unless two city hospitals affiliated with the school stop performing abortions. John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, said in an interview that if the hospitals, Lincoln and Metropolitan, did not stop performing abortions, the school, New York Medical College, would either have to give up its $24 million-a-year contract to supply them with medical services or drop its ties with the archdiocese. 'The Church or the Two Hospitals' ''The choice for the college is either the church or the two hospitals,'' Cardinal O'Connor said. ''If the choice is the two hospitals, that would be it,'' he said, adding he would be forced to sever the ties the archdiocese made with the college, which is in Valhalla in Westchester County, eight years ago. The Cardinal said that ''abortions violated Catholic principles and the sacredness of the human person'' and that they should not be performed by physicians or in any hospital affiliated with the archdiocese. ''Catholic principles and concepts of Catholic medical practice would be violated,'' he said, ''and there is no way we could continue together.'' The president of the college, John J. Connolly, said ''whatever the Cardinal said will have to be considered by the board of trustees.'' He said that the college was looking for a ''stronger relationship'' with the archdiocese and that he hoped the relationship could include the current contract with the city hospitals. The college's association with the church began in 1978, when the archdiocese achieved a dominant position on the school's board of trustees in exchange for lending the hospital $10 million and rescuing it from threatened bankruptcy. New York City awarded the college the medical affiliation contracts at Lincoln Hospital, at 234 East 149th Street in the South Bronx, and Metropolitan Hospital Center, at 1901 First Avenue, at 97th Street, in Manhattan, in 1979. Because of its ties with the archdiocese, the college's contract at the two hospitals includes a unique provision that requires the city to hire outside physicians to perform abortions so that the college's medical staff and teaching faculty would not be involved. However, as early as 1979, Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, a spokesman for the archdiocese, expressed doubt that the provision was compatible with Catholic principles. ''The Archdiocese of New York will never, through contract or other means, cooperate with abortion, nor will any agencies it controls ever do so,'' he said at that time. City hospital officials also said ''the arrangement was hardly ideal.'' The Cardinal, who became the Archbishop of New York in 1984, strongly indicated last week that he could no longer live with the provision either. 'They Trouble Me Very Deeply' At a college faculty meeting Wednesday night and in an interview on Friday, he said that abortions - no matter who was performing them - were unacceptable. ''They trouble me very deeply,'' he said. At the same time, the Cardinal raised the possibility of the college being transformed into a full-fledged archdiocesan institution that would have a new public identity as a Catholic medical school. Such a Catholic identity, he said, would create even more pressure to end any affiliation that allowed abortions. With that in mind, the Cardinal said he would discuss the issue at dinner this evening with Mayor Koch and Victor E. Botnick, the chairman of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency that operates the city's municipal hospital system. Both the Mayor and Mr. Botnick have repeatedly affirmed their support of the city's public policy that abortions are a valid and needed medical service, particularly in the predominantly poor neighborhoods served by the two hospitals. Their statements would seem to weigh against the halting of abortions at either hospital. Other medical schools have expressed interest in taking over the affiliation with the hospitals if New York Medical College withdraws, a top city hospital official said yesterday. A Possible Choice If efforts to stop abortions at the two hospitals do not succeed, the Cardinal's conditions would seem to force the college either to give up a lucrative contract or to face a break with the archdiocese that would leave the college without the considerable financial resources of the church. But the Cardinal predicted that talks with the city would be ''cordial and extended'' and would ultimately succeed, thus making any choice unnecessary. At Lincoln Hospital, abortions are restricted to Saturdays, when most of the college's supervising medical faculty is off duty. The chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Lincoln, Dr. Winfred Reguero, said the restriction meant a three- to four-week delay for some patients. In some cases, he said, patients are referred to another municipal hospital or to private abortion clinics. At Metropolitan Hospital, abortions are performed within the hospital's ambulatory surgery service. Numbers Compared A spokesman for the city's Hospitals Corporation said the 847 abortions performed at Lincoln and the 946 at Metropolitan last year were comparable to the numbers performed at other municipal hospitals. Moreover, Mr. Botnick said no patient seeking an abortion or birth control services would be turned away from any municipal hospital. After the initial agreement in 1979, Planned Parenthood of New York City criticized the conditions under which abortions were performed at both hospitals and has been monitoring the situation. The director of Planned Parenthood, Alfred F. Moran, said last week that the ''long delays'' at Lincoln Hospital were denying poor and teen-age women of badly needed abortion services. He also said that birth control services at both hospitals were ''not encouraged'' and that such practices only led to abortions that could be avoided. ''The last thing in the world I want to do is control the medical college,'' he said. The Cardinal said that if the college became an archdiocesan institution, he would ''personally'' be willing to raise funds for it. But he said the college's medical practices must be compatible with Catholic philosophy and ''impregnated with the sacredness of the human person.'' He also said that if the college became a Catholic institution, it would help consolidate and improve the quality of medical services provided at 17 Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese. He said academic freedom would not be threatened and no faculty member would be asked to leave. Issue of Academic Freedom According to a faculty member at the meeting Wednesday, the Cardinal used hypothetical examples to define what he regarded as academic freedom in a college in which the faculty and student body have a large percentage of Jewish members. He was quoted as giving the following example: ''If a physician on the faculty said to a patient, 'There is no God, just your medication is keeping you alive,' then his association with the college could not continue.'' But he said a Catholic identity would ''not mean nuns patrolling the halls, the firing of non-Catholics, or a preference to Catholic students.'' The Cardinal said he would support the transformation, even if it meant forfeiting $2.25 million a year in state financial aid for the school. State aid is given to all medical schools in New York on a student per capita basis. However, a state constitutional amendment forbids such aid to sectarian institutions under the principles of separation of church and state. ''Obviously, it would not want to lose it and we would do what we could to meet state requirements,'' he said, adding that lawyers were confident that the college would not be penalized. If they are wrong, he said, he was prepared to forfeit the aid and ''make up the funds from the private sector.'' The Cardinal said he faced a similar loss of public funds when he refused to conform to Mayor Koch's executive order said anyone with contracts with the city could not discriminate against homosexuals in hiring practices. The order was overturned by the State Court of Appeals last year. ''We were talking Catholic then, and we are talking Catholic now,'' the Cardinal said. NEW YORK MEDICAL BEGAN IN 1860 With more than 700 students, New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y., is the third-largest private medical school in the country. It provides medical services to more than 35 hospitals in the metropolitan area, many of them Catholic institutions. Founded in 1860 as a private medical college in New York City, the college has graduated more than 13,000 physicians. It is one of the few medical schools in the country that is not a part of a university. One of its first major affiliations was with Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital. But when the hospital and the medical college sustained a series of financial losses and internal problems in the 1970's, an agreement was reached with the Archdiocese of New York in 1978 under which the college accepted $10 million in financing in return for giving the archdiocese majority control of the Board of Trustees. At the time, archdiocesan officials said their objective was to help increase and unify archdiocesan health services that were scattered in Catholic hospitals throughout the region. The archdiocese converted Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital into an institution for the mentally and physically handicapped, and the medical school was moved to its Grasslands Reservation campus in Westchester County. For several years, the college was plagued by internal problems caused by rapid growth and confusion over the role of the archdiocese in its day-to-day operations. Although the archdiocese has consistently maintained that the college is an independent institution, trustees and faculty members who have resigned contended that the school was in fact being run by the health and hospitals division of Catholic Charities, an archdiocesan agency. In 1982, the college ranked as Westchester's 24th largest employer. It also attracted $16 million in research and service contracts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"80,000 IN MARCH TO CAPITOL TO BACK RIGHT TO ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/us/80000-in-march-to-capitol-to-back-right-to-abortion.html,"At least 80,000 marchers supporting the right to abortion passed the White House today and gathered at the Capitol in what some leaders of the women's movement called a sign of its rejuvenation. The march, organized by the National Organization for Women, was aimed at getting the women's movement ''back into the streets,'' in the words of NOW's president, Eleanor C. Smeal. It was also a counter to the annual antiabortion marches that have been held on Jan. 22. After the marchers reached the West Front of the Capitol today, Mrs. Smeal said, ''I'm convinced you're going to see a total turning of the tide on women's issues, and if we don't, we'll be out again.'' 'Stop Playing With Our Lives' ''Our message is simple,'' Mrs. Smeal told the crowd. ''You cannot play with women's lives any longer; stop playing with our lives.'' Leaders also plan to lobby Monday for legislation to cut off Federal funds to colleges that have programs that discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age or disability. The legislation, intended to overturn a decision that the Supreme Court made in 1984, has been bottled up in the House because of an antiabortion amendment. Among those leading the march today were former Representative Bella Abzug, Democrat of New York; Mary Kay Place, the actress; Gloria Steinem, the editor; Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California, and Bill Baird, an advocate of birth control. Among the others were Mary Ann Sorentino, who has been excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church for being executive director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island. Organizers said they were surprised at the number of people who joined the march, which they said was 125,000 and which the Park Police put at 80,000. Marchers were still leaving the Mall at 14th Street when the leaders reached the Capitol, three miles away. Mrs. Smeal had earlier said she was hoping to exceed the attendance of this year's antiabortion march, which drew about 36,000 people, according to the police. The previous year's antiabortion march drew about twice that number. White and Purple Today the organizers of the march had clear and warm weather after several days of near-record cold. White and purple, the colors of the suffragettes at the turn of the century, were worn by many. The songs and chants, many of them updated to reflect the day's theme, echoed the sounds of the 1960's. The marchers were not allowed to stop on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House. President Reagan, who has addressed the last two anti-abortion marches at the White House, was at Camp David. It was outside the White House that a man, who identified himself as the Rev. Jerry Horn, approached the marchers with what he said was a human fetus in his hands. He was arrested as he tried to join the march and charged with disorderly conduct. There were some small demonstrations by other opponents of the right to abortion. In a news conference this morning, Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, said the organization was seeking to have Mrs. Smeal excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. At the rally, Mrs. Smeal mocked the suggestion that her support for the right to abortion could lead to her excommunication or to her leaving her job as president of NOW. ''My grievous sin,'' she said, is that ''I support options for eveyone in a pluralistic society.'' 'You Cannot Sacrifice Women' ''I am in the mainstream of Catholic lay thought,'' she added. ''You cannot sacrifice women on the altar of self-righteousness.'' ''It's time for women once again to not to allow themselves not to be pushed backward,'' Mrs. Smeal said in an interview before the beginning of the march. She acknowledged the march as an important test for her leadership. She won back the presidency of NOW last year after a campaign that emphasized the need for renewed confrontation on women issues. ''The only reason the Reagan revolution is working is people are not standing up and saying enough,'' she said. But supporters said that despite the march's success the women's movement has to be better organized and effective on a local level. Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, Mrs. Smeal and others said that the women's movement has lost ground in the five years of the Reagan Administration, partly because people were just sitting tight until after Mr. Reagan left office. ''The erosion has gone on and on and on,'' said Mrs. Schroeder. ''Most of just met in small groups and just wrung our hands.'' Miss Steinem also echoed the need to carry the success of the march into organization. ''It depends on what we do when we get home,'' she told the rally. As part of the continued organization effort, the leaders used the rally to collect money for future activities. A second march is scheduled for Los Angeles next Sunday. Mrs. Schroeder said she thought the unexpectedly large turnout for the march was partly because people saw what President Corazon C. Aquino was able to do in the Philippines. ''We saw a woman in the Philippines take on something much tougher than the United States Congress and the President,'' she told the crowd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the larger change may be that France, in the five years since the Socialist Government came to power, has become more like other democracies.

"AS 'FRENCH DIFFERENCE' FADES, POLITICAL CONSENSUS EMERGES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/world/as-french-difference-fades-political-consensus-emerges.html,"A week before legislative elections that are likely to bring a major political realignment, many people in France are searching for ways to sum up the five years since the Socialist Government came to power promising fundamental change. Amid the flood of analyses and retrospectives, one basic element seems to stand out. It is that France, long so proud of its eccentricities and its differences, has become more like the rest of the world in behavior as well as mood. France has long represented an idea both of cultural glory and of inner conflicts so arcane that most of the French assume that those living outside ''the hexagon'' - as they call their roughly six-sided country - are unable to understand them. But by the admission of many of its more thoughtful citizens, France has become, by necessity rather than choice, more open to the outside world, more receptive to its influences and more like other democratic countries in political behavior. Serge July, the editor of the daily newspaper Liberation, has called this complex and often subtle phenomenon a ''normalization'' of French life, terming it the chief result of the leadership of President Francois Mitterrand. In Mr. July's formulation, contained in a recently published book, the Socialists have rendered France the ''extraordinary service of making it finally an ordinary democracy, open to the world market of ideas and values, similar to the competing industrial democracies.'' It is not that this result was intended. Indeed, Mr. Mitterrand gave every indication of wanting to maintain practices and patterns that distinguished France from most other countries, while at the same time introducing a radical Socialist program. But because of a kind of ruse of history, Mr. Mitterrand instead presided over deep changes in several domains. In its first year, Mr. Mitterrand's Government pursued an expansionist economic policy that was in itself an act of defiance toward the rest of the Western world, which had adopted the creed of austerity. But in the face of a shrinking economy, the Socialists backpedaled, adopting austerity measures that they had earlier rejected and, in so doing, aligning France with most other major Western countries. The change, Mr. July says, ''amounted to an opening to the world, a determined refusal to retreat to our own protected softness.'' Mr. Mitterrand, he says, ''succeeded in aligning the hexagonal democracy with the Anglo-Saxon model and submitting the national economy to all the constraints of the world market.'' No Longer 'Cut in Two' One of France's characteristics is that it has viewed itself as ''cut in two,'' separated into such deeply antagonistic camps that political compromise has been difficult. But in recent years many public opinion surveys have shown that the French share with other Europeans the tendency to move toward a large area of consensus, so that many are basically in the center, regardless of their political self-image. Similarly, the differences between the major political parties have so decreased that it has become conceivable for the country to move from the party of the right to the party of the left and back again - as in other democratic countries - without disturbing everyday life. The elections next Sunday are expected to return a conservative majority to Parliament and force Mr. Mitterrand to govern with a rightist Prime Minister and Cabinet. ''France is a conservative country that changes only with great difficulty,'' a senior Socialist official said. ''But my belief is that, like the United States, we will eventually have two big political forces, one more or less conservative, the other more or less liberal, and power will alternate between the two.'' Some elements of change are obvious. This year, for example, France for the first time gave licenses for private television stations. The result was a flood of American programming and, perhaps more important, of American broadcasting styles. But beyond the increasing cultural openness - another example is the growing number of people who speak English - deeper French attitudes and institutions may have become more like those of other countries, losing aspects of their Frenchness. Poses of Independence To an American or an Englishman or a German, what might be called the French difference has always been part mystery, part annoyance, part historical inevitability. The French, who consider themselves the oldest unified European people, have felt that national prestige was always tied up with the ability to strike poses of total independence. The greatest practitioner of this ability was Charles de Gaulle, who restored French prestige after the German occupation of World War II. But he did so in part by giving value to what might be called the aristocratic or monarchical tradition in French history, behaving toward the rest of the world with a combination of aloofness, disdain and apparent serenity. A basic element of French political life, for example, was the strength of the classic left, itself a legacy of the deep feeling that society was divided into a privileged caste on one side and the common people on the other. While the Socialists, as one party of the left, were always firmly democratic, they were outnumbered by the Communists, who were able to count on nearly 25 percent of the vote. Some here now feel that the greatest change of the Mitterrand years will turn out to have been the drastic decline of the Communists, who are expected to get 10 percent of the popular vote in the election next Sunday. Socialists' New Stress At the same time, the Socialists have dropped much of the radical vocabulary that they used a few years ago, substituting a stress on a mixed economy and on the need to create enterprise. The Socialists have thus emerged as a party not too different from the Democratic Party of the United States, stressing social policies but not differing from the conservatives in their essential view of their country. ''We speak the same language today in the opposition as in the Socialist Party,'' Edmond Alphandery, a rightist member of Parliament, said in a magazine interview recently. ''It is no longer a dialogue of the deaf.'' This new situation has depended on something else, the emergence of a kind of popular middle ground, the new if unspoken consensus of the French public. ''The left-right split is assumed to determine everything,'' two opinion specialists, Olivier Duhamel and Jerome Jaffre, wrote recently in the magazine Le Nouvel Observateur. ''But examining the polls shows a different scenery. Zones of consensus are forming. Disagreements are not what they are assumed to be.'' Specifically, the French public has lined up behind a moderate degree of social protection and basic freedom of choice in private life. There is little opposition to abortion, for example, either on the left or on the right. Virtually nobody wants to dismantle the social security system. Even on the right few designate themselves ''conservatives,'' and on the left only a minority considers itself ''Marxist.'' A Dose of Americanization Meanwhile, economic pressures have caused France to be more receptive to the outside world, even if that involves a powerful dose of Americanization. Max Gallo, a former Government spokesman who is editor of the pro-Socialist daily Le Matin, gave a whimsical example of how things have changed: the signing by Prime Minister Laurent Fabius late last year of a contract for a Disneyland-style amusement park on the outskirts of Paris. ''It was remarkable to see Laurent Fabius present at the Disneyland signing ceremony and presenting it as a great economic and cultural project,'' Mr. Gallo said. ''It was something that would have been heretical to the left before.'' Mr. Gallo was talking about heresy in the Socialist tradition, although an official French welcome to Disneyland - symbolic of the mistrusted Anglo-Saxon culture - would have been anathema to Charles de Gaulle as well. But the contract for Disneyland was dictated by economic necessity. The project will create thousands of jobs and draw millions of tourists to the Paris area, and that is why it was sought by the Socialist Government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"POLITICS; KEMP, SWIVELING RIGHT AND LEFT IN SPEECHES, AIMS FOR ULTIMATE GOAL",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/us/politics-kemp-swiveling-right-and-left-in-speeches-aims-for-ultimate-goal.html,"''This is not the Grand Old Party any more.'' As Representative Jack F. Kemp spoke those words, chopping the air with both hands for emphasis, swiveling from left to right like a quarterback handing off to a running back, many of the people in the audience for the Waukesha County Republican Party's Lincoln Day dinner looked quizzically at one another. ''We've got to be the party of labor,'' the Buffalo Republican continued, and there were more puzzled glances. ''Economic growth doesn't mean anything if it leaves people out. If we trust our ideas we have to take them into the ghetto, into the barrio and into the trade union hiring hall. Franklin Roosevelt made his party the party of hope, and now we must do the same thing for the party of Lincoln.'' To judge from their comments afterwards, the Republican loyalists gathered that snowy night in Oconomowoc, west of Milwaukee, had expected something a little different -''stuff on abortion and school prayer and a strong defense,'' one man said. Surprising Audiences All Over Jack Kemp has been surprising audiences all over the United States for the last year or so with his unorthodox blend of hard-line foreign policy, social conservatism and populism. If his ideas have not yet sunk in on the national level, they are becoming clearer to people in Washington and in the states where voters will have an early impact on the 1988 Presidential campaign: Michigan and Iowa and New Hampshire. A man without a statewide base, to say nothing of a national constituency, he has nevertheless managed to establish himself as the principal alternative to Vice President Bush for the Republican nomination. In the process, he has at least temporarily eclipsed such better-known figures in his party as Alexander M. Haig Jr., former Secretary of State; Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee. ''Kemp has his problems,'' says an adviser to one of his rivals, ''but he has done astonishingly well in positioning himself so well so early.'' One of those problems may be nailing down the conservative base that he will need in challenging Mr. Bush. The Vice President has courted the ''movement Republicans'' assiduously this year - so assiduously that the conservative columnist George Will, among others, has accused him of spinelessness - and his work has paid dividends. A recent poll of conservative activists gave Mr. Bush 36.3 percent, Mr. Kemp less than half that much backing. Conservatism and Individuality The conundrum facing Mr. Kemp is this: It is largely his departures from conservative orthodoxy - on such issues as right-to-work laws, sanctions against South Africa and the recently enacted budget-balancing measure - that has given him enough individuality to present himself as a credible national candidate, and yet that individuality makes it hard for him to present himself as the conservative alternative to Mr. Bush. So far, he has managed to do both, as suggested in an offhand comment by one of the most prominent ideologues in the Reagan Administration. The Vice President, said this ideologue, ''poses for pictures with people like me and Jeane Kirkpatrick, but Jack Kemp listens to what we tell him.'' Many Speeches a Month Now 50 years old, stockier than he was in his days as a Buffalo Bills quarterback, Mr. Kemp plans to announce an exploratory committee for the Presidency early next year. His strategy is to finish a strong second in Michigan and Iowa, then win in New Hampshire. But he is already running, winging back and forth across the country, making 20 or more speeches a month even though he is up for re-election in the 31st District this year. By his own account, he is still ''underfinanced and understaffed,'' but with two years to go until the first primary, he believes he has plenty of time. He said in an interview, ''Reagan dominates the party, and only the hyper-activists are ready to think about post-Reagan Republicanism yet.'' Clearly, Mr. Bush from his perch in the White House will try to take the big-money, big-name route to the nomination. His political action committee raised almost $4 million in 1985, as against Mr. Kemp's $1.2 million. But the New Yorker is making headway; his political action committee, the Campaign for Prosperity, and his foundation, the Fund for an American Renaissance, should each raise more than $2 million this year. Names on the Computer John Maxwell, an organizer with roots in the key early caucus state of Iowa, runs the political action committee and is expected, once this year's congressional races are out of the way, to be a central figure in the Kemp campaign. So is John Buckley, a nephew of the conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr., as Mr. Kemp's press secretary and constant companion on the road. Both Charles Black and Roger Stone of the successful Washington political consulting firm Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly are already working part time for Mr. Kemp. (Another principal, Lee Atwater, is committed to work for Mr. Bush). Mr. Black, who may well take charge of the overall strategy, said the names of 100,000 recent donors were already on a computer and suggested that a strong national finance committee would be in place within nine months. ''There's a message, a view, a theme to what I want to do,'' Mr. Kemp said in his staccato manner in a flight from the Midwest to Washington. ''That's my great advantage over Bush, if I can build on it. He can't depart an iota from Reagan's view, so how is anyone to know what he's about, what he'll fight for, what he'll work for? ''I can say I'd put Jeane Kirkpatrick into the State Department, promise to deploy Star Wars, tell them that I'd send anti-tank weapons to Jonas Savimbi in Angola.'' Message of Opportunity ''Bush is tied to a negative posture on the economy,'' Mr. Kemp went on, ''and I want to keep him there - cut the deficit, maybe raise taxes, pain and suffering, the Eisenhower model. I'm going to keep talking about growth, about opportunity, like Jack Kennedy: 'We can do better.' '' Bizarre as it seems, the contest for the Republican campaign is well and truly launched, no matter how coyly the hopefuls answer reporters' questions about their intentions. Twenty years ago, Presidential drives lasted a year; 10 years ago, they lasted two years; now they last three years. This month alone, Jack Kemp will appear in no fewer than eight states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCIENCE WATCH; Legal Abortions Decline,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/science/science-watch-legal-abortions-decline.html,"The number of legal abortions in the United States fell by more than 4 percent from an estimated 1,574,000 in 1982, to 1,508,000 in 1984, according to an analysis of reports from state health departments. The rate of abortions fell even more, by 5 percent, because the number of women of childbearing age rose slightly in that period. The 1984 rate was 26.9 abortions per 1,000 women 15 to 44 years old, down from 28.8 in 1982, reports Stanley K. Henshaw in the journal Family Planning Perspectives. The number of women under age 25, who normally have the most abortions, actually declined during the period. When adjusted for age differences, then, the abortion rate fell only slightly over the two years, from 28.8 to 27.7 per 1,000 women of childbearing age. The abortion rate rose through the 1970's, leveled off around 1979 and then fell significantly for the first time in 1983, according to Dr. Henshaw, who is deputy director of research at the Alan Guttmacher Institute in New York. From 1983 to 1984 there was a very slight decline but it was too small to be statistically reliable. Births did not increase in 1983 and 1984, so ''the decline in the abortion rate reflects a decrease in the pregnancy rate,'' wrote Dr. Henshaw. In 1984, Dr. Henshaw calculated, about 25 percent of the nation's pregnancies ended by abortion, and 4 percent by miscarriages and stillbirths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WOMEN LOBBY CONGRESS ON ABORTION RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/us/women-lobby-congress-on-abortion-rules.html,"Hundreds of women went to Capitol Hill today to argue with their Congressmen that civil rights statutes should protect their right to have an abortion paid for by an institution receiving Federal funds. The battle over abortion policy has snarled legislation designed to restore the scope and force of civil rights laws that were weakened by a Supreme Court decision two years ago. Opponents of abortion have supported amendments that would leave institutions free to omit abortion services from health care plans, even if they received Federal aid. With time starting to run short in the Congressional session, the women's groups that organized the lobbying efforts today seek to press the House leadership into moving ahead with a bill that drops all antiabortion amendments. ''The next week will be crucial'' in determining whether Congress deals with the matter this year, according to Judith Lichtman, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. But many supporters of civil rights on Capitol Hill say that a bill requiring religious institutions to provide abortions is not politically realistic. ''I don't think the votes are there, even though I wish they were,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. Some Seek Compromise Some of these legislators are trying to work out a compromise, but the legislative deadlock persists. ''It's unclear how many people on either side want to buy a compromise,'' Mr. Frank said. Most of the lobbyists came to Washington over the weekend to participate in a march supporting a woman's right to a legal abortion. Their activities reflected their belief that opponents of abortion have been winning the political battle in recent years, and they wanted to demonstrate that advocates of free choice also represented substantial political power. ''I just wanted to be here, I wanted my face to be here,'' said Mara Natkins, who holds a master's degree in public health from Yale. ''I think it makes a difference if you show up. We have to show people that we really care, and have the numbers.'' The complex legislative issue grows out of a Supreme Court decision in 1984 saying that Federal civil rights statutes apply only to the specific part of an institution receiving Federal aid, not the entire institution. For example, a university that received a grant for medical research would still be free to bar women from competing in intercollegiate athletics, or to avoid building wheelchair ramps to the library. Original Intent Cited Many lawmakers felt that the decision violated the original intent of Congress, which was to cover all elements of an institution with antidiscrimination laws. Legislation was quickly introduced to reverse the court ruling, and it passed the House in 1984, but died in the Senate. In their lobbying, the women's groups said they wanted a ''clean bill'' that simply restored the rights that existed before the Supreme Court decision, in the Grove City case. In their view, this includes regulations adopted in 1975, which say that if any institution receiving Federal funds offers a health care plan to its students and employees, it must include abortion services. But opponents of abortion, led by the Roman Catholic bishops, saw this legislation as a threat in two ways. First of all, they argued, the measure would actually widen the scope of civil rights laws by including, for example, a hospital affiliated with a university that received Federal benefits. The second quarrel is over which institutions could be exempt from the civil rights laws on the basis of their religious beliefs. Under existing law institutions controlled by religious groups can qualify for a waiver. Many Have Transferred However, in recent years, a number of institutions that were once owned by religious groups have transferred control to lay boards of directors. To deal with these problems, the Education and Labor Committee in the House added an amendment stating that no institution would be required to provide abortion services. Representative Tom Tauke, an Iowa Republican, who co-sponsored the amendment, said that without such a rider, the bill could never pass. ''We don't think there's any way that Congress will accept legislation that mandates abortion,'' he said. The women's groups retort that the Tauke amendment would severely weaken the bill and deprive women of rights they had before. ''There's no compromise, as long as they insist on an antiabortion amendment,'' said Pat Reuss, legislative director of the Women's Equity Action League. Meanwhile, many of the women who came to Capitol Hill today said that the Supreme Court decision limiting the scope of civil rights laws was already having a noticeable impact. ''Real world harm is being done to people,'' Mrs. Lichtman asserted. Amy Tavrow, a recent grauate of Brandeis University, said that three women had recently been denied tenure at the Massachusetts school, and that their legal remedies were now severely restricted. Leah Binder, who works for a publishing company in Portland, Me., said that one Brandeis professor who was found guilty of sexual harassment of women was still teaching at the school. ''There's no protection anymore,'' Miss Binder said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Working Profile: Alfred H. Kingon; Being a Fly on White House Wall and Loving It,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/us/working-profile-alfred-h-kingon-being-a-fly-on-white-house-wall-and-loving-it.html,"On the wall of Alfred H. Kingon's office of the West Wing basement rests a large photograph of three men - President Reagan, Donald T. Regan, the chief of staff, and Mr. Kingon himself - all staring, puzzled and skeptical, across a table at a crucial White House meeting on tax issues. It is, Mr. Kingon says with a faint smile, perhaps his favorite photograph. For him, the tableau highlights, in its way, the power he has accumulated since he was brought to the White House last year by Mr. Regan when the former Treasury Secretary changed jobs with James A. Baker 3d. In fact, the objects of the three men's skepticism, unseen in the photograph, were Mr. Baker and his key aide, Richard G. Darman, who were arguing for certain tax breaks. ''When I worked on Wall Street what intrigued me was the interaction between Government and business, and I always wished I could be a fly on the wall at some of the meetings of the White House,'' Mr. Kingon said. ''I am doing now what I've always wanted to do.'' 'It's Got Its Down Side' As secretary to the Cabinet and as one of the closest aides to Mr. Regan, Mr. Kingon plays a central role in domestic, agricultural, economic and trade policy. It is a role that has stirred criticism of him because of his relative inexperience and left him aware of the limits and vulnerabilities of working in the White House. ''I used to think this would be the most wonderful place in the world to work,'' said the slender 54-year-old former Wall Street investment adviser and publisher of Financial World and Saturday Review. ''Now that I'm here, and I see it functioning, I realize it's got its down side. It's the most defensive job and the most defensive operation in town. It gets to be, 'How did this happen?' or 'How can I get out of that?' But it's a tremendous adventure, just unbelievable.'' Mr. Kingon's adventure involves overseeing the domestic and economic policy councils, two units comprised of Cabinet officers who shape virtually the entire range of the Government's programs except foreign policy. As Cabinet secretary he serves, in essence, as liaison between the Cabinet and the White House. Beyond criticizing his inexperience in Government, some White House officials complain that Mr. Kingon and several other aides to Mr. Regan are technocrats who have sliced the ideological fervor out of some of Mr. Reagan's speeches and blurred the President's comments on issues ranging from abortion rights to arms control and relations with the Soviet Union. Mr. Kingon, a fiscal conservative who worked actively for Mr. Reagan's election in 1980 while on Wall Street, said that the dispute between White House speechwriters, under Patrick J. Buchanan, and Mr. Regan's aides had been ''overblown'' and was ''institutional in nuture.'' ''One of the things you learn here is you can't be ideologically pure,'' said Mr. Kingon, speaking in the accent of a childhood spent in the Crown Heights and Midwood sections of Brooklyn. ''When you come inside these gates you don't have the options you had on the outside. ''I can remember a decision in the agricultural field, going in and telling the President, this is what you're going to hear and these are the options, and thinking as I went through them that none are any good and if I was on my soapbox at Financial World I would have blasted away. You're in this place and you have a responsibility to make Government work. Even though your heart might want it, your mind says, you must make Government work. ''You have to give the President the option to set his own priorities,'' he said. ''He has the political instincts. And he knows you can't have everything you want at one time. One of my jobs is to let him choose - what do you want to fight for this year. That can be troublesome.'' Mr. Kingon's power is considerable but is obscured by his efforts to stay behind the scenes. Last year, for example, he quietly blocked Attorney General Edwin L. Meese 3d and Mr. Buchanan from getting Mr. Reagan to sign an executive order that would have altered guidelines on racial hiring quotas in Federal contracts. Mr. Kingon insisted that the Cabinet council first discuss the matter. Mr. Kingon's circuitous passage to the White House began with a number of low-level jobs on Wall Street after his graduation from Union College in Schenectady in 1953 and night school at New York University's Graduate School of Business Administration. In the 1960's he grew affluent on Wall Street serving as investment adviser, security analyst and portfolio manager for the Businessman's Fund, a mutual fund. With a partner, Robert Weingarten, he formed a company that bought a weekly magazine, Financial World, which he edited for a decade in the 1970's, and turned in into a successful monthly. It was then that he met not only Mr. Regan, who ran Merrill Lynch & Company, but also Mr. Reagan, in 1979, then a Presidential candidate. ''He was a dinner guest at Financial World,'' Mr. Kingon said of Mr. Reagan. ''I sat next to him. We began talking about ideas, and I mentioned to him that I had read this strange book by Hilaire Belloc, a British writer who wrote very conservative, very anti-industrial revolution books. To my surprise, Reagan not only knew the guy, he began quoting paragraphs by him.'' While on Wall Street, Mr. Kingon, who is married and has a child, said he began contemplating the notion of working in Washington. ''I kept saying that if I believed all this stuff that I was writing about -supply side economics, lower taxes, monetary policy - I should get involved,'' he recalled. ''I was fascinated with the interaction of Government with people. Politics began to fascinate me more and more as the place where the ideas come together: In the Middle Ages it was the church, and in the Renaissance it was the universities, but now you had priests and professors running for Congress.'' Meantime, Mr. Kingon and his partner made what he terms their ''biggest mistake'' when their company purchased the ailing Saturday Review in 1980. ''We said we'd be willing to risk a half-million dollars,'' Mr. Kingon said with a laugh. ''Well, $3.2 million and two years later . . .'' Mr. Kingon was an Assistant Secretary of Commerce in 1983-84 and later transferred to the Treasury. He concedes there were some surprises when he came to the White House. ''We underestimated the amount of time and energy needed to deal with Congress,'' he said. ''We underestimated, I think, the sheer amount of work. ''It just comes at you. On some days you get 45 or 50 phone calls. I just cannot answer these calls. It saddens me because in the beginning I said to myself that I wasn't going to be this kind of guy.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FETAL TESTS CAN NOW FIND MANY MORE GENETIC FLAWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/science/fetal-tests-can-now-find-many-more-genetic-flaws.html,"THE couple already had two children afflicted with the grim reality of cystic fibrosis. They could not face having another. The disease It causes digestive problems, breathing problems, lung infections, with an almost continual threat of death from early childhood onward. The woman ended her next pregnancy by abortion. But now she is pregnant again and plans to have this baby. Genetic testing that has become available only within the last several months has given her solid assurance that the child will be free of the disease. This is the human side of a revolution in diagnosis of genetic diseases that is unfolding today because of scientists' growing ability to find and interpret the messages of the human genes. Today such diagnoses are becoming available for an ever increasing roster of disorders caused by a fault in one or another single gene among the 50,000 to 100,000 that humans possess. Individually, most of these diseases are quite rare, although cystic fibrosis afflicts an estimated 30,000 Americans and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy appears about once in every 5,000 males born alive. Prenatal detection of the classic form of hemophilia has become possible within the last year, as has been the case with cystilemma fibrosis. What one expert called ''reasonably good'' detection of muscular dystrophy has been possible since last fall. Phenylketonuria, an important cause of mental retardation usually known as PKU, has been detectable in the fetus for about two years; the blood diseases sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, also known as Cooley's anemia, have been detectable longer. Earlier methods have allowed detection of at least 50 other genetic diseases, including Down's syndrome and Tay-Sachs disease. But the new DNA studies are safer for the fetus than some of the earlier techniques and have added important diseases never before detectable in the womb. Most of these methods require that the diagnostician know what disease to look for. But in the future, some experts see the possibility of comprehensive genetic profiles. And these could also show exceptional risk of a major illness such as heart disease, diabetes or even schizophrenia. There are genetic components in these diseases too, but in most cases it is a matter of predisposition based on the combined effects of several genes and environmental factors. With the new predictive abilities come some sobering ethical and social problems of which specialists are very much aware. Only a handful of laboratories today are capable of doing the new tests, and they are expensive, yet many thousands of people might benefit. Furthermore, the ever-increasing ability to detect genetic disease early in fetal life is likely to sharpen the debate over abortion and generally exacerbate the dilemma of parents and doctors when diseases that used to be unforeseeable ''acts of God'' can now be predicted in advance. A different kind of dilemma confronts the experts in Huntington's disease, a genetic disorder that causes no symptoms early in life, but grave mental deterioration and death in middle age. Is a diagnostician justified in telling a person who may carry the fatal gene defect that he tests positive if there is a 10 percent chance that this grim prediction is wrong? In some disorders, experts say the growing ability to detect faulty genes appears to be reducing substantially the number of cases of the disease in the population. The hereditary blood disorder beta thalassemia is a striking example, according to Dr. Haig H. Kazazian Jr. of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore. ''I think we are having an impact on the incidence of that disorder,'' he said. There are no national figures, but he said information from diagnostic clinics in the Northeast allows the educated ''guesstimate'' that the number of new cases has dropped by 50 percent or more in recent years in some parts of this country and in some parts of the Mediterranean basin where the disease is common. Dr. Kazazian, who heads what is probably the largest center in the country for diagnosis of human genetic diseases through DNA studies, said he expects the new tests will have a major effect on the incidence of hemophilia and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy in the next few years. He does not expect much overall impact on cystic fibrosis because present testing can be used effectively only for families in which there is already one case. Carrier Test Next Step Dr. Arthur L. Beaudet, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said most new cases of cystic fibrosis are children born to couples who have not previously had an affected child. He believes the next important step is to develop a carrier test so that two potential parents can know in advance whether either or both carry the gene defect that produces the disease. ''I think a carrier test is an almost certain predictable goal,'' Dr. Beaudet said. ''You can guess whether it is going to take one year or five, but it certainly can be achieved.'' Specialists do not expect the new tests to eliminate diseases from the population. But they do expect the research will lead to the discovery of more specific genes that cause such diseases and that these discoveries may lead to better understanding and treatment. There are several related ways of detecting a single-gene disorder in a fetus, or of proving that a child or adult is a carrier. They all are based on the fact that the messages of heredity in all living things are carried in the chemistry of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The long, twisted strands of this master chemical of heredity are made up of four different subunits repeated in various combinations thousands and even millions of times. The combinations constitute the universal code for the regulation and production of everything a cell makes. The four subunits, the chemicals adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine, are identified usually by their initials. The sequence GAT, for example, is the code ordering a cell to add the amino acid leucine to a protein under construction. Other combinations are the codes for all of the other 19 amino acids that make up the myriad of different proteins that are the main ingredients of living things. If the DNA subunits A, G, C and T are the letters in the genetic alphabet, the genes and the amino acids for which they are the blueprints might be thought of as the paragraphs, and the genetic information in each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are the chapters of the encyclopedia of each person's heredity. One Error and Many Symptoms Altogether, the human genetic apparatus is an immense archive of about three billion subunits of DNA. Just one error among the three billion can produce all the symptoms and biological derangements of a disease such as thalassemia or muscular dystrophy. Even though a gene may contain several hundred to a few thousand subunits of genetic message, scientists can sometimes detect the state of a known gene from as few as 19 or 20 subunits by preparing two ''oligonucleotide probes'' that are matched up against the patient's DNA. One probe matches the known normal gene and the other the erroneous version. In this way, it is possible to tell if the patient has one copy of the defective gene, or two or none. Many of the diseases are ''recessive,'' a term that means the the faulty gene must be inherited from both parents for the disease to occur. A person who has only one copy will be a carrier, but ordinarily will not develop the symptoms of the disorder. Cystic fibrosis is such a case. Some other diseases, Huntington's chorea, for example, are ''dominant'' genetic disorders in which it takes only one copy of the misspelled gene to cause disaster. When the gene is known, it can be studied with the aid of the DNA probes. The group at Johns Hopkins has specialized in study of thalassemia, in which about 40 different genetic ''spelling errors'' are known, most of them errors in one or another single ''letter.'' Different population groups are likely to have different errors. Most natives of Sardinia who are either patients or carriers of thalassemia all share the same specific error. Altogether there are about eight that predominate in the countries that rim the Mediterranean. Enzymes to Cut Fragments The other main testing scheme available today is useful even when the gene has not yet been found. It depends partly on the fact that genes close together on a chromosome are likely to be inherited together. Special chemical scalpels called restriction enzymes cut strands of DNA when they encounter particular sequences of the four subunits. One, for example, cuts the strands in the middle of the sequence GGCC. More than 100 different restriction enzymes that cut in different places are known. Using a large battery of these, scientists can chop up all of the complement of DNA from a person's cells into many thousands of fragments. A mutation of a normal gene, whether disease-causing or harmless, may change the short sequence recognized by an enzyme so that a cut is no longer made at that point. This produces a fragment that is not the normal size. These variations are called restriction fragment length polymorphisms, known in the vernacular of the molecular biologists as RFLP's. By comparing the DNA of a cystic fibrosis patient with that of another family member, the difference in the DNA fragments can be seen and fragments that go with the faulty gene can be identified even though the gene itself is still unknown. In 1978, Dr. Y. W. Kan and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, studying sickle cell anemia, were the first to use RFLP's for diagnosis. RFLP's have been used recently to find such genetic ''markers'' for cystic fibrosis, Huntington's chorea and several other diseases. A Massachusetts biotechnology company, Collaborative Research Inc., has probably produced more of these useful fragments than anyone else. Company scientists contributed to the discovery last fall of the first useful genetic marker for cystic fibrosis. Dr. Helen Donis-Keller, its director of human genetics, estimates her group has produced well over 500 useful RFLP probes. The test systems are also leading to the discovery of more and more specific genes that are abnormal and causes of a genetic disease. For the American Society of Human Genetics, Dr. Beaudet of Baylor has compiled annual lists of gene identifications made by many research teams. Last year's edition contained more than 300 different human gene segments of known function, most of them discovered in the last two years. Last week, Dr. Waclaw Szybalski of the University of Wisconsin Medical School's McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research described the development of a new kind of restriction enzyme that can be fabricated to cut DNA at any desired point. Others said the method has great potential usefulness. Current reseach is making important strides in detection of more and more of the estimated 3,000 or more different single-gene defects. But major diseases such as heart disease and other widespread causes of human death and disability are far more complex in origin. Susceptibility is believed to be governed by several, perhaps many, different genes modulated by the total effects of life style and all other aspects of environment. Possibility of a DNA Map But the emergence of recombinant DNA technology in general and the uses of restriction fragments in particular seem capable of bringing even these complex diseases within reach of genetic analysis, experts say. Five years ago Dr. David Botstein of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Dr. Raymond L. White and Dr. Mark Skolnick, now of the University of Utah, and Dr. Ronald W. Davis of Stanford University proposed the use of restriction fragments to make a map covering the entire 3 billion subunits of human DNA. In a recent conversation, Dr. Botstein said about 50 to 150 such fragments, evenly spaced throughout the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, could do the job. If funds were available, such a map could be completed within five years, he said. An individual's DNA matched against these probes might reveal varying degrees of inborn natural susceptibility to some of mankind's major diseases. Experts said it would take wisdom to handle this kind of information without abusing its possibilities, but it could also suggest elements of life style that individuals could use to minimize the risks to their health. The links between cigarette smoking and lung cancer are known to every educated American, yet most also know that many smokers live their entire lives free of the disease. The less fortunate ones learn their own susceptility too late. A genetic linkage map might allow parents to know early, sometimes even before the child is born, that he or she must be particularly careful to avoid smoking, for example, or should live on a diet prudent from the viewpoint of heart disease. ''I think that will be the big factor in this diagnostic area in the next 10 to 15 years,'' said Dr. Kazazian of this broadening horizon of genetic detection. ''It is amazing how far we have come in just a short time,'' he added. ''That is the impressive thing. I never would have dreamed it 10 years ago.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BLACK CHURCHES JOIN THE FIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/12/garden/black-churches-join-the-fight.html,"FAMILY planning clinics are not the only groups galvanized into action against teen-age pregnancy. An increasing number of black churches across the country are also creating pregnancy-prevention programs and support groups for young mothers. Although the majority of infants born to teen-agers are white, according to a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, black teen-agers bear proportionally many more children than their white counterparts: Of every 1,000 black teen-agers, 163 gave birth in 1984, compared with 83 for every 1,000 white teen-agers. The surge in the number of programs on teen-age sexuality and pregnancy is new to the majority of black churches, according to ministers and theological experts. ''It's not like when I was growing up,'' recalled the Rev. Jeannine Moore, who runs a shelter for young homeless mothers at the Second Baptist Church in Los Angeles. ''Then a girl had to stand up and apologize in front of the church to be reinstated. Now we've come full circle to ignoring it. Our first stab at it was only last year.'' Many ministers say they have to struggle with congregation members, teen-agers and other clergy to bring the issue into the open. ''The whole question of teen-age pregnancy comes to us in a whisper, and we fall into the trap: We answer with a whisper,'' said the Reverend Lorenzo A. Lynch of the White Rock Baptist Church in Durham, N.C. ''We don't deal with other things, like drug prevention, like that.'' Many ministers and experts on the black church agree that the training of most clergy leaves them ill-equipped to grapple with the complexities of this national trend. ''The problem is fundamentally sexual, but it is also economic and cultural,'' said C. Eric Lincoln, professor of religion and culture at Duke University. ''There are many ministers who are sophisticated enough to know we aren't just talking body chemistry but who have not yet been able to develop a proper response.'' A year ago, the Chicago Theological Seminary won a grant of $343,000 from the Carnegie Foundation to train young seminarians to cope with such sensitive issues as teen-age pregnancy. According to Dr. Kenneth Smith, president of the seminary, students go to 10 participating churches and work with ''children at risk'' for a year. Five of these churches are sponsoring programs on teen-age pregnancy. ''We're trying to help seminarians develop a leadership and administrative style so that they can help all in the community,'' Dr. Smith said. The Baptist, Methodist and Pentecostal ministers who are running programs for teen-agers and young mothers uniformly disapprove of abortion. They are also united in their desire to help young black men more. But their ideological responses to teen-age pregnancy differ widely. Some ministers, who cannot condone teen-age sexuality, counsel youths to abstain. Others consider guidance on sexuality and contraception their moral responsibility. Many merge the two approaches. ''I think I hold up the ideal first - to abstain from sex before marriage,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''If they can't live with that, I counsel them to get with their family and seek some kind of protection.'' Some churches have been engaged in counseling programs for years. Since 1980, the Abyssinian Baptist Church of New York City has sponsored a tutorial program called Alakiko, which has a budget of $30,000. According to the Rev. Calvin Butts, director of the Social Action Committee at Abyssinian, a dozen young women volunteer to sponsor an adolescent girl and discuss with her personal hygiene, sexuality and contraception as well as educational choices, savings plans and cultural history. A similar program for young men will begin this year, he said. In Washington, the Shiloh Baptist Church created the Family Life Center in 1981 to provide recreational activity for parents, teen-agers and senior citizens. According to Mattie Robinson, director of Shiloh's Department of Mission, the center has regularly offered workshops on pregnancy prevention for teen-agers, seminars for young mothers on their role as parents and job training in food services for many of the area's unemployed youth. The center's money comes from the Ford Foundation. Other churches, however, are limited in finances and personnel. ''My programs are primarily individual, which is sad but true,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''Look at how much time it takes to get to 20 teens.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ARCHDIOCESE TO KEEP LINKS TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/12/nyregion/archdiocese-to-keep-links-to-medical-school.html,"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York says it will not require a private medical college affiliated with the archdiocese to give up a $24 million contract with two municipal hospitals in which abortions are performed. Last week, John Cardinal O'Connor warned in an interview with The New York Times that if abortions continued at two hospitals, the school, the New York Medical College, would have to choose between giving up the city contract or breaking its ties with the archodiocese. he said abortions ''violated Catholic principles and the sacredness of the human person'' and should never be performed by any physician or in any hospital affiliated with the archdiocese. But after a dinner meeting Monday night with Mayor Koch, the Cardinal and the Mayor said there was ''no problem'' with the contract, which includes a provision that requires abortions at the two hsopitals to be performed by outside physicians hired by the city. The Rev. Peter G. Finn, a spokesman for the archdiocese, was asked yesterday if the Cardinal's opposition to abortion still applied to the two city hospitals, the Metropolitan Hospital Center in Manhattan and Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, or to any other hospitals affiliated with the medical college and in which abortions are performed. ''I have no comment other than the fact that the Cardinal's position on abortion is quite coherent, clear and consistent,'' Father Finn said. He said The Times's article ''gave an indication of conflict,'' but ''in fact that conflict does not exist, not as far as the city, nor the archdiocese, nor the medical college can determine.'' In addition to the two city hospitals, the college, which is considering closer ties with the archdiocese, has affiliations with 17 Catholic hospitals and 15 other private and public hsopitals. Abortions are performed at several hospitals affiliated with the college.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VATICAN TELLS PRIEST TO RETRACT VIEWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/12/us/vatican-tells-priest-to-retract-views.html,"The Vatican has ordered the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a liberal theologian at Catholic University of America, either to retract his views on birth control and other sexual issues or face the loss of his authorization to teach Roman Catholic doctrine. The ultimatum was revealed today at a crowded news conference at which the 51-year-old Father Curran made public a letter he received late last year from Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, warning of discplinary action. The congregation is the Vatican's monitor of theological conformity. Father Curran said he refused to retract his teachings but had offered to promise never to teach sexual ethics at Catholic University, a subject he said he had not taught for 15 years anyway. The compromise proposal, he said, was transmitted to Rome by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, chairman of the university's board of trustees, but Cardinal Ratzinger did not indicate a willingness to accept it. As a result, Father Curran said he was waiting for the Vatican Congregation to act on its threat, a process he said could take many months. Examination's 'Conclusive Phase' A statement released last night by Archbishop James A. Hickey of Washington, chancellor of the university, confirmed the Ratzinger letter and said that what was at issue was ''Father Curran's continued authorization to teach in the name of the Catholic church.'' The congregation's examination of Father Curran's license, the statement said, ''is reaching the conclusive phase.'' The Rev. William J. Byron, president of the 7,000-student university in the nation's capital, said in an interview that if the Vatican takes away Father Curran's authorization, he could no longer be employed as a member of the theology faculty at Catholic University, one of three departments chartered by the Vatican. However, he said, Father Curran, a tenured professor of moral theology, could teach in one of 30 other departments. Father Curran said that a transfer to another department would be unacceptable because it would violate both his tenure and his academic freedom. Father Curran, who was in Rome on Saturday for a two-hour meeting with Cardinal Ratzinger, is a popular campus figure and his supporters have scheduled a news conference Wednesday to announce a petition drive. In a similar controversy in 1968, Father Curran was dismissed as a result of a public statement that birth control was permissible. A five-day student strike ensued and he was reinstated. Cardinal's Letter Detailed The letter from Cardinal Ratzinger, dated Sept. 17, 1985, asked Father Curran to ''reconsider and retract these positions which violate the conditions necessary for a professor to be called a Catholic theologian.'' The letter said Father Curran had violated Catholic teachings that artificial contraception is wrong, that abortion and euthanasia are ''unspeakable crimes'' in all circumstances, that masturbation, premarital intercourse and homosexual acts are ''intrinsically immoral'' and that marriage is an indissoluble bond between two persons. ''It must be recognized,'' the letter continued, ''that the authorities of the Church cannot allow the present situation to continue in which the inherent contradiction is prolonged that one who is to teach in the name of the Church in fact denies her teaching.'' The controversy fundamentally reflects a tension between those with a clear hierarchical view of the church where direction and teaching flow from the top and those who hold a more democratic view and believe that the doctrines of the church are developed in consensus with the people of the church. Given the American democratic experience, the tension with Rome is felt with particular keenness in this country. Right to Dissent Held Pope John Paul II has been trying to reassert orthodox Catholic teachings and to discipline those who stray. The Swiss theologian Hans Kung was stripped of his status as a Catholic theologian in 1978 and the Brazilian theologian, the Rev. Leonardo Boff, an exponent of liberation theology, social activism in behalf of the poor, was ordered last year to maintain a period of silence. Both Father Curran and Father Byron said they could not recall any American theologian whose authority to teach in a theological faculty had been removed. Father Curran maintained that he had a right to dissent from church teachings that have not been declared infallible. ''On particular issues, there is no doubt that many Catholic theologians and faithful do disagree sharply with official teachings, such as those on contraception, sterilization and the indissolubility of marriage,'' he said. ''From this it should be evident that the positions taken by me are neither radical nor rebellious but are in the mainstream of contemporary Roman Catholic theology.'' ''I find myself at home in the church and it's as much my church as anyone else's,'' Father Curran said to a sustained round of applause from student supporters. 'A Final Judgment' Father Curran's writings on moral theology have been under investigation by the Vatican since 1979. The letter from Cardinal Ratzinger indicated that the Congregation was now ''in a position to bring this inquiry to its conclusion'' and that the inquiry's results were presented to the Pope on June 28 ''and were confirmed by him.'' ''It was clearly a final judgment,'' Father Curran argued, adding that the letter indictated he had two months by which to retract his views. The letter contended that Catholic theologians ''do not teach on their own authority but by virtue of the mission they have received from the church.'' ''In order to guarantee this teaching,'' the letter continued, ''the church claims the freedom to maintain her own academic institutions in which her doctrine is reflected upon, taught and interpreted in complete fidelity. This freedom of the Church to teach her doctrine is in full accord with the students' corresponding right to know what that teaching is and have it properly explained to them.'' Father Curran, a priest under the jursidction of the Diocese of Rochester, argued that the key issue in his struggle with the Vatican is the right to dissent from any church teachings that are not dogmas or doctrines that have been defined as infallible. 'Accuser and Judge' ''It is unjust to single me out for disciplinary action of any type when so many other Catholic theologians hold the same basic position,'' he said. He also assailed the Congregation for performing ''the roles of both accuser and judge.'' Father Curran said he felt he had been singled out because of the public uproar caused by his dismissal and reinstatement in 1968 and because he has written prolifically on moral theology. Terming his positions neither ''defiant nor disrespectful,'' he maintained that he was not challenging the teaching role of the church's hierarchy. But he said the hierarchy must also recognize that ''academic decisions must ultimately be made by peers in the light of Catholic faith and the ongoing search for truth.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/13/garden/hers.html,"It was always the look on their faces that told me first. I was the freshman dormitory counselor and they were the freshmen at a women's college where everyone was smart. One of them could come into my room, a golden girl, a valedictorian, an 800 verbal score on the SAT's, and her eyes would be empty, seeing only a busted future, the devastation of her life as she knew it. She had failed biology, messed up the math; she was pregnant. That was when I became pro-choice. It was the look in his eyes that I will always remember, too. They were as black as the bottom of a well, and in them for a few minutes I thought I saw myself the way I had always wished to be -clear, simple, elemental, at peace. My child looked at me and I looked back at him in the delivery room, and I realized that out of a sea of infinite possibilities it had come down to this: a specific person, born on the hottest day of the year, conceived on a Christmas Eve, made by his father and me miraculously from scratch. Once I believed that there was a little blob of formless protoplasm in there and a gynecologist went after it with a surgical instrument, and that was that. Then I got pregnant myself - eagerly, intentionally, by the right man, at the right time -and I began to doubt. My abdomen still flat, my stomach roiling with morning sickness, I felt not that I had protoplasm inside but instead a complete human being in miniature to whom I could talk, sing, make promises. Neither of these views was accurate; instead, I think, the reality is something in the middle. And that is where I find myself now, in the middle, hating the idea of abortions, hating the idea of having them outlawed. For I know it is the right thing in some times and places. I remember sitting in a shabby clinic far uptown with one of those freshmen, only three months after the Supreme Court had made what we were doing possible, and watching with wonder as the lovely first love she had had with a nice boy unraveled over the space of an hour as they waited for her to be called, degenerated into sniping and silences. I remember a year or two later seeing them pass on campus and not even acknowledge one another because their conjoining had caused them so much pain, and I shuddered to think of them married, with a small psyche in their unready and unwilling hands. I've met 14-year-olds who were pregnant and said they could not have abortions because of their religion, and I see in their eyes the shadows of 22-year-olds I've talked to who lost their kids to foster care because they hit them or used drugs or simply had no money for food and shelter. I read not long ago about a teen-ager who said she meant to have an abortion but she spent the money on clothes instead; now she has a baby who turns out to be a lot more trouble than a toy. The people who hand out those execrable little pictures of dismembered fetuses at abortion clinics seem to forget the extraordinary pain children may endure after they are born when they are unwanted, even hated or simply tolerated. I believe that in a contest between the living and the almost living, the latter must, if necessary, give way to the will of the former. That is what the fetus is to me, the almost living. Yet these questions began to plague me - and, I've discovered, a good many other women - after I became pregnant. But they became even more acute after I had my second child, mainly because he is so different from his brother. On two random nights 18 months apart the same two people managed to conceive, and on one occasion the tumult within turned itself into a curly-haired brunet with merry black eyes who walked and talked late and loved the whole world, and on another it became a blond with hazel Asian eyes and a pug nose who tried to conquer the world almost as soon as he entered it. If we were to have an abortion next time for some reason or another, which infinite possibility becomes, not a reality, but a nullity? The girl with the blue eyes? The improbable redhead? The natural athlete? The thinker? My husband, ever at the heart of the matter, put it another way. Knowing that he is finding two children somewhat more overwhelming than he expected, I asked if he would want me to have an abortion if I accidentally became pregnant again right away. ''And waste a perfectly good human being?'' he said. Coming to this quandary has been difficult for me. In fact, I believe the issue of abortion is difficult for all thoughtful people. I don't know anyone who has had an abortion who has not been haunted by it. If there is one thing I find intolerable about most of the so-called right-to-lifers, it is that they try to portray abortion rights as something that feminists thought up on a slow Saturday over a light lunch. That is nonsense. I also know that some people who support abortion rights are most comfortable with a monolithic position because it seems the strongest front against the smug and sometimes violent opposition. But I don't feel all one way about abortion anymore, and I don't think it serves a just cause to pretend that many of us do. For years I believed that a woman's right to choose was absolute, but now I wonder. Do I, with a stable home and marriage and sufficient stamina and money, have the right to choose abortion because a pregnancy is inconvenient right now? Legally I do have that right; legally I want always to have that right. It is the morality of exercising it under those circumstances that makes me wonder. Technology has foiled us. The second trimester has become a time of resurrection; a fetus at six months can be one woman's late abortion, another's premature, viable child. Photographers now have film of embryos the size of a grape, oddly human, flexing their fingers, sucking their thumbs. Women have amniocentisis to find out whether they are carrying a child with birth defects that they may choose to abort. Before the procedure, they must have a sonogram, one of those fuzzy black-and-white photos like a love song heard through static on the radio, which shows someone is in there. I have taped on my VCR a public television program in which somehow, inexplicably, a film is shown of a fetus in utero scratching its face, seemingly putting up a tiny hand to shield itself from the camera's eye. It would make a potent weapon in the arsenal of the antiabortionists. I grow sentimental about it as it floats in the salt water, part fish, part human being. It is almost living, but not quite. It has almost turned my heart around, but not quite turned my head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S. SEEKS TRUSTEE FOR ROBINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/13/business/us-seeks-trustee-for-robins.html,"The Justice Department today asked a Federal judge to appoint a trustee to take control of the A. H. Robins Company, charging that company officers had improperly spent money after the large pharmaceutical company filed for reorganization last year under Federal bankruptcy laws. In a motion filed in Federal District Court in Richmond, the Government said that Robins was in civil contempt of an order requiring it to seek court permission before paying off debts incurred before it filed for protection from its creditors. Payments to Officers A law-enforcement official familiar with the case said that Robins had improperly paid corporate officers and executives about $1.2 million in compensation, and had paid nearly $5.6 million in other debts. The Richmond-based pharmaceutical company sought protection from creditors last August after it was besieged by damage suits from women claiming they had been harmed by its Dalkon Shield intrauterine birth-control device. If the court motion is approved by Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., Robins executives would be replaced by an independent, court-appointed trustee. Under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, Robins would normally be permitted to retain its existing management. Robins Statement A Robins spokesman, Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., said late tonight that appointment of a trustee was ''unwarranted.'' The disputed payments ''were made in the belief that they were proper in the ordinary course of the company's business,'' he said. ''Robins regrets any violation of the court's order and is taking appropriate steps to bring itself into compliance. The actions of those involved were in no way intended to violate the order.'' Under court order, Robins was required to receive permission to pay off debts incurred before the Chapter 11 filing. The order was apparently an attempt to be fair to all creditors who had a claim on the company's assets. Today's motion was filed by an Assistant United States Attorney, S. David Schiller, on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, one of the creditors. The motion asked that the company be required to identity ''all directors, officers, managers, employees and counsel who participated in the decisions to make payments, and in the actual payments of funds, in violation'' of the court order. Robins is ''out of control, and only appointment of a trustee can set it back on course,'' Mr. Schiller told The Associated Press. Computer Costs, Drug Royalties A law-enforcement official said that the company, in addition to the $1.2 million in deferred compensation, also improperly paid out millions of dollars in other debts, including computer costs and drug royalties. In a written statement read to reporters, Mr. Puckett, the Robins spokesman, acknowledged ''payment of certain pre-petition obligations.'' But the statement said that ''the suggestion that such actions amount to contempt is unwarranted, as is the suggestion that a company with the performance record of Robins needs a trustee to oversee its operations.'' In filing for court protection last year, Robins said claims involving the Dalkon Shield threatened its viability. The company said it had become clear that the $615 million fund it had established early last year to deal with the claims would not be enough to pay damages to thousands of women who said they had been harmed by the device. At the end of 1984, Robins listed $309 million in assets. The company has released no estimate of its total liability in the Dalkon Shield claims, but some financial specialists have said it could be as high as $2 billion. April 30 Deadline Robins has set an April 30 deadline for women who claim they have been harmed by the device to notify the company. About 200,000 women have filed claims. Thousands of women have complained of pelvic infections, sterility and spontaneous abortions because of the device, and a few deaths have been reported. About 2.8 million of the intrauterine birth-control devices were sold in the United States from 1971 to 1974, when the product was discontinued. The claims process, too, has been tied up in court because of infighting among the plaintiffs. Judge Merhige was scheduled to hear a number of motions in the case on Friday, including whether a claimants' committee that was dissolved last week should be revived.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BANKRUPTCY WOES AT ROBINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/14/business/bankruptcy-woes-at-robins.html,"When the A. H. Robins Company filed bankruptcy proceedings seven months ago, it was seeking a way to handle thousands of claims from women who said they were injured by its Dalkon Shield birth control device. But now the bankruptcy strategy seems to be backfiring. Federal prosecutors in Richmond are seeking to oust the management of the 120-year-old pharmaceutical company -including E. Claiborne Robins, the chairman and grandson of the company's founder, and E. Claiborne Robins Jr., the president - and turn the company's operations over to a trustee appointed by the court. The Problems of Bankruptcy The Federal move, and a continuing fight over who will represent the women claiming injury, underscore how traumatic and cumbersome the bankruptcy process may be as a means of resolving mass lawsuits. The choice of bankruptcy proceedings by solvent companies facing such claims has been controversial ever since the Manville Corporation filed for reorganization in 1982 under the weight of thousands of asbestos claims. At that time, critics said that the company was avoiding its debt to society by escaping into bankruptcy. ''Bankruptcy court is not a panacea,'' said Harvey Miller, a New York bankruptcy lawyer. ''The appointment of a trustee is a possibility companies have to consider. And even if no trustee is named, the reorganization process is traumatic, changing the company from a private operation into one that operates in a goldfish bowl, leaving management much less control.'' A filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws automatically freezes all claims against a company until a reorganization plan is approved. In Robins's case, that included more than 5,000 lawsuits over the Dalkon Shield. But the filing also puts the company into the control of the bankruptcy court. To protect the assets that will be available to creditors, companies in bankruptcy must have approval to make all but the most routine payments. Possibility of Trustee And if a creditor charges that the management is dishonest or grossly incompetent, the bankruptcy court can remove existing management and install a trustee of its own choosing - a drastic move that is rarely made. That trustee then has responsibility for running the company and may choose to allow certain executives some operating role. On Wednesday, S. David Schiller, an Assistant United States Attorney in Richmond, asked the court to appoint a trustee to run Robins. Mr. Schiller's motion charged that since the bankruptcy filing on Aug. 21, Robins has made improper payments of more than $6.8 million, ''in knowing and willful violation'' of a court order requiring the company to get permission for payments. The disputed payments, the motion said, were $1.2 million in deferred compensation to officers, and $5.6 million in royalty and other payments. Mr. Schiller, acting on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, which is owed $62 million by Robins, said the company was in civil contempt of the court order, and argued that Robins was ''out of control and only appointment of a trustee can set it back on course.'' ''Robins should not be violating an order designed to protect the very creditors toward whom it has a fiduciary obligation,'' the motion said. ''Such conduct is both fraudulent and dishonest.'' The company acknowledged that it had made payments without the permission of the court, but said they had been honest mistakes. ''The suggestions that such actions amount to contempt is unwarranted as is the suggestion that a company with the performance record of Robins needs a trustee to oversee its operations,'' said Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., a spokesman for the company, in a prepared statement. ''The payments were made in the belief that they were proper in the ordinary course of business. The actions were in no way intended to violate the court order.'' He did not elaborate. The motion for a trustee is to be heard on April 21. Other Problems But the department's actions are not the only problem in the Robins case. With almost 200,000 Dalkon Shield claims filed since the company went into Chapter 11 and as many as 1,200 more pouring into the Richmond courthouse every day - charging that the intrauterine device caused pelvic infections, sterility and spontaneous abortions - the bankruptcy proceedings are mired in confusion. The committee of 38 lawyers appointed to represent the claimants was dissolved by United States District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. two weeks ago, after that committee asked to be allowed to replace its bankruptcy counsel, Murray Drabkin. At a March 4 hearing in Richmond, Judge Merhige decided to keep Mr. Drabkin as ''special counsel'' and, instead, to replace the 38-lawyer committee with a smaller group, which has not yet been named. Shortly thereafter, several members of the committee asked Judge Merhige to disqualify himself, saying he favored the Robins side. An Internal Battle Meanwhile, the lawyers on the committee have been embroiled in a heated internal battle. According to the chairman of the group, Mary Beth Ramey, and the former chairman, Bradley Post, one of the members, Paul Rheingold, kept advertising for more Dalkon Shield cases even after the committee passed a resolution against members doing so. As a result, they say, Mr. Rheingold was removed from the committee's executive panel and threatened with the loss of his place on the committee. At the March 4 hearing Mr. Rheingold, a New York City lawyer who has amassed more than 1,000 Dalkon Shield cases, told Judge Merhige that the committee was not functioning properly. Mr. Rheingold, who says he is no longer advertising and violated no committee ruling, says he is seeking a seat on the new committee. Miss Ramey and other members of the disbanded committee say they will ask Judge Merhige to reconsider and reconstitute the old committee. That battle could culminate today, when Judge Merhige is scheduled to rule on a slew of legal motions, including whether he should step down and who should represent the claimants. Earlier this year, as part of the bankruptcy proceeding, Robins has run advertisements advising women who used the shield that any claims against the company must be filed by April 30 - and many more claims than expected have filed. Some lawyers now expect that as many as 300,000 women may file Dalkon Shield claims. When Robins went into bankruptcy, it had more than 5,000 cases pending, and had tried 25 cases and settled another 9,300 for a cost of about $517 million. At the time, the company said the claims threatened its viability, and that a $615 million reserve fund it had established to pay the claims would not be enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Is a Man's Problem as Well as a Woman's,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/opinion/l-abortion-is-a-man-s-problem-as-well-as-a-woman-s-143386.html,"To the Editor: Last weekend, thousands of women demonstrated in Washington in support of legal abortion. Among these women were some men. There should have been many more, both those who support abortion without firsthand experience and men whose partners have had abortions. Yet clinics discourage men from being involved in abortion. In so doing, they not only turn their backs on people who can be profoundly affected by abortion, but also, by giving the message that abortion is only a woman's problem, keep men from participating in the struggle to provide contraception and abortion. When my girlfriend became pregnant a few years ago, we decided to have an abortion. The decision, and the abortion itself, were very hard for me: the clinic operated under the assumption that men couldn't be concerned about abortion, and there was almost hostility toward the men accompanying their partners. Neither counseling nor referral to counseling was offered to them. Although the clinic was supposed to have a booklet to help men deal with abortion, it was out of stock when I was there, and I was told by a counselor that they usually didn't bother to keep it on hand. Men were not allowed to be present in the meeting where contraception was discussed, and the clinic didn't even let them buy contraceptives. I later talked to the clinic's counseling director about trying to encourage male involvement in contraception and abortion when the woman wanted her partner involved; she was entirely unsympathetic. For men to be responsible partners, they must be allowed to fulfill their responsibility. Clinics need to accept that men can want to be supportive of their partners, and that they can need support themselves, either in adjusting to a mutual decision or if they wish to support a woman's decision despite their own hesitation. A Planned Parenthood advertisement directed toward men says, ''we can always pretend it's not our problem.'' ''But for many women,'' it continues, ''abortion involves more than an opinion. They face a decision about abortion, and that's harder and lonelier. They have to live with the consequences.'' A caring man cannot pretend it's not his problem; he, too, lives with the consequences. The acceptance and encouragement of active male involvement will help both men and women. Clinics could do a lot toward having as many men as women at the next march.

Abortion Is a MAn's Problem as Well as a Woman's; Augustinian Sense,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/opinion/l-abortion-is-a-man-s-problem-as-well-as-a-woman-s-augustinian-sense-144986.html,"To the Editor: Your poll on attitudes toward abortion (Week in Review, Feb. 23) found that 55 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that ''abortion is the same thing as murdering a child.'' At the same time, 66 percent agreed with the apparently contradictory statement that ''abortion is sometimes the best thing in a bad situation.'' A possible explanation for the disparity is that some of those who accepted the abstract classification of abortion as murder had been taught to associate this classification with religion and morality, but when these same respondents were asked to consider real-life situations they fell back on their innate common sense. If respondents who agreed to the description of abortion as murder thought they were voting on the side of religion and against atheism, they were mistaken. The overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations and the Conservative and Reform branches of Judaism reject the idea that abortion is murder, and it is they, not the antiabortion advocates, who follow biblical teaching in this matter. Only one passage in the Bible relates to abortion. Exodus 21:22 describes a case in which the loss of a fetus occurs ''if men quarrel, and one strike a woman with child.'' The punishment is a fine unless the woman is hurt. Augustine, one of the architects of Christian theology and a Roman Catholic saint, commented on this passage (in ''On Exodus''): ''The law does not provide that the act pertains to homicide, for there yet cannot be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation when it is not formed in flesh.'' I think that Augustine was using common sense.EDGAR VILLCHUR Woodstock, N.Y., Feb. 25, 1986",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE VATICAN FINDS A FIGHT IN AMERICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/weekinreview/the-vatican-finds-a-fight-in-america.html,"It is said that the three subjects that should never be broached in polite company are sex, religion and politics. Last week, all three combined with a vengeance in the Vatican. The central figure was a well-liked Catholic theologian, the Rev. Charles Curran. A tenured professor of moral theology at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., Father Curran made public a letter from the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith giving him an unpleasant choice: Either change his liberal views on such matters as birth control, homosexuality, divorce, masturbation and abortion or be barred from teaching as a Catholic theologian. Father Curran is fighting the ultimatum, which was issued by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger with the approval of the Pope. Liberal Catholic academics are backing him, contending that the Vatican's order threatened academic freedom. His home bishop backed him, too. ''If Father Curran's status as a Roman Catholic theologian is brought into question,'' said Bishop Matthew Clark of Rochester, ''I fear a serious setback to Catholic education and pastoral life in this country.'' The battle has been a long time coming. It is being fought over an array of questions on which the distance between the Vatican and many American Catholics is great. The church's teachings on sexuality have been mocked in plays, and in radically different ways both Mary Gordon and the Rev. Andrew Greeley have enjoyed success with novels that treat themes relating Catholicism and sexuality. The substantial attention for a recent academic work, Judith C. Brown's ''Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy,'' suggests the extent of the interest in such subjects. Traditional Catholics no doubt have a legitimate complaint when they contend that, outside the Vatican, their views on sexuality do not get much of a hearing. To those who oppose premarital sex, birth control and divorce, the church can hardly be faulted for holding to views it has maintained for centuries. ''Although those opposed to church teaching seem to be motivated by compassion,'' wrote the Revs. Richard M. Hogan and John M. LeVoir in a book on Pope John Paul II's teachings on sexuality, ''in effect, they are pessimistic about our possibility of ever overcoming the effects of sin.'' Many traditionalists also link birth control to abortion, arguing that a ''contraceptive mentality'' creates a disrespect for human life. Surely, consistency is there. Sixteen centuries ago, St. Augustine condemned as ''unnatural and sinful those sexual acts in which intercourse did not take place in a vessel fit for procreation.'' From St. Augustine to John Paul, there is a direct line, though to the surprise of many this Pope tends to more joyous and lyrical in his discussion of sexuality than the dour Augustine. But by many measures, the church's sexual teachings, especially on birth control, are falling increasingly on deaf American ears. Father Greeley and his sociological colleagues have argued that the church's ban on contraception ''seems to have been the occasion for massive apostasy and for a notable decline in religious devotion and belief.'' On birth control especially, Father Curran speaks for what, according to poll after poll, is a majority of American Catholics. ''The Roman Catholic theology of sexuality has been frequently criticized in the past because it was too negative and gave an undue importance to sexuality,'' he wrote several years ago. ''All must admit the negative and even inhuman approach to sexuality which existed in the past, both in Catholic theory and practice, but fortunately, a much more positive approach is beginning to prevail.'' Indeed, so many Catholic moral theologians agree with Father Curran's approach that supporters are asking why he has been singled out. Is it because he led the American dissenters to Humanae Vitae, Pope Paul VI's encyclical banning birth control? The Vatican says no, adding that other liberals may face penalties, too. But that will not make its position any stronger in the United States. Not incidentally, Father Curran's academic interests include a fascination with the relationship between being a Catholic and being an American. At least some Vatican officials believe that America's democratic traditions can make it harder for American Catholics to accept life in a hierarchical church. ''Too often authority in the church acts as if all the people of God were dumb sheep or illiterate masses who must be directed from without in all they do,'' Father Curran has written. Those are fighting words, and the Vatican is fighting back. But one of the curious aspects of the case is that the Vatican, which seemed to enjoy a tactical advantage against American signers of statements in favor of legal abortion, has now taken on a much broader set of issues. Many of America's leading liberal Catholics have been reluctant to stake their right to dissent on the abortion question alone. Father Curran's own quarrels with the church on the subject are relatively mild, and he freely concedes that ''the vast majority of Roman Catholic authors accept the traditional teaching'' or disagree only to a ''slight extent.'' But birth control and sexuality are another matter. Hanging his case on those issues as well as academic freedom is Father Curran's hope. And Rome's challenge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ANOTHER CAUSE, ANOTHER CONCERT FOR PETER, PAUL AND MARY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/arts/another-cause-another-concert-for-peter-paul-and-mary.html,"There are framed gold and platinum albums on the wall of Mary Travers's midtown office, reminders of the million-selling hits she sang as a member of Peter, Paul and Mary in the 1960's. Hanging next to them, however, are other kinds of citations - including, for instance, one from the Korean Institute for Human Rights. Twenty-five years after Miss Travers first sang with Peter Yarrow and Paul Stookey, the trio has been marking its anniversary with concerts for causes - standard operating procedure for the pop-folk singers who have played more than 300 benefits for causes and candidates in the past three years alone. In the wake of such socially conscious rock events as Live Aid for famine relief, Farm Aid to publicize the farm problem and the all-star anti-apartheid single ''Sun City,'' Peter, Paul and Mary might well feel like elder siblings. The group's recent 25th anniversary show at Washington's Kennedy Center was a benefit for the Free South Africa movement, which is working to end apartheid. A photograph in the program showed the singers, alongside Mr. Yarrow's daughter and Miss Travers's mother, getting arrested on the steps of the South African embassy - ''my first time with plastic handcuffs,'' Miss Travers said. This Tuesday, the trio will open ''From Bleecker to Broadway'' - a six-day, eight-show engagement at the Minskoff Theater, and Peter, Paul and Mary's first Broadway shows ever - with a sold-out benefit for the New York City Coalition for the Homeless that will raise approximately $40,000. Another cause, another concert. In the 1960's, Peter, Paul and Mary brought folk songs, children's songs and brand-new protest songs - ''All My Trials,'' ''Puff, the Magic Dragon,'' ''If I Had a Hammer,'' ''Blowing in the Wind'' - to a gigantic pop listenership; along with concert tours, they sang at civil-rights marches, anti-Vietnam rallies and political benefits. In the 1980's, while folk-style music has virtually disappeared from the pop charts, Peter, Paul and Mary's worldwide audience still turns out to see a group whose agenda continues to mix social activism with three-part vocal harmony. They say they are in the tradition of ''Seeger's Raiders'' - paying tribute to the folk singer, who has been an activist musician since the 1940's. The trio is no longer indivisible. Peter, Paul and Mary split up in 1970, two years after Mr. Stookey converted to Christianity and adopted Noel as his first name. ''I had a family,'' he said, ''and unless I stopped touring and attended to them I wasn't going to have them much longer.'' Peter, Paul and Mary remained on good terms, and reunited occasionally for benefit concerts. In 1978, they began working together more steadily. Meanwhile, Miss Travers and Mr. Yarrow have mixed political organizing and solo performing careers; Mr. Stookey sings Christian music with a group called Bodywork. ''To a large extent now,'' Mr. Stookey said, ''we walk our own roads and we bring to the group what we find arresting - an arrangement, or new lyrics, or changing lyrics. Inevitably there's a discussion. Right now, we're debating the issue of abortion, because the Christian and the political perspectives are somewhat different.'' ''This is a relationship, with all three of us, that has gone through terrible fights and wonderful making up,'' Mr. Yarrow said. ''These days, Noel and I write the songs, and Mary writes the poetry and the speeches.'' ''Twenty-five years ago,'' Miss Travers said, ''I used to get onstage and not open my mouth and not want to open my mouth to talk. The other night, at a meeting, my job was to present an organized piece of material and to lay out a course of action, and I was very organized and did it. Peter looked at me and shook his head, and he said, 'To think we thought you were dumb.' '' Mr. Stookey has lived in Maine since the mid-1970's; Mr. Yarrow and Miss Travers both have homes in Connecticut, and Miss Travers also maintains an apartment and office in Manhattan. ''I write songs while driving down the highway from Connecticut,'' Mr. Yarrow says. ''I pick up the pencil and write without looking at it; later, I see if I can make it out.'' Peter, Paul and Mary say they are heartened by the increasing social activism of rock. ''Even though Live Aid and Farm Aid were very comfortable and accessible gestures,'' Mr. Yarrow said, ''which did not involve alienating a group that would object to one's involvement, they were important steps for pop music. There's something happening in the world, and with the technology that could unite us. It's moving again, and it's a great joy that we can participate. And we have something to share now that we didn't have then - we're experienced.'' ''Singing 'Blowing in the Wind' all the places we've been,'' Miss Travers said, ''it takes on a different meaning everywhere. When you sing the line, 'How many years can a people exist before they're allowed to be free?' in a prison yard for political prisoners in El Salvador, if you have sung it to a group of union organizers - who have all been in jail - in South Korea, if you've sung that song to Soviet Jews who have been refused exit visas, if you've sung it with Bishop Tutu, the song breathes, lives, it has a currency.'' ''If we were wearing spangled tights and singing 'Fly Me to the Moon' or hits of the 50's,'' Mr. Stookey said, ''I don't think we'd still be so involved with what we're doing.'' Peter, Paul and Mary are no longer under contract to a major record label; ''we're waiting for someone to find us, I guess,'' Mr. Stookey said. ''We have a record's worth of new material to perform, and at most concerts a third to a half of the material we do is brand new, created within the last year and a half.'' (At current concerts, the group offers for sale a single written by Mr. Stookey - ''El Salvador.'') Trio members have gone on fact-finding missions to Central America, the Soviet Union and elsewhere; over the past week, they have accompanied politicians on visits to shelters for the homeless in New York City to draw attention to the problem. ''What can Peter, Paul and Mary do in the context of homelessness?'' Mr. Yarrow said. ''Well, we have a platform now. It's been 25 years, and we've been made responsible, in a way, by our research and our serious commitment. ''I think folk music is terrific,'' he concluded. ''I think classical music is terrific, too; I played the violin when I was a kid. But when I saw that music can activate energies and articulate thoughts and be a vehicle for people to move forward - when I saw it as a unifying force, I said, 'That's for me - I want to do that.' And that's why I'm still doing it, 25 years later.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS; KING TESTS WATERS UPSTATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/nyregion/politics-king-tests-waters-upstate.html,"IN A year when more prospective candidates have been dropping out of races than entering them, Nassau County Comptroller Peter T. King is the only nonincumbent Republican actively campaigning to get on the party's state ticket for November. Mr. King has started the preliminary campaigning, mostly upstate where he is little known, that he hopes will lead to his selection to challenge Attorney General Robert Abrams when the Republican State Committee designates its statewide ticket in early June. In the meantime, Mr. King is going through the classic ritual of a candidate who barely registers on the political Richter scale outside Nassau County. He is attacking the Democratic incumbent, which gets him some press attention. He is displaying his political wares to Republican Party leaders at breakfasts, lunches, dinners and other meetings. He is even attempting to appeal to what he calls ''traditional Democrats'' - mostly conservative and Roman Catholic -by his positions against abortion and for the death penalty. These positions also presumably would make him acceptable to the Conservative and Right to Life Parties, although neither party has yet endorsed any statewide candidates. On a recent day in Buffalo Mr. King went through the campaign rituals he will be performing with increasing frequency. He appeared on an early-morning television interview program, had a news conference in midmorning, met with officials of the police union and had lunch with the Erie County Republican Chairman, Victor Farley, and other Republican leaders from western New York. Then there were several radio interviews and meetings with the two top Republican officials in Erie County, Mayor James D. Griffin of Buffalo, a maverick Democrat who has criticized Governor Cuomo, and County Executive Edward Rutkowski, a Republican. The day's events were what is known as touching the political and media bases. ''It's a different world,'' Mr. King said as he echoed other downstate politicians, who are often amazed at the media attention they get upstate compared with the New York City area, where there are far more politicians competing for public attention. Mr. King, a 41-year-old lawyer from Seaford, has not formally announced his candidacy yet because, he said, party leaders have asked him not to so as not to point up the fact that the Republicans are still searching for a candidate for governor. The gubernatorial candidate will be the key to putting together a Republican ticket with at least some ethnic, religious and geographic attractions - factors that could be an important consideration in whether Mr. King is the eventual Republican nominee for attorney general. At the moment, the Republican ticket would appear to be very heavily tipped toward the suburbs. Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke is generally considered the most likely Republican candidate for governor, although he is hardly champing at the bit. Two Republican incumbents who will be seeking re-election, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, are also suburbanites, from Nassau and Westchester respectively, although Mr. Regan's original political base was Buffalo. That leaves only the lieutenant governor and attorney general posts to be filled, and Mr. King's identification with suburbia and the fact that both he and Senator D'Amato are Nassau residents could be a drawback to his candidacy, Republican leaders said. What Mr. King has going for him, however, is that he is willing to take on Mr. Abrams, who is considered a strong vote getter. In addition, Mr. King is the product of a Nassau Republican organization that is respected in Republican circles - an affluent operation that represents a county that in recent years has usually produced the largest vote of any county in the state on Election Day. Nassau and Suffolk Counties together now account for about a sixth of the overall state vote. Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau Republican chairman, has already sent two letters praising Mr. King to Republican county leaders around the state. Four years ago, the Republicans picked a political unknown, Frances Sclafani, then an assistant Suffolk district attorney, as the party's attorney general candidate. This year, Mr. King and Senator D'Amato are the only Long Islanders seeking places on the Republican ticket. Presiding Supervisor Thomas S. Gulotta of the Town of Hempstead was viewed as a potential state candidate but he said he was not interested. Until now, Mr. King, who is also a party leader as a member of the executive committee of the Nassau Republican organization, was best known outside Nassau as a strong advocate of civil rights for Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland. He has said that if he becomes the Republican nominee he hopes that Irish-American groups will play an important role in his campaign, just as other ethnic and fraternal groups have been of considerable importance in the campaigns of other candidates, including Governor Cuomo, in the past. Mr. King said he is challenging Mr. Abrams because he thinks the Attorney General is vulnerable and too liberal. He has criticized the incumbent's silence on the Gary McGivern clemency case. Governor Cuomo recommended clemency for Mr. McGivern, who was serving a prison term for participation in the murder of a deputy sheriff, but the clemency proposal was rejected by the State Parole Board. The Ulster County District Attorney who prosecuted Mr. McGivern, Michael Kavanagh, has been highly critical of the Governor and is considered a potential Republican statewide candidate and possibly a competitor for Mr. King's bid for attorney general. Mr. King has also reiterated criticism by Ronald Goldstock, the Special State Prosecutor for Organized Crime, that Mr. Abrams is more concerned with producing press releases than with prosecuting organized crime figures. Mr. Abrams has said that he remained silent in the McGivern case because he had no role in the matter. Mr. Goldstock has since withdrawn his criticism of Mr. Abrams. Campaign funds will be a key problem for Mr. King, who has said he hopes to raise $1.5 million. But in his two races for Nassau Comptroller and, before that, in a race for Hempstead Town Councilman, he has never raised more than $40,000, he acknowledged. Republican politicians said the Nassau Republican Party will have to put its fund-raising muscle at Mr. King's disposal if he is to raise a substantial amount. Any fund raising at the moment is hindered, however, by the widespread perception that Mr. Abrams is a formidable candidate who will be hard to defeat. Contributors do not like to join losing causes. That could change, however, not so much because of any keen criticism of Mr. Abrams but rather the possibility that the Governor might turn to Mr. Abrams as the lieutenant governor candidate. That would leave the attorney general race without an incumbent with a built-in head start. Such a development might not be a total blessing for Mr. King, however. The lack of an incumbent and thus the prospect of a tighter race could attract other Republicans to the attorney general contest, thus giving Mr. King competition in his own party. If Mr. Abrams seeks re-election, Mr. King might get the nomination without much fuss, if for no other reason than he is the only willing candidate so far. If he should lose to Mr. Abrams, however, all might not be lost, Nassau politicians noted. Mr. King would retain his present post and gain exposure and experience for a likely contest with Mr. Gulotta for the Republican nomination for Nassau County Executive in 1989.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
O'ROURKE LOOKS AT GUBERNATORIAL ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/nyregion/orourke-looks-at-gubernatorial-issues.html,"COUNTY Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who last week continued to weigh the decision of whether he wanted to be the Republican candidate seeking to unseat Governor Cuomo in November, has begun to address some of the issues he believes should be raised in the campaign. ''Whoever runs against Cuomo is going to have plenty of ammunition,'' Mr. O'Rourke said during an interview in which he discussed the shifting of state responsibilities to municipalities, the distribution of hydroelectric power, abortion and the death penalty. Close associates of Mr. O'Rourke said last week that the County Executive had been persuaded to delay announcing his candidacy until after the county Republican dinner on Thursday, so as not to upstage the guest speaker, Vice President George Bush. State and national Republican officials have indicated that the nomination is Mr. O'Rourke's if he wants it. Although he declined in the interview to divulge whether he wanted the nomination, Mr. O'Rourke noted that ''there are plenty of differences'' between himself and Mr. Cuomo. ''The Governor's apparent popularity now is while he's not running against anyone and while no one is talking about issues to confront him,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. As County Executive, Mr. O'Rourke has criticized Mr. Cuomo for a lack of hydroelectric power in Westchester and the downstate region, and he said that he was ''sure that would be an issue in any campaign.'' While some say that a call for hydroelectric power redistribution will be unpopular in some parts of the state, Mr. O'Rourke said that ''it depends on how it is packaged.'' ''There are ways of redistributing the power,'' he said. ''What bothers me is that over 60 percent of the legislators come from New York City, and I don't think a bill has ever been introduced to do anything to help the situation.'' Mr. O'Rourke said that the Republican candidate ''will talk about the welfare mess that exists in New York State'' and about ''the fact that as we lose more and more aid from various places, we still have this huge, cumbersome network of regulations that prevents us from even spending our own money wisely.'' Some State Democratic officials, anticipating his candidacy, have charged that Mr. O'Rourke has increased taxes in Westchester while Mr. Cuomo has lowered state taxes. Mr. O'Rourke said, however, that the state's surplus, which allowed for lower taxes, was created ''from the backs of localities,'' the result of shifting responsibilities to the municipalities and forcing them to find additional revenues. ''I wouldn't even campaign on that issue,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''If somebody said, did you raise taxes, I'd say, sure. To run a government, if you need to do that, you raise taxes. The people who run on lowering taxes -no one believes that. Nobody believes things go down unless somebody is paying for it somewhere. If you have a surplus in your house, either you got a raise somewhere or you cut back on something. It's got to come from somewhere.'' As an example, he cited the state requirement that the county house prisoners who, he said, should be in state institutions. ''I don't want the state to use our prison as a holding jail so that they don't have to build another jail,'' he said. He noted that the state reimbursement rate is $20 a day while it costs the county $80 a day to provide for these prisoners. ''Millions of dollars of county money has gone to feed and house state prisoners without so much as a 'thank you' from the State of New York,'' he said. ''It's things like that that bother me.'' He said that if state officials would ''do their job and tax for their job and not force us to tax for their job, we have enough assets in Westchester County to run our own house.'' If the state assumed what Mr. O'Rourke called its legitimate duties, would personal taxes then be increased? ''I think what you have to do is look at the whole picture,'' he said. ''New York has lost people, has lost businesses, and it is the total tax picture that gets people. There are efficiencies that should be built into government that I'm not prepared now to say weren't done, but apparently look as though they weren't done.'' Mr. O'Rourke said a special commission should have been created to investigate the ''whole mess in New York City,'' a reference to the recent disclosures of corruption among city officials. Mayor Koch has ''done great things for New York City,'' Mr. O'Rourke said, but added that public confidence has been ''shaken.'' He said that if he were governor, he would have appointed such a commission and he wondered aloud why Mr. Cuomo had not taken that step. ''The people of New York deserve that kind of response,'' he said. Mr. O'Rourke, who personally opposes abortion, said that he, unlike Mr. Cuomo, ''would be against Medicaid funding of abortion.'' ''I've said that often,'' he noted. ''I wouldn't change that. People would have to accept me on that basis.'' Mr. O'Rourke also restated his longstanding support of the death penalty for first-degree murder: ''We never should have got rid of it in the first place.'' Saying he did not know if reinstatement of the death penalty would act as a deterrent to crime, he explained: ''I think society has a right to demand a grave punishment for grave crimes committed against society. And a death of a human being is the gravest of crimes and I would think that society has a right to demand the death penalty.'' Mr. Cuomo has consistantly vetoed bills that would reinstate the death penalty. Mr. Cuomo is often mentioned as a contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988, and Mr. O'Rourke said that one of the Governor's ''major problems'' in getting re-elected was that ''he is running for two jobs at the same time.'' ''He's going to get schizoid having to concern himself with what he says in Westchester or in New York State and what its national implications are,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. Discussing how an O'Rourke candidacy would affect the operations of the county's government, the County Executive said: ''All of us have to concern ourself with our ability to do the job that we're elected to. I think obviously on an economy-of-scale basis it's easier to be County Executive and run for Governor than it is to be Governor and run for President of the United States. ''If you are a decentralizing person and have a good group working for you, that certainly makes it easier if you're away,'' Mr. O'Rourke said, referring to his own style of administration. ''I believe in a command-like structure,'' he explained. ''The people that work for the County of Westchester wouldn't be working here if I didn't have confidence in their ability. So they run their departments with a minimum amount of interference from me - certainly nothing like a day-to-day oversight - and I get involved as a problem-solver, as a setter of policy.'' He noted that as chairman of the Board of Legislators, he had had no difficulty with his predecessor, Alfred B. DelBello, running for Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ticket in 1982. After Mr. DelBello's election to that position, Mr. O'Rourke was named County Executive. In 1983 he was elected to fill out the remaining two years of Mr. DelBello's term and last November he was elected to a full four-year term. ''I like to believe, and I do believe, that I'm important to the running of the County of Westchester,'' he said. ''However, I know that the county would survive if I didn't make it home tonight, and that part of that survival is based on the good, solid underpinning of people in Westchester County. I think I've made a difference in Westchester. But it isn't a difference that Westchester wouldn't survive if I went somewhere else, if I got out of office.'' Calling himself a ''good crisis manager,'' Mr. O'Rourke cited ''strikes and earthquakes and hurricanes and Indian Point and the Mianus Bridge'' as examples of challenges he had met. ''We run a bipartisan government,'' he added. ''We don't look at people's party registrations when we hire them. And I've been interested in the kinds of things I think people are interested in, whether its welfare reform or the arts. I'm very happy with the record this administration has made.'' He said that some of the programs of which he was proud were inherited from the former administration. ''My feeling was there has to be continuity in government, and the good programs you keep,'' he said. ''The same thing would happen if I ran on the state level.'' Financing is believed to be the key variable in Mr. O'Rourke's decision about the candidacy. Although he emphasized the importance of ''the issues,'' Mr. O'Rourke conceded, ''if I go into this race, it will be because I believe that the money will be raised to run a credible campaign.'' He set a figure of at least $5 million. ''You certainly don't need $10 million,'' he said, alluding to what he said was the ''war chest'' Mr. Cuomo had amassed for a re-election bid. He said he expected his ''good friend,'' Senator Alphonse M. D'Amato, to campaign for him should he run and he hinted that President Reagan might make a personal appearance on behalf of an O'Rourke candidacy. Some political observers have suggested that if Mr. O'Rourke ran for Governor and lost, he would be the logical choice to run against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1988. ''You mean after getting the privilege of running against Cuomo, you get the privilege of running against Moynihan,'' Mr. O'Rourke said with a laugh. ''I mean, that isn't exactly the way to increase your longevity in this business.'' ''If you're saying, Does the party owe you something, I think they probably do,'' Mr. O'Rourke continued. ''But that doesn't really mean much. I can't think of anything the Republican Party has that I really want. There was a time that I was very interested in becoming a judge and I was thwarted by the party. They thought I was too independent. And that time has come and gone.'' He added: ''I never go into a race to lose. I've run 11 times and I've won 11 times, and that's a reasonable score. If I go into this race, it will be to win. It won't be to give the incumbent a sparring partner.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS; EVANGELISM AND A FIGHT WITH PERIL TO BOTH SIDES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/17/us/politics-evangelism-and-a-fight-with-peril-to-both-sides.html,"Last fall 50,000 copies of a fund-raising letter signed by the Democratic national chairman went out describing in typically partisan direct-mail language a potential Republican Presidential candidate ''too radical even for Ronald Reagan.'' If this man should be elected President, the letter warned, he would abolish public education, outlaw all abortions, set quotas for born-again Christians in Government jobs and begin ''a massive military buildup in preparation for an inevitable nuclear showdown with the Soviet Union.'' The Democratic chairman, Paul G. Kirk Jr. was referring to the Rev. Marion G. (Pat) Robertson, a 55-year-old fundamentalist evangelist from Virginia Beach, Va., whose Christian Broadcasting Network reaches 30 million cable television subscribers with a mixture of religious and family entertainment programs, including the ''700 Club, '' for which Mr. Robertson is the host. Rebuke From Evangelist The letter did not solve the Democratic National Committee's financial problems, but it did provoke a sharp rebuke from the evangelist. He dismissed Mr. Kirk's characterization of his views as ''utter nonsense,'' accused the Democratic chairman of ''virulent anti-Christian bigotry'' and challenged him to debate religion and politics on national television. This is a debate that some in both parties would like to avoid. For Democrats, it could risk reinforcing the cultural and political alienation from the Democratic Party that many evangelical Christians feel, especially in the South, a region crucial to the party's comeback strategy. Republicans, on the other hand, worry that it could cost them the support of young voters who are uneasy about the social agenda of the religious right. ''We have to walk a very careful line,'' said Edward J. Rollins, who directed Mr. Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984 and occasionally advises Mr. Robertson on political matters. ''Most of the young voters we had success with in 1984 were more libertarian than conservative. My preference is that we debate politics and not religion.'' Shift in Voting Detailed In his letter, Mr. Kirk said his staff's research showed that the votes of 22 million Christian fundamentalists ''shifted from a pro-Democratic 56-43 edge in 1976 to a 81-19 Republican sweep in 1984.'' Polls find most Christian fundamentalists vote for or against a candidate not on the basis of some narrow test but for many of the same complex reasons that sway other voters. But more than most voting groups, they seem sensitive to any candidate who is perceived as a threat to their values and views of American life. Despite the risks, some Democratic strategists view the Republican Party's relationship with the religious right as a vulnerability worth exploiting politically. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as part of its strategy for helping Democrats in this year's House elections, has produced radio and television commercials linking Republican candidates to the Rev. Jerry Falwell of Lynchburg, Va., one of the most controversial of the television evangelists who have crossed the line into politics. Falwell Runs Behind Fonda That Mr. Falwell has high negative ratings in public opinion polls is not disputed by either party, and Democratic strategists are urging their party's candidates, as one put it, to ''push the Falwell button'' in their campaigns. Mr. Falwell, who already has endorsed Vice President Bush for President in 1988, received a lower favorable rating than Jane Fonda, the actress and liberal activist, in a recent national public opinion poll conducted by Robert Teeter, Mr. Bush's poll-taker. ''If there is anything that puts a shudder into young voters, it's the right wing's social agenda,'' said Martin D. Franks, executive director of the committee. ''Until we figure out some better way to go after young people, I'm happy with this one.'' But in challenging Mr. Falwell or Mr. Robertson on the political front, Mr. Franks said: ''The key is to be precise enough to communicate to people that we're not opposing Christian evangelism but trying to make sure that extremism, whether it be religious or ideological, doesn't trample on the rights of others.'' Mr. Franks said that unlike Mr. Falwell, ''who makes my hair stand up when I see him on television,'' Mr. Robertson comes across as a more polished and less threatening figure. ''Anytime you have that message in a pretty box, it's a difficult problem,'' he said. 'A Very Positive Direction' Mr. Robertson said recently that he had not made up his mind whether to run for President in 1988, adding that ''things are moving in a very positive direction.'' In a recent Presidential preference poll of its subscribers, The Conservative Digest reported that Mr. Robertson was the choice of 19 percent of 2,400 respondents, second only to Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York at 26 percent. Mr. Bush came in third with 14 percent. More than any other potential Republican contender, Mr. Robertson hits the social issues that arouse and energize conservatives. Republican strategists are concerned that a Robertson candidacy could restrict the party's efforts to broaden its appeal by reigniting an emotional debate on such issues as abortion, school prayer and homosexuality. ''These are just not the kind of issues we need at the top of our agenda in '88,'' said one key Republican strategist. ''It comes down to the tolerance issue. The messenger is the key and I don't think evangelists are the best messengers of the Republican agenda.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHURCH AIDES SAY O'CONNOR MEANT NO THREAT TO COLLEGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/19/nyregion/church-aides-say-o-connor-meant-no-threat-to-college.html,"Officials of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York say John Cardinal O'Connor never meant to threaten to drop church support of a medical college affiliated with two city hospitals that perform abortions. An article in The New York Times March 10 reported that the Cardinal had said that if the hospitals, Lincoln and Metropolitan, did not stop performing abortions, New York Medical College would either have to give up its $24 million-a-year contract to supply them with medical services or drop its ties with the archdiocese. ''The choice for the college is either the church or the two hospitals,'' Cardinal O'Connor said in an interview at the time. ''Catholic principles and concepts of Catholic medical practice would be violated,'' he said then, ''and there is no way we could continue together.'' 'That Conflict Does Not Exist' On the day the article appeared, a spokesman for the archdiocese, the Rev. Peter G. Finn, said the college would not have to give up its affiliation contract. He said The Times's article ''gave an indication of a conflict,'' but that ''in fact that conflict does not exist, not as far as the city, nor the archdiocese, nor the medical college can determine.'' Asked to elaborate last Friday, Msgr. James P. Cassidy, director of health and hospitals for the archdiocese, said the Cardinal might have believed he was responding to a theoretical question. He said the Cardinal might also have been unfamiliar with all the details of the seven-year-old affiliation contract between the school and the hospitals. ''You could set up a theoretical case about what should be done and what shouldn't be done and then apply them any way you want,'' Monsignor Cassidy said. ''You can't expect the Cardinal to know every detail of affiliation.'' The archdiocese helped rescue the medical college from financial failure eight years ago, and the college is contemplating strengthening its association with the archdiocese as a means of improving its fund-raising capabilities. The college has been affiliated with the two city hospitals since 1979 under a contract that specifically requires that any abortions be performed by outside physicians so the college's medical staff and teaching faculty will not be involved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEW JERSEY OPINION; HUMANITARIAN ACTS CAN HAVE UNFORESEEN RESULTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-humanitarian-acts-can-have-unforeseen-results.html,"WE OFTEN act in ways that we think are humane yet that turn out later to have consequences that cause suffering. This happens in our personal lives but, more importantly, in social policies, too. ''More importantly'' because social policies can affect the lives of thousands, even millions. Let me present some examples from very different areas: IMMIGRATION When refugees flee from countries such as Haiti or Cuba, it seems humane to accept these immigrants. How could we do otherwise? Yet the consequences of accepting, even encouraging, immigrants from such countries means that the government of the country gets rid of its dissidents. Most of those who might overthrow an oppressive regime are now in some less-oppressive country, becoming citizens of a new homeland. FAMINE People in various nations have experienced famine again and again. When a new country receives attention from the press, there is a flood of help. And then the focus passes. We are concerned about Ethiopia, but we have forgotten Uganda. What does the food do? It prolongs the survival of people for a month, or a year or more. What quality does their life have? Probably incredible suffering, near starvation, unemployment, hopelessness. Typically, little is done to help the country increase its food production or to encourage birth control, steps that might alleviate the problem in the future. PSYCHIATRIC EXCUSES Dr. Seymour Halleck, a psychologist and the author of ''The Politics of Therapy,'' has repeatedly shown how giving people psychiatric excuses for special consideration prevents reform. For example, the fact that the rich and the educated could find doctors to provide psychiatric reasons for a legal abortion meant that these people had no need to press for reforms. But the rich and the educated were the very people who could press for and achieve reforms. Dr. Halleck makes the same point about providing psychiatric excuses to avoid military service, and he has given an example from his work at a university: To get out of a dormitory contract, a student needed a psychiatric reason. Dr. Halleck regularly provided such excuses until he saw that, by letting the dissatisfied leave the dormitories, he was preventing reform. He stopped granting psychiatric excuses. Within a year, a tenant group had pressed for and obtained important changes in living conditions. STREET PEOPLE Mental hospitals are not the best places for people to live in. Being in an institution leads to mental deterioration and various kinds of pathlogical behavior (similar, in fact, to that seen in caged animals in a zoo). It seemed humane to release people from such institutions, but what was the result? A major result was that these former patients were physically and psychologically abused by the owners of the halfway houses in which they stayed; they preferred to wander the streets alone. Now we have thousands of street people huddled over hot-air vents in the winter. Is this better? Many other analagous examples could be given. What often seems to be a quick, humane solution to a problem can lead to greater suffering in the future - consequences that we failed to anticipate. We are humane. But often in being so, we cause suffering. And too often we have moved on to a new humane project so that we do not see the suffering we have caused.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS; SHOREHAM KEY TO SPECIAL VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/nyregion/politics-shoreham-key-to-special-vote.html,"THE political potency of the Shoreham nuclear power plant issue is evident as the campaign for a special election for the Suffolk County Legislature begins in the Smithtown-Brookhaven area. Both major-party candidates -Barbara Barnett, the Democrat, and Donald Blydenburgh, the Republican - are also running on second lines on the voting machine: ad hoc anti-Shoreham and anti-Long Island Lighting Company parties. The parties were set up specifically to reinforce the candidates' anti-Shoreham positions and give the major-party candidates another line on the ballot in the May 6 special election. After that, the parties will fade away until the next election. Republicans set up their special line, Concerned Citizens Against Lilco, to counter the special Democratic line, Ratepayers Against Lilco, which polled as many as 1,000 votes each for Democratic candidates for the County Legislature last year. The identification of Democrats with opposition to Lilco's effort to open its Shoreham plant, which is completed but which has not received a Federal commercial operating license, was viewed by many politicians as a substantial factor in Democratic successes last November. The 18-member County Legislature is now almost evenly divided - with eight Democrats, seven Republicans and two Conservatives. The special election is to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of a Republican, Donald Allgrove of Smithtown, who has moved out of the state because his wife is ill. He defeated Mrs. Barnett by about 900 votes in the general election last November The Shoreham issue was also the critical factor in the decision by the Conservative Party to foresake its usual alliance with the Republicans and run its own candidate, Anthony DiPerna, in the special election. Mr DiPerna is a retired school administrator and an adjunct profesor at St. John's University. Harold Haar, the Smithtown Conservative Party chairman, said the party could not support Mr. Blydenburgh because of his anti-Shoreham stance. Mr. DiPerna supports opening the plant. The Right to Life Party cooperated with the Republicans, according to officials in both parties, by not nominating Mr. Blydenburgh. A candidate is entitled to no more than two lines on the voting machine, and Smithtown Republicans said they saw Shoreham as a more potent issue than abortion. However, Ken Diem, the Right to Life Party leader in Smithtown, said the party would nevertheless campaign for Mr. Blydenburgh. Another important factor in the special election will be the position of the popular Smithtown Supervisor, Patrick R. Vecchio, a Democrat who has won consistently in a Republican town and now presides over a town board that is 4-to-1 Democratic. Mr. Vecchio has cultivated an independent image to the point of often battling with his own Democratic Party and appointing Republicans, like Mr. Blydenburgh, to town offices. Mr. Blydenburgh is the Town Attorney. Smithtown Democrats have asked Dominic J. Baranello, the Suffolk Democratic chairman, to persuade Mr. Vecchio to campaign actively for Mrs. Barnett, an environmentalist and community activist. She is a member of the Smithtown Conservation Board. Mr. Vecchio was reported by his office to be on vacation and unavailable for comment. He is considered a potential candidate for Suffolk County Executive next year and thus possibly susceptible to Baranello pressure. Whatever the outcome of the special election, Gregory J. Blass, the newly elected Presiding Officer of the County Legislature, will retain his post for the next two years. He was elected by teaming up with Mr. Allgrove and the Democrats over the opposition of William M. Blake, the Suffolk Republican leader. Mr. Allgrove's reward was the No. 2 position in the County Legislature, Deputy Presiding Officer. Mr. Blass, prodded by Mr. Blake, attempted to have a Republican elected as his deputy, but Democratic legislators forced the election of the senior Democratic legislator, John J. Foley of Blue Point. ''Greg is always talking about fusion government,'' said Philip Nolan of Islip, the Democratic minority leader of the County Legislature. ''I'd like to see the performance match the rhetoric.'' The election of Mr. Blass and Mr. Foley, largely as a result of Democratic votes, indicates the unusual division in the Legislature, where an ostensible Republican-Conservative majority cannot work its will. That split may be further aggravated after the May 6 special elect-ion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out-of-Wedlock Births Found Rising in State,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/24/nyregion/out-of-wedlock-births-found-rising-in-state.html,"One in four babies was born out of wedlock in New York in 1984, an increase of 4.8 percent from 1983, according to a report on vital statistics issued today by the State Health Department. A spokesman for the department said the figures were the latest available. Of the babies born in 1984, 67,843 or 27.1 percent were born out of wedlock, the report said. The greatest increases in out-of-wedlock births occurred among older women; women 35 to 39 and 25 to 29 showed increases of 10.1 and 7.4 percent, respectively, in the number of out-of-wedlock births. The report said there were 250,426 live births, a 0.9 percent rise from 1983; 152,486 abortions, a 1.4 percent drop; 14,432 miscarriages, a 2.6 percent decline, and 2,729 deaths of infants less than a year old, a 4.4 percent decrease. The report said there was a 1.1 percent rise in the number of New Yorkers under 5, a 3 percent decrease in the number 5 to 19 years old and a 0.8 percent increase in those 60 and older. The comparison was with 1983 figures. The population of the state was estimated at 17,529,100 in 1984. New York City had 7,108,800 inhabitants or 40.6 percent of the state's population. There were 167,614 marriages, an increase of 3.2 percent, compared to 1983.

A Revolution Looms In American Health,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/opinion/a-revolution-looms-in-american-health.html,"The revolution in the American way of health will be as profound and turbulent as any economic and social upheaval our nation has experienced. At stake are not only billions of dollars but who lives, who dies - and who decides. Science serves up biomedical breakthroughs that hold the promise of miraculous cures and the threat of unacceptable costs. The aging of the population - in the first quarter of the next century 60 million Americans will be over 65 - signals the dawn of the four-generation society, in which it will soon be common to have two generations of the same family in retirement, on Medicare, receiving Social Security and nursing care. In law and religion, a confounding mix of issues bewilders our judges and theologians. At the same time, the spirited air of competition is for the first time swirling through the health industry. Fed up with years of waste, the big buyers of care - governments, corporations and unions - are demanding the facts, changing the way doctors, hospitals and other providers are used and paid, and reshaping financial incentives that have encouraged patients to seek unnecessary care. And a host of new health care providers is scrambling to get their business. The early signs are encouraging: hospital admissions, lengths of stay, and occupancy rates dropped in 1984 and again in 1985. Medicare, which many feared would go bust by the early 1990's, looks solvent until late in that decade. Cigarette consumption has been going down. But the facts make it clear that the health care revolution is just beginning. And the facts are startling enough to shake up even the most complacent purchaser of health care. Item. When doctors don't have to get advance approval, 20 percent to 25 percent of the patients they admit to hospitals shouldn't be, and those who should are kept there for too many $500 days. Largely by requiring that all non-emergency, nonmaternity hospital stays be approved in advance by a second medical opinion, the Chrysler Corporation cut $100 million from its health care bills over the past three years and provided its employees with better care. Item. Corporate and government health programs are paying as much as $60 billion for medical procedures that are unrelated to the health needs of patients. With no apparent difference in health status, residents in three Massachusetts communities -Fairhaven, Fitchburg and Framingham - are 15 times more likely to have their tonsils removed than residents of other areas in the state where antibiotics are used to treat tonsillitis at far less cost. The rate of major cardiovascular surgery is twice as high in Des Moines as in Iowa City for patients with the same symptoms - and with no noticeable difference in health results. A comprehensive study of 4.4 million Medicare beneficiaries has further documented the erratic geographic variations in medical practice. Item. Those who go to fee-for-service doctors are twice as likely to have coronary bypass surgery as those who belong to health maintenance or-ganizations - and four times more likely than their European and Candian counterparts - for no apparent reason except that fee-for-service doctors receive payments to make repairs rather than payments to keep us healthy. Item. A relatively small number of patients account for a large proportion of health costs. More than 30 percent of Medicare's money goes to patients with less than a year to live. In 1984, a mere 3.4 percent of Chrysler's insured accounted for 43.5 percent of the company's health care payments. These high cost cases often involve chronic or terminal illnesses and more often than not are related to life styles. Millions of dollars can be saved, and pointless anguish avoided, by using home health and hospice care and by promoting healthier life styles. Item. The cockeyed malpractice system costs far more than the $4-plus billion in premiums last year. Billions more are wasted on tests by doctors anticipating possible lawsuits. Item. Medical technology makes it possible to provide, at home and in the doctor's office, diagnosis and treatment (for example, chemotherapy, dialysis, intravenous therapies and feeding) that once could be delivered only in a hospital. Today, nurses can perform many tasks once reserved for doctors, such as examining, diagnosing and treating many wounds and sprains and common ailments. Early results of a Memorial Sloan-Kettering program indicate that many cancer patients can be treated just as effectively on an outpatient basis as in the hospital. Item. Each of us can do more for our own health than any hospital, doctor, medicine or drug. Smoking has killed and maimed more Americans than all our wars and automobile accidents combined. Alcoholism and alcohol abuse is the No. 4 disease in America. More than half of the dramatic 25 percent decline in deaths from heart disease over the past 15 years is attributable to changes in diet and quitting smoking. A program at Johnson & Johnson encouraging employees to quit smoking and eat and exercise properly has slashed absenteeism by 20 percent and hospitalization by 35 percent, recapturing three times the cost of the company's effort. If the big buyers of health care act on these facts, in less than 10 years we can have a health care system efficient enough to provide higher quality care for all, at the same price we are paying for a ''sick care'' system that leaves 33 million Americans without adequate care. Half the hospital beds can be closed down in less than 10 years. The number of doctors, particularly specialists, can be sharply curtailed. Their monopoly over the practice of medicine can be eased to allow paraprofessionals to provide many medical services just as competently and far less expensively. Government and private insurance programs can cover more care in the home and the doctor's office. Instead of paying doctors a fee for each service to treat us after we are sick, corporate and government purchasers can pay doctors an annual fee to keep us healthy or a pre-set fee-for-illness if we do get sick. Individuals can be given financial incentives to pursue healthy life styles. Those who smoke, don't keep their weight and cholesterol levels in acceptable ranges, and miss periodic medical or dental checkups, can be charged more. The medical malpractice system can limit recovery to a modest amount for pain and suffering, and to the amounts necessary to pay medical bills, replace lost income or compensate for the inability to function because of disability. Lawyers' contingent fees can be sharply cut. For doctors, malpractice reform can begin at home with strengthened disciplinary systems that clean out incompetents, Lots more information can be given to purchasers of health care: how much hospitals and doctors charge, how often they treat different ailments and perform various medical and surgical procedures, what their drug-dispensing practices are, how often doctors put patients in hospitals and how long they keep them there. At this stage in the revolution, the private sector holds the key to success. Politicians who must pander for private contributions for their election campaigns can't stand up to the clout and money of the hospitals, medical equipment manufacturers and physicians. But corporate America has discovered that the health industry takes a huge bite from profits. It has also discovered that it can offer employees better care at far less cost. If we fail to create an efficient health care system, we will also find ourselves involved in a debate over death control - who lives and who dies - far nastier than the controversy over abortion, and end up with government bureaucrats deciding who gets the next heart or kidney, hip or knee operation, and who is entitled to expensive anticancer therapy. The debate over death control could pit sons and daughters against parents and grandparents. And unlike fetuses, the old can speak and vote. The uncertainties are not in knowing what to do, not in science, not in economics. The uncertainties lie in our ability to discipline ourselves and in our will to act with courage and compassion. A health care system as efficient and fair as it is miraculous is at long last within our reach, if we have the daring and persistence to finish the revolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Working Profile: Patrick J. Buchanan; Eating Lightning Bolts and Liking the Taste,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/us/working-profile-patrick-j-buchanan-eating-lightning-bolts-and-liking-the-taste.html,"Seated in shirtsleeves in a cramped, windowless office only yards from the Oval Office, Patrick J. Buchanan recalls that his fierce conservatism is steeped in a Washington family that is, improbably, even more conservative than he is. One of his closest relatives, says the White House communications director, has three political heroes: Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Gen. Francisco Franco and Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur. ''I guess I'm a leftist deviationist compared to that,'' said Mr. Buchanan, laughing. Hardly. Within the last year, the provocative 46-year-old former columnist, radio commentator and aide to President Nixon has adhered to a conservatism that has privately distressed some aides to Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, and publicly angered even some Republican legislators. Most recently, they contend, Mr. Buchanan cost the White House votes when he suggested that legislators were siding with Communism by opposing the Reagan Administration's $100 million aid package for the anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua. The House rejected the aid proposal last Thursday 222-210. 'No Policy to Defend' ''Nonsense - that's silly,'' answered Mr. Buchanan. ''The Democrats attacked Pat Buchanan because they are not comfortable attacking the President. They spent two weeks defending their patriotism, which no one contests, because they have no policy to defend. The point is, the liberals who are now beginning to concede we have a cancer in Central America have no policy of their own for dealing with it.'' Within the White House, Mr. Buchanan oversees speechwriting and communication and has carried on an aggressive battle with Mr. Regan and his staff over Presidential approaches to various issues. He favors a forceful anti-Communist, pro-military stance on international matters and an economically and socially conservative stance on domestic matters, opposing abortion and favoring sanctioned school prayer, for example. His batting average remains about 50-50. He argued, for example, against imposing limited sanctions against South Africa, but lost. He strongly favored a Presidential veto on emergency farm credit legislation last year, and won. Last September he endorsed a strong free-trade, anti-protectionist speech by Mr. Reagan, and in November he helped write a toughly worded anti-Soviet speech before Mr. Reagan's trip to Geneva to meet Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. In both these instances, Mr. Buchanan was overruled by the chief of staff in favor of more accommodating oratory. But on the dominant foreign policy issue of the moment, Nicaragua, Mr. Buchanan's oratory seems to mirror the strongly held views of Communism that have marked Mr. Reagan's political career. In spite of the White House loss last week, Mr. Buchanan and others are convinced that a Senate vote this week and a scheduled reconsideration of rebel aid legislation in the House will turn the tide in favor of the Administration. Among Republicans who have openly criticized Mr. Buchanan for his uncompromisingly tough words is Representative Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin. ''It's Pat Buchanan's comments that every Democrat tells me about,'' he said before the House vote on rebel aid last Thursday. ''If we lose today, it will be his fault.'' Mr. Buchanan brushes aide the criticisms that he was ''red-baiting'' on the Nicaragua issue in an article he wrote for The Washington Post and seeking to engage in a scare campaign that may have backfired. ''Look, Pat Buchanan is a lighting rod,'' he said. ''They've had various lighting rods. Don Regan was the lightning rod last fall. I'm a man of some controversy. I'm enjoying every bit of it.'' In the article, he said the vote on rebel aid would reveal whether the Democratic Party stood with Mr. Reagan or with Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Nicaraguan leader, and the Communists. On Capitol Hill, Democrats and even such Republicans as Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas were outraged. ''The only two individuals whose motivation has been challenged by name are Pat Buchanan and Ronald Reagan,'' said the White House communications director. ''I haven't mentioned the name of a single Democrat.'' ''Nicaragua is an issue which engages the heart as well as the mind,'' he said. ''It's an issue of Communism versus anti-Communism. It is perceived by both on our side and the other side as a moral issue, an issue of right and wrong, and on issues like this emotions run deep and passions run deep and strong. We recognize this, but we have no apologies. I wouldn't change a single syllable of what I wrote.'' A gifted talker, Mr. Buchanan said he was convinced that the Administration would ultimately persuade the American people and Congress about the dangers of Nicaragua and the need to support the rebels. ''I look at it like this,'' he said. ''We're like a group of doctors here. We're sitting down and looking at a patient we want to save. What we've been saying early on is, 'Gentlemen, all the symptoms are there - this is cancer.' And what the other side is saying is, 'Look, this is a tumor, but it's not cancerous.' And I think as more and more of the evidence comes in, more and more Democrats and Republicans will come to believe that these people who told us it was cancer appear to be right.'' 'I Have No Departure Date' Mr. Buchanan said that, despite periodic rumors that he was unhappy at the White House, he had no plans to leave. ''I'm really enjoying it now,'' he said. ''I have no departure date. I think there's a real potential for Ronald Reagan, who could be a great pivotal figure in American history.'' He compared Mr. Reagan with President Kennedy, whose leadership and style stirred young people and drew them into politics. ''Ronald Reagan is doing that for the conservative movement,'' he said. ''Reagan has given the conservative movement a touch of class, a touch of majesty, and never again will they be able to say the things they say about conservatives - because of Reagan, because of his policies, because of the manner in which he carried himself. Reagan is a class act, and everyone knows it.'' On another subject, he said that his relations with Mr. Regan, at this point, were warm. ''I actually think he's pleased,'' he said, ''with his controversial choice of communications director.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BUDGET-BALANCING AMENDMENT LOSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/us/budget-balancing-amendment-loses.html,"In a dramatic loss for the Republican leadership and President Reagan, the Senate this evening barely defeated a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. The vote was 66 to 34 in favor, one vote short of the required two-thirds majority. Senators on both sides of the issue said approval in December of the new budget-balancing law, whose main Senate Republican sponsors were Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, was the key factor in the debate. Senators agreed that the new law allowed several past supporters of the amendment to vote no. The Senate had approved a budget-balancing amendment in 1982 by a vote of 69 to 31. Supporters called the loss today a severe blow and said the voters will need to change the makeup of the Senate this fall to give a chance of winning in 1987. Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, who like Mr. Reagan was a strong supporter of the amendment, shook his head in disappointment as the roll-call ended with him unable to switch the one vote he needed to win. #2 G.O.P. Leaders Assailed Other Republicans who supported the amendment immediately criticized two members of their leadership who voted no. They were John Heinz of Pennsylvania and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, both of whom also voted no in 1982. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said, ''A lot of our senators who are up this year are very upset about it.'' Ten Republicans joined 24 Democrats in defeating the proposal. The other 43 Republicans and 23 Democrats voted yes. Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, criticized Mr. Reagan as making too few phone calls in lobbying for the amendment. ''Obviously he didn't make enough,'' Mr. DeConcini said after the vote. Mr. Reagan has had only limited success with other items on the conservative agenda that he began to push when he came into office, including abortion and school prayer. A supporter of the amendment, Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, said, ''Senators think Gramm-Rudman has passed and that will do the trick.'' Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, agreed. ''We have Gramm-Rudman - let's see how it works,'' he said. ''That's my rationale for not voting for it.'' #4 Switched to Oppose It The key votes that led to the defeat came from four Senators who voted yes in 1982 but voted no today. These were Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon and Robert T. Stafford of Vermont, both Republicans, and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota, both Democrats. Over the years, those pushing for a balanced budget amendment have lobbied state legislatures to call for a constitutional convention, and 32 of the required 34 have done so at one time or another. But no legislature has done so recently, with Kentucky being the most recent to balk. On March 11 the Kentucky House voted for a resolution calling on Congress to balance the budget but not for a constitutional convention. Republican leaders said this morning that they were still short of the two-thirds vote required to approve the amendment. But late in the day proponents were arguing that they had switched some votes. Supporters had already made changes in the proposal two weeks ago in an effort to win votes. In addition, supporters thought they had gained momentum with the support of Mr. Simon, who backed the proposal after the Judiciary Committee made a change in a provision for rises in revenue. Provisions of Proposal Under the amendment voted on today, tax laws could not changed to increase revenue unless approved by a majority of the whole House and the whole Senate. As Congress is currently constituted, this would require 51 senators and 218 representatives voting in favor. Under the provision won by Mr. Simon, however, there would be no year-to-year limit on how much revenue could increase based on normal economic growth, as opposed to through changes in the tax laws. Spending would not be allowed to exceed revenue in any year unless war was declared. It would take a three-fifths vote of the whole House and the whole Senate to approve a deficit in any year. The amendment would also require the President to submit a balanced budget and require a three-fifths vote of each house to raise the debt ceiling. Amendments to the Constitution are proposed either by a constitutional convention or by a two-thirds vote of the House and the Senate. They take effect only if ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures. Opponents such as Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, argued that the Constitution is not the place to set fiscal or economic policy. ''The Constitution is no place for Congressional graffiti,'' he said. Other opponents, like Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, said the amendment ignored the fact that Congress and the White House had not yet come close to agreeing on how to meet the $144 billion deficit ceiling for 1987 under the new budget-balancing law. ''What we and the President should be doing instead is agreeing on how we're going to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for the fiscal year breathing down our necks,'' Senator Cranston said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHOOSING AN ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/27/garden/l-choosing-an-abortion-022186.html,"TO THE HOME SECTION: Anna Quindlen's essay was excellent. And I say that despite the fact that I believe unequivocally that abortion is all wrong. I understand that many who do not believe as I do have gone through their own agonizing soul-searching and have arrived at a different conclusion. As a woman, a mother and a Catholic, I have been pained and dismayed by the bitterness generated by both pro- and antiabortion factions. We don't need two marches on Washington; we don't need two groups hurlng charges at one another. We need one group of concerned citizens that will work together to eliminate the poverty and hopelessness that contribute so mightily to the abortion picture. Few major issues are resolved by groups in which there is 100 percent consensus. Only by working together and by respecting the honest views of those who differ with us can we make progress toward a better society. Even as I write this, I recall that I was harshly criticized - by a friend who believes as I do about abortion -for suggesting that pro- and antiabortion forces must work together to eliminate the need for abortions.

6 ARRESTED AT ABORTION CLINIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/27/us/6-arrested-at-abortion-clinic.html,"Six protesters were arrested today after storming into an abortion clinic that was bombed twice in 1984. Equipment was damaged and two women were injured. ''It looked like a hurricane had gone through that building,'' said Lieut. A. O. Godwin of the police. According to the police, a local anti-abortion activist, John Burt, knocked down the manager of the Ladies Center clinic and a clinic volunteer when they tried to block his path into the building. ''They threw some equipment around and upended drawers,'' said Pat Jones, president of the Escambia County chapter of the National Organization for Women. Linda Taggart, the manager, and Georgia Wilde, a member of the local NOW chapter, were in stable condition with minor injuries at the West Florida Regional Medical Center, said a hospital spokesman, Laurie O'Brien. Mr. Burt, 48 years old, who was convicted of trespassing in a doctor's office last year, was charged with resisting arrest without violence, burglary and two counts of battery. His bail was set at $15,750. The center was bombed in June 1984 and in December 1984, the same day that the offices of two doctors who performed abortions were also bombed. Four young people were convicted in those bombings. In addition to Mr. Burt, those arrested today were his daughter Sarah, 18; Joan Andrews, 38, and John Haring, 40, both members of a Washington anti-abortion group; Karisa Epperley, 21, and Mary Dowdy, 25, both of Pensacola.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHOOSING AN ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/27/garden/l-choosing-an-abortion-022486.html,"TO THE HOME SECTION: I have rarely been impressed with the reasoning of those who, even marginally, oppose the right to choose abortion. They often do so with a hysteria that precludes understanding. However, Anna Quindlen's article [ Hers, March 13 ] was presented with such clarity and sincerity as to be beneficial to those on either side of the abortion issue. Ms. Quindlen has spoken eloquently for many of us. I wholeheartedly believe that many women are equally ambivalent. None of us loves the thought of abortion. Yet it will continue to be a reality, legal or no, as long as unwanted pregnancies continue to be a reality. Whether a woman thinks of an early pregnancy as ''a little blob of formless protoplasm'' or ''a complete human being in miniature'' will determine her level of ambivalence. However, her right to choose should never be contested. LEE ROTHBERG, R.N. Matawan, N.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCHOOLS' VIEWS SOUGHT ON PROPOSED VATICAN RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/28/us/schools-views-sought-on-proposed-vatican-rules.html,"The Vatican is seeking educators' comments on proposed rules designed to give the church greater control over what is taught and who teaches it in Roman Catholic colleges and universities around the world. The draft says, ''The ecclesial community feels the need that the Catholic character of her universities be more evident and powerful.'' It then proposes rules for faculties, for directing schools and for designing curriculums. From American Catholic educators, the response was near-unanimous opposition to many of the proposals, especially those dealing with faculty hiring and promotion. The paper says, for example, ''All teachers who are to be chosen, nominated and promoted in accordance with the statutes are to be distinguished by academic and pedagogic ability as well as by doctrinal integrity and uprightness of life.'' #28 Pages in the Report The 28-page report, ''Proposed Schema for a Pontifical Document on Catholic Universities,'' was drafted by the Vatican's agency for overseeing Catholic education and was released in April 1985. In defining the relationship between the church and Catholic universities, the document noted that the church had the power to strip schools of their designation as ''Catholic.'' The Vatican circulated the proposals to the 550 Catholic colleges and universities in the world and invited them to respond. In their replies, the American Catholic educators assert that the proposed rules could threaten academic freedom and jeopardize their schools' independence by imposing outside restrictions on professors and curriculums. Some American educators also contend that adherence to the proposals could jeopardize Federal aid to their colleges. Close to Unanimous, He Says David Johnson, associate director of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, which is coordinating American responses, said the reaction was ''close to unanimously opposed.'' The proposals ''could be a lot of trouble, a real lot of trouble,'' he said. In a response last month, the association summed up the objections of American schools and called for wide revisions. The association includes 235 schools, about 40 percent of all the Catholic institutions of higher education in the world. The most criticism, Mr. Johnson said, focused on the proposals on hiring and promotion of faculty members. 'Mandate' Is Specified As well as calling for the use of doctrinal and moral standards in evaluating teachers, the paper says: ''Those who teach theological studies in any institute of higher studies must have a mandate from the competent ecclesiastical authority.'' One question those provisions raise, according to Roger L. Flakey, professor of English at Georgetown, is whether a theology professor's mandate could be withdrawn if he or she favored legal abortion or use of artificial means of birth control. In such a case, Professor Flakey said, the ''competent ecclesiastical authority'' might demand a tenured professor's dismissal, while the school could feel compelled to honor the professor's tenure. Incident at Catholic University In a recent incident, the Vatican ordered the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a theology professor at the Catholic University of America, to retract his views on birth control and other issues or lose his church approval to teach. If Father Curran lost this approval, he would be barred from teaching in the theology department at the university. The Vatican can exercise such control over the theology, philosophy and canon law departments of Catholic University because it is chartered by the Vatican itself, Mr. Johnson said. But he said that if the proposals were adopted they would extend the Vatican's authority to these departments in all other Catholic schools. ''A professor at Georgetown or Notre Dame could run into exactly the same problem that Charlie Curran has,'' Mr. Johnson said. Michael Garvey, a spokesman for Notre Dame, said that the proposals were ''opaque'' and that it was not clear whether the church's control over the curriculum in Catholic universities generally could extend to all disciplines or only to theology, philosophy and canon law. Others have also worried that the church has attempted to control differing views too rigidly. An advertisement in the March 2 issue of The New York Times, for instance, condemned church ''reprisals'' against academics and activists who took positions contrary to the Vatican's. The 1,000 Catholics who signed the advertisement said such incidents were having a ''chilling affect'' on academic freedom in Catholic colleges. Further Antagonism Feared That prospect worries educators in those universities who complain that adoption of the new document could further antagonize Catholics already concerned about academic freedom in the church. ''It's difficult to resolve this tension between a Catholic university as a place of inquiry and as a representative of a larger body,'' said Mr. Garvey. Mr. Garvey said the document was ''full of fluffy statements about what it is to be a Catholic university.'' For example, he said, a statement that the curriculum should ''always take Catholic teaching into account'' was not clear. ''Is there a Catholic way to teach nuclear physics?'' he asked. A New School Supports Draft One school that has officially expressed its support for the proposals is Christendom College, a nine-year-old Catholic school in Front Royal, Va. Robert C. Rice, the academic dean of Christendom, acknowledged that the school was ''almost alone,'' but he said he thought other Catholic institutions were trying to ''have their cake and eat it too.'' ''They don't want to be bound by Catholic doctrine, but they still want to call themselves Catholic schools,'' Mr. Rice said. The document says, ''No university, even if it is in fact Catholic, may bear the title 'Catholic university' except by the consent of the competent ecclesiastical authority.'' That provision, according to Mr. Johnson, would give power to an authority outside the university, which most schools would be reluctant to do, since the universities tell the Government that their boards act as the final decision-makers. He said schools need to make such a pledge when they accept Federal financial aid. But Damian P. Fedoryka, president of Christendom College, disagreed. A Catholic school making a commitment to accept the counsel of an ecclesiastical authority, he said, would not jeopardize its Government financial aid because the board itself would voluntarily accept the authority of the church, rather than the church's exerting its authority over an unwilling board. 'Constitutional Context' Cited There were differing opinions among educators about why the church was circulating such a document now. Some cited the conflict between church and state in the Soviet bloc; others saw a drift of American schools toward more secular education as the cause. Others said the proposals were not out of line with Pope John Paul II's wishes to make the church more orthodox. The Rev. William J. Byron, president of Catholic University of America, said he believed any final draft would have to take account of the concerns of American schools. ''The constitutional context would have to be respected,'' he said. But Father Byron said it might be impossible to draft a single statement to encompass the differing situations of American universities and those in countries such as Poland. The differences will be aired at a conference in Rome tentatively scheduled for late this year or early in 1987, Mr. Johnson said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ST. AUGUSTINE, TOO, OPPOSED ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/29/opinion/l-st-augustine-too-opposed-abortion-264986.html,"To the Editor: In reply to Edgar Villchur (letter, March 15) on abortion and ''Augustinian Sense,'' St. Augustine held with all early Christian writers that abortion was unacceptable, but he was not certain when ensoulment took place. St. Augustine was unable to reach a definitive position on the origin of the soul: Traducianism (soul derives from parents) he regarded as a perverse theory that destroys the spiritual character of the soul; the creation of individual souls at conception seemed preferable to him. Commenting on Exodus 21:22 (Septuagint version), Augustine (''Quaest. in Exod.,'' 80) states: ''The Law does not provide that the act'' - loss of a fetus - ''pertains to homicide, because one cannot as yet say there is a live soul in that body deprived of feeling, if it is in a body not formed and therefore deprived of all feeling.'' Augustine is saying that there is no violation of the law when it is a question of homicide. But can one take the liberty to introduce Augustine here as a common sense-advocate for abortion? I think not. The Augustinian sense, the Christian sense, has always been: ''The one about to be born must always be considered as one already born.'' The first Judeo-Christian writings (Didache 2:2 and 5:2, and Letter of Barnabas 19:5) state: ''Do not take the life of the fetus by abortion: it is the work of God.'' (Rev.) RUSSELL J. DESIMONE Villanova, Pa., March 19, 1986 The writer is director of Villanova University's Augustinian Institute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RELIGIOUS BOOKS: SEVEN THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/books/religious-books-seven-that-made-a-difference.html,"''THE religious revival confronting us is . . . primarily a literary tour-de-force'' having ''very little to do with American life as a whole,'' William Phillips, the editor of Partisan Review, wrote in his magazine's 1950 symposium, ''Religion and the Intellectuals.'' It was a rash claim, and not just because the postwar revival ended up reaching well beyond those who had heard of T. S. Eliot. In a religious tradition that has been obsessed with texts ever since the Ten Command-ments, literary tours de force should not be taken lightly. In fact, religion in the West has gone in large measure by the book. This is not just a matter of the Book of Exodus and the Epistle to the Romans, or of St. Thomas Aquinas's ''Summa Theologica'' and John Calvin's ''Institutes of the Christian Religion.'' There are also the lesser texts - the saints' lives and the tracts and the popular theologies that capture a particular place and time and then quietly fade away. It is these above all that enable us to trace our common spiritual life. Which are the texts that signify the most? ''Of making many books there is no end,'' says Ecclesiastes. And no formula exists to pick the key ones out. Number of copies sold, influence regardless of sales, capacity to convey a current wisdom - all are relevant considerations. In the end, however, it comes down to deciding on the religious story that is there to tell. Since World War II, American religious sensibilities have run a winding course. What follows are seven books that seem to mark it out. Near the top of the best-seller list on Easter Sunday in 1949 was the autobiography of a sensitive young man with literary ambitions. A dust jacket testimonial from the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, the monsignor of the airways, proclaimed it ''a twentieth-century form of the 'Confessions' of St. Augustine,'' and indeed, Thomas Merton's ''Seven Storey Mountain'' bore some resemblance to that granddaddy of spiritual autobiographies. Like St. Augustine carousing his student days away in fourth-century Carthage, Merton had succumbed to such physical and intellectual debaucheries as New York offered a Columbia undergraduate in the 1930's: wine, women and some Communist fellow-traveling. ''I had refused to pay any attention to the moral laws upon which all our vitality and sanity depend,'' he wrote. ''I had at last become a true child of the modern world. . . . In devouring pleasures and joys, I had found distress and anguish and fear.'' A LONGING for religion, together with the discovery of medieval literature and philosophy, led him first to become a convert to Roman Catholicism and then to leave the world entirely and become a monk. ''The Christians are right, the pagans are wrong,'' sang the 11th-century ''Song of Roland''; the similarly blunt paean Merton raised to Catholicism triumphant was a far cry from the more ecumenical spirit of his later years. His book nonetheless exerted a more than Catholic appeal in the age of anxiety. Its title referred to the seven levels of purgatory through which Dante's tarnished souls had to struggle upward to Paradise; Merton's personal journey up from the leftish, godless 30's was only one of many. Among his fellow journeyers was Will Herberg, the prewar Marxist theorist who became a postwar theologian. A Jewish disciple of America's leading Protestant pundit, Reinhold Niebuhr, Herberg prescribed ''prophetic faith'' as the cure for the secular idolatries of the time (above all Communism); and in 1955 he published ''Protestant, Catholic, Jew,'' which he called an ''essay in religious sociology'' and in which he examined how such faith was faring in the United States. Herberg contended that ethnic divisions among Americans were disappearing for good, leaving behind only the ''triple melting pot'' of his book's title. At a time when large-scale immigration was thought to have ceased, and when ethnic particularity was less celebrated than it would come to be, this reformulation of American pluralism was both plausible and pleasing. What tensions there were among the churches Herberg attributed merely to the transition from a Protestant nation to a ''three-religion country''; a common anchorage in the American way of life would prevent religious conflict from getting out of hand. He was less sanguine, however, about the prospects for faith itself. Like other ''neo-orthodox'' religious thinkers, Herberg saw America as at once the most religious and the most secular of nations - enthusiastically churchgoing yet showing little evidence of actually living its several faiths. But wasn't this just what made for pluralistic toleration? Yes, he said, but what he hoped for was a deeper Judeo-Christian bond. Needed ''to transform the inner character of American religion,'' this ''authentic Jewish-Christian faith'' had less to fear from ''overt and avowed unbelief'' than from the secularized piety of ''the contemporary religious revival.'' With the characteristic ambivalence of social thought in the 50's, ''Protestant, Catholic, Jew,'' a book of religious sociology in the prophetic mode, ended up deploring the very way of life it had pronounced benign. A decade later Herberg's neo-orthodox conundrums were swept away by another socioprophetic book, ''The Secular City'' by Harvey Cox. In ebullient tones, Mr. Cox announced the good news that secularization, far from being the enemy of religion, represented ''an authentic consequence of biblical faith.'' Christians, he said, should ''support and nourish'' a process that disenchanted nature, desacralized politics and deconsecrated values. Growing up in rural Pennsylvania had immunized Mr. Cox to Protestant nostalgia for small-town churchly community. In his book he celebrated ''technopolis,'' where the living was free and mobile and the style pragmatic and profane. The church, to be ''where the action is,'' as he put it, needed to behave accordingly - coolly promoting social progress while exorcising prejudice and hidebound, unsecular thinking. Mr. Cox did not go as far as the radical theologians who had recently made headlines by proclaiming the death of God. Softening the proclamation, he merely declared a moratorium on God talk. Since, in the secular city, ''the political'' was replacing ''the metaphysical as the characteristic mode of grasping reality,'' it was only right for religious folk to drop theology and pick up urbanology. But Mr. Cox, like many a liberal professor in 1965, was less clear than he thought about the whereabouts of the action. His neosocial gospel for the New Frontier looked backward, not forward. By that time the mainstream reformism of the civil rights movement was already turning disconcertingly radical. And when it came to grasping reality in the late 60's, the metaphysical mode proved not so uncharacteristic after all. In 1968, the year the decade finally dislocated itself, the University of California Press brought out an ethnography unique in the annals of American academic publishing - Carlos Castaneda's ''Teachings of Don Juan.'' In it a graduate student in anthropology at the University of California at Los Angeles goes off to the Southwest to research a thesis on medicinal herbs and meets a Yaqui Indian said to be very learned in peyote. The Indian, who turns out to be a sorcerer, eventually accepts the student as his apprentice. Instructed in the preparation and use of several hallucinogenic plants, the student encounters a realm of ''non-ordinary reality'' where, among other things, he experiences several theophanic visions of Mescalito, peyote's personification. In the end, he terminates his quest to become ''a man of knowledge'' when it threatens to persuade him of the actual existence of this separate reality. BEING the diligent doctoral candidate he is, the student cannot abandon his skeptical Western self. Did this or that apparently impossible thing really happen to me? ''You cannot think like that,'' he is told; ''such a question makes no sense.'' Near the end of his four-year apprenticeship, he smokes a mushroom mixture and, becoming a crow, flies alongside three silvery birds. His master pronounces these birds the only thing of ''great value'' in the entire experience. ''What was so special about them? They were just birds.'' ''Not just birds - they were crows.'' ''Were they white crows, don Juan? . . . Why did their feathers look silvery?'' ''Because you were seeing as a crow sees. A bird that looks dark to us looks white to a crow.'' William James, in a famous image, once likened the demonstration of spiritualism to upsetting the law that all crows are black: ''It is enough if you prove one single crow to be white.'' Now it looked as if finding the white crow required not Jamesian science but an altered state of consciousness. Was the Yaqui sorcerer engaging in subtle repartee with the spirit of the Harvard professor? Not exactly, for Mr. Castaneda's ethnographic enterprise was in reality a fiction. General recognition of this, however, took some time. (Mr. Castaneda received his Ph.D. for the third Don Juan volume, ''Journey to Ixtlan,'' in 1973.) Meanwhile, the mythical don acquired millions of vicarious followers eager to keep up with his creator-disciple's trips outside the reality of President Nixon's America. At the same time Mr. Castaneda was leading the way into the brave new world of psychedelic anthropology, another figure on the U.C.L.A. campus was busy adapting his own calling to the age of Aquarius. A staff member of the local Campus Crusade for Christ, Hal Lindsey worked his own teachings up into a small volume in 1970. Though scarcely noticed at publication by even the evangelical press, ''The Late Great Planet Earth'' became the best-selling book of the decade, with scores of printings ultimately churning out close to 16 million copies. IT was a tale of biblical prophecy told in countercultural vernacular, and it went like this. Soon the Israelis will rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem and conclude a treaty with the dictator of the Revived Roman Empire, also known as the Antichrist. All saved Christians will then be seized into heaven (''The Rapture,'' or ''Jesus' ultimate trip''), whereupon there will be a seven-year period of tribulation involving, first, the invasion of Israel by an Arab-African conspiracy headed by Egypt, followed by an invasion by the Russian confederacy. Russia and its allies will then be destroyed with Roman tactical nuclear weapons, and shortly thereafter the climactic battle of Armageddon will commence, between the forces of the empire and a 200-million-man Chinese Army. Before humanity succeeds in destroying itself, Jesus will come to earth for the second time (along with the enraptured saints) and establish his 1,000-year reign. Then, after a brief rebellion by Satan, final judgment will occur. So says the Bible. Known technically as dispensational premillennialism, this way of envisioning the ''end times'' had been worked out and debated for a century in fundamentalist circles, with the latest current events always being brought into prophetic line. It was a smug, antiestablishment creed, predicated on the utter corruption of all but the small remnant of the saved, and in the postwar period it had lost ground to the more inclusive evangelicalism of the Rev. Billy Graham and his associates at Christianity Today. While Israel's capture of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War - which seemed to bring nearer the requisite renewal of Temple sacrifice - may have helped restore the waning influence of dispensational theology, that cannot come close to explaining the popularity of Mr. Lindsey's book. Perhaps it was simply the prospect of getting off the planet as quickly as possible -away from Cambodia and Saigon, Watergate and OPEC, from the Rev. Jim Jones and the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In the 70's, you didn't have to be born-again to reach for notions of Apocalypse Now. And if, as it seems, the country was passing through a crisis of legitimacy, that too was indicated in ''The Late Great Planet Earth.'' ''It is clear,'' Mr. Lindsey wrote, ''that the United States cannot be the leader of the West in the future.'' Thanks to student rebellion, Communist subversion and wholesale moral decay, America would in all likelihood be relegated to a mere appendage of the Roman Antichrist. The counterstroke came in 1980 with the Rev. Jerry Falwell's ''Listen, America!'' For while that author was also a dispensationalist, he was in no way interested in throwing in the national towel. His book began, to be sure, by emphasizing how America's sinful ways had brought her to the brink of ruin. But then, in the tradition of the American jeremiad, it proceeded to call for the repentance and revival that would return the land to its original moral purity. ''God has blessed this nation because in its early days she sought to honor God and the Bible, the inerrant Word of the living God,'' Mr. Falwell wrote. Denouncing the sin meant promoting the mission, for just as ''our Founding Fathers firmly believed that America had a special destiny in the world,'' so Mr. Falwell believed that America, with ''more God-fearing citizens per capita than any other nation on earth,'' was the ''last logical base for world evangelization.'' City on a Hill, New Jerusalem, Light Unto the Gentiles - here was a gospel for the Reagan dispensation. It was also a political tract, the platform of a new political organization. Mr. Falwell had created Moral Majority Inc. to weld ''Bible-believing Christians and other moral Americans'' into a force capable of putting the country back on a firm biblical footing. ''Listen, America!'' told what that task required: a strengthened patriarchal family with no new rights for women, children or homosexuals; no abortion; tougher restrictions on pornography and drugs; increased military spending; and, premillennially, unwavering support for the State of Israel. Politicians were to be judged by how their votes measured up on this set of issues. Mr. Falwell knew that his Baptist brethren had long been skittish about mixing religion and politics, but now it was either stand up and be counted or face the children when they asked, ''Mom and Dad, where were you the day freedom died in America?'' Four years later, with the religious right an established fact of American life, Richard John Neuhaus posed a neoconservative version of this question in ''The Naked Public Square.'' Repudiating the original prophecies of Herberg and Mr. Cox, he judged Judeo-Christian faith alive and well in the population at large, and called the secular city a myth. But between the disappearance of mainline Protestantism's cultural hegemony and recent secularizing rulings of the courts, religion had lost its voice in the affairs of state. Democracy, ''a fragile and imperiled artifice,'' requires that voice, he argued, for ''without a transcendent or religious point of reference, conflicts of values cannot be resolved.'' Where were you the day democracy fell apart in America? MR. NEUHAUS, a Lutheran theologian who had won his political spurs opposing the Vietnam War, harked back to the liberal intellectuals who, just after World War II, worried that democracy without religion could not inspire American citizens to a defense of the West. As he beckoned faith back into the public square, however, he was notably unspecific about what it was supposed to do - possibly because, on any particular issue, ''the Judeo-Christian consensus'' is not so easily determined. The question of abortion, his prime exhibit for a current unresolved conflict of values, is clearly not settled by either Scripture or Judeo-Christian history. Yet what Mr. Neuhaus finally seemed to be calling for was less a set of Judeo-Christian policy recommendations than the reestablishment of ''a shared world of moral discourse.'' The moral majoritarians had ''kicked a tripwire'' alerting us all to what it means to abandon a ''religiously based moral common denominator.'' Has common moral discourse really become impossible in mid-80's America? Is the American democracy really so at risk? Mr. Neuhaus tended to assert, rather than demonstrate, his central claim. But if the religious revival confronting us is not primarily a moral majoritarian tour de force, then ''The Naked Public Square'' will have expressed something larger in American life as a whole. Someday a book will mark that out too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OMAHA ASKS IF AN UNWED MOTHER CAN BE A FIT ROLE MODEL FOR TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/us/omaha-asks-if-an-unwed-mother-can-be-a-fit-role-model-for-teen-agers.html,"To the officers of the Omaha Girls Club, it was a question of propriety. They felt that Crystal Chambers, a part-time arts and crafts teacher, could not be a good role model for teen-age members when she became pregnant out of wedlock. So they dismissed her. To Miss Chambers it was a question of discrimination. She contended that, as a black woman, she was unjustly dismissed by the club's predominantly white board. So she filed a multimillion-dollar suit against the club alleging that her civil rights had been violated. The Girls Club, a private, nonprofit group founded in 1975, serves more than 10,000 girls, most of them black, at two centers in Omaha. Nearly 60 percent of the club's staff is black. What began five years ago as a labor dispute there is now part of a national debate over teen-age pregnancy. The debate intensified earlier this month when a Federal district Judge in Omaha ruled that the club had acted within its rights in dismissing Miss Chambers. ''The evidence has shown that the Girls Club did not intentionally discriminate against the plaintiff and that the policy is related to the Girls Club's central purpose of fostering growth and maturity of young girls,'' wrote Judge C. Arlen Beam. On Wednesday attorneys for Miss Chambers filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. One Lawyer's Experience The case has sharply divided Omaha, Nebraska's biggest and most ethnically diverse city. There are those who see Miss Chambers, who finished two years of college and was scheduled for a promotion to a full-time position at the time of her dismissal, as a positive role model. Others felt the club acted within its rights in dismissing her. Anything short of that, they argued, would be tantamount to condoning her pregnancy at a time when the club was trying to send an opposite message to teen-age girls. One of Miss Chambers's lawyers is Mary Kay Green, a former City Council member who helped found the Girls Club in the early 1970's. She said she chose to represent Miss Chambers because of the discrimination she herself faced years ago after bearing twins out of wedlock. ''No one is saying teens should become pregnant,'' Miss Green said in a telephone interview from her office in Omaha. ''But rather than punishing those who do, we should be finding ways to help them.'' Miss Green noted that, according to national projections, nearly 70 percent of black women will have babies out of wedlock. Judge Beam's decision, she said, has the effect of rescinding Federal legislation barring discrimination in employment, as it applies to black women. 'Our First Responsibility' There were 2,636 babies born to teen-agers in Omaha in 1983, the latest year for which figures are available. Less than 3 percent of the teen-agers giving birth that year were married. The Girls Club proposed its policy against unwed employees who are pregnant in 1981 and adopted it in March, 1982. A month later Miss Chambers told center officials she was pregnant. She was told that, in accordance with the new policy, she would have to leave when her pregnancy became obvious. Miss Chambers was the first employee to be dismissed under the new rule and there has been one other since. ''We considered the impact the policy would have on employees,'' said Mary Heng, executive director of the club. ''But we felt our first responsibility was to the club's members. Many of these teen-agers look up to our staff and turn to them for advice and direction. What message are we sending out, if we don't set a proper model for these girls.'' But some charge that the club failed to consider the consequences of its policy. Dr. Harriette McAdoo, a professor of sociology at Howard University who was a trial witness for Miss Chambers, argued that the policy was hardly likely to reduce the rate of teen-age pregnancy and, if anything, would force women such as Miss Chambers into poverty. The only option for these women, she asserted, was abortion. Depending on Welfare ''If a girl became pregnant, the only way to keep her job was by having an abortion,'' said Dr. McAdoo. ''The only other solution, was for the girl to resign from her job and go on welfare to support herself and her child.'' Those who knew Miss Chambers, who is now 27, described her as one of the most popular teachers at the club. Since her dismissal she has worked infrequently and has lived mainly off welfare payments. Miss Heng, who described herself as a feminist, said the club's staff members and directors had carefully considered the implications of the policy and intended to stick by it. Robert D. Mullin Jr., the Girls Club's attorney, said in his closing trial arguments that the Chambers case could be viewed as a conflict of interest. While Miss Chambers did not actively express the view that out-of-wedlock pregnancies were acceptable, he said, ''her actions did that.'' ''This message is at odds with the club's mission,'' said Mr. Mullin. ''When the mission conflicts with the treatment of employees' rights, then the rights of the employees come second.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAVING IT ALL IS TOO MUCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/books/having-it-all-is-too-much.html,"A LESSER LIFE The Myth of Women's Liberation in America. By Sylvia Ann Hewlett. Illustrated. 461 pp. New York: William Morrow & Company. $17.95. A YOUNG lawyer friend of mine once worked out this response to the prospective employer's query whether marriage might conflict with her fast-track career: ''I'm so glad you asked. I believe that men have struck a perfect balance between personal and professional lives. Reasonable accommodation of private lives? Nonsense. Humanization of the work world? Who needs it? I've made it clear to my friends and family that love, affection, friendship and human emotion play a small role in the life of a real professional.'' And what if the interviewer asks about children? ''Not to worry. Test tube babies for me. That way I can wait until I'm 40, 50, even 60 before I start a family, until my career is really well established. I'm no fool.'' Sylvia Ann Hewlett, the vice president for economic studies at the United Nations Association, the author of ''The Cruel Dilemmas of Development'' and the mother of four children, describes superwomen with a good deal less humor. She relates powerful, personal stories of women, herself and others, and puts these poignant stories in a social and historical context. These women seek success in careers conceived on the assumption that every professional man has a wife to entertain for him, ghostwrite for him and maintain a haven from the heartless world. At the same time, these women seek to be wives and good mothers, in a world in which good mothering - extending to the child's future S.A.T. scores - demands sophisticated art and science and a lot of time. Women who want all this confront dismal choices. They can single-mindedly pursue a career -given the job market and persistent sexism, however, odds are great that their career will not be what they had hoped. They can devote themselves to family, though that course is both emotionally and financially precarious. Or if they are truly self-indulgent, they can try to do it all and live without sleep or the satisfaction of ever doing anything as well as they could. Sylvia Hewlett addresses fundamental feminist concerns. Feminists with a materialist view of society argue that the mom-at-home, dad-at-work arrangement persists because it meets the needs of our prevailing economic order - employers' needs for flexibility are better met by a worker who has no major obligations outside the workplace. These feminists argue that changes in the economic order are absolutely necessary for sex-based equality. But other feminists argue that women are trapped in these impossible choices because notions of gender stress the virtues of connection and nurturing in women and independence and economic achievement in men. This group seeks to enhance the social and economic value attached to the work of caring for the young and old and vulnerable that has traditionally been assigned to women. Still other feminists -surely the vast majority - struggle in a thousand intellectual and material ways to create accommodations that would give women what men have always assumed is their due as human beings - a measure of satisfaction in both love and work. Drawing on a wealth of anecdotal evidence, the author suggests that the claim that women can ''have it all'' is responsible for the impossible choices facing women today. Ordinary women, she asserts, see feminists as ''traitors because they undermine the traditional family-support systems for other women and their children.'' But blaming feminists for such destruction is simply incomprehensible, if only because they don't have that kind of political and economic power. Have feminists encouraged men to leave their wives and children for younger, less demanding women? Promoted the notion that it is all right for men to ignore basic obligations of financial and emotional support for their children? Prevented women - and increasingly men - from earning a salary sufficient to support a family in minimal decency? The author also asserts, for example, that many feminists think that a woman has ''less right to a leave [from her job] for childbirth than if she were incapacitated in a skiing accident.'' I know no feminist who subscribes to this proposition, and women throughout the land have struggled to persuade employers, legislators and courts that the needs peculiar to women - including pregnant women, whether they want an abortion or a baby - must not be subject to discrimination or treated as less important than the needs they share with men. Feminists support extending health insurance -including leaves - to pregnant women. AS a remedy for the conflict she sees between the demands of home and wage market, Sylvia Hewlett proposes that feminists ally themselves with organized labor to create a just and equitable world for women. She asserts that such a world now exists in Western Europe (although feminists there are far more skeptical than she that paradise has been achieved). Certainly such an alliance makes sense. When the Supreme Court, despite the arguments of women's rights activists, held that discrimination against pregnant women is not sex-based, it was a coalition of feminists and organized labor that persuaded Congress to amend the Federal anti-discrimination law to make plain that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is discrimination on the basis of sex. But the validity of this suggestion will not undo the damage ''A Lesser Life'' is likely to cause. Problems of sexism run deep and strike close to home. An analysis claiming that feminists are responsible for the impossible choices confronting women and all people today is comforting, particularly to those who have no interest in change. It is also wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JOHN PAUL ASSAILS DEALERS OF DEATH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/31/world/john-paul-assails-dealers-of-death.html,"Pope John Paul II, in a passionate but somber Easter message assailing human callousness, declared today that man ''has often made death the method of his existence on earth.'' Denouncing terrorism, torture, war and abortion, John Paul told a crowd of 200,000 people in St. Peter's Square that ''man unfortunately resigns himself to death and not only accepts it but inflicts it.'' ''Men continually inflict death upon others,'' he said, ''people who are often unknown, innocent people, people not yet born.'' The Pope also reiterated his invitation to the leaders of all the world's religions to meet in Assisi, the home of St. Francis, this fall to pray together and work toward a common program for peace. 'The Victory of Life' ''It will be an opportunity to reaffirm, before man, terrified by the threats of death, our commitment to the victory of life,'' he told the crowd, which overflowed the square down the Via della Conciliazione, which runs into the sqaure, and off to side streets. The Pope's litany of evil was tempered by a message of hope and by a brilliant spring day that brought out a festive, flag-waving crowd called forth from many nations. After delivering his traditional message called ''Urbi et Orbi'' (''to the City and the World''), John Paul, in golden vestments, issued Easter greetings in 49 languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, Bulgarian and Swahili. The Pope, who visited India last month, also offered his wishes in three of India's main languages, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam. The ceremony, preceded by an Easter mass, was attended by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, an Episcopalian, and his wife, Helena, who is Roman Catholic. The Pope received them in a private audience on Saturday. The Shultzes left for the United States this afternoon. In his address, John Paul spoke of violence as the product of a human failure to look beyond this life to the transcendent. No Immortality on Earth ''Man resigns himself to death when he aspires only to the things of the earth, when he seeks only those things,'' he said. ''The earth alone does not conceal within itself the leaven of immortality. ''Man not only resigns himself to death, but he has ofen made death the method of his existence on earth,'' he declared, his robes billowing in the breeze. ''Is not the method of death found in the method of violence, the method of the bloody conquest of power, the method of selfish accumulation of wealth, the method of the struggle against poverty that thrives on hatred and the longing for revenge, the method of intimidation and the abuse of power, the method of torture and terror?'' the Pope asked. The passage appeared to prefigure the Vatican's new document on the theology of liberation, expected to be released this week. The document is expected to denounce inequalities that foster suffering among the poor, while virtually ruling out violence in the pursuit of social change. The Pope said that the resurrection of Jesus from death, the core of Christian belief, was itself ''his uprising against death,'' a sign that ''God does not resign himself to man's death.'' God's challenge to man, he said, ''is the great challenge of peace.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON; ENTER THE APRIL FOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/02/opinion/washington-enter-the-april-fool.html,"On the first of April, I always try to catch up with my old buddy, the April Fool, and have a little talk with him about the foolishness of the human race. This year I invited him out to my hideaway at the headwaters of the Rappahannock in Virginia. I said I needed his help. He looked a little older and a little fat. Foolishness was flourishing, he said, but people seemed to be taking it all so seriously. There was so little laughter. I tried to interrupt. He looked out at Mount Marshall on the Blue Ridge, but went on: Officials said such crazy things and told such lies, he insisted, but nobody heckled or even giggled. These politicians have no sense of humor and no sense of history, he said. You're raving, old Fool, I replied. Lately Washington has been laughing at its stupidities. For example? said the Fool. Well, I said, George Shultz came back from Europe with a suggestion for Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev about how to improve U.S.-Soviet relations: Pipe down. ''Fat chance!'' said the Fool. ''What else is funny?'' I said we'd had some amiable nonsense in Washington lately. For example? said the Fool. Well, at the Gridiron Dinner the other night, I said, all the big shots were poking fun at themselves. The President was laughing at his age, Senator Kennedy was laughing at his disappointment, and Donald Regan, the White House chief of staff, was suggesting that he never had any trouble with the President as long as the President followed Mr. Regan's advice. Go on, said the Fool. ''I was asked the other day,'' Mr. Regan said, ''why I didn't take time out from politics to smell the flowers. What the hell do I have a gardener for?'' The April Fool smiled. ''Not a bad joke,'' he said. Even George Bush, who is not the funniest man in town, plays the fool once in awhile, I said. At the Alfalfa Club the other night, for example, he told of an exchange with a reporter. Reporter: What are your views on abortion? Bush: I agree with the President on abortion. Reporter: What are your views on prayer in the schools? Bush: I agree with the President on prayer in the schools. Reporter: Don't you have any opinions of your own? Bush: Sure I do, but I don't agree with my opinions! The April Fool nodded. These are the best jokes money can buy, he said. I know about these one-night Vaudeville stands. What about Colonel Qaddafi? Well, I said, what about him? Nobody with a sense of humor, said the Fool, would use a sledgehammer, let alone three aircraft carriers, to swat a fly. I doubt that he's a colonel, maybe not even a corporal. He's not a terror, he's a terrier. If he's a terror, you should get rid of him; if he's a terrier, you should starve him off his oil. I said I wanted to talk about other things: about my vegetables, my gardens, and what to do in the flourishing of the spring. But he wouldn't listen. So I changed the subject again. The President, I said, says that unless we give $100 million to the ''contras'' outside Nicaragua, the Communists will soon be in San Diego. It's a long way from Santa Barbara, the Fool said. You're raving, you old Fool, I said. Don't you see the Communist menace to the United States in Central America from Nicaragua and even into El Salvador? I thought El Salvador was a five-cent cigar, the Fool said. But I insisted. Could I please now get you back to why I invited you to Fiery Run? No fooling, I have a problem. What's your problem? said the Fool. Every spring, I said, I read the seed catalogues with their four-color pictures of my perfect flowers and vegetables outside my cabin, and I dream in the night that's the way it'll be. Just like Reagan, said the Fool. How big is your spread? the Fool asked. Ten and a half acres, I said, four in pasture and the rest in woods and brambles. Do you have a porch that looks out on the Blue Ridge at sundown? the Fool asked. That we do! Well, said the Fool, why not just sit on the porch and forget about gardens and politics, and let Fiery Run slide to the Rappahannock and the sea? I've been thinking about this and on the whole I've decided he's not such a Fool after all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JOSEPH KENNEDY GETS A WIDER FIELD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/us/joseph-kennedy-gets-a-wider-field.html,"The Democratic primary for Congress in the Eighth District of Massachusetts is months away, but the field of candidates, which once numbered more than a dozen, is thinning rapidly. In recent weeks three state legislators, a member of the Boston City Council and a South End lawyer have withdrawn. The reason can be summed up in a name: Joseph P. Kennedy 2d. Mr. Kennedy, 33 years old, the eldest son of Robert F. Kennedy, is considered so far ahead that opponents have been giving thought to whether the race is worth the effort. ''I got out because I wasn't going to win,'' State Reprresentative Thomas Vallely said of his withdrawal two weeks ago after spending almost $400,000 on his campaign. ''It adds up to a matter of realism.'' #3 Others Are Given the Edge Nine candidates remain, but on the basis of polls, according to people in political circles, three contenders are most likely to challenge Mr. Kennedy for an appreciable share of votes. They are State Senator George Bachrach, Melvin King, the runner-up in the city's last mayoral election, and James Roosevelt Jr., a lawyer who is a grandson of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Bunched behind them are Robert Cappucci, Robert O'Connell, Thomas Gallagher, Carla Johnston and George Spiegel. The feeling in political circles now is that pressure will increase on those remaining to clarify their positions. ''As the race focuses down, the debate will become sharper,'' said Mr. Roosevelt, who is 40 years old. Even though the filing deadline is June 3 and the primary election is Sept. 16, news organizations and the candidates are already polling voters. The results indicate that Mr. Kennedy's lead is sizable. A Third of the Vote, in Polls Various surveys showed that he had at least a third of the votes when there were more candidates in the race. No other contender had even 20 percent. A plurality, not a majority, is needed for nomination. Not one to take victory for granted -''there are two-thirds out there who aren't with me as a first choice or haven't made up their minds,'' Mr. Kennedy said - he announced last week that he had the endorsement of five members of the Boston Celtics. He has chosen to make his first bid for elective office by seeking the seat being vacated by Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House. The Eighth District is the one where his uncle, John F. Kennedy, won his first election for Congress in 1946. Range of the Eighth District The district, which includes part of Boston, straddles the Charles River, embracing Arlington, Belmont, Cambridge, Somerville, Waltham and Watertown. It is so much a Democratic stronghold that little attention is being paid to the Republican primary, in which Clark C. Abt, a Cambridge consultant, is a leading contender. Most of the Democratic candidates say they consider themselves to the left of Joseph Kennedy in a district where liberal predilections evoke Manhattan's Upper West Side. ''Probably on the emotional issues, most of them are to my left,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''I'm reluctantly pro-choice on abortion, and I think judges and juries should have the right to impose the death penalty. But on economic issues, which are most important to me, I'm as strongly or more in favor of aiding the elderly and the poor as anyone.'' A litmus test in the district is the question of United States aid to the rebels fighting the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua. All the leading contenders, including Mr. Kennedy, oppose such aid. ''But I probably differ with them on El Salvador, where I favor military aid,'' Mr. Kennedy said of his opponents. ''I qualify that by saying there should be no bombing of civilians and Duarte should have control over the military.'' Strategies of His Rivals Each of Mr. Kennedy's three major opponents has a specific strategy. Mr. Bachrach, 34, whose constituency as a three-term State Senator includes about a third of the voters in the Congressional district, emphasizes that he is an established vote-getter with a record of service to the district. ''There will be a contrast in issues as Mr. Kennedy continues to move to the right, where his constituency is,'' Mr. Bachrach said. ''I will hold fast to my progressive constituency, where I have always been.'' Mr. King, 57, who was a State Representative for 10 years before he ran for mayor, says he is best qualified to ''empower the people.'' He said he would organize his constituency to take an active role in dealing with issues such as improving the economy of the region and obtaining peace in the Middle East. He also favors cutting the military budget by one third. Mr. Roosevelt said he planned to ''try to engage'' Mr. Kennedy ''in a debate on specific issues,'' including campaign financing and tax policy. Mr. Roosevelt said he was gratified by polls showing that recognition of his name had doubled among voters in the last two months, but he concedes that it is an uphill battle to get ''Roosevelt'' as widely recognized as ''Kennedy.'' ''After all, we're in Massachusetts,'' Mr. Roosevelt said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONNECTICUT OPINION; WAITING OUT A PREGNANCY SCARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/nyregion/connecticut-opinion-waiting-out-a-pregnancy-scare.html,"EVERY morning during those long tumultuous days when I was convinced I was pregnant, I woke with two images. One was of a child of about 8 years old, shouting as he climbed an endless green slope, and then, just as he reached the top, vanishing, like a character in a Bergman movie, into white, nightgown-like shadows. The other image was of a thimble-sized embryo with eyes, fingers, knees and toes, curled up, like some precious but forgotten ring, in a wad of cotton at the bottom of a hospital trash bin. Almost daily, the man whose child I thought I was carrying telephoned me from England. Across 3,000 miles of ocean, our voices slightly delayed as they bounced off satellites swirling in the heavens, we discussed the options. If the test was positive and I decided to have an abortion, he would fly to Connecticut to be with me. ''You shouldn't have to go through this alone,'' he said gently. He insisted on paying for it - $489, which I didn't have. I was moved and touched. In the long, scratchy pauses, I asked myself the obvious but still forbidding question: Would not such a caring man make a good father, even a good husband? About the other option, about having the child, we spoke only obliquely. We had known each other a little over a month. We met, by chance, at a pub in Oxford. He was teaching a summer course at Oriel College; I was vacationing in England. For three delirious weeks, we were together almost steadily - boating along the Thames, watching outdoor productions of Shakespeare, lying for hours among the hollyhocks in the Christ Church meadow, reading poetry. Though we spoke vaguely of meeting again - he lived and worked in Illinois - we sensed that our romance would vanish as swiftly as the bright red poppies that burst forth each day in the verdant English fields and are gone the next morning. Neither of us imagined that our midsummer night's dream would fade into this -the burningly serious business of bringing new life into the world, life that would thrust both of us toward a dark and uncertain future. I grew terrified. Terrified to have the child. Terrified not to. Late at night, I poured over books on childbirth. I stared at enlarged photos of cells, embryos and fetuses. I learned, to my astonishment, that a 3-week-old embryo is one-tenth of an inch long, that it already has a heart that beats, a brain with two lobes, the beginning of a spinal chord, a vigorous circulatory system. I learned that, at two months, when most abortions are performed, the embryo has a human face with eyes, ears, nose, lips and tongue, that it even has the distinctive, never-to-be-duplicated palm prints that form a tiny ''M'' on the hand. Although I had always believed that abortion was a woman's legal and inalienable right, for the first time I considered the disturbing alternative. The embryo was a miniature human creature; to destroy it was to destroy something miraculous, an awesomely complex bit of dancing, pulsing life. As I passed the familiar but now portentous sight of women wheeling babies in shopping carts at the supermarket, there were moments of panic. I was 31. My childbearing years were diminishing. And even though the glossy magazines at the check-out counters promised otherwise - ''Mother, 45, Gives Birth to Healthy Triplets'' - I knew there would come a time when my body, like the magic hen in ''Jack and the Beanstalk,'' would no longer lay its splendid, golden eggs. I remembered what my mother said to me years ago when I told her, in a moment of feminist rage, that I had no intention of having children and ruining my life as she had ruined hers. I remembered her answer, given, on a lazy summer afternoon the day before I went off to college, gently, steadily, and with a certitude I didn't know she possessed: ''Having you and Heidi was the best thing I ever did. I've never regretted it for one second. You've been the greatest joy of my life.'' Biology is destiny. How often we feminists had fumed over that Freudian bit of humbuggery. But now, counting the days until my pregnancy test, I considered the implications of refusing to permit my body to fulfill itself. Never to be a mother. Never to see my own eyes, hair and smile reflected in the gaze of my child. Never to treasure the moment when my child utters his first word, takes his first step, sings his first song. Never to witness and relive all the poetry of childhood - the climbing of trees, the skipping of stones. To say to my mother and her mother and her mother before her, all of whom I carry within me like a shell whose patterns bear witness to centuries of waves, to say to these generations, ''No.'' Not to continue. Days later, when the pregnancy test came back negative, I felt both relieved and infinitely sad. Relieved because I was freed of the agony of having to choose. Sad because life might not say ''yes'' to me again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VATICAN BACKS STRUGGLE BY POOR TO END INJUSTICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/world/vatican-backs-struggle-by-poor-to-end-injustice.html,"The Vatican today issued its long-awaited document on ''Christian Freedom and Liberation,'' a defense of the right of the poor to struggle against injustice and a warning against totalitarianism and revolutions that lead to ''new forms of slavery.'' The 59-page ''instruction'' was issued at a news conference at which Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, its principal author, said its goal was to update Roman Catholic social teaching with an eye more to ''ethical'' than ''political'' ends. The document seeks a balance between criticisms of unbridled capitalism and of Marxism. It includes a strong defense of the right of the oppressed to revolt - even, ''as a last resort,'' to use ''armed struggle'' to ''put an end to an obvious and prolonged tyranny.'' But it repeatedly warns that movements seemingly aimed at liberation and decolonization can degenerate into ''tyrannies which scoff at human rights with impunity.'' ''The people thus reduced to powerlessness,'' the document said, ''merely have a change of masters. Situations of grave injustice require the courage to make far-reaching reforms and to suppress unjustifiable privileges.'' ''But those who discredit the path of reform and favor the myth of revolution,'' it says, ''not only foster the illusion that the abolition of an evil situation is in itself sufficient to create a more humane society; they also encourage the setting up of totalitarian regimes.'' The document is important as one of the most comprehensive and authoritative statements of Pope John Paul II's pontificate on social and political questions. It carries the Pope's formal approval, and his aides said he had reviewed it carefully. The statement comes at a time of intense debate in the church over what its political role should be and how it should interpret the Christian Gospel's strong statements on behalf of the poor. In recent years Catholics - notably in the Philippines and Nicaragua -have played a central role in social movements that overthrew dictatorial regimes. The church or segments of it have also been active against the Governments in Poland, Chile, South Korea and other countries. In the United States, the Roman Catholic bishops have taken strong stands on nuclear war and economic issues, as well as abortion. Cardinal Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and one of the leading critics of the theology of liberation, had promised the new document when he released a searing critique of liberation theology 18 months ago. Uses Word 'Liberation' Although the document repeatedly used the word ''liberation,'' it made no specific references to liberation theologians. More than a third of it was taken up with discussion of the nature of God, the religious meaning of freedom and the role of personal sin as ''the root of human alienation.'' In doing so, Vatican officials said, the document was indirectly warning against a tendency it considers prevalent among some left-wing Christians to transform Christ's teachings into a primarily political message. ''It's hardly a minority view that religion has something to do with God,'' said the Rev. Thomas J. Herron, a Philadelphian who is on Cardinal Ratzinger's staff. ''This document is simply insisting on what should have been obvious for the last 15 years: that liberation theology should, above all, be theology,'' Father Herron added. ''The Holy See is trying to divert the tendency in some theologians to collapse theology into politics.'' Defense From Latin America Advocates of liberation theology argue that they are not primarily concerned with politics and that they have strengthed the church's commitment to social and political justice. They have often said the Pope and Cardinal Ratzinger see Marxism purely in Eastern European terms and lack an understanding of Latin America. ''Cardinal Ratzinger's article seems to come from a European who reads European phenomena and tendencies into a non-European context,'' wrote the Rev. Juan Luis Segundo, a leading advocate of the theology, in a reply to Cardinal Ratzinger's first document. The Vatican document today included several pointed warnings against any social doctrines that seemed to limit the church's concern to the poor alone or that encouraged ''the struggle of one class against another in order to eliminate the foe.'' In declaring the church's ''love of preference for the poor,'' the document added: ''The special option for the poor, far from being a sign of particularism or sectarianism, manifests the universality of the church's being and mission. This option excludes no one.'' The very phrase ''love of preference for the poor'' was an attempt, Vatican officials said, to displace the phrase ''preferential option for the poor,'' which is the rallying cry of the left-of-center church in Latin America. The latter phrase, regarded in the Vatican as too overtly political, emphasizes the church's obligation to support the social struggles of the poor. At another point, the document makes a direct attack on the cultivation by left-wing movements of the ''people's churches'' that often join the popular piety of the poor to left-wing political action. The Sandinista Government in Nicaragua has supported these movements within Catholicism, angering the Pope, who sees it as an effort to divide the church. The document praised the religious devotions of the poor, saying, ''It is the poor, the object of God's special love, who understand best and as it were instinctively that the most radical liberation, which is liberation from sin and death, is the liberation accomplished by the death and resurrection of Christ.'' 'Earthly Plan an Illusion' Later on, it added: ''But it would be criminal to take the energies of popular piety and misdirect them toward a purely earthly plan of liberation, which would very soon be revealed as nothing more than an illusion and a cause of new forms of slavery.'' To do so, the document said, is to ''surrender to the ideologies of the world and to the alleged necessity of violence.'' Cardinal Ratzinger declined in response to a question to say whether the passage specifically referred to Nicaragua. He and his aides said it was a general reference to efforts to manipulate popular piety for political ends. But the document also included language that all but endorsed the course taken in the Philippines by Jaime Cardinal Sin, Archbishop of Manila. Cardinal Sin led the church in nonviolent resistance to the Government of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. In the section defending ''armed struggle,'' the document said this should be only ''a last resort,'' and added: ''Indeed, because of the continual development of the technology of violence and the increasingly serious dangers implied in its recourse, that which today is termed 'passive resistance' shows a way more comfortable to moral principles and having no less prospects for success.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And, with many of the other Republican Presidential hopefuls even further to the right, we moderates -liberal on social issues, conservative on economic issues - have no place to go. The Democratic Party, with its record of throwing money at every problem to feed a growing bureaucracy, does not tempt us. The Republican Party, which claims it seeks to get Government out of our lives, is intruding into such private matters as our bedrooms (the abortion issue) and religion.

WNET REFUSES TO AIR PBS PROGRAM ON ISRAEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/09/movies/wnet-refuses-to-air-pbs-program-on-israel.html,"A public-television program consisting of three films with sharply divergent views on the borders of Israel has stirred a heated dispute within public broadcasting. Some stations, including WNET in New York and WETA in Washington, have refused to carry the broadcast, scheduled for tonight. That refusal prompted the head of news and public affairs for the Public Broadcasting Service to issue an unusual statement supporting the program and disagreeing with the stations not carrying it. The program, which has been criticized by the American Jewish Committee, the national Jewish group that publishes the magazine Commentary, is called ''Flashpoint - Israel and the Palestinians,'' and is part of an experimental PBS series, produced by station KQED in San Francisco. The idea of the series, its producers say, is to present a sort of video Op-Ed page, similar to that of a newspaper, in which conflicting viewpoints, openly biased, compete for the viewer's judgment. The first installment in the series considered the subject of abortion and featured films produced by both sides of the abortion issue. The Center of the Dispute The ''Flashpoint'' installment features two half-hour films produced by Israeli film makers, and an hourlong film made by the American film maker David Koff. Mr. Koff's film, called ''Occupied Palestine,'' is at the center of the dispute. ''Occupied Palestine'' presents a strongly anti-Israeli view of life under Israeli military rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. ''This is an opportunity for people who are living and have been living under military occupation to express their experiences and their perceptions of what it means to live under occupation and why they struggle against it,'' Mr. Koff said. Of the 165 licensees in the PBS system, only 6 stations are refusing to carry the program for content reasons, according to Barry Chase, the vice president for news and public affairs for PBS. Of those, WETA and WNET are the largest and, according to the producers of the program, serve the most important audiences. ''It clearly takes away from the national importance of the broadcast'' not to be seen on WNET and WETA, Mr. Chase said. Mr. Koff accused WNET and WETA of a lack of nerve in refusing to air the program. ''They don't want to take the heat,'' he said. But officials at both stations maintain that the films in the program, especially ''Occupied Palestine,'' are biased, propagandistic and generally unworthy of air time. 'All 3 Films Are Inferior' ''All three films are inferior to anything we have aired previously'' on the subject of the West Bank and Gaza, said Gerald Slater, the vice president of WETA. George L. Miles, the vice president of WNET, said the station conferred with WETA on the matter and arrived at the same conclusion. ''We're not ducking it,'' said Mr. Miles. ''We're trying to present fair, representative, well-rounded programs. And this is not it.'' Beverly Ornstein, the producer who assembled tonight's package for KQED in San Francisco, said WETA and WNET were missing the point of the series. ''They say the films are biased and full of distortions,'' Miss Ornstein said. ''I say: 'That is correct. These are partisan films, produced, written and directed to portray a partisan point of view. The purpose is to present a partisan forum, to present partisan views in an unfiltered manner, like an Op-Ed page on a newspaper.' '' Some stations, such as KTCA in Minneapolis, disagree with the whole concept of partisan programming and plan not to carry any in the series. WNET did not carry the abortion program, but WETA did. ''There certainly is a sensitivity here,'' Miss Ornstein said. ''It's one that I can understand and appreciate. I know that some stations have been under some difficult pressure. I understand that difficulty. I hope, though, that we've provided the stations with an overall package, so that it's balanced and has perspective.'' She was alluding to the fact that the three films were clearly identified as being strongly partisan. L.I. and Jersey Broadcasts Although WNET is the major public-television outlet in the New York metropolitan area, others in the region, including the four of the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority and Channel 21 on Long Island, will carry the broadcast tonight. ''We're airing it because we feel we're providing a valuable public service,'' said Janice Oppenheimer, a spokesman for Channel 21. In the Washington area, the program will be carried by WHMM of Howard University, considered the secondary public-broadcasting station in the market. David Gordis, the executive vice president of the American Jewish Committee, said his group had urged its local chapters to persuade their public-television stations not to run ''Flashpoint,'' or, failing that, to replace ''Occupied Palestine.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ACROSS L.I. SOUND FROM SHOREHAM, A NUCLEAR PLANT IS MET WITH YAWNS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/12/nyregion/across-li-sound-from-shoreham-a-nuclear-plant-is-met-with-yawns.html,"The people who live along this stretch of New England coastline have much in common with their neighbors in Suffolk and Nassau Counties, just across Long Island Sound. Residents of both shores enjoy sheltered harbors and sandy beaches. On either side of the water are tackle shops offering ''shiners and sandworms'' and nautically named restaurants serving ''grog and grub.'' Both areas also happen to have imposing new citadels of high technology perched by the sound's edge: nuclear power plants that are completed and heading toward commercial operation. That is where the similarity abruptly ends. On Long Island, citizen groups and many local politicians, with the support of New York's Governor and United States Senators, are strenuously opposing the opening of the Long Island Lighting Company's $4.6 billion, 820-megawatt Shoreham nuclear power station, carrying out their fight in the courts and in the halls of government. Shoreham has not yet received its license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and if its opponents prevail, it never will. By contrast, here in Waterford, where Northeast Utilities' $3.82 billion, 1,150-megawatt Millstone 3 nuclear power plant has been licensed and is to begin commercial operation within a few weeks, the public reaction has been nonchalance. ''People here are not in the least upset,'' said First Selectman Lawrence J. Bettencourt, Waterford's chief elected official. ''It's really not an issue.'' Interviews with other residents of the area confirmed that view. ''I'm not worried and I certainly haven't seen anybody selling their houses,'' said Sheila Helgeson, who works at A Thyme to Cook, a gourmet shop. And over at Mitchell College, Charles McElaney, a 23-year-old life sciences major, said: ''I've never really heard people talking about it. Right now drinking and driving is the hot issue on campus.'' Mr. Bettencourt said nuclear power had not been debated in any local election that he could recall. On Long Island, however, nuclear power ranks right along with abortion and defense spending as among the thorniest issues a politician faces. Such divergences can be found from site to site across the United States, experts on the nuclear industry say. For example, there has long been intense opposition to the opening of a nuclear plant in Seabrook, N.H., while at the new Hope Creek plant in southern New Jersey, ''it's no big deal,'' according to Lisa Salamon, a spokesman for the plant's owner, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company. Familiar With Nuclear Industries The explanations offered vary depending on who is asked. Residents of Waterford and the surrounding towns point out that they have been living amid nuclear industries for a long time. The Millstone 1 and Millstone 2 nuclear plants, adjacent to Millstone 3, have been in commercial operation since 1970 and 1975 respectively. Just up the Connecticut coast are a division of General Dynamics that builds nuclear submarines and a Navy nuclear submarine base. Many military families live near the base as well as around the Coast Guard Academy in nearby New London. ''There's a lot of employment around here connected with nuclear power,'' said Fran Moreno, owner of the Made To Be Loved Doll Hospital in the neighboring community of Niantic, within sight of Millstone 3. ''People have come to understand it and accept it. It doesn't frighten us.'' On Long Island, by comparison, chain reactions are currently occurring only at two small nuclear reactors used in physics research at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. But Jeffrey Newman, a public relations consultant and the vice president of the Coalition for Safe Living, an umbrella organization of 35 groups opposed to Shoreham, has other thoughts on why Long Island residents have not learned to stop worrying and love the nuclear reactor. He argued that ''consciousnesses have been raised on the island'' in regard to the nuclear power issue, largely because of the heated debate over the long delayed opening of the Lilco plant. Shoreham received its construction permit 16 years ago this month. Mr. Newman, along with other opponents of Shoreham, also maintains that the peculiarities of Long Island's geography make the area particularly inappropriate for a nuclear power station. ''People in Connecticut would at least have a fighting chance to get away in case of an accident,'' he said. ''But you can't evacuate this island. If you've ever tried to go to New York from the Hamptons in summer, you know there's no way you're going to move people rapidly out of the way of a plume'' of radiation leakage. Proponents of nuclear power, such as Anthony J. Castagno, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, counter that the chances of a nuclear accident that would require a wholesale evacuation are ''almost negligible.'' And even in a worst-case scenario, he and others stress, the need would be to move people up to 10 miles away from Shoreham rather than completely off the island. Mr. Newman answered by saying that thousands of frightened residents would flee no matter what. Based largely on that view, Suffolk County leaders have refused to cooperate with Lilco's emergency planning. Emergency Planning Praised Over in Waterford, that puzzles people. ''We were the first municipality in the country to have an emergency plan,'' Mr. Bettencourt said. ''I've never had to use it for a nuclear accident, of course, but we have used it several times for other emergencies, for instance during Hurricane Gloria last fall. The mechanisms are the same and they work very well.'' A leading Shoreham opponent, Maurice Barbash, the Suffolk County builder who heads Citizens to Replace Lilco, said that what concerned him most was neither the concept of nuclear power nor the geography of Long Island. ''As a builder, why do I fear the plant?'' Mr. Barbash asked. ''Because I don't think we know what went into it. My opposition to Shoreham is based on the record of mismanagement there.'' As evidence of past mismanagement, he cited findings by New York State's Public Service Commission that almost $1.4 billion of the plant's costs had not been ''prudently incurred.'' And as evidence of current mismanagement he cited recent findings by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of ''serious deficiencies'' in the Shoreham radio-chemistry program, which tests reactor coolants and other liquids for compliance with nuclear and environmental regulations. Lilco has since suspended the employees said to be responsible for those deficiences and hired a consultant to retrain personnel and repair the program. Spokesmen for the corporation noted that the physical integrity of the plant had been thoroughly examined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and that both the plant and its procedures underwent continual testing. Reflecting on all this, Mr. Bettencourt wondered whether a communications failure might not lie at the heart of Long Island's nuclear conflict. ''The way I look at it, from what I read, it seems that nobody there is talking to the other guy,'' he said. ''Here, we have a problem, we all sit down together and we try to work it out.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberals: Their Own Worst Enemy,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/13/magazine/l-liberals-their-own-worst-enemy-922986.html,"Harry Stein describes liberals as intolerant of any dissent in their ranks on the subject of abortion. In fact, there is no single liberal position on abortion itself: Roman Catholic liberals, like Mario Cuomo, have not abandoned Catholic teaching on the morality of abortion. Liberals are united, however, in opposing the use of American law to enforce church rules of conduct.

NEW DIRECTIONS IN BIOLOGY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/13/education/new-directions-in-biology.html,"Biology has entered a golden age. Students today live in a world with test-tube babies, synthetic vaccines, miracle crops and cloned mice. On the horizon are such developments as supercows and magic-bullet cancer cures. In tinkering with the molecules of life, biologists have helped set in motion a virtual transformation of American society. Pundits say we are experiencing a ''cultural mutation'' that is leading to a science-based ''postindustrial society.'' In the face of such monumental change, what's a biology teacher to do? According to experts on science education, a growing number of instructors at the high school and college levels have dropped traditional methods of teaching biology. Various ''new biology'' curriculums are being used instead throughout the nation. But the transformation is still slow. The difference between ''old biology'' and ''new biology,'' the experts say, is profound. In ''old biology,'' the student memorizes names of plant and animal phyla, labels parts of the grasshopper, studies the sexual behavior of microbes and, of course, dissects a frog. ''In the most popular textbook, you won't find much of anything that is controversial,'' says Dr. Gerald Skoog, outgoing president of the National Science Teachers Association. According to Dr. Leroy Lee, the association's incoming president, ''Ninety percent of biology teachers use the traditional text 95 percent of the time. All their effort is directed at getting students prepared for the next-level science course.'' The emphasis of the old biology is on rote memorization; the student in a first-year biology course learns as many new words as are presented in a first-year foreign-language course. Biology is held to be a discrete discipline with no overlap into physics, chemistry or other sciences. A result of this teaching approach is ''major forgetting,'' says Dr. Paul Hurd, professor emeritus of education at Stanford University. ''The student refrain has long been, 'What good is this stuff going to do for me?' At the very time that biology can and ought to be of greatest service to humankind, we find the biology curriculum stuffed with information that has little potential for application.'' But the new biology, according to several proponents, deals with basic concepts of biology as carried to its uses in society. The animal studied is the human being, not the frog. ''Instead of teaching biology for the sake of biologists, biology is taught for the sake of humans,'' Dr. Hurd says. Courses in the new biology are organized around large, biosocial themes: population issues, genetic profiles, pollution of the biosphere, biotechnology, human development and health and disease. The themes raise real-world problems such as famine in Africa, destruction of the rain forests, rising levels of carbon dioxide and coastal flooding, gene therapy, abortion, the cost of artificial hearts and whether to spray outdoor crops with genetically altered bacteria. When biology is related to social and human problems, Dr. Hurd says, issues of values and ethics inevitably arise. Students need to realize, he says, that science and technology are never value-free or ethically neutral. The goal of the new biology then is not to teach judgments about problems that have a biological basis. Science is the search for relative truth, never absolute truth, according to the new-biology proponents, and students should learn to be comfortable with scientific uncertainty and realize that biology presents many questions for which there are no answers. According to Dr. Hurd, more than 100 national reports have been issued since 1980 on the inadequacies of science education. ''The charge,'' he says, ''is that students are completing high school scientifically and technologically illiterate - foreigners in their own culture.'' Lacking essential knowledge and skills, he says, ''they threaten the nation's competitive edge.'' A major goal, then, is to engage students in the subject matter. What does biology do for me? How does it help me understand myself and other people? There are examples of innovative programs in virtually every state. In California, many high school students can take a six-week minicourse or a full-semester statewide course of physical anthropology called ''Stones and Bones.'' Plaster casts of 15 of the world's most famous fossils were donated by the Louis Leakey Foundation of Pasadena, Calif. Students make replicas of fossil finds, discuss human origins and learn about ecological and climatological change. According to the Los Angeles Unified School District, the course has motivated many inner-city students to stay in school and study more science. At the Brandywine School District in Claymont, Del., high school students can elect a half-year course called ''Human Ecology.'' They learn basic principles of mental health, stress reduction and warning signs of teen-age suicide. The course describes physical development over the human life span and the influence of social instititions on human and environmental issues. Students volunteer a minimum of 25 hours in community service. In Minnesota, students learn how a type of bacteria resistant to antibiotics threatens the meat industry. In Iowa, they learn about the value of preserving various crop varieties. In Wisconsin, they consider the potential impact of genetically improved farm animals, such as ''supercows'' that give 10 times as much milk as ordinary cows, on the local milk industry. Despite many exemplary programs in the new biology, ''the fact remains that biotechnological issues are not discussed in most classrooms in proportion to their importance today,'' says Dr. Skoog of the National Science Teachers Association. Innovation is met with stubborn resistance, he says; some parents, for example, do not think schools should teach ethics to students. And he contends that special-interest groups, including fundamentalists who oppose the teaching of evolution, try to intimidate teachers and school officials. In response, Paul Bartz, education editor at the Bible-Science Association in Minneapolis, says: ''If the religious sensitivity of the atheist child has to be protected in the classroom, then the sensitivities of conservative Christian children ought to be protected by not teaching ethics that are in opposition to what is taught at home. A child's religious training and ethics ought to be taught at home but not challenged in the classroom.'' Textbook publishers tend to stay neutral, Dr. Skoog says, and ''often exert self-censorship'' as a result. IN HIGHER education, there is also a reform movement under way to teach biology and other sciences in more relevant contexts to both science majors and nonmajors. In recent years, nearly 1,000 colleges and universities have started to offer courses or majors in the combined influences of science, technology and society. These ''S.T.S.'' courses, as they are known, says Dr. Rustin Roy, director of the science, technology and society program at the University of Pennsylvania, are the glue that makes science understandable. By integrating science, human values and society, he says, ''S.T.S. is citizen education. It is scientific literacy for a scientific world.'' Universities have always done an excellent job in training research biologists, says Dr. Clifford Grobstein, who teaches bioethics at the University of California at San Diego. But rarely are biologists trained in ethics or public policy. And failing to teach biology in social and ethical contexts has serious consequences, according to proponents of the new biology, such as Dr. Hurd. A population that feels victimized by biotechnology and threatened by those who command knowledge, he says, cannot make sound decisions; research scientists need an educated and informed public to understand their work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, AUTHOR AND INTELLECTUAL, DIES IN PARIS AT 78",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/15/obituaries/simone-de-beauvoir-author-and-intellectual-dies-in-paris-at-78.html,"Simone de Beauvoir, the author whose work included ''The Second Sex,'' a provocative and influential polemic on the status of women, died yesterday at Cochin Hospital in Paris. She was 78 years old and lived in Paris. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed, but Claude Lanzmann, the director of the film ''Shoah'' and a longtime friend, said she had been in poor health since undergoing an operation in March. Miss de Beauvoir, who was for many years a central figure in left-wing French intellectual circles, also wrote novels, a play and nonfiction ranging from political commentary to autobiography. Her death came the day before the sixth anniversary of the death of her longtime companion, the French existentialist philosopher and critic Jean-Paul Sartre, on April 15, 1980. ''Simone's de Beauvoir's death stresses the end of an era,'' Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said yesterday. ''Her committed literature was representative of certain movements of ideas that, at one time, had an impact on our society. Her unquestionable talent made her a writer who deserves her place in French literature. In the name of the Government, I salute her memory in respect.'' 'An Authentic Heroine' Gloria Steinem said yesterday that ''if any single human being can be credited with inspiring the current international woman's movement, it's Simone de Beauvoir.'' Betty Friedan yesterday called Miss de Beauvoir an ''authentic heroine in the history of womanhood.'' Over the years, ''The Second Sex'' remained the book for which Miss de Beauvoir was known worldwide, and which made her an important theorist of militant, radical feminism and a heroine of the women's movement. The book, published in France in 1949 and in the United States in 1953, was her own favorite. It was translated into more than a dozen languages, was honored and excoriated, and sold more than a million copies in a paperback edition in the United States alone. The 1953 Knopf hardcover edition and a paperback edition published in 1974 by Vintage are still in print. Its basic premise - from which it took off for more than 700 pages of compelling, exasperating indictment -was best summed up in two sentences: ''One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.'' Condemned U.S. Role in Vietnam Throughout her life Miss de Beauvoir was active in causes that advanced or supported her beliefs - from a 1960's international ''tribunal'' condemning the United States role in Vietnam to the signing of a manifesto with 340 other women in 1971 admitting to having had an abortion in defiance of existing French law. Her disillusionment with Marxism in practice was recurrent - regime after regime, from the Soviet Union through Algeria to Cuba, disappointed her hopes. But she long advocated what she thought of as the concept of authentic international revolution, and the civil rights even of those with whom she disagreed. Although she proclaimed at 19 that ''I don't want my life to obey any other will but my own,'' she in fact spent much of her life - from 1929, when she and Sartre met as students at the Sorbonne, until his death in 1980 - as the closest companion of Sartre. They lived not in the same apartment but always near each other, saw each other daily, spent their annual six-week vacation in Rome together, were completely open about their liaison. ''We have,'' she said once, ''pioneered our own relationship - its freedom, intimacy and frankness.'' She added, with characteristic candor: ''We had also, rather less successfully, thought up the idea of the 'trio.' '' She wrote that she turned down Sartre's offer of marriage because she knew he did not want it, but that their relationship was central to both their lives, and ''essential love,'' in Sartre's phrase. They made allowance, at least in theory, for ''contingent'' relationships of less importance. As she conceded, this was not always a success, but the relationship with Sartre was always the one that mattered: ''I knew that no harm could ever come to me from him - unless he were to die before I did,'' she said once, and at another time commented that ''Since I was 21'' - when she met Sartre - ''I have never been lonely.'' Basic Existentialism Although her major theoretical contributions were to feminism, Miss de Beauvoir's writings, both novels and nonfiction, were also regarded as brilliant expositions of basic existential belief: that is, that man is responsible for his own destiny. ''Men may make of their own history a hopeless inferno, a junkyard of events, an enduring value,'' she wrote in 1947, a sentence that itself could be a definition of existentialism. Sartre encouraged her literary ambitions and was credited by her with pushing her into the investigation of women's oppression that led to the rage and accusation of ''Le Seconde Sexe.'' The book caused a storm of outrage in France and an equal furor in the United States. Philip Wylie called it ''one of the few great books of our era.'' Dr. Karl A. Menninger described it as a ''scholarly and at the same time pretentious and inflated tract on feminism.'' In 1954, Miss de Beauvoir's novel ''Les Mandarins'' (''The Mandarins'') won the Prix Goncourt and stirred scandalized delight with what were regarded as thinly disguised portraits of Sartre, Albert Camus and other leading French intellectuals. The author never admitted that it was a roman a clef, but did concede that the novel included an account of her affair with Nelson Algren, the American writer to whom she dedicated the book. It appeared in the United States in 1956. Her first novel, ''L'Invitee,'' published in France in 1943 and in the United States as ''She Came to Stay'' in 1954, concerned itself with a ''trio,'' with the triangular relationship among a man and a woman long attached and a second, younger woman. Miss de Beauvoir, although criticized for longwindedness, said that she felt she had been influenced by Hemingway, and that she admired the writing of Kafka, Proust and Joyce. She was a slow, meticulous, daily writer. Four-Volume Autobiography Her other novels included ''The Blood of Others'' (1948), ''All Men Are Mortal'' (1955), ''Les Belles Images'' (1967) and ''The Woman Destroyed'' (1968). She also wrote four volumes of autobiography - ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'' (1958), ''Force of Circumstance'' (1963), ''The Coming of Age'' (1972) and ''All Said and Done'' (1974) - and a play, ''The Useless Mouths'' (1954). A tour of China led to ''The Long March'' in 1958, just as a tour of the United States had produced - or provoked - ''America Day by Day'' in 1953. Her attitude toward the United States did not mellow with age and she wrote in the early 70's: ''The moment a nationalist or a popular movement seems to threaten its interests, the United States crushes it.'' She went on to say that friends predicted the imminent collapse of the country, adding: ''Perhaps this collapse may set off a revolution on a worldwide scale? I do not know whether I shall live long enough to see it, but it is a comforting outlook.'' With Sartre, she also engaged in acts of political protest. In 1970, for example, they were arrested for selling a banned Maoist newspaper - which they were doing to protest the ban, not in support of the paper's positions. In 1960, they were both banned from appearing on France's state-controlled radio or television because they had signed a manifesto supporting the right to refuse military service in Algeria, which was fighting for its independence from France at the time. Only a few years later, in 1967, they were put on a list of boycotted authors by a semi-official Algerian newspaper because of their support for Israel. Throughout her life, Miss de Beauvoir continued her political activism, speaking out on issues, heading committees, making speeches, signing manifestos. The condition of women was perhaps her primary ''cause,'' followed some years later by a similar outrage at the conditions of old age. These she wrote about in ''The Coming of Age'' in 1972, arguing that, for once, women had the advantage: ''Old age is better for women than for men,'' she told an interviewer in 1974. ''First of all, they have less far to fall, since their lives are more mediocre than those of most men. And then they still have their homes, their housework, cooking, their children, all the 'feminine' culture.'' Conveyed 'Emotional Toll' The problems of women in France early in this century figured in a collection of five early stories by Miss de Beauvoir that was published in the United States in 1982 under the title ''When Things of the Spirit Come First.'' Earlier, Miss de Beauvoir had written about death, specifically that of her mother, in the ironically titled ''A Very Easy Death'' (1966). Although she had never been close to her mother, the book was unusually free in its expression of emotion. Her mother had been a devout woman; her father a skeptic and unbeliever. Later, Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir, born in Paris on Jan. 9, 1908, was to say that this ''disequilibrium, which condemned me to a perpetual soul-searching, largely explains why I became an intellectual.'' After conventional studies she went to the Sorbonne for a degree and diploma in philosophy, which she planned to teach. It was there that she met Sartre, a fellow student three and a half years older than she. ''It was the first time in my life,'' she wrote ''that I felt intellectually inferior to anyone else.'' For about two years after leaving the Sorbonne, Miss de Beauvoir remained in Paris. In 1931 she obtained a teaching appointment in Marseilles, and in 1933 in Rouen. By 1938, she was back in Paris, teaching, and in October she began work on what would be her first published novel. By 1943, she had given up teaching to write, and in 1945, she joined Sartre in the editing of Les Temps Modernes, a monthly review. Miss de Beauvoir was somewhat humorless, uncompromising and passionate in her convictions. She remained convinced that, as she wrote in ''The Second Sex,'' a ''totally new society'' would be needed, but became increasingly convinced that meaningful change in the status of women would not necessarily evolve from change in the forms of government. ''I think that for the proletariat or a government representing it, to own the means of production is not enough to change the relationship between people,'' she said in the mid-70's. ''That's what is really important, to change relationships between people.'' At about the same time, Miss de Beauvoir acknowledged that ''There hasn't been the change I'd hoped for'' in women's condition. In 1976, some 25 years after ''The Second Sex'' she told an interviewer that she was uncertain about the coming of the hoped-for revolution. ''But the changes that women are struggling for,'' she said, ''yes, that I am certain of, in the long run women will win.'' Miss de Beauvoir's survivors include a sister, Helene de Beauvoir. WRITINGS ABOUT WOMEN A man who is compelled to go on materially and morally supporting a woman feels he is victimized. But if he abandons without resources the woman who has pledged her whole life to him, she will be quite as unjustly victimized. The evil originates in a situation against which all individual action is powerless. Women are ''clinging,'' they are a dead weight, and they suffer for it; the point is that their situation is like that of a parasite sucking out the living strength of another organism. Let them be provided with living strength of their own, let them have the means to attack the world and wrest from it their own subsistence and their dependence will be abolished - that of man also. There is no doubt that both men and women will profit greatly from the new situation. - From ''The Second Sex'' (Alfred A. Knopf), translated and edited by H. M. Parshley. In my family it was always held that the things of the spirit came first. Papa devoted his life to the study of literature and Mama to the practice of the Christian virtues, while Marcelle and Pascal were dedicated to the worship of beauty and the inner life. As soon as I was three years old Marcelle taught me to read, and when I was seven I made my first Communion with an extraordinary degree of piety. I was always very advanced for my age because they paid so much attention to me at home: Papa used to read Pascal and the tragedies of Corneille and Racine after dinner and I was allowed to listen; that forms one's mind - I was always first in examinations, and at the end of term the old ladies of the Institut Ernestine Joliet embraced me more heartily than any of the other pupils. These worthy schoolteachers were not overburdened with diplomas, but as far as devotion and morality were concerned they were second to none: they wore long black skirts and plum-colored silk blouses that caressed my cheeks when they pressed me to their bosoms.'' - From ''Marguerite,'' one of several short stories about French women rebelling against their upbringing, in ''When Things of the Spirit Come First'' (Pantheon), translated by Patrick O'Brian. She passed examinations, attended courses, and she won a certificate that enabled her to work as an assistant librarian in the Red Cross. She learnt to ride a bicycle again to go to her office. She thought of doing dressmaking at home after the war. When that time came I was in a position to help her. But idleness did not suit her. She was eager to live in her own way at last and she discovered a whole mass of activities for herself. She looked after the library in an observation sanatorium just outside Paris as a volunteer, and then the one that belonged to a Catholic club in her neighborhood. She liked handling books, putting wrappers on them, arranging them, dealing with the tickets, giving advice to readers. She studied German and Italian, and kept up her English. - From ''A Very Easy Death,'' a reminiscence, as her mother lay dying of cancer, of the new life her mother began when she was left a penniless widow at 54 (G. P. Putnam's and Pantheon), translated by Patrick O'Brian.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"O'ROURKE, WESTCHESTER'S CHIEF, TO OPPOSE CUOMO",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/nyregion/o-rourke-westchester-s-chief-to-oppose-cuomo.html,"Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, announced his candidacy for Governor yesterday with the virtual assurance that he would be the Republican-Conservative challenger of Governor Cuomo. With no competition for either nomination, the official designation of Mr. O'Rourke at Republican and Conservative state committee conventions in late May appears to be a formality. Governor Cuomo, a highly popular Democrat who is acknowledged even by Republicans to be the early favorite, is expected to announce his candidacy for a second term about the same time. ''Realistically the only candidate is O'Rourke,'' said Serphin R. Maltese, the Conservative Party leader, echoing his Republican counterpart, Anthony J. Colavita, who said he had abandoned the traditional neutrality of a state chairman to support Mr. O'Rourke. Mr. O'Rourke offered some generally low-key criticism of the Governor. It was couched in humor, except for references to the New York City corruption investigations. He noted several times that the Governor was from Queens, where the scandals began unfolding, and added at one point, ''It seems to me that he might know what's going on.'' Later, in Albany, Mr. O'Rourke said: ''He's from Queens. It's impossible that he wouldn't know something about it.'' Recalling that he had appointed a former Democratic opponent, Ogden R. Reid, to investigate possible corruption in the construction of a Westchester garbage incinerator, Mr. O'Rourke said with a broad smile, ''I challenge Governor Cuomo to appoint Lew Lehrman to look into the problems of New York City.'' The Governor defeated Mr. Lehrman, a Republican, in the 1982 election. In response to questions, Mr. O'Rourke took direct issue with Governor Cuomo on three often heated subjects - the death penalty, legislation banning discrimination against homosexuals and the use of Medicaid funds for abortions. Mr. O'Rourke supports capital punishment and opposes the homosexual and abortion provisions. A spokesman for the Governor, Gary Fryer, said Mr. Cuomo would not comment on the O'Rourke statements. Even before the campaigning gets under way, the contest for Governor has taken on extra significance as Mr. Cuomo has emerged as a national figure for his outspoken views on major issues, even though he has said repeatedly that he is not a candidate for President. However, he has not ruled out such a candidacy. Both White House and Republican National Committee aides said they were watching the race closely. William Lacy, director of the White House office of political affairs, and William I. Greener, deputy chief of staff of the Republican National Committee, said they had talked to Mr. O'Rourke and his aides and would decide how much help to give him as the campaign developed. Mr. Lacy said Mr. O'Rourke's selection had ''averted disaster'' - token opposition to Mr. Cuomo. Republican and Conservative leaders who surrounded Mr. O'Rourke at a news conference in the Hotel Roosevelt viewed him as the point man in a state and national Republican effort to defeat the Governor or at least cut down the Cuomo victory margin in what could be one of the first skirmishes of the 1988 Presidential campaign. Has Met With President Mr. O'Rourke has met with the President at the White House and will be singled out by Mr. Reagan at a Republican fund-raising event in New York tomorrow, according to Mr. Lacy. Mr. O'Rourke referred to the Governor's ''national ambitions'' and set the state election in an ideological context when he said that beyond disagreements on specific issues with the Governor, ''the telling difference between us is our belief in the proper role for government.'' ''I believe that government ought to be like a good relative or close friend -always close at hand, ready to step in when needed or asked, but always sure to knock first,'' continued Mr. O'Rourke in an obvious allusion to the liberal Governor's frequent references to ''the family of New York'' and the need for compassionate government to help the less fortunate. Several Issues Cited On specific issues, Mr. O'Rourke said in his formal announcement at the Roosevelt that he would emphasize the ''staggering'' increases in state spending, high taxes, the state's handling of ''soaring'' increases in malpractice insurance and ''the exodus of industry and people'' from the state. He said state spending had jumped 43 percent during the Cuomo administration while inflation had increased 15 percent. He described Governor Cuomo's talk of ''fiscal responsibility and cost containment'' as ''hollow words.'' The Republican candidate charged that the Governor had at first delayed and then had stymied action on malpractice insurance. ''Is there anyone in charge at the Executive Mansion?'' he asked. He also said Mr. Cuomo had ''direct responsibility'' for cost overruns and delays at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, along the Hudson River on Manhattan's West Side. The construction was supervised by the State Urban Development Corporation. However, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a Republican, said later in a telephone interview that the overruns were modest in comparison with other large-scale public works projects and added, ''What the Governor could have done differently, I don't know.'' Mr. Regan had boasted in his 1982 television commercials of the convention center and his oversight of it. Despite his position on abortion, Mr. O'Rourke said he would not seek the Right-to-Life Party endorsement. Some of his advisers believe that the Right to Life line would ultimately cost him more votes than it would provide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV VIEW; BALANCED JOURNALISM NEEDN'T PRECLUDE A POINT OF VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/20/movies/tv-view-balanced-journalism-needn-t-preclude-a-point-of-view.html,"Once more an argument in public television; once more the same ramparts are mounted. The casus belli this time is ''Flashpoint - Israel and the Palestinians,'' two-and-a-half hours of recent prime-time programming that the Public Broadcasting Service called a brave new venture, and that some of its member stations rejected as not very good. ''Flashpoint'' was made up of two half-hour films that favored Israel, a one-hour film that did not, and some 30 minutes of chitchat and discussion. The main point of contention was the one-hour film, ''Occupied Palestine,'' an examination of the lives of Palestinians under Israeli rule. Some stations, WNET/Channel 13 among them, rejected it as biased. PBS said that bias was besides the point. ''Flashpoint,'' it said, was a noble experiment in ''free-speech television,'' a chance for partisans to express their views. Back off a moment now to get ''Flashpoint'' in perspective. It was put together by KQED in San Francisco, which has developed a format called ''theme night.'' In itself, this is not a terrible idea. On theme nights, independent film makers with opposing views on the same topic have an opportunity to have their films shown. The first theme night, ''The Abortion Battle,'' was presented by PBS last September. WNET and some other stations declined to show that, too. Undismayed, PBS pressed on with ''Flashpoint.'' Say immediately that, in terms of television, ''Flashpoint'' was not gripping stuff. It is unlikely that many viewers of the stations that showed it stayed around the full two-and-a-half hours. The first two works, ''Two Settlements: Etzion and Hebron'' and ''Peace Conflict,'' had all the intensity of industrial films that big corporations sometimes show new employees. In theory, they presented the uncensored views of highly partisan pro-Israel film makers. In reality, it was hard to find much that anyone, save Yasir Arafat, might have censored. The worst thing the two films did, journalistically speaking, was to give the religious right wing in Israel a free ride. In Israel, the religious right (and sometimes the secular left) is contentious. We didn't get much sense of this in the films. As propaganda, the films were pallid. ''Occupied Palestine,'' however, was more like the real thing. It did not quote the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' that famous anti-Semitic document, although it didn't miss it by much. At one point, a Palestinian defined Zionism as ''Jewish capital allied with international capitalism, allied with British imperialism.'' Somewhere the ghosts of old Nazis must have cheered. ''Occupied Palestine'' also spoke of the razing of Arab villages (''All who returned for their belongings were killed by the Jews,'' a Palestinian said) and quoted from what purported to be the 1948 diary of an Israeli soldier. Other soldiers, he supposedly wrote, smashed the skulls of Arab children. The commanding officer, meanwhile, threw two Arab children into a house and then blew it up. ''The fewer the Arabs who remained,'' he was quoted as saying, ''the better.'' A couple of things should be noted about this package. One is that the pro-Israel films were indeed pro-Israeli, but they weren't particularly anti-Palestinian or anti-Arab. ''Occupied Palestine,'' on the other hand, wasn't so much pro-Palestinian as it was anti-Israeli. Indeed, its denunciations sometimes looked very much like old-fashioned anti-Semitism dressed up in a new political nomenclature. At one point, it gave us a glimpse of a fund-raising dinner by American Jews. The money raised, ''Occupied Palestine'' strongly suggested, would be used to buy weapons to murder Arabs. We were not far removed here from the films produced under the Third Reich. Thus a question: Why was this shown? In a lofty message to its member stations, PBS said there were ''only two logically consistent grounds for objecting to 'Flashpoint.' '' One was that ''free-speech television, in which a small portion of the PBS schedule provides a format for the unvarnished expression of partisan views, is unworthy of even that small part of the schedule.'' The other was that ''the expression of such views'' should not be ''even an experimental part of public television's business.'' Anti-Semitism, apparently, did not count. At the same time, it seems fatuous to argue that public television needs a ''format for the unvarnished expression of partisan views.'' A format isn't needed; ordinary programs can be partisan enough. A recent half-hour film, ''Witness to Revolution: The Story of Anna Louise Strong,'' characterized the late Miss Strong as ''a woman ahead of her time,'' who left a ''legacy of social conscience and personal commitment.'' In real life, Miss Strong devoted herself to apologizing for Stalin and all his grisly works. Another recent film, ''Guatemala: When the Mountains Tremble,'' sanctified Guatemalan guerrillas and blamed the United States for the massacre of peasants. In fairness to PBS, it should be noted that it added a panel discussion to the Guatemala documentary. Some guest experts argued politely with the co-director about her sense of journalism. ''We wanted to give an emotional understanding,'' she replied. ''It was never meant to be a textbook account.'' She also spoke about the value of a ''highly lyric and stylized form of documentary.'' This was nothing more than a defense of documentaries as vanity films: It doesn't matter what a documentary says, but only how it says it; truth is not determined by facts. Meanwhile, responding to criticism of public television, Barry Chase, a PBS vice president, agreed in a recent newspaper interview that there did seem to be a problem. ''The imbalance'' among documentary makers, he was quoted as saying, ''at the moment is toward the left.'' Apparently, not many conservatives produce documentaries. One supposes that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which disburses Federal funding to PBS, could begin an affirmative-action program for conservatives, but it is unlikely this will happen. On the other hand, there is a way out. If we accept the premise that news and public-affairs programs should receive Federal subsidies (which does, after all, blur an American tradition about an independent press) it is reasonable to insist that the programs practice balanced journalism. This does not mean that programs cannot take a point of view. The notion that a film maker must dispense with journalistic canons to produce, for example, a documentary sympathetic to Palestinians, or critical of Israelis, is nonsense. A recent PBS documentary, ''The Paper Curtain,'' proved this. It took a point of view: The ideological exclusion clauses of the McCarran-Walter Act should be suspended; foreigners should not be denied visas to the United States because of their political beliefs. At the same time, the documentary practiced balanced journalism. The documentary maker, Paul Lewis of station WXXI in Rochester, put the issue in perspective, and then he made his case. This was responsible journalism. Partisan vanity films are the last refuge of the journalistic hack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE AMERICAN WOMAN'S LIBERATION: IS IT A MYTH?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/21/style/the-american-woman-s-liberation-is-it-a-myth.html,"In 1939, American women earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by men. Forty-seven years later, after a world war, a sexual revolution and the emergence of the most radical and vocal feminist movement in the world, American women earn 64 cents for every dollar. How could the discrepancy have changed so little in almost half a century? The economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett, who uses these figures in her new book, ''A Lesser Life: The Myth of Women's Liberation in America'' (William Morrow, $17.95). says part of the blame lies with the American women's movement. Female writers and leaders of the women's movement have had passionate and sharply divided reactions to the book. Several well-known feminists, such as Robin Morgan and Betty Friedan, have criticized it harshly. ''I'm accused of blaming the victim,'' Dr. Hewlett said in a recent interview. ''But the women's movement is not the victim. The victim is the American working woman and her children.'' Dr. Hewlett said that women's movements here and abroad had traditionally sought to improve women's lives through different strategical approaches, breaking into two major camps: those activists who fought for legal and psychological equality, and those who worked to achieve social reform and material benefits. In Western Europe, she maintained, social reform was the dominant strain since the beginning of the century.Reform was effected mostly by having a women's section within the established organs of power - the political parties and the labor unions - that fought to institute special benefits for women to ease their double burden as workers and mothers. In the United States, the emphasis, especially in the feminist revival that began in the 1960's, was raised consciousness and a fight for equality by pressure groups who agitated outside the structures of power. ''Now a lot of the evidence is in,'' Dr. Hewlett said, and she has concluded, after three years of research, that American working mothers have fallen behind their European counterparts in social benefits and general quality of life. Bleak Economic Future An economist and vice president of the United Nations Economic Policy Council, Dr. Hewlett has marshaled a wealth of statistical data and cross-cultural studies to support her contention that American women and children face bleak and deteriorating economic futures. Why? Isn't America one of the world's most child-oriented countries? Not really, Dr. Hewlett points out. Seventy-seven percent of this nation's poverty is borne by women and children. Aren't American women the most independent and liberated in the world? Fifty percent of American marriages end in divorce, Dr. Hewlett answers. Afterward, the standard of living of ex-husbands rises 42 percent while that of wives and children falls 73 percent. What about fathers? Aren't they the most involved and helpful, compared with those in the more traditional European countries? Two-thirds of custodial mothers receive no child support, Dr. Hewlett answers. Forty-nine percent of American fathers don't see their children for at least a year after a divorce. Don't we have the most radical and effective women's movement, materially improving the lives of millions of women? Maternity Leave In the United States, Dr. Hewlett points out, more than 60 percent of working mothers have no right to any maternity leave, which is a basic guarantee in 117 nations. Social support for working mothers in the form of high-quality child care, free prenatal and delivery costs, flexible work schedules and financial support to divorced mothers of small children, all of which are guaranteed in most Western European democracies, are still unavailable in this country. ''There is a great deal of public piety in this country,'' Dr. Hewlett said, ''but very little public policy.'' She believes that the lack of social supports for working mothers stems from three sources. ''First,'' Dr. Hewlett said, ''we have this baroque 1950's vision of domesticity in this country. We had a baby boom that was 20 years long. Many policy makers see the 1950's as the golden era. Day care became a dirty word in the 50's, and this attitude still persists.'' Second, Dr. Hewlett said, she believes the Reagan Administration bears additional responsibility for undermining the relatively small safety net for women that did exist. She points to a cutback on nutrition programs for pregnant women, and the fact that 25 percent less public money goes into day care now than in 1980. Third, she feels that the women's movement, by concentrating on equality, on ''cloning the male model,'' forgot that most women need social support if they are to have an equal chance to compete with men in the job market. ''Many women's leaders in the late 1960's were fleeing the Norman Rockwell world of the 50's,'' Dr. Hewlett said, ''and families were seen as the problem, not the solution. We attempted to be men much more aggressively than European women did. We forgot that 90 percent of us have children and that unless we help women resolve their double burden as mothers and workers they are bound to remain second-class citizens.'' She points out that 73 percent of American mothers now work outside the family, mostly because they have to. Dr. Hewlett has an answer for the argument that equal opportunity would rule out unequal treatment in the form of special privileges for women. ''I'm interested in equal results,'' she said, ''not only equal treatment.'' Betty Friedan, who in her 1981 book, ''The Second Stage,'' also supported child-care programs and the restructuring of work, home and family to ease domestic burdens, defends the drive for equality by the American women's movement, especially its emphasis on passing the Federal equal rights amendment. ''Sylvia Hewlett says women shouldn't fight for equality,'' she said. ''She wants to go back to reactionary things like getting special protection for women. But these things are all wrong. They have to be sought only in the name of equality. If these are asked for only as protection for women, it would give employers reason not to hire women, as they did before we demanded equality and forced them to open up more jobs and positions for women.'' Dr. Hewlett acknowledges that American women are far ahead of their European contemporaries in one way: greater access to jobs and promotions in the private sector. But she makes a passionate case for realigning the movement's priorities toward social supports that would strengthen the American family, a goal she claims most women share. ''By largely ignoring working mothers and their children, the women's movement has allowed the ultra-right to take over the family,'' she said. ''Even the terminology -prolife, profamily - became rightist slogans. I think that's why the membership of NOW has dropped by one-third since 1980. I think it's because of the almost exclusive concentration on abortion rights and E.R.A. We should march for abortion rights, but also for prenatal care and maternity benefits. We would get more support. I am a feminist. I would like to see the movement more vigorous.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Issue Weaves an Intricate Web,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/22/us/abortion-issue-weaves-an-intricate-web.html,"More than two years after the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of four key civil rights laws, an effort in Congress to overturn that decision has evolved into one of the most tortuous legislative dramas in recent memory. The drama may soon enter its last act unless the bill's supporters, in negotiations under way, manage to free it from the political web of abortion and religion in which it is enmeshed. If this were simply a matter of a bill that was dying for lack of support, the story might be important but hardly novel. But the Civil Rights Restoration Act is a bill, or at least a concept, that nearly everyone claims to favor. The House of Representatives, where the bill now lies dormant, actually passed it once, in June 1984, by a vote of 375 to 34. It never came to a vote that year in the Senate and so had to be reintroduced the next year in the House, where it is now a case study in the power of the abortion issue in Congress to derail almost any legislative effort. Grove City College v. Bell The Supreme Court decision that started the debate, Grove City College v. Bell, had nothing to do with abortion. The Justices were called on to interpret Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a law that bars sex discrimination in schools and colleges receiving Federal financial assistance. The Court ruled on Feb. 28, 1984 that only the specific department or program receiving Federal funds, rather than the institution as a whole, was barred from discriminating. Since athletic departments, for example, rarely receive Federal money, colleges were freed of the obligation to provide equal opportunity for women in their sports programs. The decision accepted the Reagan Administration's view of the law and rejected the view presented by a large bipartisan group in Congress. By a vote of 414 to 8, the House had passed a resolution affirming that the scope of Title IX was institution-wide. Congress submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to that effect signed by 49 Senators and Representatives, among them Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is now the Senate majority leader. The fallout from the Grove City decision extended beyond education because three other important civil rights laws are worded in a similar fashion. The Reagan Administration announced that it would also give a narrow reading to the laws barring discrimination against the handicapped, discrimination on the basis of age and discrimination based on race in federally backed programs. The Civil Rights Restoration Act would overturn the Grove City decision by stating that all four laws bar discrimination by entire institutions, not just by individual programs. While none of the four laws say anything about abortion, regulations adopted in 1975 to implement the education law require schools and colleges to treat all pregnancy-related conditions, including ''termination of pregnancy,'' like any other temporary disability for the purposes of their employee medical insurance plan, sick leave and student health services. In 1985, the United States Catholic Conference, which had supported the restoration bill in 1984, asked for an amendment to remove abortion from the scope of this protection. ''We didn't catch it the first time around,'' the Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, an official of the Catholic Conference in charge of social and political issues, said last week in explaining the changed position. Catholic institutions themselves have always been exempt from the regulation under a separate provision of Title IX that insures that schools controlled by religious organizations will not have to violate their ''religious tenets.'' But once aware of the regulation, Father Hehir said, ''we couldn't have the bishops in the position of agreeing that abortion is like everything else,'' even for non-Catholic institutions, ''when we believe that abortion is not like everything else.'' Some who have followed the issue speculate that the change reflected internal church politics, notably the heightened priority the anti-abortion effort assumed in the 1984 Presidential election. In any event, the church's new stance made the bill a lightning rod for anti-abortion sentiment, and the 1984 majority evaporated. The House Education and Labor Committee, sharing jurisdiction over the bill with the Judiciary Committee, adopted two amendments. One in effect overturned the regulation. The other broadened the ''religious tenet'' exemption by freeing from compliance with the law those institutions ''affiliated with'' as well as those ''controlled by'' a religious organization. The Judiciary Committee rejected both amendments, and suddenly one bill had become two. The Judiciary Committee version, essentially the bill that passed in 1984, lacks the votes to pass today. The Education and Labor Committee version could probably pass, but the bill's original sponsors, including the women's and civil rights groups that helped draft it, view the amended bill as an anti-abortion vehicle and do not want to bring it to the floor. The episode has severely strained the customary civil rights coalition, of which the Catholic Conference is a long-time, active member. Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an umbrella organization of 185 groups that includes the Catholic Conference, said: ''Regrettably, the Catholic Conference, with its rich civil rights heritage, is being used as a legitimate front by those who seek to kill the bill.'' No one is willing to predict what will happen next except that time will run out if there is no movement within the next month or so. Only quick action by the House can preserve a chance of getting a bill through the Senate, where the climate is even more hostile. Several members of the House Democratic leadership have been trying quietly for the last few months to devise compromise language. Among them are Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the majority whip, and Representative Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio, secretary of the Democratic Caucus. Both are Roman Catholics; Miss Oakar opposes public funding for abortion, and Mr. Foley describes himself as having a ''100 percent pro-choice voting record.'' 'A Question of Conscience' ''I think we're getting close,'' Mr. Foley said. Abortion ''is an issue on which the leadership simply cannot draw a line in the sand,'' he added. ''It's a question of conscience, of judgment, and when you try to force the issue you can't pass a thing.'' According to Miss Oakar, ''Everyone has lost sight of the focal point -getting a bill.'' ''I think it's possible to find language that everyone can live with,'' she said. ''They don't have to love it, they just have to be willing to agree to it for the sake of the larger picture.'' ''I just wish the abortion issue would go away,'' she said, adding: ''But it never will.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Ohio Abortion Law On Minors Is Overturned,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/23/us/around-the-nation-ohio-abortion-law-on-minors-is-overturned.html,"A Federal district judge today declared unconstitutional Ohio's one-month-old law requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Judge Ann Aldrich said the law violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. ''Since requiring the physician to effect notification may add to the cost of abortion procedures, while the state's interest is minimal, this provision unduly burdens a minor woman's right to choose an abortion,'' Judge Aldrich said. Judge Aldrich granted a request for a permanent injunction to the Ohio Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed suit March 21 on behalf of an Akron abortion clinic and two unidentified 17-year-old girls.

FIGURE IN SPY CASE TELLS OF ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/24/us/figure-in-spy-case-tells-of-abortion.html,"Svetlana Ogorodnikov, a Russian emigre who pleaded guilty last year to espionage charges linked to Richard W. Miller, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified today at his espionage trial that another bureau agent had taken her to a doctor for an abortion. Both Mrs. Ogorodnikov and Mr. Miller have admitted they had a sexual relationship, and in her first day of testimony Tuesday in Federal District Court she said she had also had a sexual relationship with a second agent, John E. Hunt. Mrs. Ogorodnikov said today that it was Mr. Hunt who took her to the doctor for an abortion, but she did not identify the father of the child she was carrying. Mrs. Ogorodnikov also testified that Mr. Hunt had lived in fear of being killed by agents of the Central Intelligence Agency. She said that their social and sexual relationship continued over a period of weeks in 1982. Ogorodnikovs Pleaded Guilty Mrs. Ogorodnikov and her husband, Nikolay, interrupted their trial last June to plead guilty to espionage charges that stemmed from her relationship with Mr. Miller in 1984. He was a counterintelligence agent in the bureau's Los Angeles office before being dismissed and charged with espionage in the same case. Mrs. Ogorodnikov is serving an 18-year Federal prison sentence. Her husband is serving an eight-year term. Mr. Miller, who is on trial for the second time, is accused espionage, passing a classified document to a foreign power and bribery, but he contends that he was trying to use his relationship with Mrs. Ogorodnikov to infiltrate the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency. Mr. Miller's lawyers have called Mrs. Ogorodnikov as a defense witness in an effort to support this contention. Mr. Miller's first trial ended last November with the jury deadlocked. Couple Called 'Utility Agents' The Government contends that Mr. Miller, who was a 20-year bureau veteran, was lured by Mrs. Ogorodnikov and her husband into passing secret bureau documents to the K.G.B. Federal prosecutors have described the Russian couple as ''utility agents,'' or part-time agents, for the K.G.B. Mr. Hunt, who retired from the bureau in 1984, has said that his relationship with Mrs. Ogorodnikov was purely professional, aimed at making her a bureau informer. However, he said he gave up the effort because he found he could not determine her loyalties. Mrs. Ogorodnikov was an expressive witness, at times speaking in Russian in a husky voice, with a translater interpreting, and at other times in heavily accented English, and at times sighing or whispering. 'Maybe I Remember' If she faltered in her account, she frequently addressed herself to Joel Levine, Mr. Miller's lawyer, saying, ''If you remind me, maybe I remember.'' Responding to Mr. Levine's questioning, Mrs. Ogorodnikov testified that Mr. Hunt took her to see a Los Angeles doctor because ''I was pregnant.'' She was not asked by Mr. Levine who the father was. Asked why Mr. Hunt took her to the doctor, Mrs. Ogorodnikov said, ''He was my man.'' She said she had an abortion and that Mr. Hunt paid for it. According to Mrs. Ogorodnikov's testimony, the doctor who performed the abortion is now dead. Mr. Hunt testified at the trial of Mrs. Ogorodikov and her husband, before they pleaded guilty, that he had taken her to see a doctor when she had complained of suffering from ''a rare blood disease.'' Shortly before testifying about the pregnancy, Mrs. Ogorodnikov seemed to fight back tears and asked for a brief break to compose herself. She Tells of Agent's Fear Mrs. Ogorodnikov also described Mr. Hunt as a man increasingly distraught and fearful of another arm of United States intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency. She told the jury that Mr. Hunt had placed greater and greater pressure on her to feed him information about Soviet activities in this country. She said that they broke off their relationship because both their spouses were suspicious. She testified that Mr. Hunt ''was crying frequently'' and was often angry. ''He was afraid of the C.I.A.,'' she said. ''He offered me to go to another city with him and if possible another country, but his people will find him anyway and they will kill him.'' ----New Test for Walker SAN FRANCISCO, April 23 (UPI) -John A. Walker Jr., who confessed espionage, has said in a new polygraph test that his former Navy friend, Jerry A. Whitworth, sold him classified material, according to prosecution papers filed today. Results of the polygraph, or lie-detector, test, administered within the past week, were disclosed in papers filed by an assistant United States Attorney, William Farmer, in the espionage trial of Mr. Whitworth. The new examination was part of a Government effort to prevent an earlier polygraph test of Mr. Walker from being brought into the trial of Mr. Whitworth. The defense wants to use the results of the earlier test in an effort to show Mr. Walker did not answer some of the questons honestly. Questions specifically naming Mr. Whitworth were posed to Mr. Walker in the latest test for the first time, according to court papers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRIEST REFUSES TO RECANT VIEWS ON SEX ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/us/priest-refuses-to-recant-views-on-sex-issues.html,"A priest at the Catholic University of America says he will not recant his views on sexual issues despite a threat by the Vatican to strip him of his standing as a Roman Catholic theologian. In a letter released today, the priest, the Rev. Charles Curran, again demanded to be told what rules he had broken. He called the threatened action ''an injustice to me and harmful to the credibility of the church.'' Father Curran also renewed his offer to refrain from teaching sexual ethics classes at the church-chartered university here, a compromise he said had already been rejected by the church. A seven-year Vatican investigation of the priest has focused on his views on birth control, divorce, abortion and other practices forbidden by the church. He maintains that, in some instances, they are morally justified. Meeting in Rome Cited Father Curran said in the letter, which was requested by his main accuser, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, that he was grateful for being allowed to make his case at a meeting last month in Rome. Cardinal Ratzinger heads Pope John Paul II's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. But the priest added that ''both good theology and justice demand'' that he be told on what grounds the Vatican could threaten to punish him for dissenting from church teachings that have not been declared infallible. The letter to Cardinal Ratzinger was released by Friends of American Catholic Theology, a group that supports Father Curran. The group also released statements to Cardinal Ratzinger in which 727 members of the Catholic Theological Society of America or the College Theology Society said they were ''profoundly disturbed'' by the threatened punishment. University administrators have said Father Curran could not teach theology at the school if his theological authority were removed. They have also said he could remain in another department, but he has rejected that idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/books/in-short-fiction.html,"BRAVO BURNING. By Donald Tate. (Scribners, $15.95.) The most striking thing about this first novel by a former Vietnam War reporter is the blustering vitality of its style. In the voice of Pvt. Michael Ripp, unwilling 1967 recruit into Uncle Sam's Army, Donald Tate writes a brilliant version of the profane, jargony black humor that seems to be a necessary gambit of ordinary men facing the realities of war. The soldier's language of coping, one might call it. Drafted at 23 out of a Louisiana town in which, he says, ''for a golden glimpse my American Dream future stretched before me like a shining track,'' Ripp tries unsuccessfully to get out of serving in Vietnam. His adored sex-bomb of a wife, he explains in vain to his superiors, says that without him she won't have the baby she is carrying. On the eve of his first big encounter with the enemy, Ripp receives a letter telling him his wife has miscarried and that she is leaving him. Forgetting his fear, he blindly kills 30, maybe 40 Vietcong, throwing live grenades back at the enemy. Quickly surrounded on the hill they had fought so hard to take, his company is ruthlessly beaten back, with Michael Ripp one of the few survivors. Home minus a leg, his wife - and, I'm afraid, his sexual potency - he goes to Washington to receive the Medal of Honor. (The novel is loosely conceived as his recollection of the events leading to that visit.) Although many of the situations and characters are familiar, Mr. Tate mixes a few unsettling surprises into his formula. And in charting the emotional odyssey - from confused fear to confused bitterness - of a simple man forced into a nightmare, he conveys the horror of war with gruesome, at times dazzling, power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'A Lesser Life',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/books/l-a-lesser-life-441986.html,"To the Editor: Sylvia Law's review of ''A Lesser Life'' misconstrues the author's point that though it has been a long, hard struggle for feminists one cannot deny that their highest priorities have been and are the equal rights amendment and abortion rights. Their efforts have in fact neglected the family. Sylvia Law implies that the author believes Western Europe is a paradise for women; in fact, Sylvia Ann Hewlett simply points out that Western Europe is a lot better off than the United States. Economic and demographic trends of the past two decades have led to the rapid influx of women into the labor force and to the growth of the two-paycheck and single-parent families. Most of Western Europe has responded to these changes by policies that help parents integrate work and family responsibilities; the United States has not. In Italy, for example, women earn 86 cents to the man's dollar, while in America - the land of opportunity for all -women earn 64 cents to the man's dollar (the same ratio as in 1939). How can we truly achieve equality? We must recognize our biological differences. Women are equal to men, but we must admit that we are differ ent. Ninety percent of working women will bear at least one child while employed and there are currently 8.5 million children under 6 with working mothers. We need policy actions that invest in our children. After all, they are our future work force. ''A Lesser Life'' not only meshes the personal with the political but also contains proposed recommendations for action by business and labor leaders.ROSE CARCATERRA Brooklyn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THEATER; 'CARELESS LOVE': SOAP OPERA IN STAMFORD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/nyregion/theater-careless-love-soap-opera-in-stamford.html,"JACK is a struggling actor. Martha is an aspiring dancer who works as a waitress. Martha is pregnant. Yes, Jack is the father-to-be. Whatever will they do now? Live together? Get married? What are the other alternatives? Abortion? Adoption? The play that presents the dilemma and drones on to a hasty resolution is John Olive's ''Careless Love'' at the Hartman Theater in Stamford. The title smacks of soap operas and low-grade movies, and Mr. Olive might have been better off if he settled for those simple genres. Actually, careless is the word to describe the play's construction and characterizations. Five minutes before the plot, such as it is, starts, one already feels suffocated by Jack's introductory speech. Beware of actors who talk at us, as if they were message-bearing writers. In Jack's fancy monologue, he refers to cosmic concerns and ''plastic flowers.'' The latter image is supposed to represent a social, not to mention pseudo-poetic, comment. It is not brought up again until the last scene. By the time the windy but mercifully short evening - less than two hours - is over, Jack has referred to the unborn child as a ''small version of yourself'' and as a product of his own ''creative egotism.'' Mr. Olive's repetitious, calculated and careless dialogue is alienating, not involving, and the director, Margaret Booker, has not personalized it. Now that telephone-answering machines have become more a necessity than an accessory, writers of two-character plays, wherein the telephone is all too often the convenient third character, have a handy new device. Martha leaves message after message on Jack's machine. One wonders whether there would even be a play if Jack did not leave his machine on. At one point, he forgets, so they talk about that. Of course, the issues here are clear. All too rarely Mr. Olive handles them humorously. ''You get guilty; I get pregnant,'' Martha tells Jack, impatiently. Mostly, though, the problems are dealt with pompously. Jack informs Martha that she has as much responsibility as he does. Then there are the mundane but very pressing worries over money. These are so easily resolved that they turn out not to matter - and the resolution is unbelievable. What one assumes concerns Mr. Olive - the commitment to a relationship and the readiness to have a child - is touched on pointlessly, perfunctorily. The plastic life style in Los Angeles - what the flower image is supposed to be about - comes off as a contrived afterthought. Putting down Los Angeles, where Jack goes for an audition, has become tiresome. Lines such as ''Los Angeles is the only city in the world with rabies'' do not even make sense. A graphic description of an abortion turns out to be irrelevant, mostly because Mr. Olive cannot seem to get a handle on Jack and Martha as real people. Conflicts summed by such pat statements as, ''I am an actor; I cannot be a father,'' are unclear, unexplained - and then turn out to be contradicted. Change is human; the unexpected can be expected. However, the changes in Mr. Olive's characters appear to be in accordance with a playwright's whim, not a person's doubt or decisiveness. When Martha arrives at her decision, it isso abrupt, one is not convinced it is really hers. It just ends the play, occurring, as it does, in the last scene, with no buildup or payoff. The role of Martha is at once arduous and thankless. With her impish qualities, she is supposed to be enchanting, much like Gittel in ''Two for the Seasaw.'' Kelly Curtis, the daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, works at it conscientously, but the playwright lets Martha down and neither the actress nor the director can muster the resources to pick her up and dust her off. Miss Booker's superimposed farcical touches appear forced. Martha, unexpected, is asleep on the couch and Jack stumbles upon her. Jack opens the door, carrying the bag from the supermarket. Martha, once again unexpectedly, is behind it. Jack falls on the floor. The play is full of references to Jack's auditions and appearances -in a pizza commercial, in industrial shows, in ''Mother Courage,'' in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' ''Tartuffe,'' and something called ''Middle Criminals.'' It is all a lot of ''in'' talk, of interest only to actors. Jack, played by Bruce Gooch, is most convincing when he admits he does not know what he is talking about, as when he has had too many beers. Too bad it also falls upon the character to declare, ''I'm a very good actor.'' What is worse, he is burdened with having to promise that he will give ''the performance of a lifetime'' at one point. This is simply not fair to Mr. Gooch. Nor is ''Careless Love'' fair to the audience. Do not expect a romantic comedy or a realistic drama here. Mr. Olive has emphasized the latter with a dollop of the former and succeeded in coming up with neither.

IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/books/in-short-fiction-972686.html,"PRIZE STORIES 1986: The O. Henry Awards. Edited by William Abrahams. (Doubleday, $17.95.) In his introduction to the 66th O. Henry Award prize stories, William Abrahams laments the way writers today stress artifice at the expense of truth. He wants to ''open the windows and let life in,'' and the 19 stories he has chosen from more than 100 magazines address serious issues: race relations, homosexuality, battered women, divorce. The pregnant stand-up comic in ''The Comedian,'' by John L'Heureux, reflects that ''the only subject you can't make a good joke about is abortion.'' But the biggest issue for these writers is the Vietnam War, which looms behind at least five of the stories. ''I believe in Vietnam,'' says the grandmother in Stephanie Vaughn's superb ''Kid MacArthur,'' which is about an Army brat bred for battle, who only survives the war physically. In Bobbie Ann Mason's ''Big Bertha Stories'' a veteran tells his wife and son tall tales about a huge strip-mining machine. ''Strip mining is just like what we were doing over there,'' he explains. ''We were stripping off the top. . . . Here, at least the coal companies have to plant vetch and loblolly pines.'' Since most of these stories hinge on what happens to family ties in the face of extreme experience, it is fitting that first prize was awarded to Alice Walker's ''Kindred Spirits,'' which recounts a family's resentment at the daughter-sister-niece who writes stories about them. The main formal characteristic these stories share is (in homage to O. Henry perhaps) the surprise - or enigmatic, or missing - ending. Stuart Dybek's brief, exquisite ''Pet Milk'' has the most inventive conclusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RHODE ISLAND AT 350: ECONOMY (AND SCANDALS) UP,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/us/rhode-island-at-350-economy-and-scandals-up.html,"This was supposed to be a good year for Rhode Island. The tiniest state is celebrating the 350th anniversary of its founding by Roger Williams. After decades of industrial decline, Rhode Island's economy seems to have finally turned around. For the first time in recent years, per capita income now exceeds the national average, its tax burden has dropped below the national average and in March its unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent, the fifth best figure in the country. Gov. Edward D. DiPrete has public opinion polls on his desk showing that two-thirds of Rhode Island's 955,000 residents now ''feel good'' about their state, as against only one-third in 1984, before he was elected. But the mood of celebration has been dampened by an extraordinary series of scandals and trials. They have touched many of Rhode Island's most prominent public figures and institutions, including the state's Chief Justice, a Bishop of the Roman Catholic church, Brown University and the Fleet National Bank, the state's largest. 'Malfeasance and Corruption' The scandals have been so pervasive, said J. Stanley Lemons, a professor of history at Rhode Island College in Providence, that ''they seem to confirm Rhode Island's reputation for malfeasance and corruption.'' It is a mark that dates to the 17th century when the state was known as ''Rogues' Island'' because of the haven it offered pirates. In recent years Providence has been the headquarters for organized crime in New England. The cases have also touched off bitter disputes. When the Fleet National Bank and three of its vice presidents were indicted earlier this month in connection with a scandal at a state agency that grants low-interest mortgages to qualified home buyers, the bank charged it was the victim of a ''politically motivated witch hunt.'' In turn, the state Attorney General, Arlene Violet, a Republican and a former Roman Catholic nun, has accused the bank of trying to frustrate the investigation by withholding records subpoeaned by a grand jury. In addition to the bank officers implicated in the case, Governor DiPrete's former chief of staff, Robert D. Murray, was found guilty of filing false documents to obtain a low-interest mortgage from the agency, the Rhode Island Housing Mortgage Finance Corporation. A state trooper who once chauffered the Governor pleaded guilty to the same charge. Testimony by Crime Figures Chief Justice Joseph A. Bevilacqua has been embroiled in a prolonged dispute over charges that he has links to mobsters. Last year he was censured and left the bench for four months after an investigation by a special state tribunal into allegations that he violated the canons of judicial ethics. When Chief Justice Bevilacqua, former speaker of the state House of Representatives, decided to return to the bench last Novemeber, impeachment proceedings were initiated against him by the Legislature. The Sons of Italy, a fraternal organization, protested that the Chief Justice was being unfairly persecuted. The House Judiciary Committee, in preliminary hearings on the Bevilacqua case this spring, has heard from a stream of organized crime figures. The atmosphere in Rhode Island has become so highly charged that even Bishop Louis E. Gelineau, the Roman Catholic bishop of Providence, recently took to television to deny rumors that he had been arrested. The rumors arose after three parish priests and a religious brother who is the principal of a Catholic high school were charged with sexual misconduct with children. One priest, the Rev. Paul H. Leech, has been convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. 'A Diocese in Total Disarray' The Bishop's position is particularly sensitive because 65 percent of Rhode Island's population is Catholic. The state's Catholic community has also been shaken by a number of other disputes, including an order by Bishop Gelineau that forced Attorney General Violet and Elizabeth Morancy, a Democractic state representive, to resign from their religious orders. Earlier this year the church disclosed that Mary Ann Sorrentino, a Catholic who is director of the state's Planned Parenthood Federation, had been excommunicated because she does not oppose abortion. ''This is a diocese in total disarray with its own dirty linen to keep clean,'' Mrs. Sorrentino said in an interview. ''It's a puzzlement that they focus on women when there are such problems in the hierarchy of the diocese. You'll notice that the church hasn't taken any action against the doctors and hospital administrators who are directly connected with abortion. Why not? It's because they are men and powerful.'' And there are more scandals. This month a prominent heart surgeon, Dr. Felix M. Balasco, was sentenced in Federal District Court in Providence to 10 years in prison for taking kickbacks to implant pacemakers in the hearts of elderly patients who did not need them. A female senior at Brown University, Dana E. Smith, and a Providence insurance agent have been indicted for participating in a prostitution ring. The agent, Stanley Henshaw 3d, is a past president of the Rhode Island State Association of Life Underwriters. Smallness May be a Factor Why are there so many scandals in Rhode Island, which is only 48 miles from top to bottom and 37 miles across at its widest point? Fourteen national parks are bigger. Some residents think its size is a key factor. ''In a sense, we're a city-state where interrelatedness is a phenomenon of the place,'' said State Representative Morancy. ''If you don't know someone, you know someone who does.'' In such a small environment, she said, things tend to get magnified and news travels fast. Mr. Lemons, the history professor, who is the co-author of a history of Rhode Island, says he believes that ''some of what's happened is coincidental.'' He also traces the problem to Rhode Island's past. Williams, the founder, arrived here after Massachusetts ousted him for sedition and heresy. Tradition of Selling Votes In the 17th century, ministers in other New England settlements often refered to Rhode Island as ''The isle of errors'' or ''the sink into which all the other colonies dump their heretics,'' Mr. Lemons recalled. Late in the 17th century, as Newport catered to visiting pirates like Captain William Kidd, it earned the nickname ''Rogues' Island.'' More important, Mr. Lemons suggested, was that in the two decades before the American Revolution, Rhode Island held elections for governor that were marked by open vote buying. ''It was the Yankees who started the practice,'' Mr. Lemons said. In the 19th century, as Irish and French-Canadian immigrants arrived, the Democrats and Republicans vied to buy their votes. Rhode Island developed such a reputation for political corruption that in 1905 Lincoln Steffens wrote an article about it called ''A State For Sale.'' But the current crop of scandals is almost enough to make people forget Claus von Bulow, the Newport socialite who was acquitted after two trials on charges of trying to murder his wealthy wife. Former Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. of Providence, who resigned after pleading no contest to charges of assaulting his wife's lover with help from a policeman, has reappeared as a popular radio talk show host. Mr. Lemons and Governor DiPrete argue that the current impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice Bevilacqua represent progress. ''In the past,'' said Mr. DiPrete, ''you could never have gotten the Legislature to take this kind of action.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW G.O.P. GROUP CRITICIZES RIGHT AND IS ASSAILED IN TURN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/28/us/new-gop-group-criticizes-right-and-is-assailed-in-turn.html,"Amid criticism from the right, some self-described mainstream Republicans have held their first national convention here. Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, founder of the group, the Republican Mainstream Committee, was among those who applauded the growth of the Republican Party under President Reagan, but expressed concern that conservative ideologues might try to force progressives and moderates out of the party. ''The question is whether we should have a party that is exclusive or inclusive,'' Mr. Leach said, warning that overreliance on one strain of political philosophy might weaken the Republican Party by making it vulnerable to extremism. Mr. Leach assailed a conservative political action committee, the United Republican Fund of Illinois, for holding a news conference at which Thomas F. Roeser, president of the City Club of Chicago, called the new group ''about as mainstream as Walter Mondale'' and ''a liberal, left-leaning adjunct of the Democratic Party.'' Accusation of Suppression Mr. Leach said the conservative group was trying to suppress the views of Republicans who did not agree with it. ''There have been hundreds and hundreds of conservative Republican meetings,'' he said. ''I don't know of one that had a counter news conference.'' Only one probable Republican Presidential aspirant, former Gov. Pierre S. du Pont 4th of Delaware, accepted an invitation to speak to the Republican Mainstream Committee. And even Mr. du Pont attended the conservatives' news conference. His speech to the Mainstream Committee on Saturday was met with polite applause, but it appeared to disappoint many delegates. ''Frankly, America is finding a clarity in the candor of the conservative movement,'' Mr. du Pont told his audience. He challenged the group on several policy issues, including what he saw as the Mainstream Committee's tolerance of tax increases, lack of commitment to a strong military and unwillingness to support military aid to the rebels in Nicaragua. The group, which apparently seeks to attract a broader constituency than the longstanding Ripon Society of liberal Republicans, with which it has no formal connection, ended its convention today. ----Maine Republicans Meet PORTLAND, Me., April 27 - Three thousand Republican delegates closed their state convention here today, agreeing that their prime concern is regaining the Governor's mansion after 20 years out of power. Their actions included endorsing a conservative platform while rejecting amendments that would have taken stances against obscenity and abortion. Much of the attention went to John R. McKernan Jr., a Congressman, and Porter D. Leighton, a former regional official with the United States General Services Administration, who will face off in June for the gubernatorial nomination. Mr. Leighton told delegates he was one of ''a new breed of Republicans who are fed up with politics as usual and who are fed up with special interests.'' He called for lower taxes and contended that his experience with the Federal agency that oversees buildings and equipment could help him make ''government more efficient, more effective, more compassionate.'' Representative McKernan said he was ''happy to be coming home after four years in Washington, to lead Maine into the 1980's.'' The plank on abortion that was omitted from the platform would have affirmed Republican support for ''protection of life for the aged and the unborn.'' Opponents said that abortion was a personal, not a political, issue, and did not belong in the platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABOUT EDUCATION; WHAT IS PROPER ROLE FOR EDUCATION DEPARTMENT?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/29/science/about-education-what-is-proper-role-for-education-department.html,"NEW controversy has erupted over the role of the Federal Department of Education. Is its task primarily to administer programs enacted and funded by Congress? Or should it seek to influence what schools and colleges teach? Two recent incidents have angered those who believe that the Federal Government should not try to impose its views on teaching and curriculum. In Denver, the department's regional office circulated a report critical of the University of Denver's Center for Teaching International Relations. The center trains high school teachers in international affairs. In Washington, Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Connecticut Republican who heads the Senate Education appropriations subcommittee, attacked the department for what he considered an improper critique of American history textbooks. In both instances, the department's critics were concerned that it was trying to impose conservative doctrine on the schools. The Denver case was touched off by a report, ''Blowing the Whistle on 'Global Education,' '' written by Gregg Cunningham, a lawyer for the department's regional office. The document denounced instruction given to the high school teachers as ''capitulationist'' and ''anticapitalistic.'' It charged that in dealing with the threat of nuclear war, the program ignores ''any discussion of the value of freedom as a concept worthy of the ultimate sacrifice'' and that ''life after global war is invariably described in the most horrific possible terms, but life after the loss of liberty is never mentioned.'' Mr. Cunningham denounces as ''pacifistic'' a listing of strategies for the resolution of international conflict, which includes nonviolence, bargaining and compromise. He revives charges that American liberals delivered China to Communism by using their influence ''to bring down Chiang Kai-shek'' and that they invited disaster in the Philippines by opposing Ferdinand E. Marcos. On human rights, Mr. Cunningham complains that the center fails to deal with ''the rights of the unborn'' by not opposing abortion. University spokesmen, rejecting the charges, called the center's approach ''balanced.'' Andrew F. Smith, president of Global Perspectives in Education, which promotes a knowledge of world affairs in the schools, also rejected the charges. Mr. Smith is the former director of the Denver University center. In Washington, Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said that the report did not represent the department's policy and that the Denver office had been told not to distribute the report any longer. According to a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education, copies are still provided on request. The second politically explosive issue resulted from what Secretary Bennett and Under Secretary Gary L. Bauer asserted was their right to expose information in textbooks that they regarded as false. In part, the controversy was touched off by a study underwritten by the department and carried out by Paul C. Vitz, a professor of psychology at New York University, which charged that textbooks ignore the importance of religion and of conservative thought in American history. Secretary Bennett defended the department's concern when there is ''a problem of bias or an omission'' in textbooks. Senator Weicker argued that the Congressional definition of the department's functions prohibits any supervision and control of textbooks. Mr. Bauer replied that while the department should not write textbooks or dictate what books schools should use, he considered it his duty to sound an alert on any flawed books. Professor Vitz's views are reported in the current issue of Education Update, a publication of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization that has repeatedly been reported as having close connections with the Department of Education. Professor Vitz charges that those who ''believe in religion and its importance in American life'' and who believe in ''the traditional family'' and in the free enterprise system ''are, for all practical purposes, disenfranchised by these textbooks.'' He said that in 60 books he reviewed he found that ''American Protestantism was almost totally unrepresented'' and that ''the few occasional images'' of religion ''that were shown were Jewish or Roman Catholic.'' He also charged that almost all post-World War II ''role models'' in the books ''were politically and ideologicallly liberal,'' with Republicans given short shrift. The Denver and Washington controversies illustrate fundamental disagreements concerning the Federal Government's role in education. As in other areas, the Reagan Administration contends that it wants to curb the Government's powers. In education, as elsewhere, this has generally focused on reduced Federal subsidies and regulations. At the same time, many school people feel that the Administration wants to use the Department of Education to impose its ideologies in the schools. The Administration, which had initially vowed to abolish the Department of Education in order to get the Government out of education, now seems to welcome it as an instrument to promote the Administration's views. In a recent report, former Education Secretary T. H. Bell recalled that, as Mr. Bennett's predecessor, he fought a constant battle against intrusions by ultraconservatives. He expressed satisfaction that he had kept ideological bias at bay. The latest controversies over textbooks and the teaching of global issues suggest that such incursions are no longer unwelcome. Some methods used to judge ideological purity are reminiscent of the 1950's. For example, counting the number of times liberals or conservatives are mentioned in textbooks, as in Professor Vitz's critique, recalls earlier rightist attacks on books. How today's ultraconservatives would like to reshape certain areas of teaching is indicated by their invention of bias-laden words and the selection of villains. For instance, Mr. Cunningham uses ''pacifistic'' and ''capitulationist'' in his critique of discussions of the threat of nuclear war and Professor Vitz takes a dim view of, among others, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine and John Dewey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPREME COURT DISMISSES AN ABORTION CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/01/us/supreme-court-dismisses-an-abortion-case.html,"A major abortion case ended anticlimactically today when the Supreme Court, on procedural grounds, unanimously dismissed an appeal of a lower Federal court decision that struck down an Illinois law regulating and restricting abortions. The Court, noting that the state itself had not appealed, ruled that a pediatrician who had intervened in the case in defense of the law and had appealed on his own to the Supreme Court had no legal standing to do so. The decision came in one of two cases in which the Reagan Administration had filed a brief as a friend of the court in July urging the Court to overrule its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. Rights Groups Hail Decision While the procedural grounds on which Justice Harry A. Blackmun based his opinion for the Court shed no new light on the extent to which states may constitutionally regulate abortions, groups favoring abortion rights hailed the decision as ''a major pro-choice victory,'' in the words of the National Abortion Rights Action League. Justice Blackmun said, ''Because a private party whose own conduct is neither implicated nor threatened by a criminal statute has no judicially cognizable interest in the statute's defense, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.'' The pediatrician's appeal, filed by the American United for Life Legal Defense Fund, which was the basis on which the Court agreed last year to review the case, had stated incorrectly that the state was also appealing. Another Case Is Pending The Court still has pending before it the other abortion case discussed in the Government's brief, in which Pennsylvania appealed a Federal court decision striking down its law regulating abortion as unconstitutional. Among the provisions of the Illinois law that were struck down by the lower Federal courts were requirements that physicians who prescribe birth control devices defined as ''abortifacients'' that ''cause fetal death'' explain to their patients how they work, and that physicians performing late-term abortions use special procedures to save viable fetuses. The Illinois case began as a suit by Illinois physicians who provide abortion and related services alleging that the statute violated their rights by threatening them with criminal prosecution for what they said were constitutionally protected abortion procedures. Dr. Eugene F. Diamond, the pediatrician who intervened in defense of the law along with others who later died or dropped out, said he favored the law because it would reduce the number of abortions and would protect the lives of viable fetuses. In a concurring opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, along with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist, gave somewhat different reasons for concluding Dr. Diamond lacked standing. The case was Diamond v. Charles, No. 84-1379.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPREME COURT; THE DAY THEY DISCARDED ALL THE LABELS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/02/us/supreme-court-the-day-they-discarded-all-the-labels.html,"At least on the surface, the Supreme Court seemed to have things backward Wednesday when it overruled a 1965 precedent and handed a major victory to black criminal defendants at the expense of prosecutors and the Reagan Justice Department. This is supposed to be the era of the conservative majority under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, a group whose approach is often contrasted, almost reflexively, with the Court's pioneering liberal activism and expansive view of criminal defendants' rights two decades ago, when Earl Warren was Chief Justice. President Nixon wanted his four appointees to be tough on crime, and generally they have been. Yet two of them, Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Harry A. Blackmun, were in the 7-to-2 ''liberal'' majority that on Wednesday curbed the powers of prosecutors to exclude prospective black jurors from the trials of black defendants. In fact, Justice Powell wrote the opinion. Also in the majority was Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, President Reagan's lone appointee to the Court. The decision was one of those that confound the labels - liberal and conservative, judicial activism and judicial restraint - for which journalists, lawyers, politicians and judges often grasp when seeking to fit the Court's shifting coalitions into a logical framework. 'Tides of Public Opinion' The Court's sharp reversal on exclusion of black jurors may also have something to do with the subtle effect on the Court's thinking that Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court's most consistent conservative, ascribed last month to the ''currents and tides of public opinion which lap at the courthouse door.'' The national consensus that racial discrimination is unacceptable may be one current lapping at the door even more powerfully now than in the heyday of the Warren Court. The Warren Court did much to create that consensus. But it was that Court, in the 1965 case of Swain v. Alabama, that allowed prosecutors to exclude all black prospective jurors from a black defendant's jury. Condemning racial discrimination in theory, the Court refused to find proof of it in practice even in a county where no black had ever been seated on a jury. It did not want to fetter the ancient rights of prosecutors and defense lawyers alike to use their allotted ''peremptory challenges'' to exclude some jurors without giving a reason. And it was the Burger Court (with the Chief Justice and Justice Rehnquist dissenting) that overruled the major holding of Swain in Wednesday's decision in Batson v. Kentucky, barring prosecutors from excluding a black from a black defendant's jury on account of race. Justice Byron R. White, who wrote the Swain decision, voted Wednesday to overrule it, saying, ''the time has come'' to move against racial discrimination in jury selections. Others joining in the Batson decision were Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens. The Batson decision surprised and delighted many liberals, some of whom had viewed Swain as one of the Warren Court's darkest hours. Terry Eastland, chief spokesman for Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, was not a bit delighted, if not altogether surprised, by the Justices' willingness to depart from centuries of tradition in pursuit of their vision of racial fairness. ''Many conservatives expected the Burger Court to overturn Warren Court decisions,'' he said with the wry laugh of a man whose team just lost a big one, ''but certainly Swain was not one of them.'' The Administraion had urged the Court to reaffirm Swain. In fact, as Mr. Eastland and other students of the Court have written for some time, far from overturning many liberal Warren Court decisions, the Burger Court has in some ways been both more ''liberal'' and more ''activist,'' sometimes in opinions written by Chief Justice Burger himself, sometimes over his objection. It was the Burger Court, not the Warren Court, that first ordered busing of students when necessary to desegregate public schools in 1971, legalized abortion in 1973, upheld use of affirmative action preferences for blacks by private employers in 1979 and struck down in 1980 a state law that required posting of the Ten Commandments in public schools. The Burger Court has also gone well beyond the Warren Court in holding unconstitutional certain forms of discrimination against women. Does this mean that it is the labels that are backward, that the Burger Court is really more liberal than the Warren Court? Certainly not, say Professors Vincent Blasi of Columbia Law School and Laurence Tribe of Harvdard Law School; the labels are a very rough, sometimes misleading approximation of a far more complicated reality. Mr. Blasi, editor of a 1983 book, ''The Burger Court: The Counter-Revolution That Wasn't,'' says the ''pragmatists'' who occupy the shifting center of the Burger Court are ''activist'' in using their power of judicial review to serve justice as they see it but are not driven by the ''larger principles'' that moved liberals like Chief Justice Warren, Justice Hugo Black and others. They are, he said, ''hardworking and above all open-minded,'' and they take ''an issue-by-issue, fact-specific view of the world.'' He contrasted the Batson decision, which he said might be explained in part by the Court's concern that innocent black defendants might sometimes be convicted by unsympathetic all-white juries, with the Court's decisions cutting back defendants' Fourth Amendment rights not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. In the Fourth Amendment context, Mr. Blasi said, the Court is often asked to reverse the conviction of a clearly guilty criminal because of errors or abuses by the police. He contrasted the Burger Court's careful analysis of costs vs. benefits in such cases, driven by reluctance to let the guilty defendants escape punishment, with the Warren Court's determination to vindicate an idealistic vision of Fourth Amendment freedom, cost what it may. 'Wonderful and Long Overdue' Mr. Tribe, who is generally considered a liberal but who disdains such labels, said ''it would be a mistake to paint too rosy a picture'' of the Burger Court's record on civil rights and civil liberties. But he said the Batson decision was a ''wonderful and long overdue'' example of the Burger Court's willingness to ''push forward the frontiers'' of the law to combat racial and gender discrimination. He said the decision was more easily understood ''as not so much a case about criminal pocedure as about race relations.'' Although the Burger Court ''has been far slower to vindicate and expand'' civil liberties under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments than the Warren Court was, Mr. Tribe explained, ''it has been willing to recognize the relevance of both sexual and racial discrimination in contexts that the Warren Court had left largely untouched, such as family law and the peremptory challenges involved in this very case.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PEOPLE IN CRISIS DIAL A 'HELPLINE' IN NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/04/nyregion/people-in-crisis-dial-a-helpline-in-new-york.html,"It was late when the phone rang, but not too late. The caller, her voice slurred and barely audible, said she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills and turned on the gas in her apartment. In the background a child was crying. While the woman was falling unconscious, the stranger she had called kept talking with her until he learned her name and address. Firefighters reached her apartment and took her to a hospital in time. The call that saved the woman's life - 532-2400 - was to Helpline, a 24-hour, privately financed telephone crisis counseling center. The service, established in 1969 by the Rev. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, the evangelist and author, gives confidential assistance, whether it is helping someone find pizza at 3 A.M., locating scrap metal for an art project or giving them a reason to live. The Helpline, sponsored by Marble Collegiate Church at 3 West 29th Street, where Mr. Peale was once pastor, received 32,000 calls last year, 1,900 of them from people who said they had been contemplating suicide. Some 300 volunteer housewives, stockbrokers, actors, students and retired and unemployed people work the telephones as counselors. They do so after interviews and a 50-hour training course, said Amy-Marie Hohn, the executive director of Helpline. Miss Hohn described the selection process as rigorous, because Helpline ''can't take any unstable people.'' 'The Decision Is Theirs' Bill Kwasnicki, the crisis line director, who teaches counseling techniques to volunteers with simulated crisis calls, said the sessions were intense. ''Once you get out there on the telephone,'' he explained, ''things will come up that you never thought of that will wipe you away.'' The volunteers are instructed not to give advice, but to listen and help the caller find his own solution. ''We never tell people what to do,'' Mr. Kwasnicki said, ''The decision is theirs. ''If I tell a pregnant woman to get an abortion and a week later she calls and says to me, 'I'm feeling very guilty about having had an abortion. You killed my child,' I should never have put myself in that position in the first place.'' While each caller who mentions suicide is taken seriously, Mr. Kwasnicki said, the volunteers learn to judge the sincerity of such calls. ''Some people will use suicide whenever they call to dramatize their situation,'' he said. 'Calling to Say Goodbye' The Rev. Kathleen Noel, the assistant director, said: ''There's a certain group that really scares me who just say, 'I feel so cold inside. I've already died. My body's just alive.' '' She said such callers usually spoke in a monotone. ''It's like talking to an iceberg,'' she said. ''Somehow they've already died emotionally. They've run through every emotion, and they're just worn out. And they're just calling up to say goodbye.'' While answering difficult calls can be emotionally taxing, the volunteers have benefited from the experience. One, a 38-year-old graduate student of education, said: ''In many cases I could be some of these callers on the other side of the line. Some of the things that cause me problems are identical to what cause some of these callers problems, but I'm taking a different point of view.'' In the last year, the number of suicidal callers has risen dramatically, which is partly because of increased publicity for the service. ''People who want to kill themselves want to stop hurting,'' Mr. Kwasnicki said. ''It's not as if they don't have any hopes or they don't want to be around tomorrow. They do. They just can't stand the pain of the moment. ''The part of them that makes them call,'' he added, ''is the part of them that wants to live.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'A Lesser Life',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/04/books/l-a-lesser-life-706286.html,"To the Editor: I have read ''A Lesser Life: The Myth of Women's Liberation in America'' by Sylvia Ann Hewlett and reached conclusions very different from those in Sylvia A. Law's review (March 30). I do not agree with everything in the book, but I think that many of its observations are on target. As a feminist who worked hard for the equal rights amendment and who was an early supporter of pro-choice policies, I believe that there has been significant progress. The women's movement deserves credit, but I am convinced that the movement's goals have been too narrow. During the 1970's many women felt that if they were to succeeed in business they could not bring their child-care problems to the workplace. I know of many women who felt that it was extremely important to be as much like men as possible. What the women's movement must now do is broaden its horizons. We must recognize women's roles as the breeders and nurturers of children, and we must insure that the business world, which is dominated by men, also recognizes the importance of this role. I cannot understand how Sylvia Law reached the conclusion that Sylvia Hewlett was proposing no change. She does, in fact, propose some dramatic changes that are essential to the welfare of our society. Women must have the additional support services that are now lacking, and among them is affordable quality child care. Leaders of the women's movement must be willing at least to listen to voices that may not be singing precisely their song. And there are realities that need to be brought to the attention of our country. They include the increase in divorce rates, the continuing low relative salary levels and the lack of child support. This is not to say that we don't still need the strong voice of the women's advocacy organizations to open up the marketplace, to increase the numbers of women in government positions, to equalize the salaries, to insure abortion rights and to supply the necessary child care so that women can function in the workplace. The women's movement has given short shrift to child care. To date I know of no conference held by a women's advocacy group where a major address on child care has been given, nor of any feminist publication whose major focus has been on child care. Sylvia Hewlett may well have stirred up a controversy out of which some of the major reforms that are needed by families can be instigated.

MASSACHUSETTS SETS VOTE ON ABORTION LIMITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/04/us/massachusetts-sets-vote-on-abortion-limits.html,"After a long and emotional debate, the Massachusetts Legislature has approved a constitutional amendment that would allow the state to place some restrictions on abortion. The amendment is to be on the November ballot for a final decision by the voters. The legislators, sitting as a constitutional convention, voted 123 to 69 Wednesday in favor of the amendment after several legislators said the state should do everything it could, within the bounds of Federal law, to restrict abortions. The proposed amendment would remove anything in the state's Constitution that limits legislative power to regulate abortion. The 1973 decision of the United States Supreme Court that legalized abortion would still take precedence over state law, but the Legislature could move to ban the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor women. State Spending $1.4 Million Representative Charles Doyle, the most outspoken abortion foe in the Legislature, said the state was spending $1.4 million a year to help pay for 8,000 operations in which, he said, fetuses were ''scorched by chemicals and dismembered by the surgical tools of the abortionists.'' Mr. Doyle, a Boston Democrat, ridiculed groups that favor abortion for calling themselves ''pro-choice'' while trying to deny ''the people of Massachusetts the right to make a choice about whether their tax dollars should be used for the killing of children.'' Representative Marjorie Clapprood, a Democrat from Sharon, one of many female legislators to oppose the amendment, said it could go much further than limiting Medicaid-financed abortions. ''What this amendment seeks to do clearly, unequivocally and unconditionally is to ban and prohibit abortion in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all women,'' Representative Calpprood said. ''It is very clearly discrimination against 51 percent of the population by restricting the right of all women to freedom of choice.'' She said it was ''clearly beyond the scope of our role as public policy makers'' to ''pit our women against criminal charges for exercising their right to choose whether their bodies will house an unwanted pregnancy.'' Representative John McDonough, a Boston Democrat, also urged the legislators to move slowly, noting that the November ballot was already long. Abortion Foes Rally at Statehouse But Senator Francis Doris, Democrat of Revere, said that by allowing abortions, the state was moving in a direction that could lead to the killing of children with birth defects, allowing parents to say, '' 'Let's do away with a person and start again.' '' Several hundred abortion foes, each holding a red rose, rallied outside the Statehouse at noon and then packed the visitors gallery in the House chamber for the three-and-a-half-hour debate. They were repeatedly cautioned by the Senate president, William Bulger, to remain silent after they applauded those who spoke against abortion. The Coalition for Choice, a group representing several organizations opposing the amendment, made public Tuesday a statewide poll taken in February, in which, the organization said, some 82 percent of the 400 people questioned by telephone said the government should stay out of the question. ''If, in fact, the question was put on the ballot, we have a great deal of confidence in the voting public in Massachusetts to understand the issue as it affects their lives, and we know we will be successful in November,'' said Carol Doherty, a coalition leader. The Legislature approved another constitutional amendment in March that would allow direct state aid to private schools. That amendment is also to be on the November ballot. After approving the abortion question, the lawmakers recessed the constitutional convention until May 28, when they may consider other changes in the Constitution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN SHORT: NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/04/books/in-short-nonfiction-698986.html,"HISTORY'S MISTRESS: A New Interpretation of a Nineteenth-Century Ethnographic Classic. By Paula Weideger. (Pelican Books, $6.95.) In 1885, a German gynecologist named Hermann Ploss published a daring anthropological account of the legends, myths, rituals and beliefs that governed women's lives. Originally titled ''Women,'' the 2,000-page book was organized around the biological stages of a woman's life -birth, puberty, pregnancy, childbirth and menopause. It became an immediate success, partly because of the erotic content of the pictures and partly because of the stature anthropology had gained with the appearance of Darwin's theories of evolution. Ploss died two months after his book appeared, however, leaving the 10 subsequent editions to the stewardship of his four successors, each of whom made substantial cuts and additions to the text. Now, thanks to the labors of the feminist historian Paula Weideger, who has compressed the original book into 276 pages, this fascinating 19th-century ethnographic classic is again available. Miss Weideger has discarded much of the gynecological detail. To underscore the mostly powerless position of women in primitive societies, she has preserved the sections on polygamy, marriage and prostitution; ideals of female beauty, including scarification, body painting and genital tattoos; the African practice of clitoral excision and infibulation; as well as chapters on female infanticide, adultery and abortion. In addition, she includes short sections on Amazons, sorcery, fortune-telling and witches. What emerges is not only a rich though chilling portrait of the indignities and abuses visited on the female sex, but, as Miss Weideger observes in her persuasive introduction, an equally telling picture of the racial and sexual prejudices of the men who compiled the original book. ''History's Mistress'' is a superb and blighted archive of the relations of women and men.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NORTH CAROLINA VOTE TODAY POSES KEY TEST FOR REPUBLICANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/us/north-carolina-vote-today-poses-key-test-for-republicans.html,"When Representative James T. Broyhill and David B. Funderburk, a college professor, face off in the Republican primary election here Tuesday, there will be more at stake than who wins the party's nomination for the Senate campaign this fall. If the 58-year-old Congressman prevails, as most political analysts and public opinion polls suggest he will, the election could mark a political setback for the National Congressional Club, the right-wing, fund-raising organization closely tied to Senator Jesse Helms, the doyen of conservative Republicans. Over the last decade, the Congressional Club, based in Raleigh, has helped reshape Republican politics in North Carolina, playing an important role in the re-election of Mr. Helms to his second and third terms in 1978 and 1984, and making it possible for John P. East in 1980 to overtake Senator Robert Morgan, the Democratic incumbent. It was to succeed Mr. East, who is retiring because of ill health, that the Congressional Club picked Mr. Funderburk, 41, a political unknown who is a protege of Mr. Helms and served as the Reagan Administration's former Ambassador to Rumania. Mr. Broyhill, his opponent, is one of the state's most powerful and respected Republican politicians. A Test of Leadership The wealthy scion of a furniture manufacturing family, Mr. Broyhill is a conservative who has represented his Piedmont district in the House of Representatives since 1961. Republicans here view this spring's sharply fought primary as an important test of who will lead the party. While the party's ranks have grown in recent years, so has the rift between more traditional Republicans like Mr. Broyhill and Gov. James G. Martin, whose conservatism is reflected most in economic issues, and more ideological Republicans like Mr. Funderburk, whose political views include strong stands against abortion and on behalf of school prayer. The increasing rancor between the two Republican candidates, including an aggressive effort by the Congressional Club and Mr. Funderburk to paint their opponent as a man of unreliable conservative instincts, may rebound to the favor of Democrats trying to regain the seat they lost six years ago. Last month, R. E. Carter Wrenn, an official of the Congressional Club, said the group might continue to oppose Mr. Broyhill even after the primary. The threat was later disavowed by Senator Helms, who has refused publicly to endorse either Mr. Funderburk or Mr. Broyhill. Former Gov. Terry Sanford is considered the leader in a crowded Democratic Senate primary, in which Mr. Sanford's age, 68, has been as much the focus as any other issue. Mr. Sanford, an elder statesman here who was elected Governor in 1960, the same year John F. Kennedy was elected President, is facing nine challengers in the primary on Tuesday. Mr. Sanford, who was president of Duke University from 1969 until last year, joined the race after former Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. and others turned down bids to run. Mr. Hunt made no secret that he had lost his appetite for confrontation after the bitterness and rancor that marked his unsuccessful challenge of Mr. Helms in a campaign that ended here just 18 months ago. Between them, the two men spent $20 million on the campaign, making it the most costly Senate race in American history. A Bitter Campaign Like that race, the outcome of the contest here next November could be an important factor in which party controls the Senate in coming years. The Democrats, who hold 47 seats, are looking to Mr. East's seat as one of four they must capture from the Republicans to gain control of the Senate. In recent weeks, the campaign between Mr. Funderburk and Mr. Broyhill has become increasingly embittered, with Mr. Funderburk and his advisers seeking to depict Mr. Broyhill in television commericals as being an advocate of abortion and an untrustworthy, shifty-eyed politician. Mr. Broyhill's aides, in turn, have accused Mr. Wrenn and his allies in the Congressional Club of waging ''political terrorism.'' Merle Black, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina, says Democrats like Mr. Sanford could benefit from all the dissension in the primary, ''because it will be very hard for the Congressional Club and the real Republicans to unify when it's over.'' As a result, Mr. Black believes the Congressional Club's role in state politics could wane, at least over the short term. ''They've made a lot of mainline Republicans angry with them,'' he said. But the allegations directed at Mr. Broyhill, including charges that he is the author of Congressional legislation that made North Carolina the possible site of a nuclear waste dump, have also taken a toll. A Defensive Stance They have forced the Congressman to adopt a more defensive posture that Mr. Black says may make the vote on Tuesday closer than originally believed. In both party contests there will be a runoff June 3 if no candidate wins a majority on Tuesday,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BROYHILL DEFEATS CAROLINA RIGHTIST,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/07/us/broyhill-defeats-carolina-rightist.html,"Representative James T. Broyhill won a commanding victory today over David B. Funderburk, a conservative college professor, in their race for the Republican nomination to the United States Senate. He faces a showdown in November against former Gov. Terry Sanford, who won the Democratic Senate nomination over nine opponents. The contest will pair two of the state's most well-known veteran political figures. The Republican vote appeared to deal a sharp setback to the National Congressional Club, the staunchly conservative faction of the party that is closely tied to Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. The Congressional Club had handpicked Mr. Funderburk, a political unknown, for the race. Broyhill's Decisive Lead With about 70 percent of the of 2,383 precincts tallied, Mr. Broyhill had a nearly 2-to-1 lead over Mr. Funderburk. At the same time, in the Democratic primary, Mr. Sanford had more than 60 percent of the ballots cast for all 10 candidates. The Republican contenders were seeking the seat now held by Senator John P. East, a first-term Republican who is retiring because of poor health. In recent weeks, the Republican primary had become increasingly sharp, with the Congressional Club seeking to paint Mr. Broyhill as a man of unreliable conservative instincts. Television commercials portrayed him as an advocate of abortion and an untrustworthy, shifty-eyed politician. In turn, Mr. Broyhill accused the Congressional Club of waging ''political terrorism.'' #2 Republican Foes The campaign reflected the wide and sometimes bitter divisions within Republican ranks in the state. Mr. Broyhill, who is 58 years old, is one of the state's most powerful and respected Republicans, and has represented his Piedmont district in Congress since 1961. Mr. Funderburk, 41, is the chosen representative of the party's ideological right wing. A professor at Campbell University in Buies Creek, a small Baptist college south of here, Mr. Funderburk is a protege of Senator Jesse Helms. Mr. Funderburk served for three years as the Reagan Administration's Ambassador to Rumania, a post in which he often clashed with State Department officials, whom he accused of working ''hand-in-glove with Communist tyrants in Eastern Europe.'' He was chosen for the race by officials of the National Congressional Club, the organization established in 1972 to help raise funds and pay off the debts resulting from Mr. Helms's first succesful race for the Senate. In contrast to the Republican primary, the campaign on the Democratic side failed to provoke much excitment. With Mr. Sanford the acknowledged front-runner, his rivals focused on his stamina and his age, 68. Mr. Sanford, who served as president of Duke University from 1969 until last year. is regarded as one of the state's most venerable public figures. He was first elected Governor in 1960. A Crucial State for Democrats North Carolina is one of the states that Democrats will target nationally in the general election in November as part of their bid to gain control of the Senate. The Democrats, who hold 47 seats, are looking to Mr. East's seat as one of the four seats they must capture to regain control of the Senate. In general, voters this spring reported a lack of interest in the primary, which many attributed to a kind of lingering hangover from the excesses of the state's last Senate race. That ended 18 months ago, when Senator Helms defeated the Democratic challenger, James B. Hunt Jr., then the Governor, in a bitter campaign. Between them, the two men spent a total of $20 million, making the election the most costly Senate contest in American history. It was a result of the scars from that contest, in fact, that Mr. Hunt decided not to run for Senator East's seat this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books: Another Round,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/08/arts/books-another-round.html,"TABLE MONEY By Jimmy Breslin. 435 pages. Ticknor & Fields. $17.95. IT is easier to write a book about New York than it is to write a good novel about New Yorkers. New York would not, of course, be New York without its special breed of citizens, but New Yorkers are such a diverse lot that it takes a native, or a longtime resident, to sniff out the differences and explain the variations of location, lineage and leanings, as Jimmy Breslin does with his new novel about Irish Queens, ''Table Money.'' These fine differences add up to substantially more than the tourist perception that all New Yorkers are one, that they rush and push and speak with their mouths closed in such a way that they are clearly defined from the rest of the world. Not so. The fine tunings are there and it takes a sensitive writer to bring them in loud and clear. There is, for example, the Jewish Brooklyn of Malamud, Doctorow or Kate Simon. The Harlem reflected in Langston Hughes is seen in a different mirror as the one viewed by Claude Brown. Mr. Breslin's Irish Queens is more feisty than the Queens summoned up more gently by Mary Gordon. His Queens is one of Irish and Germans whose families are earlier settlers, antedating the influx of blacks, Jews, Asians, Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic people, that have all but swept away the old-timers in the last 20 years. In this superbly described Breslin Queens the men tend to drink and throw the money left over on the table for the wife to spend on the house, which is kept painfully and antiseptically spotless. Mr. Breslin is a newspaper columnist, a recent winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and a man who may know more bars in his Queens than the Census Bureau. He knows many other things, too. He knows how the borough works, how the pride of the people reacts aggressively against condescending Manhattan snobberies, how the stresses of modern life are affecting young people in the strictly old church community of which he writes. His style is scathing on almost every subject but through it comes an affection and understanding for the people whose lives he has undertaken to limn in print. It is a novel that moves and is often moving. If there is any fault, it is that he has too much to say, as though this might be his last chance to get all views aired. But this is more a cavil than a castigation for a book that so fully introduces readers, even New Yorkers, to a world that they may not have known. We are in Glendale, a section near the Brooklyn border but more isolated culturally from the black neighbors across the city line than any international boundary could enforce. Owney Morrison, the book's hero, is back at work in 1970 as a sandhog, his family trade, after returning from Vietnam where he won the Medal of Honor. He also developed bad dreams and is a man given to sudden impulse, usually with good cause but in a violent way. He marries Dolores, a neighborhood girl who is determined to break the mold in which women were shaped in Glendale. She loves her husband and their young daughter but she is determined to put herself through medical school and become a doctor. The people of Glendale have strong thoughts on what is right and what is wrong: there is a strong work ethic, religious belief, hatred of blacks and resentment of sorts about Jews. As often as not, prejudices show more strongly in their words than they do in their practices because many, particularly the sandhogs, have blacks as equals in the tunnel trade. If there is one curse hanging over the community, it is not blacks or homosexuals or abortion. It is drink and this is Owney's affliction, one that he thinks he can lick by himself, but his wife knows he can't and leaves him. This is the essential plot of ''Table Money,'' but Mr. Breslin has things going for him on the side, too - a yarn of corruption in the union, of gangster terrorism, of a college romance. The writing is vintage Breslin, which means it is boisterous and knowledgeable of how people speak. It is full of what Jewish Queens might call ''shtiks,'' little bits of special business that put a high polish on an act. Among these are the antics of the obese, pajama-clad lawyer who spends his time drinking, the description of a brawl at a wedding, the paramedic who lives in a Long Island City loft and has a million-dollar view of shining Manhattan and notes that, in contrast, ''they pay ten thousand dollars to look at me.'' This is a story with interesting, journalistic detail about the work of sandhogs on water tunnels built beneath the Bronx and upper Manhattan, about the many neighborhoods of Queens, about the way people look and act in their native habitats, Queens and elsewhere. For the moment, Queens, this part of Queens as yet unheard from in the world of New York letters, has found its bard, and you don't have to live within turnstile radius of the place to appreciate the tune he is calling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S. JUDGE CITES CATHOLIC GROUPS FOR CONTEMPT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/09/nyregion/us-judge-cites-catholic-groups-for-contempt.html,"The two principal national organizations of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States were held in contempt of court yesterday by a Federal judge in Manhattan. The judge, Robert L. Carter of District Court, ordered the two groups, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference, each to begin paying daily fines of $50,000 next Monday for refusing to turn over documents subpoenaed in a lawsuit over the tax-exempt status of the church. A lawyer for the Catholic conferences, Charles H. Wilson, said he would be in Judge Carter's court at 10 A.M. today to ask him to stay the fines pending an appeal. Penalties are held in abeyance during an appeal. Case Dates to 1980 Lawyers and church officials could not recall a similar contempt-of-court ruling with such stiff penalties against any major religious organization. Judge Carter issued his ruling in a six-year-old case that reflects the nationwide debate over the legitimacy, even the legality, of mixing religion and politics, and the constitutional issue of separation of church and state. The central question of the lawsuit is whether the church, by its activities against abortion, has acted in violation of its tax-exempt status. A spokesman for the Washington-based conferences, William Ryan, has said in the past that the subpoenas raised ''grave constitutional issues.'' He declined to comment yesterday on Judge Carter's action. 'Systematic Effort' Cited In yesterday's eight-page opinion on the contempt-of-court ruling, the judge sharply reprimanded the two organizations for having ''willfully misled'' him and the plaintiffs in a series of procedural ''maneuvers'' over the last year during which, he said, it appeared that all the issues involving the documents sought had been resolved. The plaintiffs in the suit are Abortion Rights Mobilization, an organization based in Manhattan, and 20 other individuals and groups that favor abortion rights. ''The argument then was and still is that the church engaged in a systematic effort to support or oppose candidates for public office depending on their views on abortion,'' the lawyer for the plaintiffs, Marshall Beil, said yesterday. ''This is prohibited by the Internal Revenue Code.'' Section 501(c)(3) of the code grants tax exemption to groups ''organized and operated exclusively'' for religious, charitable or educational purposes, providing that influencing legislation is not a ''substantial part'' of the group's activities and that it does not campaign for political candidates. The plaintiffs, Mr. Beil said, contend that the Catholic Church, engaging in antiabortion activities, cannot be given favored tax treatment while those who support abortion rights, either as individuals or groups, are not. Judge Carter, who has been associated with the case since 1982, issued the subpoenas on Feb. 26 and set a deadline of March 7 for turning over the documents. On March 8, the Catholic conferences informed him that they would not comply. Among the subpoenaed documents are the bishops' Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities, a 10-year-old plan that was substantially revised last year. Conferences Decline Comment Mr. Beil said the documents sought by the plaintiffs to buttress their case concerned the church's ''partisan political activity,'' its tax-exempt status and enforcement of the code by the Internal Revenue Service. In his opinion yesterday, Judge Carter said that ''there would be no cause to complain today'' if, at the first of a series of court conferences that began last July, the lawyers for the Catholic conferences had said that they would ''continue to seek appellate review and that they had resolved to subject themselves to a contempt order should other means of appellate review fail.'' If that had been done, the judge said, ''we would be exactly where we are today, less the baggage of plaintiffs' assertions of bad faith and delay and the court's conclusion that plaintiffs' complaints are amply justified.'' Subject of Appeal Judge Carter observed at the end of his opinion that an appeal of his contempt order would put the issue of the validity of the subpoenas before the United States Court of Appeals. However, he added, it was ''questionable'' whether an appeal would get the merits of the dispute before the higher court. According to the church spokesman, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops deals with internal church religious matters, while the United States Catholic Conference concerns itself with secular matters. Both conferences originally were defendants, along with the Internal Revenue Service, when the lawsuit began. In 1982, Judge Carter ruled that a trial could be held on the suit and removed the two conferences as defendants because ''it is against the Government, not the church, that plaintiffs have stated a claim.'' The conferences remained subject to subpoenas, however, for documents relevant to the suit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Judge Stays Contempt Fines Against Two Catholic Groups,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/10/nyregion/judge-stays-contempt-fines-against-two-catholic-groups.html,"A Federal judge yesterday stayed his ruling ordering the two principal national organizations of the Roman Catholic Church to pay contempt-of-court fines of $50,000 a day. The judge, Robert L.

Throwing the Book at the Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/10/opinion/throwing-the-book-at-the-church.html,"Like any charitable organization, a church must render unto the Federal tax collector the records that support its eligibility for tax exemption. Whether the Roman Catholic Church must also yield such documents to citizens challenging its tax status is the question to which Federal Judge Robert Carter has just given a dramatic answer. He has ordered the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference to produce those records or pay $50,000 each, daily, until they do. Though he has now stayed the penalty, such heavy fines, and the judicial wrath that accompanied them, seem needlessly inflammatory, especially given the substantial likelihood that the underlying lawsuit will ultimately be thrown out of court. The suit was filed in New York against the Internal Revenue Service by abortion-rights supporters demanding an end to the church's tax exemption. They claim that the bishops promote pro-life political candidates and have therefore forfeited their tax privileges. They cite such episodes as statements by priests and bishops that Catholics should ponder candidates' stands on abortion. Internal Revenue, citing statutes that protect taxpayer privacy, refuses to produce enforcement records. More fundamentally the Service, with church support, challenges the plaintiffs' legal standing to sue at all. Judge Carter has refused to dismiss the suit but it's doubtful that higher courts will sustain him. Only two years ago, the Supreme Court denied standing to black families challenging exemptions for segregated private schools; it is unlikely to uphold these litigants. Unfortunately, the arguments over documents have proceeded this far without clear appellate guidance. When the bishops enter the political arena, they have to expect the rough-and-tumble. But they have a legal right to disobey the court order for the purpose of testing it. Judge Carter's temper notwithstanding, the bishops may be in technical contempt without being contemptuous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIEWS OF SPORT; NEW FATHER FINDS NEW JOY IN RUNNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/11/sports/views-of-sport-new-father-finds-new-joy-in-running.html,"RUNNING gives my life order and stability. No matter what the weather, what my workload, how I'm feeling, I usually go for a jog at least three times a week. Seasons change, my life changes, and I continually perform the comforting ritual of going for a run. I don the appropriate garb for the weather, I stretch, I do some leg lifts and sit-ups, I bound out the front door and take off for the winding paths of Rock Creek Park, about a mile from where I live in Washington. I jogged when I was unemployed for a spell, I jogged when I lived and worked in Baltimore, I jog now in the nation's capital. I have run through personal triumphs and crises. I jogged the night before I was married, and I jogged the day before my wife had to have a therapeutic abortion because the baby she was carrying was diagnosed as having a fatal genetic disease. At those times, running helped me cope with the tensions of planning a wedding, and the pain of losing a child. Running reassures me: though my life may change, I am who I am. Then, not long ago, I went on my first run after my wife gave birth to our first child. My pace was the same as always, the running path looked the same, the fellow runners I saw wore the familiar expression of agony/ecstasy. This run, however, was completely different than any other I have taken. Before the baby was born, friends and family told me that having a child gives you a new perspective on life. That includes a new perspective on running. A routine that I've had since the mid-70's, for better or for worse in my life, through colds and the flu, during cold and blistering heat, had suddenly, almost magically, been transformed. My run showed me that I was not who I was, that my life had changed and I had changed. Things that I took for granted took on special significance. In the hospital, a nurse had told my wife and me, ''Your baby may sneeze and hiccup because the air is new for her and she is getting used to it.'' As I breathed in and breathed out during that first postpartum jog, I thought of how this air I've inhaled for 34 years is as new to the baby as a walk in outer space would be for me. I saw colors that she has never seen before - the soft, delicate pink of cherry blossoms, the bright yellow of dandelions, the muddy brown of the creek I run beside. I heard sounds that she has yet to hear - the pant pant of a runner's breathing, the slap of my shoes against the asphalt running path. I felt runner's aches and pains and the trickle of sweat down my brow -feeling that she has never known. When I passed a fellow jogger, instead of raising my hand in greeting, I had to fight the urge to call out, ''I'm a father!'' As I ran, I tried to figure out how to take my daughter on a run with me. With her long, slender legs, she is a born runner, that's for sure. At home, in bed, I give her nightly running workouts with Jane Fonda-like exhortations to finish that mile, round that bend, make it burn. I pump those ruddy legs up and down as if she were racing in the Olympics. Will this imprint running on her brain? Or has daddy gone off the deep end? Would she like to be jostled in a Snugli or perched in a back pack while I run? I suppose neither is a practical means of bringing a baby on a run. Sometimes when I hold my arms half-bent, they're in the position in which I hold my baby. Why not just cradle her as I lope along? Then it occurred to me that I could substitute her for the Heavyhands that I once used to pump while I ran. I'm not sure what Dr. George Sheehan would say about pumping a baby, although she'd certainly be softer and cuter than Heavyhands. Then I remembered that a set of two one-pound Heavyhands slowed me down a bit; imagine what would happen with a 6-pound 7-ounce baby. The only option left seemed to be the Baby Jogger, an outlandish carriagelike contraption that runners can push ahead of them with a baby securely buckled in place. I used to laugh at advertisements in running magazines for the Baby Jogger -who in their right mind would spend $175 for a racing stroller? Now I find myself seriously thinking about sending away for the promotion brochure. I'd certainly be the first on my Yuppie-frequented running path to have a Baby Jogger. What a hoot it would be to push her along and, as I pass a slow runner, to call out in the civilized Washington manner, ''Father and daughter passing on the left.'' When I told my wife my various ideas, she wondered whether I wasn't suffering the effects of new father sleep deprivation. Oh well, maybe it is too soon to take Maya on the running path (although there's always the possibility of starting a day care center alongside the jogging path for the children of runners). And even if I can't take her with me in body, I certainly do in smell (her sweet scent seems to cling to my clothes) and in spirit. Just a couple of months ago, in my pre-Maya days, I hit the jogging path and hadn't a care in the world. Now there's one overwhelming thought that weighs on my mind as I begin a four-mile run: Thirty-two minutes to go before I can hold my newborn daughter in my arms again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE NATION; 2 Catholic Groups Held in Contempt,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/11/weekinreview/the-nation-2-catholic-groups-held-in-contempt.html,"A Federal judge in New York City gave the debate over the separation of church and state a new dimension last week, holding two major organizations of the Roman Catholic Church in contempt of court. The reason, he said, was their refusal to turn over documents subpoenaed in a six-year-old lawsuit over the church's tax-exempt status. The central question of the case, brought by Abortion Rights Mobilization, a Manhattan-based organization, and 20 other pro-choice groups and individuals, is whether the church's campaign against abortion, including its opposition and support of candidates for public office, means that it cannot be given favored tax treatment. Those who support abortion rights are denied similar advantage. The documents sought by the plaintiffs, according to their lawyer, Marshall Beil, concerned the church's ''partisan political activity,'' its tax-exempt status and enforcement of the tax code by the Internal Revenue Service. The judge, Robert L. Carter of District Court, held in an eight-page opinion that the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference had ''willfully misled'' him and the plaintiffs in a series of procedural ''maneuvers.'' He ordered each group to begin paying daily fines of $50,000 tomorrow, but stayed the order pending appeal. In 1982, Judge Carter removed the two organizations as defendants in the suit on the ground that ''it is against the Government, not the church, that plaintiffs have stated a claim.'' But the conferences remained subject to subpoena for documents. In the past, they have held that the subpoenas raised ''grave constitutional issues.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPY TRIAL CLASH TURNS ON MOTIVES OF EMIGRE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/12/us/spy-trial-clash-turns-on-motives-of-emigre.html,"The espionage trial of Richard W. Miller reached a peak last week when the prosecutors and defense clashed over the motives of a Russian emigre who testified that Mr. Miller was innocent. Mr. Miller, the first agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ever charged with espionage, is accused of conspiring with the emigre, Svetlana Ogorodnikov, and her husband, Nikolay, to pass classified documents to the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency, for a promised $65,000 in cash and gold. Mr. Miller's first trial last year ended when a jury that was heavily for conviction declared itself deadlocked At times in the two and a half months of the second trial spectators have remarked that the proceedings were like a soap opera, with testimony about an affair between Mr. Miller and Mrs. Ogorodnikov and about Mr. Miller's foibles as an overweight and eccentric F.B.I. agent. Adding to that was testimony by Mrs. Ogorodnikov that another bureau agent, John Hunt, now retired, was also her lover and had taken her to have an abortion. But by the end of Mrs. Ogorodnikov's testimony, in which she recanted an earlier confession, the trial was linked to the realities of United States-Soviet relations, as the prosecution and defense debated what the future might hold for Mrs. Ogorodnikov as a result of her testimony favorable to Mr. Miller. The debate was confined to the courtroom: a court order bars lawyers and other parties in the trial from making public statements about the case. Exchange With Soviet Union Russell Hayman, an assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case, suggested in his cross-examination that Mrs. Ogorodnikov denied that she and Mr. Miller had worked for the K.G.B. in the hope that she might return to her homeland in a future spy swap. Mr. Miller's lawyers, Stanley Greenberg and Joel Levine, said she was not tailoring her testimony. Mrs. Ogorodnikov had interrupted her own trial last June to plead guilty to espionage in a plea bargain. But near the end of her testimony last week in the Miller trial, in one of several disavowals of that guilty plea, she said the Soviet intelligence knew she had really been trying to help the F.B.I. and therefore she could not return to the Soviet Union. ''I would be shot,'' she said. ''What do you think the Russians are, fools? They know the truth.'' A prosecution disclosure during Mrs. Ogorodnikov's testimony appears to have ended in a setback for the defense. In cross-examining her, the prosecution disclosed that last year, while seeking her plea-bargain agreement, Mrs. Ogorodnikov had said in a statement to the judge that Mr. Miller had passed a classified document. The prosecution disclosed that she had been permitted to make the admission privately to Federal District Judge David V. Kenyon because of her expressed fears for her family in Russia. Mrs. Ogorodnikov testified that her statement to the judge was not true and ended her testimony asserting that she and Mr. Miller were helping the F.B.I. infiltrate Soviet intelligence and had passed no secret information. No Direct Evidence The Government has presented no direct evidence that Mr. Miller, a former agent of a counterintelligence unit, passed classified documents. The Government has relied on what it called Mr. Miller's confession, made during five days of questioning by F.B.I. agents after his arrest Oct. 2, 1984. Although he said then that he had passed classified documents he later disavowed that, saying he had made the statement under the duress of F.B.I. interrogation. While Mr. Miller has freely admitted having an affair with Mrs. Ogorodnikov, he has asserted that he was trying to use her as a double agent to infiltrate the K.G.B. Mr. Miller's lawyers have tried to show the jury that Mr. Miller was attempting only to continue a plan that had earlier been tried and scuttled by Mr. Hunt of the F.B.I. of turning Mrs. Ogorodnikov into a double agent. Mr. Hunt, in his testimony at Mr. Miller's trial, denied trying to make her a double agent or being her lover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHURCH AND POLITICAL ISSUES: HOW FAR IS TOO FAR?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/12/us/church-and-political-issues-how-far-is-too-far.html,"A Federal judge's decision to hold the country's two foremost Roman Catholic Church groups in contempt of court dramatizes a continuing controversy over the rights of religious groups to get involved in politics. At its narrowest, the contempt citation Thursday grew out of the refusal of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference to turn over some subpoenaed documents to a Federal judge in New York. In that court case, a group called Abortion Rights Mobilization is demanding that the Internal Revenue Service revoke the tax-exempt status of the conferences, saying they have organized a political campaign to support and defeat individual political candidates on the basis of their positions on abortion. The Internal Revenue Code, while allowing some political activity by organizations that are exempted from taxation, prohibits campaigning for candidates. But the case touches on larger questions. What rights do religious groups have to speak out on political issues? Have religious spokesmen gone too far in supporting and attacking views that are closely associated with particular candidates? And if the church's statements on abortion favor certain conservative candidates over liberal ones, what rights do tax-exempt groups have to speak out in favor of politically liberal causes, such as a nuclear freeze, the sanctuary movement and an end to American aid to rebels fighting the Government of Nicaragua? 'Part of the First Amendment' The United States has had a long history of religious organizations becoming deeply involved in the politics of war and peace, racism and racial tolerance, the rights of private property and the rights of the poor. In recent years, some Protestant fundamentalists have been notably outspoken in defending some of the same political views that conservative Catholics support, while liberal Protestant denominations have supported political causes that are also being supported by liberal Catholics. Both sides in the current court case, however, tend to view their fight as unique. ''Every religion has a right to come in on an issue - that's part of the First Amendment,'' said Lawrence Lader, the president of Abortion Rights Mobilization. ''The one sole issue is attacking or supporting a political candidate.'' But Robert Wonderly, a spokesman for the two Catholic conferences, said that while the church has condemned abortion, it has carefully confined its statements to the issues. ''We studiously avoid personalities,'' he said. The church has taken the same tack, Mr. Wonderly added, in a series of widely noted pastoral letters dealing with such issues as nuclear war, the arms race and the economy. Another pastoral letter on the economy is due to be released soon, Mr. Wonderly said. ''It addresses the role of government in economic matters but there are no personalities,'' he said. ''No individual or political party is mentioned or considered.'' Critics Say It's the Same Thing But some critics of the church's involvement in politics have suggested that such distinctions can be more apparent than real. They say that attacking political positions amounts, in some cases, to attacking individual candidates. Among the documents subpoenaed by the plaintiffs in the I.R.S. lawsuit, who are seeking to demonstrate this, is the bishop's ''Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities.'' Those who have questioned the church's stance have included, on occasion, Catholics like Governor Cuomo who have said they personally oppose abortion but tolerate the views of others and uphold the law, which protects a woman's right to abortion. No one who has spoken out lately on these matters has denied a religious organization's right to a certain amount of free expression on political issues. The question, rather, concerns tax-exempt status. Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code permits a church, school or charitable organization to remain exempt from taxes so long as it ''does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements) any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office.'' At the same time, the law allows a tax-exempt religious organization to attempt to influence legislation so long as such work is not a ''substantial part'' of its work. Precise Limits Are Undefined The precise limits of these distinctions have rarely been investigated and have never been fully established in law. So the point at which church and state draw the line - or where a religious organization that is not required to pay taxes should decline to get involved in politics - remains open to dispute in the tax laws as it does in other areas of public life. Mr. Wonderly, speaking for the two key Catholic groups embroiled in the current court case, said that, although individual priests, nuns and bishops had spoken out in favor of providing ''sanctuary'' for illegal aliens entering the United States from diplomatically friendly (but sometimes politically oppressive) Latin American countries, the Church's national organizations had not taken a position on the practice. Mr. Lader of the abortion rights group said he assumed that the reason there had been no prominent court cases over other political activities by the church was simply that the church had not supported or opposed individual political candidates over these other issues. He added that in his view the political activities of conservative Protestant fundamentalists, black Protestants and other religious groups had been ''very careful'' to avoid supporting and opposing particular candidates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Packwood War Chest Biggest,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/13/us/packwood-war-chest-biggest.html,"Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican whose tax revision efforts have thrust him into the national spotlight, has raised and spent more money than any other candidate in this year's Congressional races. Mr. Packwood, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has raised nearly $6 million and spent nearly $3 million, the Federal Election Commission said today based on reports filed for the 15 months from Jan. 1, 1985, through March 31, 1986, Tagged ''Senator Death'' by abortion foes for his support of a woman's constitutional right to abortion, Mr. Packwood is being challenged in the May 20 Republican primary by the Rev. Joe Lutz, a Baptist minister. His likeliest Democratic opponent in the general election, Representative James Weaver, has $1,550 in his treasury. Next among fund-raisers were Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, with $4.7 million, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, with $4.6 million. In what is shaping up as one of the big-money races of 1986, Senator Paula Hawkins, Republican of Florida, has raised $3 million, while her Democratic challenger, Gov. Bob Graham, has $2.3 million in contributions. Fifth on the fund-raising list was another incumbent, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania. A challenger was among the five top spenders: Representative Ed Zschau of California, competing in a crowded field for the Republican nomination to challenge Mr. Cranston, has already spent $1.4 million.

NEBRASKA GUBERNATORIAL BID: IT'S WOMAN AGAINST WOMAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/15/us/nebraska-gubernatorial-bid-it-s-woman-against-woman.html,"Voters up in Nebraska awoke today to find that they had fulfilled pre-primary predictions by becoming the first state to stage a woman-against-woman campaign for Governor. Now, no matter which party they choose, they will elect the eighth woman to become a governor. But the primary election Tuesday resulted in one departure from the predictions. The Republican candidate will be Kay Orr, now the State Treasurer, rather than the party's early front-runner, Nancy Hoch. Ultimately Mrs. Hoch, ''outorganized and outspent,'' as one expert put it, ran third, behind Kermit Brashear, an Omaha lawyer. Now Mrs. Orr, 47, faces Helen Boosalis, a 66-year-old former Mayor of Lincoln, the state capital, who never flagged after beginning the Democratic race as a front-runner. Her closest pursuer in an eight-person field was David Domina, a Norfolk lawyer. Mrs. Orr, it seems, begins the general-election campaign with some advantages. She is a conservative in a state where conservatism is the dominant mood and, as a Republican, is a member of Nebraska's majority party. A State of Surprises But Nebraska is a state of surprises. Though Democrats are outnumbered by Republicans, they often win elections. The Governor and both Senators are Democrats. ''I expect to win with bipartisan support,'' said Mrs. Boosalis. But Mrs. Orr, sounding exuberant after her come-from-behind victory, said today that she had no intention of allowing that to happen. Of course, she said, she faces an opponent who had also won because, as in her own case, voters ignored sex and chose ''the most qualified candidate.'' The outcome of the primary races appears to have surprised outsiders more than it did Nebraskans, as one political expert explained. ''This is a state that does have a history of giving women prominent positions,'' said John Cavanaugh, an Omaha lawyer who is a former United States Representative. He noted Mrs. Orr's present elective position as State Treasurer, the fact that Lincoln twice elected Mrs. Boosalis as its Mayor, and the fact that the state has been sending Virginia Smith, a Republican, to Congress for 12 years. Proud State Tradition ''This is the Oregon Trail still,'' he continued. ''Women were walking the Platte Valley alongside the wagons.'' Ultimately, said Mrs. Boosalis, there was an element of pride that emerged. ''Women had a strong base of support, and not just among women,'' she said. Mrs. Orr, a longtime worker for Republican causes, accepts with little resistance the word tough, a term that is frequently applied to her. ''Tough? I guess so,'' she said. ''I'm hard working. People equate that with being tough.'' She recalled that she had served for two years as chief of staff for Charles Thone, then Governor, a role that contributed to her reputation. ''I also got high marks for the job I did,'' she said. Mrs. Orr, the daughter of a Swedish dealer in farm implements, was born Jan. 2, 1939, in Burlington, Iowa, and named Kay Avonne Stark. And she recalls that politics was a frequent topic of dinner-table conversation. She attended the University of Iowa, where she met her husband, William T. Orr, now an insurance executive. They moved to Lincoln in the early 1960's and there she began a career of political activity, playing her first role in the 1964 Presidential campaign of Senator Barry Goldwater. Early Reagan Supporter She has tended to side with conservatives ever since, and she has gone three times to the Republican National Convention as a Ronald Reagan delegate. In that role in 1984, she noted today, she served as co-chairman of the platform committee and helped write its anti-abortion plank. She also opposes an equal rights amendment to the Constitution because, she says, ''although I don't differ with its goal, I just feel it can be achieved without a constitutional amendment.'' In a congratulatory call from President Reagan today, Mrs. Orr reminded him of her early support, an event noted by her opponent, Mrs. Boosalis. ''I congratulate her,'' said Mrs. Boosalis. ''That's one of the advantages of incumbency.'' Mrs. Boosalis, named Helen George GeanKoplis on her birth in Minneapolis on Aug. 18, 1919, is the daughter of Greek immigrants. She attended the University of Minnesota before marrying Michael Boosalis, a plant pathologist, whom she accompanied when he moved to Lincoln to take a post at the University of Nebraska. There, Mrs. Boosalis fell into politics almost by accident. She became president of the Lincoln League of Women Voters, a group that came out victorious in a fight to preserve the city's strong-mayor charter. The Mayor then urged the group to field a City Council candidate. When no one else would run, Mrs. Boosalis did. After 16 years on the Council she ran for Mayor and became, as she likes to recall, the first woman to be mayor of a city over 100,000 population with a strong-mayor form of government. She subsequently became the first woman to be president of the United States Conference of Mayors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Linking Adoption And Abortion In One Crusade,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/16/us/linking-adoption-and-abortion-in-one-crusade.html,"Most of what Congress does centers on large ideas like Federal budgets or on the specific concerns of constituents, but personal experiences have a way of affecting the legislative process, too. For example, since adopting a son last year, Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, has emerged as a leading Congressional spokesman on adoption. He wants to make adoption easier both for couples who want children and as an alternative for women considering abortions. ''My wife and I had no children, and we had long wanted one,'' Mr. Humphrey said. Like others, they struggled with the regulations, the problems of supply and demand and the waiting lists before actually adopting a child, who is 9 months old. And now Mr. Humphrey says he takes ''every chance I get'' to speak about adoption and how to make it easier. The Senator also created the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, which includes 19 Senators and 36 Representatives and which held its first hearing last month. 'Focus on the Advantages' ''The purpose of the coalition,'' Mr. Humphrey said, ''is to focus on the advantages of adoption for all concerned - the child, the biological parents and the adoptive parents.'' The coalition hopes to provide Federal aid to remove some of the obstacles to adoption, most notably by increasing counseling services for pregnant women and training the counselors to emphasize the benefits of adoption for those who do not want to keep the child. According to Mr. Humphrey, some women are inadequately counseled and choose to have an abortion because they do not understand that adoption might be available to them. ''For every child which is adopted, there are at least 60 homes,'' he said. ''Tragically, at the same time, approximately 1.5 million abortions are performed every year.'' Thus, says Wendy Stone, a spokesman for Mr. Humphrey, although promoting adoption is clearly the coalition's ''broad purpose,'' it also carries a connection to the abortion debate. ''If there's an adoption instead of an abortion, then there's obviously a connection between the two,'' she said. But those coalition members whose views on abortion do not always conform with Mr. Humphrey's carefully separate the coalition's work on adoption from any abortion message. Aides to the House majority leader, Jim Wright, who supports a woman's right to choose an abortion if a pregnancy results from rape or incest, say Mr. Wright joined the coalition ''to help break down the barriers to adopting children, especially handicapped children.'' A spokesman said Mr. Wright sees no connection between the abortion issue and better adoption procedures. Groups that advocate abortion rights are also choosing to ignore Mr. Humphrey's link between adoption and abortion, although some are wary of the Senator's leadership in several efforts to restrict abortion rights. Alice Gee, a spokesman for the National Abortion Rights Action League, said, ''We support a woman's right to choose, whether it be abortion or adoption or any other option, so of course we would favor adoption efforts.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/books/in-short-fiction.html,"TIME LOVES A HERO. By Ben Greer. (Doubleday, $17.95.) The Southern writer as virgin, last seen as Stingo in ''Sophie's Choice,'' resurfaces in a coming-of-age novel that never quite comes of age. This time around our hero is South Carolina's Cody Walker, simultaneously searching for his long-overdue sexual initiation and the real answers behind his patrilineage on Black Island, the compound of the eccentric billionaire Mallory Beale, who may, in fact, be Cody's grandfather. Cody encounters two women who show him the way to manhood: the lithe, tough Lisa Kraskawitz, refugee from working-class Boston, searching for a rich husband while she toils as a maid to the Beales; and Harding Wicks, a purebred, slightly frigid preppie. Without much delay, Cody transforms himself into a practiced lover. He also uncovers Mallory's diaries, which chronicle the billionaire's forays to Hollywood, where he frolics with the likes of Greta Garbo and Mary Pickford, and to Moscow where he frolics with the likes of Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. All this proves less absorbing than it should in an overly busy novel whose contrivances and verbal acrobatics do not disguise its meagerness. The diary entries, which focus on fictionalized meetings with real persons, seem ultimately gratuitous since some public figures are not in a position to defend themselves. The book also could have used pruning, to eliminate relentless metaphors (eyes are ''big as walnuts'' or ''black as pea-coat buttons'') and verbosity (walking into Elaine's, the New York restaurant, Cody describes the air as a ''soft, lucent tincture''). Ben Greer's unflagging energy is to be commended, but ''Time Loves a Hero,'' his third novel, never becomes rollicking, as it sometimes suggests it will.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IN PENNSYLVANIA, DIVISIVE PRIMARIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/us/in-pennsylvania-divisive-primaries.html,"As Democrats prepare to nominate candidates for Governor and United States Senator in Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary, some Democratic leaders say that their party's future as a statewide force is at stake. Since 1962 the Democrats have not elected a United States Senator and have won the governorship only twice, with the election of Milton Shapp in 1970 and his re-election in 1974. To fail again this year, some Democrats fear, might insure Republican dominance indefinitely. ''Nothing's ever final,'' says Edward Mezvinsky of Philadelphia, the state Democratic chairman. ''But it would be a very serious blow if we don't win a major statewide race in 1986. How devastating, I don't know.'' Moreover, he went on, losing both major races ''would make it exceedingly difficult for us to put Pennsylvania in the Democratic column'' in the 1988 Presidential election. On top of that, at least 50 candidates allied with the extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. are running in the primary as Democrats, mostly for lower-level offices. And while none is expected to win any major nomination, their uncertain impact in the lesser races is considered by Mr. Mezvinksy to pose an internal challenge to the party. Divisive Primary Campaigns Mr. Mezvinsky and others believe that matters have not been helped by the aggressive, financially draining and potentially divisive primary campaigns now drawing to an end. While some of the Democratic aspirants have fought and often engaged in negative advertising campaigns, the Republicans have sat back united and flush with money. Lieut. Gov. William W. Scranton 3d, the Republican candidate to succeed Gov. Dick Thornburgh, who must step down after having served two terms, is unopposed in the primary. Senator Arlen Specter, the moderate Philadelphia Republican who is is up for election this year, has only minor opposition in the primary and is expected to win easily. With the Democrats, it is a far different story. The close and spirited race for the Senate nomination pits a six-term Philadelphia-area Congressman, Bob Edgar, against Don Bailey, a former Congressman from western Pennsylvania who lost his seat to redistricting in 1982 and was elected the State Auditor General in 1984. The LaRouche candidate is George R. H. Elder. In the race for the gubernatorial nomination, Robert P. Casey, a Scranton lawyer and former Auditor General, faces Edward G. Rendell, who until this year was the Philadelphia District Attorney. The LaRouche candidate is Steve Douglas. Edgar a Liberal Democrat Representative Edgar is a 42-year-old Methodist minister who has consistently won re-election as a liberal Democrat in a heavily Republican suburban district. He first ran for the House because he was outraged by the Watergate scandals, and became an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War. His opponent, the 40-year-old Mr. Bailey, received a number of combat decorations, including the Silver Star, in that war. He is a lawyer who once played football at the University of Michigan. Mr. Bailey considers himself a liberal on social issues but a conservative on national defense. He opposes abortion. He argues that he is better equipped to defeat Senator Specter in November because his more conservative stance would enable him to draw Republican votes. Fourth Try for Nomination Mr. Casey, 54 years old, is making his fourth try for the gubernatorial nomination. His loss in one race was attributed to confusion with a candidate who had the same name. His campaign committee this year is ''The Real Bob Casey Committee.'' He has made economic revitalization the cornerstone of his campaign. Mr. Rendell, 42 years old, is a liberal who built a reputation as a tough law-enforcement official. Economic development has also been a major campaign theme for him, and he has attacked the public utilities for rates he says are too high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FROM BIDEN TO BABBITT TO NUNN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/magazine/from-biden-to-babbitt-to-nunn.html,"AGAINST A BACKDROP OF A UNITED States flag that overwhelmed their hotel meeting room in Atlanta, members of the Democratic Policy Commission two weeks ago began drafting recommendations on such issues as the rural economy, international trade, family life and military policy. ''The larger interests and broader agenda of the Democratic Party and the nation have superseded the singular agenda of elite groups,'' declared Paul G. Kirk Jr., the Democratic national chairman who had limited the panel's membership to elected officials. At the same time, in Washington, more than 1,000 liberal Democrats, mostly feminists, members of minority groups, labor leaders, peace activists and advocates of homosexual rights, rallied to bitterly denounce what they perceive as the party's swerve to the right since 1984. One of the key speakers, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, charged that the party was producing ''schizophrenic leaders who want to look like John Kennedy with hair flowing to the left and act like Ronald Reagan with behavior flowing to the right.'' A reconfigured Democratic establishment has emerged out of the trauma and confusion of the 1984 Presidential election, in which President Reagan overwhelmed Walter F. Mondale in 49 states. Its new politics and electoral strategies are tilted heavily toward the South and the West, politically muscular regions that cast 272 of the 538 Electoral College votes for President. And its leadership is dominated by a new generation of politicians, most of whom were little more than bystanders at the party's 1984 convention and whose names even now are unfamiliar to many Americans. When the country chooses its next President, the three Democrats most prominently identified with the policies and traditions of the New Deal will be on the sidelines. Last December, 13 months after Mondale announced his retirement from elective politics, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts removed himself from the 1988 Presidential field. And at the end of this year, Speaker of the House Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill will lay down his gavel and retire from political life. The party's ascendant leaders are mostly Southerners and Westerners in their mid- to late-40's whose politics are rooted more in pragmatism than ideology. They have met little resistance from the remnants of the Democratic old guard as they have taken command of the debate over how to recast the party's image and message to connect Democrats with lost constituencies, including the baby boom generation, which, in 1988, will constitute one of the largest voting blocs in American history. Although there is little question that the party's center of gravity is shifting, it would be premature to write off the traditional wing, which is prominently represented in the Congress and still controls foreign policy within the party. In the months ahead, the political debate will be increasingly dominated by the party's Presidential hopefuls, and two of the leading ones, Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, have been sharp critics of the Reagan agenda and staunch defenders of many traditional Democratic positions. In the field of possible 1988 Presidential primary candidates, Hart and Cuomo would find themselves running to the left of such Democrats as Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona. Hart says he will make his record of opposition to nearly all of Reagan's major legislative proposals an important part of his campaign. ''People want a program and a policy and a vision that is different from Ronald Reagan's but is put positively,'' he says. ''In 1988, everybody is going to be called to account on how they voted on all these Reagan policies. How did he vote on the tax cuts? How did he vote on Gramm-Rudman? How did he vote on aid to the contras? How did you vote on a whole list of things? It's going to be uncomfortable for some of the Democratic leaders because they're going to have to justify having voted right down the line with Reagan. I don't have to do that because I haven't done it, and I'm one of the few who hasn't.'' In the 1984 campaign, there were few fundamental policy differences between Hart and Mondale. The real difference was in the public perception of the two contenders. Mondale was viewed by many as a captive of the party's special-interest groups, especially organized labor, and as a symbol of the past. Hart came across as fresh, independent and forward-looking. His campaign eventually stalled on questions of character -for example, why he changed his last name and the confusion over his age. Other Democrats moving to the forefront are generally known more for their stands on particular issues than for a broad political philosophy. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, without question the most influential lawmaker in either party on military issues, is the commanding general of the party's effort to shed its ''soft-on-defense'' image. Babbitt is a leading advocate of shifting more responsibilities from Washington to the states and of advancing the argument that Social Security and other Federal entitlement programs should be related to need. Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, along with Gephardt, was the architect of an early tax-revision bill that helped frame the debate on that issue. Former Gov. Charles S. Robb of Virginia has emerged as a spokesman for fiscal conservatism, a tougher foreign policy and new social priorities. And in Massachusetts, the only state that preferred George McGovern to Richard Nixon in 1972, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has redefined the liberal approach to welfare and unemployment with programs that have attracted national attention. These are problem-solving governors and legislators who have built their reputations on innovative programs and policy initiatives and who have little allegiance to the party establishment or its interest groups. S OME ANALYSTS BE-lieve that the next President will be a Democrat or Republican who is able to catch the spirit of the times - as did Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Ronald Reagan in 1980. One man with that potential is Cuomo, the 53-year-old son of Italian immigrants whom some party strategists regard as the most promising of their Presidential prospects, perhaps the one Democrat able to bridge the chasm between the party's traditional values and its new political imperatives, including how to appeal to young voters and other constituencies that have drifted into the Republican ranks. Another is Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a 43-year-old Irish-Catholic who rivals Cuomo as a passionate speaker and whose approach to politics is more thematic than programmatic. Biden, who is so committed to his family that he commutes daily by train between Washington and his home in Wilmington, is a harsh critic of his party. Democrats, he says, have put the narrow agendas of special interests ahead of the national interest and have been guilty of ''intellectual snobbism.'' Biden's critics say he is more style than substance, contending that even after 13 years of grappling with national and international issues in the Senate, he does not have a clear political identity. He has been a strong supporter of civil rights bills but has long opposed busing as a means of achieving school desegregation. He has taken positions on both sides of the abortion issue, although women's groups say he generally has voted against a woman's right to choose. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he established himself as its leading authority on nuclear arms control, but he now admits he has temporarily dropped the issue ''because it's not going anywhere'' in the Reagan Administration. Biden says that if he runs in 1988, he will look forward to matching his knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs with his opponents. But to counter the impression that he does not always do his political homework, he has begun consulting with academic, political and Government experts on a range of policy questions. ''I don't think anyone really questions my substance, especially my Senate colleagues,'' he says. ''I think some people just assume that anybody who is being talked about in terms of style must be lacking in substance.'' Most of the party's Presidential prospects agree on the need for arms control, policies to spur economic growth and competitiveness in foreign trade, reindustrialization, military reorganization and closer cooperation among Government, business and labor. They speak of a more activist Government in some areas, but they also emphasize the limitations of Government. Unlike their party's Congressional leadership, some of them call for higher taxes, if necessary, to balance the Federal budget and for removing Social Security and other entitlement programs from the list of political untouchables. On national defense, Nunn and Hart, as well as the others, are saying the same thing: It's time to shift the debate from the size of the Pentagon budget to the need for military reorganization and a coherent military strategy. The Democratic Party, however, remains deeply divided on foreign policy, which Hart says ''none of us have thought through completely.'' Robb and Nunn, for example, support the President on providing military assistance to the contras. But Hart, Cuomo, Babbitt, Gephardt and Biden oppose the President's policy. Most of the party's Presidential as-pirants supported the bombing raid on Libya. The exceptions were Hart, who contended that nonmilitary responses to terrorism would be more effective, and Jesse Jackson. ''I don't think there have been Democrats in the last 10 or 15 years who have spelled out in any detail their framework for a foreign policy of the future,'' says Hart, who is planning a series of speeches this year outlining his own views. ''We've been operating in a vacuum since Vietnam. We have voted against things. We've been against Marines in Lebanon. We've been against contra aid. Some of us have been against the Grenada invasion. We haven't said what we are for.'' The most difficult foreign policy question facing Democrats, he added, ''is when and where do we use military force.'' H ART WILL BE 51 IN 1988 and the old man of the new generation unless Cuomo runs. One of his problems is to preserve the sense of generational change that surrounded his 1984 candidacy. Many of his ''new ideas'' have lost their freshness or have been nibbled away by some of his potential rivals, and he is still saddled with a $3 million campaign debt. Hart has spent the last year sharpening his own message, gorging himself on policy papers and writing a book on military reform called ''America Can Win.'' The 1988 contest, he says, will be decided on the strength of ideas. ''All the candidates for President will be new people, new in the sense that none of them have ever held national office and, except in my case, have never run for national office,'' says Hart. ''And virtually all of them are in their 40's. Now that's phenomenal when you think about it.'' But there is another Democrat who ran for President in 1984 and is expected to do so again in 1988 - Jesse Jackson, who until recently had been dismissed by party leaders as a one-campaign phenomenon. The former aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. won almost 21 percent of the nationwide primary and caucus vote last time - 80 percent of it black. Some party strategists believe Jackson has the potential to be an even stronger force this time around. Jackson has not been vis-ible at party meetings since 1984, and his estrangement from the Democratic hierarchy makes it more likely that his candidacy will reopen divisions within the party. He has spent much of the last year trying to fashion a political organization by reaching out to desperate farmers and to a variety of dissidents who have grown disenchanted with the centrist drift of their party. If some Democrats are nervous about the prospect of another Jackson candidacy, there are good reasons. For one thing, some strategists say Jackson will benefit from the Southern regional primary scheduled for early March in 1988. It will be one of the first delegate-selection contests, after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Some also fear that Jackson's leftist agenda and rhetoric could become a polarizing force - in the aftermath of the attack on Libya, he charged that President Reagan ''practices terrorism'' by supporting anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua and Angola. This would increase the pressure on other candidates to attack him directly, which neither Mondale nor any of the other 1984 Presidential candidates could bring themselves to do. So far, Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta is one of the few black Democrats to declare that he has no intention of supporting Jesse Jackson in another bid for the Presidency. ''Only in America,'' says Young, ''can someone who could not be elected mayor, governor or congressman run for President.'' Some believe that Mario Cuomo is the one Presidential prospect who could fill the vacuum created by Kennedy's withdrawal and prevent many of the party's liberal constituencies, including blacks, from feeling that Jackson offers the only political shelter. But Cuomo, who is agonizing over whether to run, does not appear eager to claim the Kennedy mantle and is struggling to create his own political identity. Cuomo gained national prominence on the strength of his stirring keynote address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention. That speech, many political experts believe, offered the Democrats a chance to redefine liberalism in a period of conservative dominance. ''We believe in only the Government we need, but we insist on all the Government we need,'' Cuomo told the convention, going on in homiletic tones to speak of ''the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all.'' But Cuomo has offered few specific alternatives to Reagan policies. On foreign policy - the debate he seems most reluctant to join - he has moved from saying he has no expertise in the field to making general observations to consulting foreign-policy experts. Unlike other prominent Democrats, Cuomo has not tried to distance himself from Mondale. He continues to say that the former Vice President was ''right on all the issues in 1984'' and he let it be known recently that Mondale was among the Democrats with whom he was consulting. Some experts question whether Cuomo has the personality and temperament to survive the pressures of a Presidential campaign. He has a reputation for being a thin-skinned and unpredictable politician with an appetite for controversy. ''Every time I mention his name on television or in newspaper interviews I get two or three calls from his staff wanting to know what I meant by my remarks,'' says Charles Robb. ''If he wasn't thinking about running, I don't think he and his staff would be that sensitive.'' R OBB SAYS HIS CANDIDATE for President is Sam Nunn. Nunn says he thinks Robb should run. Both are viewed as potential Vice Presidential choices who seem more in sync with Gephardt and Babbitt than with Hart and Cuomo. Gephardt, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, favors tuition tax credits when the budget permits; favors taxing some health-care fringe benefits, and opposes abortion, busing and additional gun controls. Babbitt, a geologist and Harvard-educated lawyer, advocates a means test to relate Social Security and other Federal entitlement progams to need. His ''crockery-breaking talk about domestic policy assumptions,'' wrote the conservative commentator George Will, ''makes him the miner's canary of the Democratic Party.'' The ideological centrism of some of these Democrats may appeal to many Americans, but not to the party activists who play a key role in the Presidential nomination process. Babbitt admits to being baffled about one aspect of Democratic politics: Why interest groups seem to hold Presidential candidates to a higher standard on ''litmus test'' issues than they hold candidates for state and local office, where Democrats have overwhelming strength and numbers. ''Those of us elected at the state and local levels have never had to pass these litmus tests,'' he says. ''The interest groups seem to be much more pragmatic and accommodating at these levels and I don't know why. For example, Chuck Robb has been highly acceptable to constituency groups in Virginia - labor, feminists and minorities - and I'm sure if he were a candidate for President these same groups would try to hold him to a different standard.'' If he runs for President in 1988, Gephardt is likely to find himself mired in one of the most emotional debates in today's politics. According to the National Women's Political Caucus, Gephardt ''has almost always voted against a woman's right to choose'' an abortion. Caucus officials point out that he has co-sponsored constitutional amendments to outlaw abortions, and in 1985 supported a bill to prohibit the District of Columbia from using its own funds to pay for abortions, even when the mother's life was at stake. ''I feel that abortion is an issue on which a clear consensus has not been formed,'' Gephardt says. ''My conviction is that abortion should not be used as birth control, but as President, I would not make abortion a litmus test for my judicial appointments.'' In an effort to reposition himself on the issue, Gephardt recently dropped his support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. His move provoked an angry response from the National Right to Life Committee, which accused him of ''political capitulation to proabortion activists.'' No Democrat is working the Presidential campaign trail harder than Gephardt, whose strategy is to make a breakthrough in the Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the 1988 primary season. So far his reviews have been favorable, partly because his earnest Eagle Scout image has made him one of the most likable Presidential hopefuls on the circuit. ''His stuff is still vague and at some point he has to get sharp,'' says one Capitol Hill Democrat. ''What is lacking in Gephardt's image is any sense of his willingness to take risks or go for the jugular. He and Bill Bradley started out owning tax reform, but Gephardt backed off when it became a hot issue.'' S OME DEMOCRATS saw the 1984 election as a triumph of the Republican message of opportunity over the Democratic assertion that the Reagan policies are unfair to the poor and middle-income people. But public-opinion surveys suggest that the fairness question still has political value, and that the President, his popularity notwithstanding, has failed to move the country significantly closer to his ideology. In January, a nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll asked 1,581 persons a number of political questions that were first asked in early 1981. The responses showed no definitive evidence of change in a conservative direction. There was, for example, no significant change in the percentage of those who believe that the Government should see to it that everyone has a good job and a decent standard of living. And despite the realignment talk prevalent throughout much of 1985, there is also ample evidence that the Reagan Presidency has failed to move Republicans closer to their goal of becoming the majority party in this century. For most of 1985, polling data showed that the Democratic and Republican parties were at rough parity in the percentage of voters who identified with them. But by early 1986 the gap in party identification was back to about where it had been when Mr. Reagan first took office: 49 percent Democratic and 41 percent Republican, figures that include independents with identifiable leanings. As the post-Mondale chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Paul Kirk, a Boston lawyer and former aide to Edward Kennedy, surprised many Democrats by his deference to Sun Belt Democrats and their agenda. Despite the reservations of many Democrats, Kirk did nothing to discourage Southerners from organizing a regional Presidential primary and has encouraged the notion that the party will need a Southern candidate on its 1988 ticket. And under his leadership the party reduced its number of special-interest caucuses and increased the role of elected officials in party affairs, including the number who will be automatic delegates to the 1988 national convention. At the same time, Kirk has tried to shift the spotlight from the Democratic establishment in Washington to ''success stories'' in the states. As an alternate approach to welfare policy, he cites what Michael Dukakis has accomplished in Massachusetts, where the employment training program encourages welfare recipients to obtain job counseling and training, education and unsubsidized employment. Despite Kirk's gestures, Sun Belt Democrats organized the Democratic Leadership Council in February 1985 to act as an independent force in steering the party away from its old politics. With more than 100 elected officials on board, the council has held forums throughout the South and the West to promote its views and showcase its founders: Nunn, Robb, Gephardt, Babbitt and Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida. Once derided as ''the white-male caucus,'' the council started out as a halfway house for disaffected Democrats in the South and the West. But recently it has turned its attention to attracting blacks and women and to influencing the intellectual and policy debate within the party. Shortly after taking over as chairman of the council from Gephardt, Robb challenged Democrats to end their ''conspiracy of silence'' and start a frank discussion of ''the new obstacles to black progress'' - high rates of teen-age pregnancy, illiteracy, drug addiction and violent crime. Speaking at Hofstra University in April, Robb said, ''It's time to shift the primary focus from racism, the traditional enemy from without, to self-defeating patterns of behavior, the new enemy within.'' Kirk originally opposed the D.L.C., but now says it is playing a ''constructive'' role, especially in bringing more elected officials into party affairs. A good example is Sam Nunn. The 47-year-old Georgian had remained aloof from the party for most of his political career. But in recent months Nunn's role in the D.L.C. - insiders say he is its most influential leader - has transformed him into a party activist who has used his credibility on military affairs to shield his party from Republican attacks on the national defense issue. John White, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who is helping the council with fund raising, says: ''The D.L.C. is a counterbalance to the Americans for Democratic Action faction that has had influence way beyond its numbers. It's filling a vacuum in the Scoop Jackson wing of the party that has a broad constituency but has not had a leader since his death.'' Gary Hart has used the D.L.C. to promote his views on trade policy, but he has declined to become part of its larger political effort. ''You've got this D.L.C. group that wants to move the party to the center,'' he says. ''The only question is, what does the center mean? Apparently for some of them it means financing contra aid in Central America and voting for Reagan economic policies. Well, if that's what they define the center as being, we shouldn't have a Democratic Party. You know, it's Reagan in Franklin Roosevelt's clothing.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EDUCATION WATCH; MANY CAUSES MOVE A TEXAS CAMPUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/weekinreview/education-watch-many-causes-move-a-texas-campus.html,"DR. Les Kurtz, a sociology professor at the University of Texas here, is an outspoken liberal who admits his views would have found more supporters in the 1960's than they do now. But when asked when he would rather be teaching, he paused and said the broad range of political viewpoints and activities on campus make the present a more stimulating time to be in academia. ''In a way, it's what the university should be,'' he said. ''My classes are extremely lively, and when you go out to the West Mall, where many of the political groups on campus have set up tables, you can find almost everything. It helps me sharpen my ideas, in a way I wouldn't have had to earlier.'' In Washington last week, Education Secretary William J. Bennett criticized the tenor of much of America's campus politics, contending that ''a significant body of opinion'' has developed that rejects a democratic dialogue in favor of radical politics. However, other recent reports, including a study by the highly regarded Public Opinion Laboratory of Northern Illinois University, have concluded that students are becoming increasingly conservative and apolitical. A review of the past year at this sprawling, 48,000-student campus suggests a political environment that mirrors neither the quiet of the 50's nor the ferment of the 60's. Instead, there seems to be a raucous chorus of ideologically-mixed voices. The activists remain an extremely small percentage of the student body, but even those who are uninvolved politically are shaping their own political views in a more politically diverse atmosphere on campus than has existed for years, some professors say. ''There's less pressure on conservative students to keep quiet. There's certainly less prejudice against conservative faculty members,'' said Dr. Thomas Schwartz, a politically conservative government professor. ''It has to have an effect on what students see and hear.'' ''There's more activity on the part of the left and the right,'' said Dr. Douglas Kellner, a philosophy professor since 1973. ''This year was as politically active as any I've seen.'' In recent months the activity has included anti-apartheid rallies and a debate over a suitable role for an acerbic conservative newspaper modeled after the controversial Dartmouth Review. Precinct records showed that many students voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. But when a conservative challenger tried to run for the elected post of editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Texan, he received only 30 percent of the vote against his liberal opponent. Similarly, an attempt by a conservative group, Accuracy in Academia, to deny tenure to Dr. Kurtz fizzled, and the group was widely condemned. The most heated campus controversy involved the arrests of hundreds of students, including 182 on one day, for demonstrations against the school's investments in South Africa. The rallies were carried out in areas other than those that had been designated by the university and quickly evolved as the focus of a debate over free speech. But perhaps just as much controversy was generated by conservatives through organizations such as Accuracy in Academia and The Texas Review, a conservative newspaper, which has sued the university because of restrictions on its distribution. The West Mall area, where many student groups tend to congregate, usually includes clusters of undergradutes attacking the Administration's policies in Latin America, others recruiting members for an organization of young Republicans and representatives of United Campuses to Prevent Nuclear War, The Gay and Lesbian Student Association and The Young Conservatives of Texas. Many students, professors and administrators here attribute much of the activity to the policies of the Reagan Administration. Another source of political activism is the campus's varied ethnic and racial mix. There are scattered complaints that the school has failed to adequately recruit minorities, but the university has a somewhat more varied student body than it had a decade ago. The school is now 77 percent white as against 86 percent in 1976. Blacks still represent only 3.5 percent of the student body, but their numbers have almost doubled since 1976. There have been comparable increases in the number of Hispanic students, who now make up almost 9 percent of the student body. Dr. Ira Iscoe, a psychology professor and director of the university's honors program, says that, for all the sound and fury, the campus political scene reflects many of the weaknesses of the national one. ''There are groups talking about abortion, nuclear arms, Iran, Nicaragua. But it's almost the same kind of special-interest politics we see nationally,'' he said. ''There are a lot of things students can do about their own life, but you never see much in the way of results.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ART; OFFICE COMPLEX WITH AN EYE TO EXHIBITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/nyregion/art-office-complex-with-an-eye-to-exhibits.html,"CORPORATIONS everywhere are turning their houses into homes with art collections, as well as sponsoring exhibitions. Landlords, however, have yet to join the cultural race in significant numbers, which makes Blue Hill Plaza, an office complex near Pearl River in Rockland County, an unusual, although not unique, enterprise. On 140 very pretty acres on Orangeburg Road (Exit 6W on the Palisades Parkway), it might have remained just an office complex had the Broadway Management Company not taken it over and turned part of the main floor into the Blue Hill Cultural Center. The space begins in one lobby, runs the length of a passage lined on one side with a brick wall and on the other with shops, through an atrium that is a greenhouse complete with a waterfall and a sloping glass roof, and ends in another lobby the size of a SoHo loft gallery. Inaugurated two years ago with the showing of Douglas Ablah's Henry Moore Collection, the center is now the host to ''A Matter of Scale,'' an exhibit of about 60 photographs chosen by Ned Harris. Jointly sponsored by the Rockland Center for the Arts in West Nyack and Blue Hill Plaza Associates, the show will remain through June 10 (Monday through Friday 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays 8 A.M. to 2 P.M.). The show should really be titled ''A Matter of Size,'' because scale is as easily conveyed by small as large objects - Ruth Thorne-Thomsen's tiny image of a large stone head dwarfing the ladders leaned against it is a perfect example. Besides, the selection's chief purpose is to comment on the trend toward bigness in a medium that, like printmaking in general, was once an intimate alternative to painting. Mr. Harris notes in a statement that there is a veritable ''stampede'' of photographers ''competing for those large public spaces formerly reserved for paintings, wall hangings and sculptures.'' Russell Munson's black-and-white photograph of melting ice measures 42 by 60 inches and his aerial shot of geese flying over a field patterned with snowdrifts is even larger. James Casebere's ''Stonehouse,'' a dramatically lighted facade which, including the vine climbing over it, was modeled by the photographer himself, is a 60-by-40-inch image also in black and white. But most of the large works are so because they are printed over several panels, as in Gilbert and George's luridly colored self-portrait with four youths, which measures overall about 8 by 6 1/2 feet, or else because they are a series of small images, such as Bernhard and Hilla Becher's views of nine all-but-identical gasometers, the huge cylindrical tanks that Europeans use for storing gas. Still, there is bigness enough to make Mr. Harris's thesis worth considering. Eliot Porter's exquisitely colored shots of trees and horsetail grasses are all the better for measuring 30 by 40 inches. Sandy Skoglund's tableaux need their 30-by-40-inch formats, especially that of a man standing at a window, seemingly oblivious to the babies suspended in the black void outside. Titled ''Maybe Babies,'' this could be read as a statement against abortion. Even so, most of these images would have been just as effective half the size, which suggests that bigness in photography is merely part of the overall trend toward the grandiose and unworkable. The small prints in any case hold their own, particularly Imogen Cunningham's well-known ''Triangles,'' a study of a highlighted woman's breast framed by fragments of her torso and limbs in shadow, and Margaret Bourke-White's astonishing picture of innumerable spiders. Other memorable contributions come from Jan Groover, Dean Brown and Ann Sager. There are signs that Mr. Harris had trouble illustrating his point, for he includes a 13 1/2-by-16 1/2 Ansel Adams of Mono Lake as an example of bigness, but omits Duane Hanson, whose prints are eloquent examples of smallness. But a show that gets Lewis Carroll, Robert Mapplethorpe and Robert Rauschenberg under the same roof, along with several lesser- knowns, including the curator himself, is not to be missed. Apartheid is the subject of an exhibition at the Mount Vernon storefront that is headquarters for the Association of Community-Based Artists of Westchester (124 South Fourth Avenue). And the image that sums up the subject best is Adger Cowan's blurred painting of a black mask with ''Soweto'' stenciled below. Mr. Cowan, however, has spaced out the word so that it can be pronounced ''so we too.'' He is the author also of the sculpture that, made out of a thick black gasket, looks as much an instrument of torture as any of the welded pieces in Mel Edwards's ''Lynch'' series. Even more pointed is Camille Akeju's serigraph of a man's profile, in which the black ink defining the forms of the head acts also as the blood dripping from it. Nevertheless, it soon becomes clear that apartheid is too vast an issue to get a grip on, much less illuminate. Like nuclear oblivion, it is in any case a realm where art has been pre-empted by eyewitness photography; proving this point is Harold Esannason's painting of a poorly dressed black woman pausing beside a brick wall with her two children. Except for the slogans scrawled on the wall, this is a copy of a photograph taken in the South more than 30 years ago by Consuelo Kanaga. Inevitably, therefore, too many of the images - especially the collages done by Michael and Michelle Singletary and the quilted hangings of Dindga McCannon - make their impact first as art but only later, if at all, as protest. But simply as an attempt by black artists to deal with an evil that directly affects them (the first that this reviewer has seen), the show is important. And while most of the contributors work in disconcertingly different styles, several are well worth checking out as artists in at least one - among them, Linda Hywot, with her landscape-like abstractions; Ann Tanksley, with her woman lying among flowers; and Ademola Olugebefola, with his black and white woodcut of two profiles confronting each other. (Through June 28).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GRANTS INCREASE FOR WORK IN POPULATION AREA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/19/us/grants-increase-for-work-in-population-area.html,"Wealthy foundations regarded as trend-setters are beginning to spend more money in a controversial area: birth control, contraceptive research and teen-age sexuality. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of New Jersey, for one, announced in April that it would provide $16.8 million over six years for clinics at schools to provide adolescents with comprehensive health care, including pregnancy prevention services. Public high schools in at least 20 cities are to be selected for the program, to be operated by local medical facilities and guided by community committees. Each community is to decide if contraceptives or abortion will be provided. The Johnson Foundation is the country's largest private philanthropy devoted to health, but scores of smaller foundations around the country have also begun helping programs seeking to prevent teen-age pregnancy. Clinics based in schools are operating in 18 states, as against a handful of clinics nationally in the 1970's. ''They are springing up faster than I can count them,'' said Sharon Lovick, a program director of the Center for Population Options in Washington, an advocacy group that has created a support center to train staff for these clinics. 'New Momentum' Is Seen The surge in foundation support for the clinics as well as for research in contraceptives and other family planning activities has created a ''new momentum,'' said Dr. Sheldon J. Segal, director of population sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation, which, along with the Ford, Mellon and Hewlett foundations, is a major provider of international financing for population activities. ''Foundations are getting more involved because they see mechanisms around them that can be successful in population control and they are willing to back them,'' he said. ''No one likes to back something that is going to fail, not politicians and not philanthropies.'' One leading newcomer in the field is the Carnegie Corporation, which is providing $4 million over two years for efforts to prevent first pregnancies in adolescents. Carnegie is focusing on a younger population, not yet sexually active, than other foundations are. ''If any foundation tackles it, we're the likely one to do it,'' said Dr. David A. Hamburg, a physician who is Carnegie's president. The foundation is widely regarded as one of the most influential in the United States for its work in early education. Moves on Teen-Age Pregnancy Carnegie is supporting a program still being developed by the Children's Defense Fund of Washington to enlist black church groups in a campaign called Prevent Children Having Children. Carnegie is also focusing on two junior high schools in a largely Hispanic neighborhood in Manhattan's Washington Heights and is helping finance a program of the Center for Population Options to influence television and Hollywood producers on adolescent sexuality and pregnancy. The Kaiser Family Foundation, based in California, is also entering this field, inviting communities in 13 Western states to submit proposals on teen-age pregnancy as part of a new $15 million national health program. The MacArthur Foundation in Chicago, one of the wealthiest American philanthropies, is preparing for its first commitment in family planning, in the range of $10 million to $15 million. A number of other foundations, prompted by the Reagan Administration's policy against giving money to foreign programs permitting abortion, recently began or expanded financing of family planning efforts in third world countries. The Noyes Foundation of New York, for instance, decided six months ago that it would support family planning in developing countries, even though one of its directors acknowledged that $1 million annually from a small philanthropy was tiny amount in such efforts. Few Grants in Early 1980's The expanding foundation support of family planning and population control appears to be a recent phenomenon. An unpublished study by Margaret C. Ayers, executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation in New York, found that 1.7 percent of all grants by 500 major foundations from 1980 to 1984 were devoted to population issues, for a total of $112 million. Comparable figures after 1984 are unavailable. Less than 1 percent of the $112 million went to ''address teen-age pregnancy, promote sex education or family planning, to conduct policy analysis or support advocacy to protect women's reproductive rights,'' Miss Ayers said. Of the $112 million, $71 million came from the Ford, Hewlett, Mellon and Rockefeller foundations. Relatively few of the 500 foundations studied gave substantial sums to advocacy groups, such as those lobbying against efforts to eliminate Medicaid financing for abortion. One exception was the Gund Foundation of Ohio, whose director, James S. Libscomb, said it regarded women's reproductive rights as ''both a civil right and a right that has a major impact on the role and progress of women in our society.'' By contrast, the DeRance Foundation of Wisconsin devoted its population grants to efforts against abortion. 'Afraid of Controversy' Jeannie Rosoff, president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, said foundations' support of family planning and prevention of teen-age pregnancy was still limited. Calling this ''irresponsible and shameful,'' she said: ''They like to see themselves as trail-blazers when, in fact, they are afraid of controversy. Very few are willing to take the heat or even come close to the stove.'' Foundation spokesmen said their increased attention to this field, particularly adolescent pregnancy, stemmed in part from a Guttmacher study last year concluding that the United States had higher rates of teen-age pregnancy, abortion and childbearing than most other industrialized nations. ''Now, new ideas about adolescent pregnancy such as school-based clinics and broader sex-education curriculum have captured the foundations' attention,'' said Joy Dryfoos, a consultant to both the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations. ''It became respectable to fund prevention programs.'' The Planned Parenthood Federation of America received $2.5 million from foundations last year, double what it got in 1984, said its president, Faye Wattleton. In addition, foundations gave $5 million to its 187 affiliates. Bronx Center as a Model One undertaking attracting national attention is the Hub, a bustling youth center in the South Bronx that was developed jointly by Planned Parenthood of New York City and the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and minor support from a dozen smaller philanthropies. The Hub, which is being copied in other cities, provides medical services weekly for 350 teen-agers as well as job counseling, computer training, art and karate classes. The aim is to keep teen-agers in school, build self-esteem and persuade them that an unwanted pregnancy limits choices. A medical staff runs group discussions of contraceptives, and a pregnant adolescent has the choice of prenatal care or an abortion. Research on reproduction is also getting more foundation support, stimulated, said Dr. Segal of Rockefeller, by technological progress in improving contraceptives. As an example, he cited Norplant, a hormone implant under the skin that protects against pregnancy for five years. Norplant was developed by the Population Council, a research group, and is used in Scandinavia and Latin America. The Ford, Rockefeller and Mellon foundations are discussing creating a multinational consortium for contraceptive research that would also involve United Nations agencies. According to participants in these talks, progress is slow because European governments will not join unless the United States decides to contribute and because United Nations agencies disagree on how the consortium would be directed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIABILITY CRISIS COMPLICATES CONTRACEPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/19/style/liability-crisis-complicates-contraception.html,"Dr. Louise Tryer sighed and hung up the telephone in her Seventh Avenue office at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America the other day. The caller was a 38-year-old woman who had been wearing a copper-covered intrauterine contraceptive device for the last three years. Now it was due to be replaced, but neither her gynecologist nor the family planning agencies she had visited would insert a new device. What did Dr. Tryer recommend? ''I gave her the name of a doctor in Montreal, but what can I say to the women who can't afford to go there?'' said Dr. Tryer, who is Planned Parenthood's vice president for medical affairs. She added that Canadian doctors are ''overwhelmed with professional American women coming up for IUD's.'' The so-called Canadian connection is one solution to the contraception gap created by the recent decisions of drug companies to discontinue sales in the United States of the three most frequently prescribed intrauterine devices. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, about 2.2 million American women use IUD's. They are the fifth most common form of contraception after voluntary sterilization, birth control pills and condoms and diaphragms. Removed From the Market In January 1986, G.D. Searle removed its widely used Copper 7 as well as another copper device, Tatum-7, from the market. The company cited ''unwarranted product litigation'' and the difficulty of obtaining insurance. Four months earlier, the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation stopped selling a plastic device called the Lippes Loop, terming production ''no longer economically feasible.'' As a result, the only IUD still being sold in this country is a little-used device that releases hormones in much the same way as a birth control pill. Although the action affects only one contraceptive method, family planning advocates say that its ramifications extend far beyond the IUD market in this country and that research on new methods has slowed down or stopped because of the unavailability of insurance. ''Ortho and Searle decided to stop marketing their IUD's not because of new research findings indicating increased medical risk, nor because of pressure from physicians or consumers to do so,'' said Dr. Jacqueline Darroch Forrest, research director of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and education organization. ''Indeed, the national medical committee of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council were actively encouraging Searle to exercise its licensing rights and market an additional copper-bearing IUD, which the Food and Drug Administration had approved for U.S. use in 1984.'' Product Liability Suits The problems for Searle and other manfacturers began more than a decade ago when product liability suits started flooding the courts. The main target was A.H. Robins Company, which filed for bankruptcy last year after 14,000 users of its Dalkon Shield sought damages for pelvic infections, sterility and other problems they attributed to the device. Searle contended there was no comparison between its IUD's and the Dalkon Shield and many medical authorities agreed. In April 1985, however, The New England Journal of Medicine published two studies that suggested a link between IUD's and infertility. Both studies agreed that plastic IUD's were associated with a higher incidence of infertility than the more widely used copper devices. 'We never recommended that the IUD should not be used at all, merely that it should not be used by a woman who had not had a child,'' said Dr. Daniel W. Cramer, author of one of the studies. ''We probably speeded up the demise of the IUD's by the articles but they were headed that way because of the lawsuits.'' Dr. Cramer, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School, was among many doctors who expressed concern that the IUD had become a casualty of the product liability crisis. He and others fear that loss of what was a safe and effective birth control method for most of its users - older mothers who are not candidates for the pill - will result in unwanted pregnancies and sterilizations under pressure. Resort to Sterilization ''Many women are taking that route now,'' Dr. Cramer said. ''I've seen a fair number coming in here when the IUD's expire'' for sterilization. The F.D.A., which still approves the use of the Searle IUD's, the Lippes Loop and others, has stressed that women need not have them removed. Nevertheless, gynecologists say some patients have lost confidence in the devices and want them removed before the three-year expiration date when they begin to lose their effectiveness. Other patients, however, are asking doctors to sell them copper devices for future insertion. But many doctors say they are unwilling to take the legal risk and most say they have returned their supply of unused devices at the manufacturer's request. The request has been widely interpreted by doctors to mean ''we no longer have any legal backup,'' as Dr. Enayat Elahi, medical director of Planned Parenthood's New York City affiliate put it. ''It's like the recall of a car,'' he said. ''If Ford sells you a car and then says send the car back, you send it back.'' Affiliates Have Choice Speaking for the Planned Parenthood Federation, Dr. Tryer said that it was up to each of its 187 affiliates to decide whether or not to continue inserting IUD's. The federation has encouraged them to do so, she said, but some clinics, particularly those in the northeast, have stopped providing copper IUD's although others such as the New York clinics still offer the less effective Lippes Loop, which can be worn without replacement until menopause. ''I think some affiliates had more concern about medical-legal risks than about the needs of the patients they're serving,'' Dr. Tryer said. ''These patients are really in a bind. Either they're going to have to be sterilized or take the pill, which puts them at considerably increased risk after age 40, or they're going to have to use one of the barrier methods, which have a failure rate among average users in the first year of from 10 to 19 percent. For a lot of women that's absolutely unacceptable, particularly those who wouldn't consider abortion.'' Private gynecologists are no less concerned, although some like Dr. Benny Pascario of Manhattan have the sort of patients who can afford to go out of the country for an IUD. ''I had a patient here today who said 'What's the big deal? I'll go up to Canada and have one inserted,' '' he said, adding that other patients were ''upset and even outraged'' when he explained that he could not replace their IUD's. ''It's one more example of how the consumer is being hurt by the malpractice crisis,'' Dr. Pascario added. ''No sane physician would dare give an IUD today except to his wife.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PACKWOOD FACES OREGON PRIMARY CHALLENGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/20/us/packwood-faces-oregon-primary-challenge.html,"Senator Bob Packwood, a Republican, has a strong lead in the polls in his race for renomination in the Oregon primary Tuesday. A poll published Sunday by The Oregonian of Portland showed Senator Packwood, 54 years old, favored by 67 percent of Republican voters while Joe Lutz, 35, a former Baptist church pastor, was supported by 29 percent. From the beginning Mr. Lutz's campaign was labeled by Senator Packwood and others as an attempt by anti-abortion groups to retaliate for the Senator's stand in favor of the right to an abortion. Mr. Lutz says he opposes abortion, but that he also opposes Senator Packwood's positions on other issues ranging from timber sales to foreign aid. Last-Minute Commercials Mr. Lutz spent time today making radio and television commercials to charge that the Packwood campaign falsely said he supported ending the social security system. The most recent campaign spending reports show that Senator Packwood has raised about $7 million since his last election in 1980, and has about $2.7 million unspent. Mr. Lutz has raised $175,000. However, looming off in the November mists is a potentially difficult campaign for Mr. Packwood against Representative Jim Weaver, whom the poll favored as the probable Democratic Senate nominee. The newspaper poll showed Mr. Weaver, 58, favored by 55 percent of Democrats, leading state Senator Rod Monroe, 43, with 14 percent, and state Representative Rick Bauman, 35, with 9 percent. The Oregonian poll was conducted by Bardsley & Haslacher Inc. of Portland, which conducted telephone interviews May 12 to 15 with 680 registered voters: 251 Republicans, 335 Democrats and 94 independents. The margin of sampling error was 3.8 percentage points for the whole sample, 6.2 for the Republicans and 5.4 for the Democrats. Race for Governor For the Democratic nomination for Governor, Neil Goldschmidt, 45, a former mayor of Portland and Secretary of Transportation in the Carter Administration, and State Senator Edward N. Fadeley, 55, appeared to be running ahead of three lesser known candidates. Senator Fadeley stressed his successful opposition to a state sales tax. Mr. Goldschmidt had endorsed the tax, which was rejected by a 4-to-1 margin last November. Norma Paulus, 52, a two-term Oregon secretary of state who is opposed by three little known candidates, was expected to win the Republican nomination for Governor. Senator Packwood's campaign has been conducted with almost unlimited funds and against a backdrop of generally favorable national publicity growing out of his successful leadership of the Senate Finance Committee in passing a tax bill acceptable to the Reagan Administration. Praise From President A few weeks ago he let reporters into his office to listen while he accepted a congratulatory call from President Reagan after the passage of the bill. Senator Packwood said the President ended the call by telling him, ''You go out there and win that primary big.'' The incident illustrated the Senator's shift over the past four years from outsider to insider status at the White House. In an interview in May 1982, Mr. Packwood described the Republican party leaders as lacking substantial campaign issues and as anti-government. At that time, he said, ''If there's to be a fight for the soul of the Reublican party, I'm prepared to lead it.'' Since then Bob Dole of Kansas became Senate majority leader, opening the way for Senator Packwood to show his legislative skill as the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. #6 Straight Victories In a general election campaign against Mr. Weaver, Mr. Packwood would be facing a candidate who won six straight elections to the House from a Southern Oregon seat. But Mr. Packwood would begin the race in the lead, polls show. Mr. Weaver is the grandson of James B. Weaver, the Populist Party's nominee for President in 1892. As a member of the House, Mr. Weaver was pretty much alone among officials from this area in opposing the Washington Public Power Supply System, the public agency that later defaulted on $2.75 billion of bonds while building only one of its five planned nuclear reactors. In the race for Governor this fall, the Mr. Goldschmidt must overcome the effect of a five years absence from public life. Before he resigned as Mayor of Portland in 1979 to take the Carter Cabinet appointment, he was seen as a major force in Oregon politics. When he returned here, he became a vice president of Nike Inc., the shoe manufacturing company. Mrs. Paulus, meantime, has been out of office only since January 1985. After she finished two terms as secretary of state, the Oregon constitution barred her from running again. She has used those months to mount her campaign for Governor while she taught law at Willamette University in Salem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONCERN IN ISRAEL OVER IMMIGRATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/21/world/concern-in-israel-over-immigration.html,"Immigration to Israel this year is expected to be at the lowest level in the nation's 38-year history, while emigration is rising sharply, according to reports here. Minister of Absorption Yaacov Tzur said at a news conference that since Jan. 1, only 2,800 new immigrants had arrived in Israel and that he expected total immigration this year to reach only about 9,000. The previous low in immigration was set in 1985, when only 11,298 new immigrants arrived in Israel, while some 15,000 Israelis left the country, Mr. Tzur added. He did not issue a projection for emigration for 1986. But the number of Israeli emigrants last year was up 47 percent from the 10,400 Israelis who emigrated in 1984, according to a special report by the Central Bureau of Statistics. In 1983, only 8,600 Israelis left on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, many of the Israelis who have emigrated were new immigrants from The United States, Canada, South America and Western Europe who came to Israel for a time and then returned to their countries of origin. The emigration statistics came after a report to the Israeli Cabinet last week about the shrinking Jewish population around the world. Prof. Roberto Bacchi, head of the Hebrew University statistics department, told the Cabinet that today's 9.5 million Jews living outside of Israel would shrink to about 8 million by the year 2000 if current demographic trends in assimilation, intermarriage and low birth rates continue. The reports have set off a debate in the Government, with each official offering solutions in terms of his own political outlook and agenda. For example, Minister of Religious Affairs Yosef Burg said the statistics proved that legislation was required to reduce the number of abortions in Israel. Minister of Communications Amnon Rubinstein said the demographic picture proves that Israel cannot afford to annex the West Bank and Gaza strip. Prime Minister Shimon Peres said the answer is that every Jewish family in Israel should have four children. On Sunday the Cabinet approved in principle the allocation of as much as $20 million to help 6,000 infertile Israeli couples to have children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMOCRATIC RIVAL ASSAILS PACKWOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/22/us/democratic-rival-assails-packwood.html,"Jim Weaver, the Democrat who was nominated Tuesday for United States Senator, charged today that his Republican opponent, Senator Bob Packwood, has shaped his votes to fit the interests of contributors to his campaign fund. Mr. Weaver and Mr. Packwood both won nomination by wide margins in Oregon's primary Tuesday. ''If he's talking about people giving me money and cowing me,'' Senator Packwood said in a telephone interview, ''have him talk to some of the people who gave me money and came out losers in the tax reform bill. Ask him to talk to people who had immense real estate tax shelters that are closed, or had cattle feed operations. See if they think somehow that they got what they wanted.'' As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Packwood has led in the creation of a tax revision bill that now is pending in the Senate. Nominees for Governor Both parties nominated strong candidates to succeed Gov. Victor G. Atiyeh, a Republican, who is barred from seeking a third term. Neil Goldschmidt, a former Mayor of Portland who was Secretary of Transportation in the Cabinet of President Carter, received 68 percent of the Democratic vote in a field of seven candidates. Norma Paulus, former Oregon Secretary of State, got 77 percent of the votes cast for seven Republican candidates. Packwood 'Elitism' Charged Representative Weaver, who is giving up his House seat to make the Senate race, also said in a telephone interview that he believed that more and more office holders ''have gravitated to people with money, power and position,'' and added, ''Bob Packwood is a prime example of this elitism in politics.'' Senator Packwood said, ''I don't even understand what he's talking about.'' Mr. Weaver said he intended to make Mr. Packwood's fund raising an issue. The Senator has raised about $7 million in campaign funds since his last election in 1980, and reports that he has about $2.7 million in hand for this election. His campaign reports show that much of the money is from political action committees. ''Raising campaign funds is corrupting,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''The word is that if you want to have breakfast with Bob Packwood you put up $5,000.'' Packwood Cites Small Givers Asked to respond to this, Senator Packwood said, ''About half the money I have raised has come from the people around the country who support me on the issue of abortion.'' He said he has about 150,000 separate contributors whose average contributions were under $50. Mr. Packwood has been targeted for defeat by the anti-abortion groups that provided much of the financial support received by Joe P. Lutz, a Baptist minister who ran against him in the primary Tuesday. Mr. Lutz, who had never run for office before, drew 43 percent of the vote and carried eight of the Oregon's 36 counties. Senator Packwood, who has represented Oregon since defeating Wayne Morse, a Democrat, in 1968, got 57 percent of the Republican vote. Mr. Weaver has held a House seat from the Eugene area since 1974. He calls himself a populist, but says he believes it is possible to advance his ideas as a Democrat, rather than to try to run as a third-party candidate as did his grandfather, James B. Weaver, the Populist Party nominee in 1892. Weaver Finances Assailed Senator Packwood attacked Mr. Weaver's assertion that he would take no contributions from political action committees. ''He took PAC money for every election up to this year and it constituted, of his reported funds, the bulk of it,'' Mr. Packwood said. ''He took it from business, from labor, from environmentalist groups, but it's funny, it just never seemed to taint his vote. He's somehow immune.'' Mr. Weaver, who said he spent less than $2,000 in the primary, was opposed by two state legislators. He carried every county but one and received 62 percent of the Democratic vote. Democrats lead Republicans in registrations in Oregon, 49 percent to 38 percent, with 13 percent of the voters enrolled as independents. For the Democratic nomination to succeed Mr. Weaver in the Fourth Congressional District, a Lane County Commissioner, Peter DeFazio of Eugene, led by about 1,500 votes over State Senators Bill Bradbury and Margie Hendriksen, with 3 percent of the vote uncounted. Republicans nominated a Douglas County Commissioner, Bruce Long of Roseburg. The other four Oregon House members won renomination easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GRANDMOTHER GETS THE BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/us/grandmother-gets-the-bill.html,"The first person ordered to pay child support under a state law holding grandparents liable for their teen-age children's offspring says it is hard to teach children right from wrong these days. The grandparent, Jean Mayberry, 42 years old, of Beaver Dam, was ordered last month to pay $30 a month to support her 1-year-old grandson until her daughter turns 18 in six months. Her ex-husband was ordered to pay $280 a month. ''Nowadays,'' Mrs. Mayberry said this week, ''kids can tell you what to do because they have the law behind them.'' When Mrs. Mayberry's daughter applied for public assistance, officials found she was unwed and the family was asked to appear in court under the new measure. The order was the first to test a new law aimed at reducing the number of teen-age pregnancies. Under the measure, believed to be the only one of its kind in the nation, grandparents of an infant born to unmarried minors can be forced to support the baby until the parents turn 18, get married or join the armed services. ''I don't think it's right,'' Mrs. Mayberry said. Her daughter could not be reached for comment despite repeated calls, but Mrs. Mayberry said her daughter was also unhappy with the new law because she probably would have received more money under public assistance. The father of the infant is not a minor, so his parents do not have to pay support. Mrs. Mayberry said a court hearing is scheduled next week to determine if the father should pay support. ''I'm going to try to teach my other children right from wrong, but they'll do whatever they want to do anyway,'' she said, adding she has three other teen-age children. The grandparent liability law was included in a 10-part measure drawn up last year by various groups, some of which favor and others of which oppose the right to abortion. The law, which went into effect Jan. 1, also provides increased money for a state adoption center and pregnancy counseling, and it prohibits trespassing at abortion clinics. John Hartman, Dodge County District Attorney, handled the case in Beaver Dam, about 50 miles northwest of Milwaukee. He said he had expected court challenges to the grandparent liability measure but none had been filed. That portion of the new law expires in 1989 so its effects can be studied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMOCRATS ATTACK REJECTION OF WOMEN'S BOARD NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/nyregion/democrats-attack-rejection-of-women-s-board-nominee.html,"LAST week's vote by the County Board of Legislators, in which the Republican majority rejected a nominee for the Women's Advisory Board, has angered women's rights groups and led some Democratic legislators to accuse their colleagues of ''McCarthyism.'' The furor has also drawn attention to the advisory board, a two-year-old diverse coalition of 37 members, representing a broad spectrum of women's interests. The Republican legislators rejected the nominee, Cheryl Tate-Lambert, on the advice of the County Board's Committee on County Officers and Departments, headed by Stephen P. Tenore, a Republican-Conservative from New Rochelle. When Mrs. Tate-Lambert was originally considered by Mr. Tenore's committee, she described herself as an active member of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion. That organization, Mr. Tenore said, ''regularly works against the election of most members of the County Legislature'' and had ''misrepresented'' those legislators' views on abortion. According to Mr. Tenore, the rejection of the nominee ''had nothing to do'' with her position on the abortion issue. ''The appointee chose,'' he said, ''to make an issue of her political activism against the elected officials she would be advising.'' The women's board role is to advise the Board of Legislators and the County Executive on women's issues. Denying that she had ever worked against the election of Mr. Tenore or any county legislator, Mrs. Tate-Lambert, an accountant with Merrill Lynch relocation management in Harrison and a Yonkers resident, said she had lobbied for legal abortion at the state and Federal levels. Her efforts had intensified in recent years, Mrs. Tate-Labert said, after her younger sister died in what she called a ''back-alley abortion mill.'' Declining to describe his own position on abortion, Mr. Tenore said in an interview last week, ''Abortion is not a county issue, and it is irresponsible for any politician to grandstand on one side of the issue or another to grab votes.'' Mr. Tenore said that he had never received the endorsement of the Right to Life Party and added that he would refuse to accept its endorsement. One hour after the vote of the full County Board, Mr. Tenore's committee considered and unanimously approved a second nominee for the advisory board, Dr. Zelle W. Andrews, executive director of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, who is a member of the boards of several women's rights organizations and the former head of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women. Dr. Andrews, a historian, said she was also a sponsor of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion. The approval of Dr. Andrews led the Democratic minority leader, Sandra R. Galef, who was observing the proceedings, to ask: ''How's that for consistency?'' The Women's Advisory Board Chairman, Sharon A. Frayne, who also observed the proceedings, said she was mystified by the committee's action. ''I do not understand, but the committee's action is truly impeding the progress of our board and will make our future not impossible, but more difficult.'' Following the County Board's rejection of her nomination last week, Mrs. Tate-Lambert said she would fight to gain a seat on the Women's Advisory Board. ''I did not work against Mr. Tenore last fall,'' she added, ''as I didn't have the time, but I certainly would have if I'd had the time.'' Mrs. Tate-Lambert said the Republican legislators had made her a ''scapegoat'' because of their resentment toward the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion. Audrey G. Hochberg, a Democratic legislator from Scarsdale and member of Mr. Tenore's committee, said, ''to accuse Mrs. Tate-Lambert of misrepresenting members of the Board of Legislators because of her membership in the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion is to charge guilt by association, and that's tantamount to McCarthyism.'' In a news release, Legislator John W. DeMarco, a Democrat of White Plains, also characterized the action as McCarthyism. Mrs. Hochberg said: ''There's no difference between Sheryl Tate-Lambert and Zelle Andrews except Mrs. Tate-Labert became a scapegoat in the Republican attempt to get even with the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion. Any time you have elected officials creating a scapegoat because a reputable organization won't allow them to sit on the fence on an important issue, it is a defect in the caliber of government, and the public should be concerned.'' The controversy may hurt the advisory board itself, Mrs. Hochberg said. Although the advisory board, she said, has provided ''nothing helpful'' to the legislators so far, ''the potential is always there.'' County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke in January 1984 established the Women's Advisory Board to advise the legislators, after he disbanded an earlier women's group, the Women's Council, saying that it did not represent a true cross-section of women's opinion in the county. The major achievement of the new board, according to its Mrs. Frayne, has been to create a Women's Hall of Fame. ''Change doesn't happen overnight,'' Mrs. Frayne said, adding that the Women's Advisory Board is preparing a series of recommendations for Mr. O'Rourke to consider submitting to the county legislators. Chief among them, she said, are seeking changes in conditions for women at the County Jail, a ''wellness'' curriculum for junior high schools countywide, an effort to increase awareness about problems associated with teen-age suicides, and proposals for reducing homelessness. At last week's meeting of the Women's Advisory Board, the group also agreed on a series of recommendations urging the County Executive to consider appointing qualified women to commissioner-level posts in the county and to establish search committees for those positions that would include members of the advisory board. Sally Ziegler, executive director of the Child Care Council of Westchester, is also chairman of the advisory board's subcommittee on children and families. Mrs. Ziegler said her committee has helped start three ''latchkey'' programs, or after-school child-care programs, in Peekskill, Bedford and Irvington. Members of the committee, she said, had served as leaders in their communities to develop the programs. ''There hasn't been a lot accomplished on the advisory board as a whole,'' Mrs. Ziegler said. ''The board is too big and cumbersome and at nearly every discussion, we tend to break into camps.'' When she first proposed the latchkey program, Mrs. Ziegler said, she was surprised to find that it, too, was controversial. ''There are members with strong feelings about women working,'' she added. Mrs. Ziegler was also critical of the Board of Legislators, which, she said, ''hasn't used us at all.'' She said the County Board had recently sent a day-care proposal to Albany without ''checking with anybody.'' Terry Kornbluh, coordinator for the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, responded to Mr. Tenore's charges by saying ''Mr. Tenore says prochoice is not a county issue. Well, prochoice is a county issue, and county legislators have voted on this issue four times.'' While the county legislators have no power to regulate abortion, Mrs. Kornbluh said, they have ''recommended that the New York State Legislature pass a constitutional amendment overturning Roe v. Wade, the legal-abortion decision, and they've also passed a resolution supporting an antichoice minor's bill restricting minors' access to abortion.'' Mr. Tenore ''does not have the luxury not to state his position,'' Mrs. Kornbluh said, adding: ''The role of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion is to find out candidates' positions, and tell the public so the public can use this information to judge who to vote for. The Westchester Coalition has an impeccable reputation for doing this job thoroughly.'' Mr. Tenore spoke to the coalition's executive director, Polly Rothstein, before last November's election and, Mrs. Kornbluh said, ''He told her his views and her assessment is that Mr. Tenore is antichoice.'' In an interview last week, Mrs. Rothstein confirmed that Mr. Tenore had told her that he was antiabortion. Mr. Tenore ''used Cheryl Tate-Lambert as a scapegoat to get at the coalition,'' Mrs. Kornbluh said, adding, ''He is angry because we campaigned for his opponent. Mr. Tenore does not want the public to know he's antichoice, and he's afraid because he must know the county is prochoice. Mr. Tenore accuses us of misrepresenting his position?

'I HAVE a story to tell you,'' says the companionable widower at the outset of ''The Congressman's Daughter'' by Craig Nova. This is the second oldest proposition in the world, but it still entices. And rewards. Provided, of course, that the teller understands the subtle mechanics of suspense and disclosure. Mr. Nova - the author of four previous novels, including ''The Good Son'' (1982), which was widely praised - has the right instincts; he gets his plot moving with a veteran's sure hand. Alexandra Pearson, the daughter of Harlow Pearson, a former Congressman now retired to his New England district, is returning home to make peace with her father. She is impetuous and strong-willed - she dashed off to California to protest Harlow's aloofness - and exile has only polished her edge. Passing a truck with a ''SHOW ME LEG'' sign, for instance, Alexandra is only too happy to oblige: ''And, as she went by, she put her head back and laughed, showing her white teeth and the shape of her mouth and filling the Ford with her sharp, barking laughter.'' But she is also 19 years old, unmarried and six weeks pregnant - coming to terms with her father will not be easy. Alexandra has, however, a reserve of inherited guile. Harking back to an ancient fly-fishing ritual (Harlow used to get her to bet on her casting prowess), she now wagers that she can land a certain ''cannibal'' trout that lives in a still pool on their property. Harlow takes the bait, then asks the terms. ''If I catch the fish,'' she says, ''you'll give me some help.'' Then she tells her news. She wants the baby and the reconciliation. If she doesn't catch the fish, she will have to fly to Sweden for an abortion. Stagy though it sounds, this first section achieves some life on the page. Alexandra has credible gumption, and Harlow, hollowed out by politics, affairs and bourbon, is just the sort to take the gamble - his eyes brighten only when the roulette wheel is spinning. When Alexandra watches him, she feels a chilled fascination: ''was she condemned to the same life as her father, was it going to be passed down to her, and was it so horrible after all?'' The questions will not be answered for decades. Indeed, the emerging lines of her destiny eventually become the dominant interest of the novel. The crisis scene is crowded with improbabilities. Harlow dies at the very moment that Alexandra hooks - and loses - the fish. But she is unwilling to stop. She enlists the help of Willie Shaw, a handsome townie whom she has favored from a distance since adolescence. But the terms of Harlow's will virtually force Alexandra to marry the evilly unctuous Bryce McCann, his protege. ''The Congressman's Daughter'' would very likely sink under the weight of its plot were it not for the canny storytelling style of the unnamed Yankee neighbor. This man has a gift for eliciting confidences and for stringing together episodes and observations in a manner at once digressive and involving. He understands, among other things, the sexual and filial ambiguities that beset the father-daughter relationship; his account links them suggestively with details drawn from the natural surroundings: ''The fish rose from the bottom and took a nymph that was struggling on the surface. It was a slow, quiet rise, coming out of water so deep and clear as to make the trout seem to be rising through the wrong end of a field glass.'' AFTER Alexandra and Bryce exchange their loveless vows, the tempo of the book changes. The father has defeated the daughter, driven her inward. She is trapped by the terms of his will, at least until her daughter, Anna, comes of age. She stares out the window and waits. The passing of years is slow and excruciating. What the narrator once observed while watching Harlow looks like it might apply to Alexandra as well: ''It's not an easy moment when you realize you haven't escaped life at all, or those horrible things that happen to others, or when you realize life is only rearranging itself in that phantomlike way and that soon it will kill you.'' But Alexandra is not Harlow, and life has made other provisions for her. It would not do to rob Mr. Nova of his carefully engineered denouement. I will say that he brings ''The Congressman's Daughter'' to a flashing finish, balancing off the requisites of plot with the resolution of his deeper concerns. Mr. Nova not only isolates those moments in a life when grace supervenes, allowing a glimpse of the path leading out from the dark wood of contingency; he also teaches us, through Alexandra, that the glimpse is just a beginning and that the real work must often be carried out in fear and trembling. Behind the gears of an unlikely plot, the reader discovers an active moral imagination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FROM CRUSADE TO CAMPAIGN IN MICHIGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/weekinreview/from-crusade-to-campaign-in-michigan.html,"WHAT began in Michigan as the first test of strength between Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York is now being closely watched for another, at least as significant result: the ability of the Rev. Pat Robertson to mobilize thousands of evangelical Christians as a statewide political force. If his drive here is successful, it could have major implications not only for the 1988 Presidential race but for the future of the Republican Party. The religious right, increasingly at odds with local Republican establishments, has made political breakthroughs in Minnesota and other states with far less of an effort than is being made here by followers of Mr. Robertson, a television evangelist from Virginia Beach, Va., who says the Michigan outcome will be weighed heavily in his decision on whether to seek the Presidency. Unlike Mr. Bush and Mr. Kemp, who have delivered mostly pep talks to groups of party regulars, Mr. Robertson is trying to pull conservatives in both parties, as well as independents, into his tent. His preachings against abortion and pornography, coupled with his call for school prayer, have been bringing large audiences throughout the state to their feet. The first indication of how the Robertson effort is going will be known next Tuesday, the deadline for qualifying candidates for thousands of Republican precinct delegate slots at stake in Michigan's primary on Aug. 5. The election of the delegates, officially uncommitted to any candidate, is the first and most important step in the state's process for choosing its 77 delegates to the Republican National Convention year after next. The Freedom Council, a tax-exempt group founded by Mr. Robertson in 1981, is conducting its campaign for precinct candidates on the same scale as the Bush and Kemp organizations. To get around Federal campaign finance laws, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kemp are cloaking their activities as party-building exercises. And Mr. Robertson contends that both parties will benefit from his efforts to get more born-again Christians involved in politics. A Possible Spillover A strong showing by the Robertson forces in Michigan could spill over into other states, including Iowa where the evangelist has been organizing his followers and making contributions to farm groups. Such a development, some party strategists say, almost certainly would increase the influence of evangelicals in the early phase of the 1988 Republican Presidential primary campaign. The first three states to choose Presidential nominating delegates in 1988 will be Iowa, Michigan and New Hampshire. In Iowa last month, evangelical activists won voting control of the Republican Party convention in Polk County, which includes Des Moines and is the most populous and politically dominant county in the state. While the infusion of the new-style activists has brought new vitality to the Republican Party, it also has created rising tensions as the party's old guard resist the efforts of evangelicals to take control of local and state parties. Evangelical forces now control the Independent Republican organizations in several Congressional districts in Minnesota and are asserting their influence in party affairs in a number of other states. The challenge to party regulars also extends to the election front. In the May 6 primary election in Indiana, evangelical forces scored two striking victories against Congressional candidates backed by the local party leadership. In the Fifth Congressional District primary, James Butcher, a State Senator and evangelical Christian, defeated state Treasurer Julian Ridlen for the Republican nomination. Mr. Ridlen, a veteran party loyalist, had been endorsed by 13 of the district's 14 Republican county chairmen. Even more surprising was the victory of the Rev. Donald Lynch, a Nazarene minister, over Jay Wickliff, a longtime Republican fundraiser, in Indiana's Second Congressional District. Both Mr. Butcher and the Rev. Lynch bypassed the party structure by mobilizing hundreds of church laymen and ministers to help them spread their conservative message. In Oregon's Republican Senate primary on Tuesday, a similiar strategy enabled the Rev. Joe Lutz, a poorly-financed Baptist minister making his first political race, to win 43 percent of the vote against Senator Bob Packwood. Some analysts say the increasing activism of evangelicals, who represent a constituency that includes many low-income people with populist instincts, could pose a major threat to the political character of the Republican Party. They also fear that the religious right's preoccupation with social issues could alienate young voters and other new constitutencies who have become tenuous members of the Republican coalition that have produced the Reagan landslides. ''I sense that the party establishments are getting a little nervous about evangelicals saying we want to get involved in party politics,'' said Curtis Maynard, an official of the American Coalition for Traditional Values, an umbrella organization of Christian right organizations. ''We've begun to realize that if we are going to have an impact we have take our involvement in politics beyond voting.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congressional Research Service; How Your Tax Dollars Help Do Term Papers,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/28/us/congressional-research-service-how-your-tax-dollars-help-do-term-papers.html,"When Terri Bower, a high school junior from Finksburg, Md., needed help with a paper on the Soviet Union, she asked her history teacher where to look. He told her to write to Congress. She sent a letter to several Capitol Hill offices, including those of Senators Richard G. Lugar, the Indian Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland. The letter said she was a high school student writing a term paper and asked seven broad questions, such as ''Do the Soviets expect specific goods and acts in return for giving foreign aid or is it given more to promote their economic and political system?'' Each office referred the letter to the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, which compiled a stack of pamphlets, newspaper and magazine articles addressing Miss Bower's questions. These were then forwarded to her. ''The responses were great,'' said Miss Bower, adding that the new information helped her write a much better term paper. ''Lots of teachers say that if you can't find information, you should write to your Congressman, because that's what they're there for.'' With a 1986 budget of $37.3 million and a staff of more than 500 research and information specialists, the research service serves a main function of helping Congressional and committee staffs get quick and thorough information on matters pertaining to legislation. A secondary function is to help Congress with one of its main priorities: answering constituent mail. But sometimes, say some Congressional staff members, the secondary function gets a little out of hand, especially when research requests come in from students. A Whole Class Heard From ''A whole elementary school class wrote in, asking for information on all 50 states,'' said Bill Aseltyne, a legislative assistant to Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan. ''Their letters said, 'I am doing a paper on Nebraska and cannot get to the school library; please send me all the information you can.' We figure the teacher wrote the letter on the board and told the students to copy it. We referred the requests to C.R.S., a few at a time.'' Research service officials say they are aware of some abuse of the system but cannot say how extensive it is because they often do not know for sure whether the request originated with a legislator or a constituent. ''There are some constituent requests that just aren't appropriate for us to do,'' said Nancy Davenport, coordinator of the Member and Committee Relations Office at the research service. But the service does not consider it within its jurisdiction to inquire why requests are made. ''The question is not whether or not we think the requests are appropriate,'' Miss Davenport said, ''but whether or not the Congress thinks so.'' Requests Hard to Refuse Congressional offices are not supposed to ask the service to provide students with information already available in their school or public library. The problem, Congressional staff members say, is that students nevertheless often ask for data that are available elsewhere or require a special effort to dig up. And legislators, being legislators, hesitate to turn down requests from the children of the people who put them in office. For the most popular topics, like abortion and arms control, the research service has prepared ''Info-paks'' to send to legislators and constituents. ''We don't provide term papers,'' said Miss Davenport, although, she added, the service does offer pamphlets on how to use a library and how to get bibliographical information. In response to new cuts that have pared its budget by $3 million from 1985, the research service is trying to streamline its operations and will no longer accept ''rush'' priorities on constituent requests. But this, too, is difficult to enforce. ''If we need something really quickly, sometimes we'll say it's for office use when it's really for a constituent,'' Mr. Aseltyne said. ''It is a very common practice.'' The research service has also barred Congressional interns, many of whom are college students working temporarily on Capitol Hill, from asking for information over the telephone. They are now required to make requests in person. In the past, some interns say, they often asked the service to do research for friends or for their own school projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVANGELIST MAY LEAD IN PRELUDE TO MICHIGAN RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/28/us/evangelist-may-lead-in-prelude-to-michigan-race.html,"The Rev. Pat Robertson, a television evangelist who is considering a Presidential bid in 1988, appeared to score a major breakthrough yesterday in Michigan's delegate-selection process. Marlene Elwell, the state coordinator for Freedom Council, a tax-exempt foundation founded by Mr. Robertson, said last night that preliminary figures indicated that 3,000 to 4,000 supporters of the council had qualified to run for precinct delegate slots in the state's primary Aug. 5. Supporters of Vice President Bush estimated that his Michigan effort could account for 4,000 to 4,500 candidates. Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York appeared to be headed for a third-place finish, with his supporters saying they expected to have 2,000 to 3,000 candidates on the ballot when the numbers are known. Candidates Officially Uncommitted The exact number of candidates probably will not be known until later in the week, and even then the picture will still be confusing because the candidates will officially be running uncommitted to any Presidential hopeful. At this early stage of the process, some political strategists say, the psychological momentum of the Michigan exercise could be its most significant result. ''What we've done is phenomenal,'' said Mrs. Elwell, a veteran political worker and anti-abortion activist. ''Not all of our districts are in yet, but what we've gotten so far are good, solid figures from our people. It looks like we're going to wind up with between three to four thousand candidates.'' Mr. Robertson has said the outcome in Michigan would weigh heavily in his decision on whether to seek the Presidency in 1988. Although he said that his Freedom Council activities were aimed at getting evangelical Christians involved in politics, the apparent success of his effort here could have major implications for the Presidential contest. ''The message here is that grass-roots people were told they have a place in politics and they accepted the challenge,'' said Mrs. Elwell. Many Claim Victory Although only preliminary and unofficial figures were available last night on the number of candidates for precinct delegates, everyone seemed to be claiming a victory of some kind. Officials of the organization backing Mr. Bush said its candidate recruitment effort appeared to match their expectations. Bill Phillips, executive director of the Fund for America's Future, the political action committee set up by Mr. Bush, said, ''We don't have any totals, but I'd say it was an overwhelming success from our standpoint.'' Mr. Phillips said it appeared from field reports that as many as 9,000 candidates, a record, qualified for the precinct delegate posts by the filing deadline of 4 P.M. yesterday. ''From talking to our field people, I think we were responsible for about half of them,'' he said. W. Clark Durant 3d, a Detroit lawyer who is Mr. Kemp's principal political agent in the state, said candidate numbers aside, the Kemp forces had accomplished their major goal. ''The important thing is the energy that is generated here to challenge the assumption that Bush has it locked up,'' he said. The August election of precinct delegates will be the first and most important step in the process of choosing the state's 77 delegates to the Republican National Convention in 1988. Because Michigan plans to be among the first states to choose its national convention delegates, Mr. Bush, Mr. Kemp and Mr. Robertson made a major effort to recruit precinct delegate candidates to show support for their prospective candidacies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THEATER: FRANCA RAME,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/30/theater/theater-franca-rame.html,"WHILE Dario Fo is regaling theatergoers with his ''Mistero Buffo,'' his wife, the actress-author Franca Rame, is exhorting them with ''Tutta Casa, Letto e Chiesa (It's All Bed, Board and Church).'' Miss Rame's one-woman show opened Wednesday at the Joyce Theater, where it is running in repertory with ''Mistero Buffo.'' In contrast to Mr. Fo's improvisational Living Newspaper style of presentation, Miss Rame takes a more structured approach, drawing selections from the dozen short plays about women that she has written in collaboration with her husband. Both Fos have performed their shows throughout Europe. As she tells us, the plays all deal with ''women's sexual servitude.'' By design, they are sessions in consciousness-raising, with a humor that is often filled with malice (and sometimes with vulgarity). Despite her doll-like, Goldie Hawn appearance, Miss Rame minces no words. In fact, she spends too much time sparring with language, as she analyzes the names of bodily parts and functions. As a performer, she is a woman with a fighting edge. On one level, the work - the comic as well as dramatic moments - is a digest of pertinent women's issues, from sexual harassment at work through enslavement by ''bed, board and church.'' In detail, she describes a gradual alteration in Italian attitudes, how, for example, abortion is now legal, but certain gynecologists have become ''conscientious objectors.'' ''Mistero Buffo'' could only be performed by Mr. Fo. On the other hand, the ''Tutta Casa'' plays are carefully scripted. They have been performed by other actresses - at London's National Theater by Yvonne Bryceland and at the Public Theater by Estelle Parsons. Both of those productions, using different titles, benefited from the versatility of the actresses and from the fact that each performed in English to an English-speaking audience. In Miss Rame's introductions to her plays, her Italian is translated, line by line, by Maria Consagra, a process that does not flow as smoothly as Ron Jenkins's simultaneous translation of Mr. Fo's ''Mistero Buffo.'' In the latter case, the comedy becomes a dialogue between actor and interpreter. Miss Rame and Miss Consagra do not appear to have the same breezy rapport. For the stories - as with Mr. Fo - subtitles are projected on screen, but, in Miss Rame's case, we are watching an actress in small domestic monodramas without much action. The subtitles distract us from the performance. Miss Rame is evidently a talented actress, but the plays themselves are hardly more than attenuated sketches. A mother awakens, rushes through her daily chores, most of which concern her infant, and heads for her job - only to realize that it is Sunday, ostensibly her day of rest. A wife is locked inside her house by her jealous husband, has a conversation with an unseen neighbor and fights off a lecherous brother-in-law. In ''We All Have the Same Story,'' she reaches for - and achieves -something slightly more ambitious. In this monologue, she brings us inside the imagination of a woman in the middle of humdrum lovemaking. In an act of transference, she wonders what it would it be like if men were able to become pregnant. Actually, Miss Rame - and the evening itself - is at its most communicative in two serious pieces, the story of ''A Rape'' and her distillation of ''Medea,'' both of which describe a woman's anguish. For each of the sketches, a knowledge of Italian or a familiarity with the plays would enhance one's appreciation. Slaves of Love TUTTA CASA, LETTO E CHIESA (It's All Bed, Board and Church), by Franca Rame and Dario Fo; directed by Mr. Fo; set and lighting by Lino Avolio; translation by Stuart Hood and Ron Jenkins; company manager, Maria Nadotti; stage manager, Walter Valeri; actors' assistant, Mario Pirovano; production company, Compagnia Teatrale La Comune Milan; representation, Andres Neumann International Rome.

"JOHN PAUL, ISSUING FIFTH ENCYCLICAL, ATTACKS MARXISM",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/31/world/john-paul-issuing-fifth-encyclical-attacks-marxism.html,"Pope John Paul II issued the fifth encyclical of his papacy today, denouncing Marxism and other forms of philosophical materialism as ideologies that portray ''God as an enemy of his own creature.'' In the 141-page document brimming with references to Satan and to the coming of the third millennium, John Paul sought to focus the attention of Roman Catholics on the Holy Spirit, the mysterious third person of the Trinity whom Christians revere, along with the Father and the Son, as the one God. The encyclical, ''Dominum et Vivificantem'' (''The Lord and Giver of Life''), is a highly personal revery by John Paul on one of the richest but most elusive concepts of the Christian faith - in the Pope's words, the ''hidden God'' who is the Holy Spirit. Harsh Critique of Modern World But John Paul, as is his habit, used these reflections to undergird a harsh critique of the modern world, with ''its signs and symptoms of death,'' and of ideologies he sees as destroying a spiritual vision of humanity. He underscored the importance he ascribed to his message by issuing it as an encyclical, which is the most formal teaching instrument of the papacy. ''In principle and in fact, materialism radically excludes the presense and action of God, who is spirit, in the world and above all in man,'' he wrote. ''Fundamentally, this is because it does not accept God's existence.'' Marxism Is Attacked Resistance to the Holy Spirit, the Pope said, ''reaches its clearest expression in materialism,'' and is ''carried to its most extreme practical consequences'' in ''dialectical and historical materialism, which is still recognized as the essential core of Marxism.'' A materialist worldview, the Pope said, dismissed religion as ''a kind of idealistic illusion to be fought with the most suitable means and methods according to circumstances of time and place, in order to eliminate it from society and from man's very heart.'' The encyclical reflected both the Pope's intense study of Marxism and his experience as an Archbishop in Poland. There, he confronted both a Communist Government intent on limiting the power of the church, and an intellectually vibrant Catholic community that sought to counter the ''materialist'' theories of Marxism. The Pope's reaction to Marxism elsewhere in the world, including Latin America, has been heavily influenced by his belief that Communist regimes necessarily limit religious freedom and often seek to divide Christians. His choice of an encyclical to make his point is in a long tradition of such documents. In his 1981 encyclical, ''Laborem Exercens'' (''On Human Work''), he emphasized the church's commitment to the rights of labor at a time when the Solidarity union movement in Poland was near its height. Echoes 1891 Encyclical This encyclical, in turn, echoed one from Pope Leo XIII - ''Rerum Novarum'' (''Of New Things'') in 1891, which represented the Roman Catholic Church's first clear statement of its support for the rights of working people. At a news conference called to explain the new encyclical, the Rev. Umberto Betti, a Vatican theological expert, said it should be seen alongside two of the Pope's earlier encyclicals as a ''trilogy on the Trinity.'' In ''Redemptor Hominis'' in 1979, the Pope treated the theme of Christ as ''Redeemer of Man,'' and in ''Dives in Misericordia'' in 1980, John Paul spoke on ''the mercy of God'' the Father. The Pope's other two encyclicals were ''Laborem Exercens'' and ''Slavorum Apostoli'' (''The Apostles of the Slavs'') last year, on Christianity in Eastern Europe. Composed in Polish Father Betti said the Pope had composed the new encyclical in his native Polish, then translated it into Italian, from which all the other official translations came. He said the Pope had first conceived of an encyclical on the Holy Spirit in 1982 and began writing it last year. The Holy Spirit is in many ways the most abstract, ethereal expression of God's existence in Christian theology. The coming of the Holy Spirit was promised by Jesus, and his descent on the Pentecost, 50 days after Easter, renewed the Apostles' faith, according to the Scriptures, and empowered them to heal the sick, speak in tongues and prophesy. The Holy Spirit is believed by Catholics to guide the church and to deliver it from error. In his encyclical, the Pope often refers to the ''Counselor'' who is ''continually at work in the church.'' The Pope's decision to highlight the importance of the Holy Spirit was also significant because of his long-term goal of reuniting Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Holy Spirit Was an Issue The main theological issue - there were also political questions - that led to the break between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism in 1054 was the nature of the Holy Spirit. The dispute was over the inclusion of the word ''filioque,'' in the Creed, to assert that the Holy Spirit ''proceeded'' not only from God the Father but ''also from the Son.'' To the Orthodox, this downgraded the role of the Spirit to a position below that of Christ. The Pope underlined his desire for reunion with Eastern Orthodoxy by noting that the current millenium, at the beginning of which the split took place, was about to come to an end. John Paul's encyclical underlined what has emerged as perhaps the single most important theme of his pontificate: his insistent assertion of the primacy of the spiritual over the material, and his consequent fears for a world he sees as turning its back on God. Related to this is his belief, as expressed in the encyclical, that modern men and women do not understand the difference between good and evil, ''reflected in the loss of the sense of sin.'' Cites 'Death of God' Theologies The Pope saw signs of the turning away from God in the ''death of God'' theologies, which were briefly popular in the 1960's. ''The rejection of God has reached the point of declaring his 'death.' An absurdity both in concept and expression!'' the Pope wrote. ''But the ideology of the 'death of God' is more a threat to man.'' Citing the teachings of the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), the Pope declared that ''without the Creator, the creature would disappear'' and that ''when God is forgotten, the creature itself grows unintelligible.'' The loss of God and of any sense of sinfulness, the Pope said, resulted in ''the signs and symptoms of death'' visible ''on the horizon of contemporary civilization.'' These included the ''inherent danger of nuclear self-destruction,'' as well as ''the grave situation of vast areas of our planet, marked by death-dealing poverty and famine.'' ''It is a question of problems that are not only economic but also and above all ethical,'' he said. 'Pressure to Reject God' Referring repeatedly to Satan as ''the father of lies,'' John Paul argued that ''throughout the history of humanity, there will be a constant pressure on man to reject God, even to the point of hating him. ''Man,'' he continued, ''will be inclined to see in God primarily a limitation on himself and not the source of his own freedom and the fullness of good.'' The Pope also used the encyclical for one of his sharpest attacks on abortion and euthanasia. ''On the horizon of our era there are gathering even darker signs of death,'' he said. ''A custom has become widely established - in some places it threatens to become almost an institution -of taking the lives of human beings even before they are born, or before they reach the natural point of death.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RELIGIOUS RIGHT CHALLENGING G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/02/us/religious-right-challenging-gop.html,"The sudden emergence of the Rev. Pat Robertson and the religious right in Presidential politics means Republicans must reassess their strategies for 1988, their advisers and political experts say. Although the 55-year-old television evangelist's appeal to voters has yet to be tested, political experts say that in some key states his candidacy could hurt Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, the party's leading contenders. They were upstaged last week when about 4,500 supporters of the Freedom Council, a group founded by Mr. Robertson, qualified to run for precinct delegate slots in Michigan's Aug. 5 primary. The primary is the first phase of the process for selecting the state's delegates to the 1988 Republican National Convention and the group's success deprived either Mr. Bush or Mr. Kemp of a clear victory. Ammunition for Conservatives Political experts said further successes for the religious right would give the party's hard-line conservatives new ammunition for persuading a candidate more to their liking to seek the nomination. One who might heed their call is Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, who has said he would consider a Presidential bid if a strong contender did not emerge by early next year. Robert Teeter, a Detroit-based poll-taker who is one of Mr. Bush's closest advisers, said any strategy for the nomination would have to consider the potential of a Robertson candidacy. He said such a candidacy could mobilize the religious right as an unpredictable element in the primary campaign. He said the religious right was likely to have less influence in primary elections than in party caucuses and conventions, which are more easily dominated by activist groups. ''They also have greater significance in multi-candidate races,'' he said, adding that in a crowded field, ''if Robertson only got 5 or 6 percent of the vote, that could be important.'' Setting Party's Agenda Mr. Robertson has said he would decide late this year or early next year whether to enter the race. A Kemp adviser said Mr. Robertson ''obviously'' had to be ''figured into the equation at this point, although I'm not sure what changes, if any, we need to make in our game plan. One thing we are not ready to do is concede the evangelical vote to Pat Robertson.'' The first delegates to the 1988 Republican National Convention will be chosen in the Iowa caucuses and at Michigan's state Republican convention. In Michigan last week, the Bush organization said it filed as many candidates as the Robertson group. The Kemp forces said they had 3,400 candidates, although they admit that they are counting some of the same candidates the Robertson camp is counting. One Republican strategist who supports Mr. Bush said that if Mr. Robertson was a candidate, his rivals would have to try to keep him from setting the agenda for the political debate. ''It would be a mistake for the others to try to out-do Robertson on abortion and the kind of social issues that energize his followers,'' the strategist said. Network of Activists The potential of the religious right to influence Presidential politics rests in part on its network of activists, a communications operation that includes cable television networks and direct-mail computers, and a political gospel that stresses conservative values, patriotism and social issues. ''No other interest group has the kind of unchallenged access to the audience they want to reach,'' said Jeffrey Hadden, a sociologist at the University of Virginia and author of the book, ''Prime Time Preachers.'' In Mr. Robertson, the movement has the promise of a national political leader, one who presides over an organization built around a cable television network supported by millions of viewers and contributors. Some analysts say, however, that the religious right is not likely to be a monolithic political force, even if Mr. Robertson should enter the Presidential scramble. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, another politically active evangelist, already has endorsed Mr. Bush for President, and aides to Mr. Kemp say that he has strong support from the religious right. ''The first problem is defining the evangelical group,'' said Mr. Teeter. ''If you take the people who fit the general definition of evangelicals, that could be 30 percent of the country, and that includes a very large chunk of blacks,'' who vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Even so, Mr. Teeter said evangelical and fundamentalist Christians are a major political constituency that had to be considered by strategists in the 1988 Presidential campaign. ''They're there, the numbers are impressive and they have the technology to communicate with each other,'' he said. Tensions in Republican Party In the 1980 campaign, Ronald Reagan met in Dallas and gave his blessing to the political action movement of a group of evangelical Christians who advocated bloc voting for candidates who shared their views. That movement, a major element of the Reagan coalition, now has begun to create tensions within the Republican Party as the religious right runs candidates in Congressional races and challenges party regulars for control of local and state Republican organizations. The religious right could be ''an important source of support and political energy,'' one Republican poll-taker said, ''but it also could turn on the party in a costly way.'' This poll-taker, who asked not to be identified, said: ''It's an asset in that it is a new, identifiable, homogeneous and active political constituency that can be easily mobilized. It has its own communications network, fundraising operations and cadre of leaders.'' The risk, he added, was that the religious right was likely ''to dwell on the wrong issues,'' including abortion and school prayer, and could alienate younger voters and independents. Network Reaches Millions Mr. Robertson, a polished performer who was educated at the London School of Economics and Yale University, is a member of a prominent Virginia family and is the best known and most successful of the television preachers. His Christian Broadcasting Network reaches about 16 million households each month and brings in more than $200 million annually in donations. He is the host of ''The 700 Club,'' a religious talk show that appears four times a day and is the centerpiece of his network's programming. His primary political organization is the Freedom Council, a tax-exempt educational foundation with a staff of 50, an annual budget of $5.5 million and 60,000 dues-paying members. Influence Said to Vary Richard Minard, the council's national director, said it was ''non-partisan,'' but acknowledged in an interview that Mr. Robertson stood to benefit from its work in Michigan. Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst, said the influence of the religious right would ''vary greatly from state to state.'' ''It's going to easiest for them to be an influence in primary elections in states in the North and Midwest that have strong Republican traditions, states like Michigan, Iowa and Minnesota,'' he said. In the South, he added, their greatest impact would be in general elections. ''That's because in the South you're dealing with a lot of low-income, blue-collar people who have to vote in Democratic primaries if they want to have a role in electing sheriffs, mayors and local officeholders,'' he said. It remains to be seen how many of the candidates recruited by the Freedom Council will be elected to delegate posts in Michigan, and how many of them are committed to Mr. Robertson. But the momentum he gained there is certain to aid his political fundraising and organizing efforts in states like Iowa, Florida and North Carolina, all early Presidential battlegrounds. Said one Bush supporter: ''Robertson showed he can be effective in a small universe situation where a few thousand people can make a difference. There is no event in the near future to counter what happened in Michigan. Until there is, Robertson is going to loom as a bigger force than any of us ever thought he would be.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COLLEGES USE HONORARY DEGREES TO RAISE ISSUES RATHER THAN ENDOWMENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/02/nyregion/colleges-use-honorary-degrees-to-raise-issues-rather-than-endowments.html,"Honorary degrees, traditionally bestowed by American colleges and universities during commencement season as a way to note academic or civic accomplishments, are increasingly being used to take positions on political, social and moral issues. At the commencement exercises of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice yesterday, an honorary degree was awarded in absentia to Winnie Mandela, a leading antiapartheid activist in South Africa and the wife of Nelson Mandela, imprisoned leader of the outlawed African National Congress. In doing so, the school acknowledged her role in resisting what the official citation called ''the cruelty and injustice of South Africa's racist regime.'' At its commencement ceremonies last month, Russell Sage College in Troy, N.Y., gave an honorary degree to the disarmament advocate Dr. Helen Caldicott, citing her opposition to ''the world's nuclear madness'' and thanking her for ''awakening us to the impending suicide of our planet and its people.'' Such citations signal a marked departure from the customary role of honorary degrees as a way to thank philanthropists for contributions, alumni and public officials for efforts in behalf of the school or even as a way to gather publicity through the presence of a celebrity. South Africa Draws Attention The issue attracting most attention this year appears to be South Africa and its system of apartheid, or racial separation. Colleges have been under pressure from students and faculty members to divest themselves of stock in companies active in South Africa and to take other steps to distance themselves from the white-minority government there. ''There have been increasing numbers of South Africans honored with honorary degrees in recent years,'' said Jennifer Davis, executive director of the American Committee on Africa, an antiapartheid group that has been active on many campuses. ''It is an important recognition of the new stage of struggle in South Africa and an important step for American consciousness.'' In addition to Mrs. Mandela, institutions in the New York area have awarded honorary degrees to Bishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was the main commencement speaker at Hunter College last Thursday, and Helen Suzman, a white opposition member of the South African Parliament. Other honorees this spring include the Rev. Beyers Naude, an Afrikaner cleric who was put under house arrest by the South African Government in 1977 after reversing his position and denouncing apartheid. The playwright Athol Fugard received honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and the City University of New York last month, and Roman Catholic Archbishop Denis E. Hurley of Durban, a particularly outspoken critic of his Government's resettlement policy, will be honored later this month by De Paul University in Chicago and the University of Santa Clara in California. 'A Moral Context' ''What we are trying to do is put the political statement in a moral context and make it an educational experience for our students and community,'' said the president of Santa Clara, the Rev. William Rewak. ''This is a seething public issue right now, about which there has been a great deal of discussion on our campus, and we want to be on record.'' A professor of anthropology at Hunter College and member of the committee that picks recipients of honorary degrees there, Daniel Bates, said that ''even if political events had not taken such a serious turn, we would have been delighted'' to honor Bishop Tutu. But he said that a ''high-minded statement'' on South Africa has more impact ''when it is made by a college like Hunter.'' ''One thing a college tries to do is draw attention to the things it stands for,'' Dr. Bates said. ''This college is a public institution that is more than 50 percent black and Hispanic, so this is a meaningful question to our students, who have been discriminated against themselves.'' Other Issues South Africa is not the only issue being addressed. Universities have also used honorary degrees this spring to comment on matters such as nuclear disarmament, Central America, the Philippines and abortion. There are even instances of colleges rescinding offers of honorary degrees on what they see as an issue of conscience. Quincy College in Quincy, Ill., last month withdrew an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and commencement speech invitation to Senator Alan J. Dixon, an Illinois Democrat, after what it called ''careful scrutiny'' of his views on abortion. ''It was felt that the voting record of the Senator reflects positions incompatible with the philosophy of Quincy College,'' according to a statement issued in the name of the school, which is a Roman Catholic institution. Mr. Dixon has said he does not favor abortion but does not favor a Constitutional amendment barring abortions. Of the several thousand honorary degrees being awarded this commencement season, most are still of the traditional variety, according to educators and administrators. At some schools, in fact, students and faculty have been unable to overcome barriers to awarding honorary degrees to controversial political figures. At the University of Michigan, for example, a campaign by some students and faculty members to honor Mr. Mandela failed this year. In protest, a small ''alternative commencement'' was held at which student leaders noted that the university had earlier awarded honorary degrees to Ferdinand E. Marcos, then the President of the Philippines, and the Shah of Iran. University officials said it was not possible to award Mr. Mandela an honorary degree because of requirements that any recipient be present when the award is made. But Mr. Mandela's supporters argued that a change in the bylaws could have been made if regents and the degrees committee had been willing. A spokesman for the university, Robert A. Potter, said an honorary degree for Mr. Mandela had not been rejected outright. ''His name remains on the active list,'' and the university will consider proposals to waive the bylaw that worked against him, Mr. Potter said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABOUT EDUCATION; PANEL OF EXPERTS SEES TREND TOWARD 'SMARTER' TEXTBOOKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/science/about-education-panel-of-experts-sees-trend-toward-smarter-textbooks.html,"THE ''dumbing down'' of textbooks - a phrase coined by former Secretary of Education Terrel H. Bell - may at last have bottomed out, and a ''smartening up'' trend may be on its way. A panel of experts who reviewed the 31 most frequently used junior and senior high school American history textbooks reported last week that recent improvements in the texts have been ''dramatic.'' ''We happily note a reversal in an apparent trend to water down school history,'' said the chairman of the panel, O. L. Davis Jr., professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Texas. The panel rated 13 of the books ''good to excellent'' and 12 others ''satisfactory.'' The other six were rated ''poor.'' ''Most of these new 1986 U.S. history books are very good; some are excellent,'' Professor Davis said. He added: ''The United States is presented in a postive light by all of the textbooks we studied. At the same time, these books do not attempt to obscure recognizable blemishes in the story of our nation's continuing progress.'' Most of the books, he said, stress ''intellectual understanding of major principles and concepts and common loyalties in our nation's heritage, but they do not indoctrinate.'' The review's most serious criticism is that even the best books fail to give adequate coverage to the role of religion in American life. The panel also criticized the excessive attention given to ''readability'' formulas that dictate the use of short words and sentences, which, ironically, make the books less readable. The reviewers said they found the earlier tendency to avoid issues largely remedied. The role of black Americans is no longer neglected, they said, but the treatment of women, people of Hispanic origin, Asians and American Indians is still inadequate. Hispanic Americans, whose ancestors were the first European explorers and settlers within the nation's current boundaries, the panel says, are still being ignored or only casually mentioned, even though they will constitute this country's largest ethnic group by the end of this century. The role of women in America's history, and how women feel about their part in it and about their lives, the review adds, deserves greater attention. Some books were also criticized as ''bloodless'' in their effort to ignore that ''warfare that employs spears of atomic bombs is brutal, ugly and violent.'' ''To depict it in any other form is only bad history,'' the panel said. Despite its attention to such shortcomings, the panel was encouraged by the general improvement of American history texts. While no individual ratings were given to the books, the reviewers cited several as outstanding, among them: ''A History of the United States Since 1861'' (Ginn and Company); ''The American Nation: Beginnings Through Reconstruction, and Reconstruction to the Present'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich); ''Triumph of the American Nation'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich); ''History of the American People'' (Holt, Rinehart and Winston), and ''America: The Glorious Republic,'' in two volumes (Houghton Mifflin). The review was commissioned by People for the American Way, a nonprofit organization that describes its goals as ''to protect constitutional liberties.'' In an earlier study the organization reviewed biology texts and found that most publishers had succumbed to pressures to minimize, or even eliminate, the topic of evolution in order to pacify adherents of the creationist view of human origins. Half of the texts were found to cover evolution inadequately, and one in six did not even mention it. Calling the improvement of American history texts ''dramatic,'' Anthony T. Podesta, president of People for the American Way, said he welcomed the finding that many publishers have apparently decided to resist ''pressures from ultrafundamentalists who want textbooks to teach children what to think, not how to think.'' Publishers who used to submit to such pressures, he said, are now encouraging students to think critically and creatively. But, turning to an aspect of this and other studies that has attracted considerable interest, Mr. Podesta underscored the panel's concern over the generally poor coverage of religion in American history. He made it clear that neither he nor his organization in any way advocated the teaching of religion, but criticized the books' failure to teach ''about religion'' and its significance in American life. ''The two themes, which have been in tension since the earliest colonial times - religious intolerance and religious idealism - are not recognized as essential to an understanding of the American character,'' he said. When religion is mentioned, it is just that - mentioned.'' ''While history textbooks talk about the existence of religious diversity in America,'' he continued, ''they do not show it. Jews exist only as the objects of discrimination. Catholics exist to be discriminated against and to ask for Government money for their own schools. There is no reflection of the diversity within American Protestantism.'' Mr. Podesta asserts that the books omit the role of religion in fueling social movements, such as Prohibition, the labor movement, antiwar protests and the abortion debate. He found much of the coverage of the Holocaust superficial. ''The poor coverage of religion is not the result of any ideological bias - left and right in the world of religion are ignored equally,'' Mr. Podesta said. ''When there is no Billy Graham, there is no National Council of Churches. In fact, more often than not, when Moral Majority is mentioned, it is treated as virtually the only religious development since World War II.'' Publishers, he concluded, ''fear pressure from both militant atheists and militant fundamentalists.'' Such criticism differs basically from that voiced in a textbook review underwritten by the Department of Education and published last month, which called for greater conservatism in the presentation of American life and religion, and complained that texts shortchanged Protestants by giving too much space to Catholics and Jews. By contrast, Professor Davis's panel stressed that ''our history must not be held hostage to any ideology.'' It warned against allowing indoctrination to replace education. Copies of the report, with listings of all the books reviewed by the panel, are available for $5 from People for the American Way, 1424 16th Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EDUCATION; RELIGION LACK IN TEXTS CITED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/science/education-religion-lack-in-texts-cited.html,"In one history textbook Joan of Arc is discussed without any mention of God or of her becoming a saint. In another, the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving Day is described without any reference to their thanking God for their survival in the new land. These examples, from a study financed by the Federal Department of Education, are cited as indicative of the way school textbooks treat the role of religion in history. This study's findings resemble those of two other recent surveys in concluding that religion's role has been largely excised from the textbooks. But the studies offer widely different reasons for this. The Education Department's study holds that a ''liberal bias'' in many textbooks is responsible. Textbooks, it says, ''characterize'' American history in terms of minority rights, feminism and environmental issues, and fail to give any ''serious positive treatment'' to conservative views. But the other studies, one by People for the American Way, a nonprofit organization that monitors the religious right, and the other by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a 39-year-old religious-liberty organization, see the omission as reflecting the desire of textbook publishers to avoid controversy at all costs. The studies finding religion omitted from textbooks are applauded by Education Secretary William J. Bennett, who has denounced ''the assault of secularism on religion.'' In a recent speech that cited the Americans United findings, Mr. Bennett said, ''If students grow up ignorant of the role of religion, of religious freedom and religious faith in American life, then surely we will have badly failed them.'' His chief of staff, William Kristol, said Mr. Bennett attributed the lack of religion in textbooks to publishers' desires to skirt controversy and to an ''often unconscious liberal or secular bias.'' However, according to Donald Eklund, vice president of the school division of the Association of American Publishers, textbooks simply reflect the demands made by school boards. ''This is one of the most competitive of all businesses,'' Mr. Eklund said. ''State and local school boards set the rules. If publishers don't abide by them, they don't stay in business. If boards wanted more religion, they could do something about it.'' Lois Eskin, a top editor at Holt, Rinehart and Winston, said the company takes pains to remain neutral where religion is concerned. She disputed the contention that religion has been removed from contexts in which it is historically relevant, as did Jeremiah Kaplan, chairman and president of Macmillan Publishing Company. ''Religion is treated adequately in our textbooks,'' he said. Henry F. Graff, a professor of history at Columbia University who is the author of textbooks for junior and senior high schools on American history, conceded that ''there are probably more things we can say about religion in American life'' than have been included in recent textbooks. ''But when the right in this country talks about religion in the books,'' Professor Graff added, ''they're interested in anti-abortion and fostering their own agenda. They're interested in more than the spirit of God.'' According to Mr. Kristol of the Education Department, the view that one must be ''a right wing crazy to say that religion has been shortchanged in our children's textbooks'' was disproved by the appearance of the studies by the two citizens groups. Of the three studies, only the one financed by the department reflects conservative views. That study was directed by Paul C. Vitz, a psychology professor at New York University, who received a $74,000 grant to conduct it. In an interview last month in Education Update, a publication of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, Professor Vitz contended that ''secular humanists have been able to dominate and control education.'' ''Those who write and publish the textbooks are of a relatively homogeneous, secular and antireligious mentality,'' he said. ''Individual principals or superintendents who select textbooks are of the same attitude.'' His study bears the warning that it does not necessarily reflect the views of the department. But Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican of Connecticut, an outspoken critic of the Vitz study, recently attacked Mr. Bennett for ''rewarding'' Professor Vitz with another grant, $24,000 from the Secretary's discretionary fund, in spite of the fact, Mr. Weicker said, that the professor's application did not rank well in a peer review of grant proposals. In his study of textbooks, Professor Vitz deals both with the historical inaccuracies that result from omitting references to religion and with what he regards as biases against ''committed Protestantism'' and traditional family values. He says a sample of 40 books included not a single reference to television evangelists, born-again Christians or the Moral Majority organization. And while textbooks neglect Christianity, he says, they overly emphasize feminism. He also says they display a ''lack of support for business,'' a ''lack of patriotism'' and a ''liberal bias'' in selecting role models. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, and the environmentalist Rachel Carson are depicted as role models, he says, but Phyllis Schlafly, Dr. Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jerry Falwell and Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, are not mentioned. The movement against the proposed Federal equal rights amendment, ''the pro-life movement and the tax revolt'' are also neglected, he says. ''Phyllis Schlafly's group, the Eagle Forum, represents tens of millions of people,'' Professor Vitz said in an interview. ''They have as much right to determine the content of textbooks as the political and social opposition.'' Politics aside, Professor Vitz's observations regarding the treatment - or nontreatment - of history are bolstered by the other two studies. The one financed by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, conducted by Professor Charles C. Haynes, a former religion professor who now works as a consultant with Americans United, also says that topics involving religion are ''largely ignored'' in American history and civics books in high schools. This is ''an urgent danger signal'' for religious freedom, he says. The study by People for the American Way similarly points out that ''school histories, with only rare exceptions, treat religion by exclusion or by brief and simplistic reference.'' That study, of which O. L. Davis, professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Texas at Austin, was chairman, examined 31 American history texts for junior and senior high schools. It concluded, ''Honest treatment of religion in American history seems to be equated with advocacy of particular religious ideas and practices.'' People for the American Way has been providing legal help for school boards in court cases in Tennessee and Alabama, in which some parents have charged that their childrens' school reading materials are colored by anti-Christian, ''secular humanist'' themes. But the group's president, Anthony Podesta, finds nothing contradictory in its call for religion to receive better treatment in textbooks. The same fear of controversy that leads publishers to remove evolution from biology texts, he said, is responsible for their removing religion from history books, both at the expense of academic integrity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TIGHT G.O.P. CONTEST IN CALIFORNIA FOR CHANCE TO CHALLENGE CRANSTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/04/us/tight-gop-contest-in-california-for-chance-to-challenge-cranston.html,"Two California Republicans from opposite sides of their party's political spectrum were in a tight battle tonight for the right to challenge Senator Alan Cranston this November. With 16 percent of the votes counted, Representative Ed Zschau, a moderate who represents Northern California's high-technology industrial belt, held a 33 percent to 29 percent lead over Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative television commentator from Los Angeles. The two candidates were out-distancing 11 other Republicans who were seeking to block Mr. Cranston, the Senate Democratic whip, from a fourth term. Replay of Governor's Race Against little opposition, Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, and Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, a Democrat, won their parties' nominations for the November election. Mr. Deukmejian narrowly defeated Mr. Bradley for the governorship four years ago. The early returns also indicated that a referendum that supporters contended would limit the spiraling cost of liability damage suits was winning by a small margin. In San Diego, early returns indicated that voters were going to elect the first woman to serve as the city's mayor. With more than 40 percent of the votes counted, Maureen F. O'Connor, a former member of the City Council, was leading Councilman Bill Cleator 54 percent to 46 percent. Although the 13-way battle for the Republican Senate nomination has dominated partisan politics in the state this year, it apparently failed to ignite much interest among voters. Election officials said that they expected the voter turnout today to be the lowest in the state's history for a primary election, with only 38 percent of registered voters going to the polls in Los Angeles County. Officials attibuted the low turnout to the state's general prosperity recently and to an absence of other more contentious issues on the ballot. Cranston's Three Victories All of Mr. Cranston's three previous Senate victories have been against members of the conservative wing of the Republican Party in California that Mr. Herschensohn represents. Mr. Zschau, who was first elected to Congress in 1982, had been a successful entrepreneur in the electronics industry. Virtually unknown in most of the state a year ago, he vaulted to prominence in the race through television commercials financed by more than $3 million in contributions from business interests led by David Packard, co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company. The commercials, among other things, were intended to explain how to pronounce his name - like the first syllable of shower. Mr. Zschau, who is 46 years old, describes himself as a moderate on social issues and a conservative on economic and most military issues. He maintains, for example, that women should have the right to decide whether to have abortions, but opposes public financing of abortions. He opposes production of the MX missile, contends the Pentagon wastes too much money, but, after first opposing it, supports President Reagan's efforts to give aid to Nicaraguan rebels. Former Nixon Speechwriter Mr. Herschensohn, 53, was seeking his first elective office after rising to prominence in southern California as a political commentator for a Los Angeles television station. Once a speechwriter for President Nixon, he is an articulate speaker who has drawn high marks in the campaign for his command of foreign affairs. Throughout the campaign, in which he had trouble establishing credibility in parts of the state that were not familiar with his television commentary, he called for a constitutional amendment to bar abortions, opposed the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, favored ordering the United Nations out of this country, supported the MX missile, took a dim view of any arms control agreements, and called for the United States to take a tougher stance in its dealings with the Soviet Union. Besides Mr. Zschau and Mr. Herschensohn, the other principal candidates in the race were Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich; Ed Davis, a former Los Angeles Police Chief; Representative Bobbi Fiedler; the economist Arthur Laffer, and State Assemblyman Robert Naylor. Cranston Urges Debates Mr. Cranston faced only token opposition in his bid for the Democratic Senate nomination. He said today that he had sent a telegram to the Republican Party urging the winner of its primary to join him in a series of campaign debates. The pre-election campaign over the ballot measure known as Proposition 51, which would limit the size of certain jury awards in liability cases, was one of the most expensive in the nation's history, costing both sides a total of about $10 million. Under existing law in California, as in a number of other states, a wealthy defendant, like a city or corporation can be required to pay all damages in a liability case even though their negligence was only marginally responsible for an accident. The proposition would limit awards proportionately to the defendant's responsibility. Trial lawyers in the state spent more than $5 million to defeat the measure, while insurance companies, local governments and organized medicine spent almost as much in seeking to have it passed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRIMARIES POINT TO BATTLES FOR STATE CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/05/us/primaries-point-to-battles-for-state-control.html,"The results of Tuesday's primary voting point toward pitched battles this fall in California, Alabama and South Dakota that figure heavily in party strategies in the fight for control of the Senate, political experts said today. While both Democrats and Republicans contended that the results in the three states brightened their Senate prospects, political experts said the most significant outcome was the emergence of a serious Republican challenger to Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California. California Republicans, choosing from 13 candidates in their Senate primary, nominated Representative Ed Zschau of Los Altos, a moderate Republican and high-technology millionaire who had heavy financial backing from business in the state. One of the Republican incumbents considered to be in the greatest political jeopardy, Senator James Abdnor of South Dakota, survived a primary challenge from Gov. William Janklow by a surprising 10-point margin. Party strategists say that his strong showing against Mr. Janklow, a popular politician who contended that Mr. Abdnor could not win in November, should improve the Senator's chances of holding his seat against his Democratic rival, Representative Thomas A. Daschle. In Alabama, Republicans had hoped that Representative Richard C. Shelby, a conservative Democrat, would be forced into a runoff in the contest for his party's Senate nomination. But Mr. Shelby won more than 50 percent of the primary vote against four opponents, strengthening his position against the state's first-term Republican incumbent, Senator Jeremiah Denton. In one recent statewide poll, Mr. Shelby was running even with Mr. Denton. Democrats Need 4 Seats Democrats, who are a 47-to-53 minority, need to pick up four seats to regain control of the Senate. One thing in their favor is the arithmetic: 22 seats held by Republicans are up this year, as against 12 held by Democrats. ''There is no question in my mind, we're going to win the Senate,'' said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Committee. ''Of the 22 Republican-held seats, Democrats are ahead in the polls in six - Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, Nevada, South Dakota and Idaho.'' Of the 12 Democratic seats at stake, he added, ''we are leading in 10, roughly even in Missouri and behind in only one, Louisiana.'' Republicans, however, differ with that assessment, particularly Mr. Mitchell's description of California as a safe Democratic seat. ''We think Tuesday's vote was good news for Republicans,'' said David Narsavage, a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''California is now our No. 1 race and we're closing in.'' Today, as Republicans held a unity luncheon in Los Angeles to close ranks behind Mr. Zschau, who is viewed as a liberal by the party's conservative wing, Cranston strategists were preparing their first television assault against his Republican challenger. One benefit Mr. Cranston expects to reap from Mr. Zschau's nomination is the strong support and financial backing of the state's Jewish voters. The 71-year-old Senator has been one of Israel's strongest allies on Capitol Hill, and on Thursday Mr. Cranston is set to lead the fight on the Senate floor against the Reagan Administration's proposed arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Zschau Votes at Issue Mr. Zschau has frequently voted against Israel's positions. He supported Saudi arms sales and last year backed a supplemental appropriations amendment that, among other things, would have slashed foreign aid by 5 percent across the board, with no exception for Israel. Jim LeMunyon, a spokesman for Mr. Zschau, confirmed those votes but added that the Congressman has been a strong supporter of President Reagan's Middle East policies. Cranston strategists said they would soon begin running television commercials attacking the record of the 46-year-old Congressman from the state's Silicon Valley on a key environmental issue, the cleanup of toxic waste. Mr. LeMunyon said Mr. Zschau had voted for legislation to establish a Federal ''superfund'' that requires chemical companies to pay part of the cost of cleaning up toxic waste. But he said the lawmaker had opposed an amendment that would have set aside money in the fund to pay damage claims to individuals. Mr. Zschau, the aide added, also voted against a measure that would have required companies to make public a list of the chemicals they discharged into the environment. Some Democratic strategists say they were concerned that Mr. Zschau's political appeal could transcend any set of issues. California is a state of weak party identification, they say, and its voters in the past have often favored new faces and candidates who defy easy ideological labeling. Starting his campaign with little name recognition outside his northern California district, Mr. Zschau spent $3 million, most of it on television, to familiarize voters with his name and his business background as a successful manufacturer of computer disk storage systems. In past elections, Republicans had nominated far-right conservatives who were easily defeated by Mr. Cranston, but Mr. Zschau's political independence and his appeal to voters in the center of the political spectrum confronts Mr. Cranston with a new kind of Republican challenger. Mr. Zschau is a free-market conservative with libertarian instincts. He opposes government intervention in both the economy and personal lives and has drawn criticism from party conservatives for his support for legalized abortion and the equal rights amendent for women. Like Mr. Cranston, he opposes the MX missile and supports arms control. Until this year, when he changed his position, Mr. Zschau had voted consistently against Mr. Reagan's requests for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. ''He's flip-flopped on contra aid and other issues,'' said one Cranston aide, ''and we're going to be use it to raise questions about his political character.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CURTAIN UP FOR SENATE TAX DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/05/business/curtain-up-for-senate-tax-debate.html,"With one senator after another calling it a historic occasion, the Senate began debate today on legislation that would overhaul the income tax system Congress has assembled piecemeal over decades. ''The moment has now arrived,'' said Senator Bob Packwood, the bill's floor manager, at the outset of the debate. ''We are on the tax bill, and it is the most radical tax bill the Congress has seen in half a century.'' No votes were taken today, and most of the session was devoted to opening statements by supporters of the measure, which would dramatically lower tax rates and abolish or restrict many deductions and other tax preferences. The Senate will put the tax bill aside Thursday to deal with President Reagan's plan to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and then will take up an appropriation bill. A full-scale debate on the tax bill and votes on amendments will resume next week. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said the Senate might be able to complete action on the measure by the end of next week, but most other senators expect the debate to last at least two weeks before a vote is taken on passage. The House of Representatives approved a companion bill last December. It follows the same principles as the Senate measure but differs in many important respects. If the Senate approves a bill, it will go to a House-Senate conference for reconciliation of the differences. In his opening statement, Senator Packwood, an Oregon Republican and chairman of the Finance Committee, urged the Senate to approve the legislation without amendment. ''It's not very often the brass ring is going to come this close,'' he said. ''This opportunity will not come again, not in this Congress, not in this decade, probably not in this century. It's the most extraordinary opportunity for the American people we are likely to see in our careers.'' President Reagan, who has invited all 100 senators to the White House for breakfast Thursday to lobby them on the tax bill, agrees that the bill should be approved without significant change. But many senators who said they supported the bill also said they wanted changes in it. Comment From D'Amato For example, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said this morning before the debate that it was ''absolutely ludicrous'' to ask senators to withhold amendments. ''I didn't get elected and I don't think senators are elected to be rubber stamps,'' said Mr. D'Amato, whose main interest is in preserving deductions for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts. Senator Packwood and other sponsors said the I.R.A. amendments were the ones that seemed to have generated the most support. The bill would disallow deductions for contributions to retirement accounts by taxpayers who are covered by company pension plans. It would let the interest and dividends earned by such accounts accumulate tax-free. Before the tax measure was officially called up today, several senators expressed opposition to other provisions. For example, John Melcher, a Montana Democrat, said the legislation would be devastating to agriculture, mining and timber interests in his state. As of this morning, 25 or 30 amendments had been filed, but many of those will not be called up for votes. The prevailing view was that the bill would be passed handily by the Senate, with an amendment on I.R.A.'s the only consequential one standing a chance of passage. Long Predicts Passage Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana said to Mr. Packwood: ''Your bill's going to pass. I predict that in confidence.'' Senator Long was chairman of the Finance Committee for more than a decade when Democrats controlled the Senate and presided over enactment of many of the tax rules that would be changed by this legislation. But today he called the tax measure before the Senate ''a long stride toward fair and equal justice for all taxpayers.'' Other senators made similar statements. Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, who was credited by many colleagues today with being the point man in the march toward tax revision, said the bill was ''the best thing middle-income Americans have seen in a generation.'' ''How can we expect only some Americans to pay for our national security, our schools, our health care for the elderly, our programs for the poor and our roads, subways and our ports?'' Mr. Bradley asked. Then he answered his own question: ''The answer is clear. We can't. It's time for us to look at the special interests and say get on board, be part of the community, be a part of America, pay some tax. It's time to remove the web of suspicion and inequity that covers our tax system.'' Some Questions Raised Some of the supporters also raised questions in their opening statements about parts of the measure. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, a senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he was preparing an amendment that would put the reductions in tax rates into effect at the first of next year. Although restrictions in deductions under the bill would be effective Jan. 1, rates would not be reduced until July 1. That means that many taxpayers would owe higher taxes in 1987 than they would if the present system were in place. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of a handful of senators who actively supported tax revision in years past, said today that he would vote for the measure ''enthusiastically'' but that he hoped ways could be found to have the wealthy pay more in taxes and the poor even less. One potential snag developed today: Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, a New Hampshire Republican, said he would offer an amendment that would disallow tax-exempt status for organizations that finance or provide facilities for abortions. Senator Packwood, a proponent of legalized abortion, called the tax bill an ''inappropriate place'' to debate the issue and said he hoped Mr. Humphrey would reconsider his intentions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EX-OFFICER IS G.O.P. HOPE IN 5-WAY HOUSE CONTEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/06/nyregion/ex-officer-is-gop-hope-in-5-way-house-contest.html,"Richard (Bo) Dietl is running for Congress with a .38-caliber handgun strapped to his left ankle, a vestige of his 15-year career in the New York City Police Department. Constituents in the Sixth Congressional District in Queens rarely notice Mr. Dietl's gun, but it symbolizes the law-and-order posture that Republican Party officials hope will inspire an upset in next Tuesday's special election, when Mr. Dietl will be facing four feuding Democrats. The death in April of Joseph P. Addabbo, a Democrat who represented the district since 1961, spurred bitterness and disorder among his would-be successors within the party. Assemblyman Alton R. Waldon was nominated by Queens Democratic district leaders, while State Senator Andrew Jenkins, also a Democrat, was designated by the Liberal Party as its candidate. Two other Democrats secured enough petition signatures to run independently: the Rev. Floyd Flake of the Allen A. M. E. Church in St. Albans and Kevin McCabe, an assistant city health commissioner. Tax Plan a Concern In a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans 7 to 1, and nonwhites represent a majority of the voters, Mr. Dietl's cause might be considered hopeless were it not for the crowded field. Political observers say such a situation probably would not have been permitted if Donald R. Manes were alive and running the county organization with his characteristically tight grip. Mr. Manes committed suicide in March as a continuing corruption investigation was unfolding. All of the candidates have looked for opportunities to praise Mr. Addabbo. All of them have also expressed concern that middle-class citizens are not sufficiently helped by the Senate Finance Committee-passed tax plan. Of the five candidates, two - Mr. Dietl and Mr. McCabe - are white. The three black candidates say that the time has come for a black representative in a district across southeast Queens where blacks predominate. Mr. Waldon and Mr. Jenkins stress their legislative experience. Mr. Waldon also points to his welcome in both the black and white communities and Senator Jenkins harks back to his days as a civil rights activist. Mr. Flake talks of his record as a community leader. Mr. McCabe focuses on his experience running government programs. Mr. Dietl, who has run a security business since his retirement last year, is alone in supporting the death penalty and opposing legal abortion. Dietl Downplays Party Ties It was Mr. Dietl's police background that most intrigued John F. Haggerty, the chairman of the Queens Republican Party. ''I think a Republican-Conservative who identifies with the law-and-order issue has an excellent shot,'' Mr. Haggerty said. But Mr. Dietl has tried to downplay his connection with the Republican Party and, to that end, his posters and campaign literature make no mention of party affiliation. ''If I can get people to look at the candidate and like the candidate, then they won't care,'' he said. ''I expect tremendous underground backing from Democrats like the Italians from Ozone Park and Howard Beach.'' Mr. Haggerty defended the posters. ''We're trying to pull out all the voters who will identify with him,'' he said. According to Mr. Haggerty and George L. Clark, the former state Republican chairman who is working for Mr. Dietl, national party organizations have made generous contributions to the Dietl campaign chest, which is expected to reach $75,000. ''I stressed with every bit of my energy to the National Congressional Campaign Committee that this was a do-able slot,'' said Mr. Clark. ''Bo's a bit of a bull in a china shop, but I've had it with lawyers elected to public office.'' Reagan's 'Kind of Guy' Last week, Mr. Dietl visited President Reagan in the Oval Office and the President, Mr. Dietl said, knew all about his high-profile arrests, including the rapists of a nun in East Harlem several years ago and the murderer of eight children in the East New York section of Brooklyn last spring. ''He told me, 'You're my kind of guy,' '' said the 35-year-old Mr. Dietl, who retired recently because, he said, he was assigned to a desk job after being injured in a sky-diving accident. Mr. Dietl's street-tough posture, including his frequent boasting that he averaged 100 felony arrests a year, is prompting both support and consternation in the district. On a recent tour of nursing homes, Mr. Dietl talked of mandatory life sentences for cocaine dealers - ''Let's put the animals away for life!'' - and the wheelchair-bound elderly applauded vigorously. He promised middle-income housing for the Rockaways - a return of ''people who care about their houses'' - and the patients voiced approval. But the next night, at a candidates symposium in Richmond Hill, a black man, John K. McMiller, jumped to his feet waving one of Mr. Dietl's advertisements, which includes a photograph of the former detective leading a handcuffed black prisoner. ''This is insulting and degrading to people who constitute 48 percent of your population,'' said Mr. McMiller, who identified himself as a Republican. Mr. Dietl apologized. Foes Critical of Tenor When confronted with criticism that he is running a racist campaign, Mr. Dietl responds by citing his police work in precincts in minority neighborhoods. ''I served those people,'' he said. ''I know their problems. I can relate to them better than anybody else.'' But Mr. Waldon and Mr. Jenkins, the other two well-financed candidates, are outspoken about what they consider the unacceptable tenor of Mr. Dietl's campaign. ''In Congress, you do things like pass bills and attend committee meetings and you need the collegial skills to interface,'' said Asseblyman Waldon, a former Housing Authority police officer. ''This young man is running amok, thinking he can throw somebody up against a wall, pat him down and get a bill passed. He's like Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson and the James Gang rolled into one.'' ''He knows absolutely nothing about politics and is playing on latent racism,'' said Senator Jenkins, ''but this is not - thank God - a racist district.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICAL MEMO; Bush and Kemp in the Early Hall of Mirrors,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/06/us/political-memo-bush-and-kemp-in-the-early-hall-of-mirrors.html,"At this early stage of jockeying, the contest for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination would be far less interesting if the realities matched appearances. Two cases in point are the unannounced campaigns of Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York. Mr. Bush is the overwhelming choice of Republicans in nearly every public opinion poll taken so far. But the sometimes stumbling manner in which his Presidential drive has unfolded to date suggests he is far from having a lock on the nomination. A Kemp candidacy, on the other hand, may have more potential than his low standing in the polls indicates. His early efforts have been hindered by, among other things, the reluctance of conservative activists to commit themselves. Questions About Bush First, consider Mr. Bush's situation. Some of his early political maneuvers, including what many considered his clumsy attack on Governor Cuomo of New York on ethnic prejudice, have reinforced questions about his political character and his ability to survive the pressures of a Presidential marathon. And Mr. Bush seems to be in no hurry to tackle what some political experts consider his greatest challenge: breaking out of his political servitude to President Reagan and fashioning his own identity and vision of the future. His strategists contend that the harsh assessments Washington insiders have made about Mr. Bush's performance are not shared by grassroots Republicans and have not significantly affected his standing in Presidential preference polls. But some political professionals suggest that this kind of reasoning underscores a potential danger for the Bush campaign: the tendency to confuse approval of his Vice-Presidential role with support for his Presidential candidacy. Kemp and the Opinion Polls Mr. Kemp faces a different set of problems. He is a man of ideas and he has a clearly defined message: The proper economic policies, he says, will spur growth and provide a ''ladder of opportunity'' for even the most disadvantaged elements of society. But in most public opinion polls, Mr. Kemp is still languishing in the single-digit bracket. One of the early political assumptions about the Republican contest was that Mr. Kemp would quickly emerge as Mr. Bush's main challenger from the right, something that has not happened so far. As the scrappy underdog, Mr. Kemp has done just about everything expected of a Presidential hopeful to lay a foundation for a campaign. The former Buffalo Bills quarterback, whose office gets 300 speaking invitations a week, has placed himself in bondage to his party, making speeches at local and state party events and candidate fund-raisers from Maine to Idaho. He is closely identified with Reaganomics and is an architect of the tax-cutting measure Mr. Reagan embraced as the centerpiece of his first-term economic program. And he has been out front on two of the conservative movement's litmus tests issues: opposition to abortion and support for United States military aid for anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua and Angola. At the same time, Mr. Kemp appears to be trying to redefine Republican conservatism in the post-Reagan period by appealing to blacks, union members and other Democratic constituencies. When it comes to addressing the concerns of minorities, no other Presidential hopeful matches Mr. Kemp's intensity. He attacks racism in South Africa and speaks with passion about the economic and social distress in this country's black ghettoes. ''Economic growth,'' he says, ''doesn't mean anything if it leaves people out.'' But many blacks may find his oratory more refreshing than convincing. To them, his message of jobs and growth sounds similiar to Mr. Reagan's economic prescription: a rising tide that lifts the smallest boats. Mr. Kemp has said he was not concerned about early polls, contending that they reflect little more than the name recognition of the Presidential hopefuls. His strategy has been to organize grassroots activists behind his candidacy and ambush the Vice President in one of the early contests. But that strategy has run into a complication: The early emergence of the Rev. Pat Robertson and the religious right as potential factors in Iowa and Michigan, the first states to choose Republican nominating delegates in 1988, raises questions about Mr. Kemp's ability to build a solid conservative base from which to challenge Mr. Bush. Patience seems to be one of Mr. Kemp's strong suits. In time, his strategists say, conservatives will realize that Mr. Robertson, whatever his appeal, is not going to win the nomination. When they are hit by the blinding light of pragmatism on the road to 1988, Mr. Kemp expects to be the prime beneficiary. For much of this year Mr. Bush has been courting conservative groups, hoping that if he cannot gain their early support he can at least prevent them from rallying behind Mr. Kemp or some other contender. That strategy seems to have worked so far, but at some point conservatives are going to begin choosing sides. Some remain suspicious of Mr. Bush, saying he has never been out front on any issue on their agenda. If Bush Should Falter . . . If Mr. Bush's campaign should falter in one of the early states, Mr. Kemp's candidacy could take off. Or one of the party's dark horses, or even a new face, could emerge. Either Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, or Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, his predecessor in that job, could break out of the pack. Or someone like Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, Mr. Reagan's old friend and confidant, might enter the race. ''For the first time since 1960 no one owns the conservative movement,'' said David Keene, a consultant who advises Mr. Dole. ''In the end, they're all likely to get a piece of the conservative movement.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHILDREN OF POVERTY: CRISIS IN NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/magazine/children-of-poverty-crisis-in-new-york.html,"IMAGINE THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CALLING AN URGENT NEWS CONFERENCE to announce that the crisis of the city's poor children had reached such proportions that he was mobilizing the city's talents for a massive rescue effort not unlike the one that saved us from bankruptcy 10 years ago. I believe some such drastic action is warranted, even essential, because our city is threatened by the spreading blight of a poverty even crueler in some ways than that of the Great Depression half a century ago. Almost 40 percent of our children - 700,000 boys and girls - now live in families with incomes below the poverty line. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has estimated that half of the babies born in the city in 1980 can be expected to be on our welfare rolls before they reach the age of 18. Social critics, including Mr. Moynihan, have been telling a tale of two cities to describe the kind of community New York has become: while the city enjoys prosperity, the ''new'' poverty goes unchecked. The richest Congressional district in the nation shares a boundary with one of the poorest. And it was precisely during the last two banner years of economic growth and enhanced city budgets that the child poverty rate accelerated dramatically. Today's children of poverty are suffering in ways that would have dumbfounded those who knew the Great Depression: an estimated 3,000 babies born addicted to drugs every year, 10,000 children living in shelters and hotels for the homeless, 12,000 children who were abused or neglected so severely last year that they had to be removed from their homes and placed in foster care. All too many poor children in New York are denied dignity even in death, according to a recent report by the Coalition for the Homeless. The report revealed that almost half of the infants under the age of 1 who died in the city between 1981 and 1984 were buried in potter's field in unmarked graves that their families thus could not visit. All this poses a practical as well as a moral issue for the city, for the way we deal with the problem will determine the quality of life for all of us in the future. There is no question that the problem is enormously difficult, but it is not yet hopeless. Many sensible steps can be taken to attack the situation, including the appointment of one person - a ''czar'' if you will - to oversee all agencies that serve children, efforts to engage the private sector, revamping of the workloads of caseworkers and the increasing involvement of the school system. There are others as well. This is not to say that the solutions will be easy. The problem is exacerbated by the rate of family breakdown, and the cruel choices this presents for the city can be illustrated with the story of 3-year-old Giovanny Maria of the Bronx, recorded in the Surrogate's Court this spring. His fate came to be decided by a judge because, shortly after his third birthday, his mother decided that being a parent had become too much of a burden. Giovanny's mother was planning a trip to the Dominican Republic and did not know when, if ever, she might return. The boy's father was unknown, so she left Giovanny with a friend. The friend was a 20-year-old single woman with a ninth-grade education, unemployed and living on public assistance and food stamps. Last November, she and Giovanny began living in a single room in a three-story rooming house, where they shared a kitchen and two bathrooms with 20 other people. Under the circumstances, these living arrangements were felt to be the best possible by a caseworker for the New York City Office of Special Services for Children, whose function is to intervene to protect the welfare of children like Giovanny. The caseworker was sent to Surrogate's Court to support a petition to have the mother's friend declared his legal guardian. Giovanny's prospective new mother failed to appear for the guardianship hearing, leading the lawyer for the city to wonder whether she was fit to care for the child. Still, the caseworker told the court that, under the circumstances, the boy should remain where he was. She recounted her investigation of Giovanny's life in the rooming house. ''He didn't have any marks on him and he looks well cared for,'' she testified, although she conceded that because the child spoke little English and she spoke no Spanish, she had reached her conclusion without ever communicating directly with the boy. As for his living conditions, she said they seemed adequate: the communal bathrooms were ''moderately clean'' and the room the child was sharing with his prospective guardian was ''spacious, well heated and clean.'' But it seems clear that the only valid argument for continuing the arrangement was that the alternatives were far worse - either a homeless shelter for the woman and child or a foster home for the child. Judge Bertram R. Gelfand, Bronx County Surrogate, ordered the city to remove Giovanny from the ''deplorable'' conditions of the rooming house and to ''place this child in a more appropriate environment which will more likely protect his health, safety, welfare . . . [ and ] give him the opportunities in life to which he, and every child in our society, is entitled.'' The judge, in a rebuke to the city for the inadequate resources it devotes to its child protective services, urged the city to staff the agency with more professionally qualified social workers, at higher salaries. (Giovanny's worker had a degree in communications and was earning $19,000 a year.) The judge also reflected on the city's budget priorities: ''This court is sensitive to the constrictions of budget limitations. However, in a budget-making process that is necessarily based upon fixing priorities, the cost of assuring the development of children into useful citizens is minuscule against the costs of endlessly continuing to expand the criminal justice system . . . create new expanded drug and alcohol abuse programs and swell the ranks of those who cannot provide for themselves, all because, in early childhood, people were denied the fundamental education and upbringing necessary to meet the challenges of life.'' Citing the confidentiality provisions of the state's social-service law, a spokesman for the Special Services agency said it could not reveal what happened to Giovanny after the judge's decision. Nevertheless, we can reasonably speculate that foster care would not have been a desirable solution. Unlike adoption, foster care is not a permanent arrangement, and many foster ''parents'' participate simply because they get extra income. They may take a child in for a day, a week, a month or longer, then send the child back. Too many foster-care children ultimately end up in shelters for the homeless. Despite the problems with the system, it is being strained beyond its limits by the magnitude and pervasiveness of poverty and family breakdown. Children are being abused and mistreated at record levels, abandoned like excess luggage, and we are simply running out of places to put them. The Special Services agency projects that it will have to cope with reports of abuse and neglect involving 69,000 children in the coming fiscal year. The number of cases has been increasing at a rate of about 10 percent a year. David Tobis, a senior associate at Welfare Research Inc., a respected policy studies group, has concluded that in some neighborhoods ''as many as 20 percent of the children have been reported to be abused or neglected during the past five years.'' The total foster-care population in the city is now about 17,000, one of the largest in the country. But while the demand for foster care has risen, the availability of beds has contracted. This spring, hundreds of children, from infants to adolescents, were piling up in agency offices and sleeping on benches, while overburdened and harassed caseworkers labored through the night trying to arrange temporary foster-care placements for them. On any given day this spring, up to 30 healthy infants were lingering in hospitals, at a cost of several hundred dollars a day for each infant, because there were no foster beds. Reports of child abuse are coming in so fast that workers in some agency regional offices are assigned 10 or 11 new cases a month, despite the fact that New York State's Department of Social Services has established a guideline of 4 to 5 new cases a month as the number that a trained caseworker can manage with any degree of professional competence. According to Mr. Tobis, this was a crisis waiting to erupt. In fact, in a 1985 speech to the Conference on Setting Municipal Priorities, he warned that the foster-care system was being overwhelmed by the rising number of abused children needing placement. ''Recent events show again that the city's priorities are all wrong,'' Mr. Tobis said. ''We spend half a billion dollars on child welfare services but most of it is used to remove and confine children after they have been damaged by poverty and neglect. We have no early warning system to identify children's problems before they overwhelm families and the city's budgets.'' The courts now seem to agree. In a recent ruling, Civil Court Judge Edward H. Lehner in Manhattan ordered the city to come up with a ''service plan'' for intervention in families that face removal of children for placement in foster homes. The city has now taken heed of some of the criticism of the Special Services agency. In an otherwise ''lean'' budget dictated by Federal cutbacks and decreased revenues, Mayor Koch this spring singled out the crisis in Special Services for Children, and requested funds to hire 323 new caseworkers and support staff. Surely that is good news for the overburdened and unappreciated caseworkers. Yet even if the city retains the new personnel it intends to hire, we are still speaking about emergency treatment, not cures. The gridlock in the city's principal agency serving abused children is merely a symptom of a more fundamental and complex social disease. To understand what is happening in the city we must return to poverty and its related disorders - family disintegration and teen-age pregnancy. The likelihood of a child's growing up poor is four times as great if he is born into a household headed by a woman rather than a traditional two-parent home. And it is even more likely if the mother is a teen-ager. New York City has been massively afflicted by this ''feminization of poverty.'' Though the city's population declined 11 percent between 1970 and 1980, the number of people living in female-headed families rose by almost 30 percent. The city's welfare rolls now consist mainly of minority-group women and children. Demographic projections suggest that this most vulnerable group will continue to grow as a percentage of the population at least through the next decade. The most potentially destructive of these trends is the epidemic of teen-age pregnancy. Although the total number of teen pregnancies in the city has decreased in the last decade (as a result of a decline in the teen-age population) pregnancies among 15- to 19-year-old females went up from 12.3 percent to 13.1 percent between 1975 and 1984. The city's Adolescent Pregnancy Interagency Council has projected that if the present rates remain constant, 1 out of 4 girls 14 years old today will be pregnant at least once before her 18th birthday; 1 out of 8 will have had at least 1 abortion before reaching 18; and nearly 1 out of 11 will be a mother before she is 18. The 13,000 babies born to teen-agers in 1984 represent a staggering social and economic cost. Seventy percent of those new babies and their mothers can be expected to end up on public assistance within 18 months, according to the Interagency Council. Pregnant teen-agers are far less likely than other expectant mothers to receive prenatal care, thus increasing their risk of bearing low-birth-weight babies requiring extensive medical care at public expense. Teen-age pregnancy is the single most important factor causing girls to drop out of school, and contributes substantially to the city's huge high-school dropout rates: 40 percent overall, 70 percent among minority groups. Earlier this year, the Washington-based Center for Population Options released a study estimating that the cost of teen-age pregnancy (taking into account only direct Federal and state expenditures for Aid to Families With Dependent Children, Medicaid and food stamps) was $16.5 billion in 1985. What we are experiencing throughout the country, but most particularly in major urban areas such as New York, is the result of an unprecedented reversal of fortunes among our age groups. Historically, poverty had always struck hardest at the elderly, because they were most likely to be infirm, without work or without income. That held true until the mid-1970's. Then a disproportionate number of children began to be poor, a phenomenon exclusive to the United States among the industrialized nations. In the last two decades, the poverty-rate curves for children and the elderly crossed each other. For children, the rate rose steadily, from 12 percent in 1965 to close to 25 percent in 1985. For the elderly, poverty declined just as steadily, from a high of 35.2 percent in 1959 to 12 percent in 1985. The Federal Government last year defined the poverty line as $10,990 for a family of four. The White House task force on families concluded in 1984 that most of the poverty among children would disappear with economic growth were it not ''that the rates of divorce and formation of single-parent households remain high.'' Almost everyone agrees that the American family is in trouble, but there is wide disagreement as to the causes. Why is it that of all the industrialized democracies, the United States has the highest rates of divorce and teen-age pregnancy, along with resulting child abuse, teen-age suicide, drug addiction and alcoholism? Neoconservative writers on poverty, who have the ear of the Reagan Administration, have argued forcefully that the federally sponsored social programs and the ''explosion'' of welfare payments of the 1960's and 70's created a ''culture of dependency'' in the urban black ghettos. Starting with the War on Poverty, Washington began sending the wrong message to the poor, these commentators argue - that they weren't responsible for anything, that their condition was the product of racism and other defects in society, and that it was all right for young men to stay out of the labor force and for teen-agers to have children, because the government would take care of them. New York City's government has been depicted by such critics as particularly profligate in its social spending. They believe that the city consequently gets (and deserves) its exceptionally high rates of social pathology, such as teen-age pregnancy and family disintegration. Yet the empirical evidence doesn't always fit the theory. New York City certainly has a very serious problem of births to teen-age girls, for example, but in 1980 it was only 26th among the 30 largest American cities. The Washington-based Children's Defense Fund, a private advocacy group, published a survey recently comparing states' rates of teen-age births with 1983 payment levels of Aid for Dependent Children. The results are startling; practically every state whose payments were more than 50 percent of the Federal poverty level also had teen-age birth rates below the national average. On the other hand, almost every state with low payments had teen-age birth rates higher than the national average. Thus a substantial correlation was found to exist between lower welfare payment levels and higher indexes of social pathology. This is exactly the opposite of the outcome predicted by neoconservative theory. The Reagan Administration is not likely to be convinced by any evidence that higher payments might be socially beneficial, but neither is it about to end all welfare benefits to working-age adults, as some conservative writers urge. Instead, we can expect more of the same - payment levels that continue to lag behind inflation, and further cuts in Federal programs that provide essential social services to the poor. At the present time, for example, the entire Federal budget for preventive services for children (in the form of grants to the states and demonstration projects) is $207 million. That is about $130 million less than the Federal Government's public relations budget and about half the amount the city of New York allots to Special Services for Children. Liberals and conservatives will no doubt continue debating the causes of family disintegration and poverty. But while the debate rages, millions of Amerian children become poorer. In New York City alone, over half a million remain on the welfare rolls. The tale of two cities is no mere metaphor. It describes a process of decay that is already unraveling our social fabric and damaging our most precious democratic institutions, particularly our public schools. One-third of the pupils now in New York City public schools are on public assistance. At the same time, the middle class continues to desert the schools. Clearly, New York must do better if it is to survive as a community into the 2lst century. The middle class can remove its children from the public schools, but it cannot escape the consequences of child poverty on this scale. Ultimately, the children of the middle class and the children of the underclass will be sharing the same streets. I believe that the situation is not altogether hopeless. Despite Federal cutbacks, the city's $21.5 billion budget, when added to the immense resources of our private sector, could support a massive rescue effort. What is needed is not necessarily more public spending, but inspired leadership. Imagine if the Mayor, in announcing a massive rescue operation as I suggested earlier, appointed a czar to lead the city's effort - a person of national stature, a leader and advocate for children and someone with proven administrative skills. Imagine that this czar would have the Mayor's full backing to coordinate and oversee the performance of all city agencies that serve children. Suppose the czar began a concerted effort to enlist the private sector, the universities and the foundations, to work together with the city to develop innovative programs for children in distress. We might also imagine some common-sense proposals that the czar would immediately put into action. For example, the head of the city's Human Resources Administration could begin a television crusade, appealing to the public to open its hearts and homes to the increasing numbers of foster-care children. The agency would create an early-warning system to identify families at risk and provide them with necessary social services before a crisis arose and the children had to be removed. The city, as noted, has already started an effort to improve the situation of the Special Services for Children agency, but much remains to be done to reduce paperwork to give workers more time for personal contact with the children and families they are supposed to serve and to improve morale, which is at an all-time low. Staff attrition at the agency is more than 50 percent a year, up to 70 percent in some of the more swamped offices. Caseworkers resign so fast that administrators have a hard time filling the agency's allocated positions. Under our imagined czar, paperwork for caseworkers doing protective services for children would be drastically reduced, so that the workers could devote more attention to the children. Other actions could be undertaken as well. The city now houses 3,400 families with children in decrepit privately owned hotels, at rates of up to $3,000 a month. To end this scandal, the city could immediately lease these hotels and contract with private, nonprofit agencies to provide better services and management. As for schools, the Board of Education, in conjunction with community school boards, could be pressed to implement immediately its family life/ sex-education curriculum for all schoolchildren and to expand the teen-pregnancy-prevention net-works in coordination with outside social-service agencies. Alternative high schools, small and caring institutions, are among the most effective means for saving at-risk students from dropping out. The city's 80 private and public colleges could be asked to volunteer to be host to at least one alternative school on their campuses and provide other educational resources to enrich the high school programs. Summer programs in the city's schools could be increased. Major corporations would be asked to provide instruction and training in computers and other technical subjects. The Board of Education and the Human Resources Administration, the two mammoth agencies that together have contact with almost all the city's poor children, and whose combined budgets surpass $10 billion, would be mandated to coordinate their efforts on behalf of at-risk children. The list could go on. There is no shortage of ideas that deserve to be tried and excellent programs just waiting to be set in motion. None of this is utopian. I have seen the programs work. At Middle College High School, on the campus of La Guardia Community College in Queens, I talked to youngsters who had already dropped out of the system and were saved because of the special, intimate nature of that school and because of its dedicated teachers and principal. I heard Robert Scott, a student at High School Redirection in Brooklyn, say that at the age of 18 he had won a Golden Gloves championship but couldn't read or write -until that alternative school changed his life. And I saw him put his arm around two of his teachers and say, ''Thank God for these two.'' The city could double the number of alternative high schools within two years (there are now 14). Given the political will, all the proposals on the above list can be accomplished - and more. Alone, the city can't eliminate poverty among children; it can't put back together families that fall apart, or are never formed, because of that poverty. But if we move the problems of poor children to the top of our agenda, we can find the means to intervene and save many from utterly shattered lives. In saving them, we would be saving ourselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE REGION; HAVE BALANCED TICKETS GONE THE WAY OF PRESSING THE FLESH?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/weekinreview/the-region-have-balanced-tickets-gone-the-way-of-pressing-the-flesh.html,"QUICK! What's the religion of Stan Lundine, the upstate Congressman chosen by Governor Cuomo as his running mate? Do most voters know? Do they care? There is a body of thought in state politics that says they do. Every four years when members of the Republican and Democratic committees gather to pick their statewide tickets, as they did over the last two weeks, conventional wisdom has it that, to draw the most votes, those tickets should be ''balanced'' - by ethnicity, by geography, by religion. Those factors were said to have influenced the Governor's selection of Mr. Lundine for the ticket, which wound up including at least one Roman Catholic, one Jew and one Protestant. But on the Republican side, the party chose a ticket made up entirely of Catholics from downstate. It was generally agreed, even among Republicans, that they would fare better if they had an upstater on the ticket. They simply could not find one. But as for religion, the Republicans said not to worry, that politically it just did not matter anymore. They thereby set off a heated debate in political circles: In 1986, does anyone really care about a candidate's religion? ''I don't think that concern exists much anymore, except maybe with older people,'' said Maureen Connelly, the political media adviser, who helped run some of Mayor Koch's campaigns. Miss Connelly contended that voters did not even know the religion of most politicians. Miss Connelly and other professional political advisers cited the general decline of religion as a force in society, the influence of suburban homogeneity and the rise of television, which has made it possible to go beyond the labels of religion and ethnicity - even party - and to emphasize issues, personality and incumbency. Ethnicity certainly did not appear to predominate last week in New Jersey, where Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr. handily beat back a Democratic primary challenge from Councilman Donald M. Payne of Newark. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and other supporters of Mr. Payne, who is black, had argued that it was time for the 10th Congressional District, with a black majority, to elect the state's first black Congressman. But Mr. Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, won with almost 60 percent of the vote. It was not always thus. ''I'm 45 years old and I remember the Wagner days,'' George L. Clark, the former New York State Republican Chairman, said of former Mayor Robert F. Wagner. ''Back then you had to have balance. You had to run Abe Beame for Comptroller because you needed someone Jewish on the ticket. It was very, very important. No more.'' Said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion: ''The traditional categories of voting are not what they used to be. Jews don't draw the curtain on the voting booth and vote just for Jews, Catholics don't vote just for Catholics.'' That view is borne out by a New York Times/CBS News survey of voters as they left the polls in 1982. According to the survey, Mr. Cuomo, a Catholic, carried the Jewish vote by 2 to 1 over his opponent, Lewis E. Lehrman, a Jew who has since converted to Catholicism. Mr. Lehrman and Mr. Cuomo split the Catholic vote. Still, the sentiment for balanced tickets remains strong in political circles. In part, according to analysts, that is because the party committees tend to be dominated by older men brought up in the days when religion held a stronger influence. But it is also because there is an underlying belief that, while religion itself may not be a deciding factor, it is an element of an overall ethnic and cultural portrait of a candidate that can be significant. ''Religion may not matter by itself, but names like Cuomo or O'Brien matter, and religion is part of what's tied to those names,'' said the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, a sociologist and a research associate at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. ''It's subtle. It doesn't have to do with issues like abortion. It's the sense of 'they're not our kind of people' or 'they are our kind of people.' '' Father Greeley argued that the power of religion in politics was illustrated by negative votes cast for candidates, by the fact that there is an anti-Jewish vote or an anti-Italian vote. ''Don't underestimate what can be a very subtle, very subconscious sort of thing,'' he said. For the record, here's the breakdown of this year's New York tickets: Republicans, five Catholics; Democrats, three Protestants, one Jew, one Catholic. And Mr. Lundine? He is Episcopalian.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW TYCOONS RESHAPE POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/magazine/new-tycoons-reshape-politics.html,"RICHARD DENNIS, A BEEFY, RUMPLED 37-YEAR-OLD IN A short-sleeved shirt with no tie, sits in a noisy grill in Chicago, talking politics between glances at a Quotron machine. A commodities trader, he is a major Democratic contributor. ''I am trying to get a Democrat nominated for President who's not in the special-interest generation,'' Dennis says. For him, the old-fashioned trading of votes for favors ''means bargaining away the heart and soul of the political process.'' Barton M. Biggs, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, looks like central casting's idea of a Wall Street pro as he sits in his office on a rainy Manhattan afternoon. Like Dennis, he is a political activist, a supporter of the unannounced Presidential candidacy of Republican Representative Jack Kemp, of Buffalo, N.Y. ''There was a time,'' he says, ''when we all sort of were traditionalists. I believed the old guard's story. I was a eunuch before I was a supply-sider.'' Dennis and Biggs are at opposite ends of the political spectrum, but they share an impatience with the old political and economic order and a determination to do something about it. In many ways they are typical of a new breed of businessman who is having a substantial impact on both the Republican and Democratic parties. The standard work on how business in this country sees the world is ''The American Business Creed,'' published in 1956. It divides the business creed into two strands: the classical, devoted to pure capitalism and most popular in the ranks of small business, and the managerial, which stresses social responsibility as well as profits and finds its following in large corporations. The authors saw the tides of history running strongly against the classical strand. As prophecy, ''The American Business Creed'' held up for a full 20 years. Big corporations - primarily interested in a stable economy and harmonious relations with government and labor - gravitated toward the moderate wing of the Republican Party, and that was the political home of American business through most of the 60's and 70's. As recently as the Carter Administration, the widely accepted spokesmen for business in Washington were three chairmen of corporate boards -Irving S. Shapiro, of Du Pont (a Democrat); Reginald H. Jones, of General Electric, and John D. DeButts, of AT&T. Things are different in the 80's. In dozens of interviews with businessmen and politicians across the country - in Wall Street and Washington, in Silicon Valley and the Texas oil patch - a clear pattern emerges. The managerial strand is more muted now than at any time since the end of World War II, and the classical (or, to use the current buzzword, entrepreneurial) strand has come seemingly out of nowhere to dominate the politics of business. Entrepreneurs played a much more important role than big corporations in making Ronald Reagan President - as they probably will in determining the makeup of the 100th Congress this fall, and in picking Mr. Reagan's successor two years from now. ''We never had a place at the table before Reagan came in,'' says James McKevitt, Washington counsel of the National Federation of Independent Business and a Reagan fund-raiser in 1984. ''In '81 we started sharing strength with the corporate types. Today, when we go head to head, we beat 'em.'' GOOD STARTING DATE FOR the political rise of entrepreneurs and the eclipse of corporations would be 1974. That was the year when the impact of the oil embargo, which caused major rearrangements in the economy, hit home. And it was the year when Congress passed amendments to the Federal campaign finance laws, putting a $25,000 limit on the political contributions an individual could make to national candidates each calendar year. Because the law was a reaction against large gifts to Richard Nixon's 1972 Presidential campaign and restricted the kind of jumbo donations the Democrats had seldom received anyway, it was seen primarily as a blow to Republican big-business fund raising that would have little effect on the Democrats. As a result, the Republicans immediately began to change their techniques, and the Democrats didn't. ''We sat down and thought about whether we should have a major donor program,'' says Wyatt A. Stewart 3d, the longtime director of finance at the National Republican Congressional Committee, ''and we decided not to.'' Instead, the Republicans raised their money in two ways. They began an active direct-mail effort which, during the last two-year Congressional cycle, brought in $275 million - nearly 90 percent of the party's total funds - from more than three million small donors. And in the late 70's the Republicans began to create organizations for contributors of $10,000 and up, aimed at corralling hundreds of people who would have been considered small fry a few years earlier. The first of these organizations was a subsidiary of the Republican National Committee called the Eagles, which has an annual membership fee of $10,000. Its leading recruiter was Joe M. Rodgers, then a Nashville motel magnate, now Ambassador to France, and his most productive hunting ground was Texas and Oklahoma, where the oil boom was near its peak and independent producers were angry at President Carter for sticking with government price controls on oil. (Today, with oil busted, Eagles membership is down more than 20 percent.) The Republicans now have three such organizations for donors of $10,000 or more; together they put on a big annual event called the President's Dinner that raises between $5 million and $10 million. The goal is to wring an amount near the legal limit from a lot of people, who in return can attend a glittering gala and rub elbows with the leading Republican politicians. Vice President Bush, his sometime image as a moderate Republican notwithstanding, has been assiduously working the new Republican dinner circuit in anticipation of the 1988 Presidential campaign. Independent businessmen are the main organizers of and guests at these events. Putting them together requires people with full Rolodexes, high profiles and control over their own time; entrepreneurs fill that bill better than corporate chief executives, whose attention is devoted to maintaining quarterly earnings and stock prices. (The campaign finance law also led to a boom in business political action committees. There are now more than 2,000 of them. But almost all are involved purely in matters of narrow self-interest, not party direction or ideology.) THE COMMUNITY OF high-tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley did not become seriously involved in national politics until almost a decade ago. The crucial event was the lobbying campaign for the Steiger Amendment, a measure to cut the top tax rate on capital gains that was a late addition to President Carter's tax-reform law. Though fairly obscure, the amendment was big news in Silicon Valley, where most of the new wealth was tied up in closely held company stock that couldn't be sold without a painful tax bite. ''The '78 capital-gains change was really what got these people into politics,'' says Regis McKenna, a public relations man and the leading Democratic fund-raiser in Silicon Valley. ''Prior to that, they felt, 'Leave us alone and we'll be successful.' To lobby, or even to donate money in hope of getting favors, was not in their realm of thinking.'' In 1977 Silicon Valley's trade association, the American Electronics Association, formed a task force on ''capital formation,'' which lobbied hard for the Steiger Amendment. ''We had a folk-legend experience with changing tax policy,'' says Ed Zschau. The founder of System Industries, a manufacturer of disk-storage systems, Zschau was the head of the task force; he went on to become Silicon Valley's Republican congressman and is now a candidate for the United States Senate. Silicon Valley has remained very active in politics, especially on tax and trade issues. The American Electronics Association has a new and more aggressive spinoff, the Semiconductor Industry Association. Regis McKenna says he has had 30 members of Congress in his office in the last year. Though mostly Republican, Silicon Valley is politically catholic; it gave strong majorities to President Reagan, to Senator Gary Hart in the 1984 Democratic Presidential primary and to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a Democrat, in his unsuccessful Senate race in 1982. The Valley's leading political voices are engineers and scientists who come from modest and usually small-town backgrounds. Robert Noyce, a founder of Intel, is the son of an Iowa minister. Charles Sporck, the president of National Semiconductor, grew up over his family's grocery store in upstate New York. David Packard and William Hewlett, the founders of Hewlett-Packard and longtime active Republicans, were born in Pueblo, Colo., and Ann Arbor, Mich., respectively. The closest the computer world comes to a liberal organization is probably the Massachusetts Computer Software Council, founded last fall as an offshoot of the Massachusetts High Technology Council, a trade group dominated by large manufacturers. The Software Council's members are younger and run smaller companies, and some see themselves as children of the 60's. But one person close to the organization says, ''I'd imagine they'd be closet conservatives, if anything. They'd be secretly, if not overtly, cheering Reagan.'' Daniel S. Bricklin, a member of the council's board and, as the co-inventor of the Visicalc spreadsheet program, a founder of the personal-computer software industry, says he is ''more on the liberal side,'' but he is a registered Independent and votes for both Democrats and Republicans. That is about as far left a position as can be found among high-tech entrepreneurs. THE 1980 ELECTION WAS crucial to the rise of the entrepreneurs as the dominant political voice of American business. In the Republican primaries, big corporations bet mainly on John Connally and George Bush. Ronald Reagan's emergence as the nominee gave new importance to the Southwesterners who formed the core of his business support. He articulated conservatism in an exuberant way that sat better temperamentally with entrepreneurs than had the rhetoric of Presidents Nixon and Eisenhower. More specifically, Reagan strongly associated himself with the entrepreneurs' emerging great cause, tax cuts, and with its intellectual underpinning, supply-side economics. After the election, the Democratic Party began to court business more aggressively than it had in years. The main agent of change was Representative Tony Coelho, a California Congressman who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the most important link between the party and its new business constituents. Following in the Republicans' footsteps, the Democrats have developed a beefed-up direct-mail operation that now raises half of their funds, and three special committees for big donors. The largest of these, the Democratic Business Council, has 200 members who give about $2.5 million every two years. The new civilian players in Democratic politics tend to be entrepreneurs, too - Coelho says he barely knows anyone in big business - and if there is one industry in which they are clustered, it is real estate development. Because there are so many fewer businessmen in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party, Democratic businessmen probably exert more individual influence on their party. Elizabeth Drew, in her 1983 book, ''Politics and Money,'' makes the point that the Democrats' last-minute insertion of several provisions to make the 1981 tax cuts more generous was directly tied to their new recruiting campaign in business. Coelho solicits business contributions by appealing to his listeners' self-interest. ''I tell business groups,'' he says, '' 'Whether you like it or not, I'm going to be involved in your business.' The sales pitch, basically, is: Government is a part of their business, and they should treat it as they would any other part of their business. I don't advocate that they become rabid Democrats, but that they get to know Democrats. Because we're going to be in control of the House for the rest of the century.'' It seems likely that the 1988 Democratic Presidential nominee will be someone for whom entrepreneurs are a key constituency. Four possible candidates in particular have been energetically making the rounds of business groups all over the country and portraying themselves as advocates of entrepreneurial growth: Gary Hart of Colorado, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Just a step behind them, and playing in the same key, are Representative Tim Wirth of Colorado and Charles Robb, the former governor of Virginia. Any of them would be the most business-oriented Democratic nominee, rhetorically at least, since John W. Davis in 1924. (Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, the de facto leader of the liberal wing of the party, has some business support, but little of it outside New York.) NOTHER CENTRAL factor in the rise of the new entrepreneurs was the Wall Street boom that started in 1982. The 1970's had been relatively bad years for the market. Stock prices failed to keep pace with inflation, and fixed commissions were eliminated, making Wall Street brokerage houses increasingly competitive and driving the more genteel ones out of existence. Today the biggest money is being made in the market by upstarts who, by background and by temperament, are not drawn to moderate Republicanism. The center of the action on Wall Street, mergers and acquisitions, is a war waged against big corporations by entrepreneurs. T. Boone Pickens Jr., the chairman of Mesa Petroleum of Amarillo, Tex., and the best-known of the new Wall Street raiders, is a very active Reagan Republican who was co-chairman of this year's President's Dinner. He is scornful of the economic-political nexus of corporate chief executives and moderate Republicans. Two issues on which they fought were Pickens's attempt to take over Gulf Oil in 1984 and the Federal Reserve Board's decision early this year to raise the margin requirements on junk bonds, which are used to finance many takeovers. Mergers are a good example of the kind of economic issue that pits entrepreneurs against corporations and also translates into a political split between conservative populists and moderates. ''About 10 years ago,'' says Pickens, ''the Business Roundtable didn't want any controls on mergers and acquisitions because the big companies were doing the acquiring.'' The Roundtable is a predominantly corporate group whose political crusades are usually in behalf of the economic status quo. ''Now that large companies are vulnerable,'' Pickens adds, ''they don't want any mergers.'' In addition to the merger specialists, another Wall Street subculture that does not like corporate statesmen or moderate Republicanism is made up of money managers, whose world view tends to reflect their obsession with the price of stock. Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley executive who supports Jack Kemp, sees himself as just one of ''hundreds'' of supply-siders in the ranks of money managers. ''The Business Roundtable types tend to support Bush,'' Biggs says. ''They believe the conventional wisdom. Austerity. High interest rates. Tight money. The way to solve the deficit is to raise taxes. Henry Kaufman [ the bearish chief economist of Salomon Brothers ] is their god. President Reagan must at times be confused when the so-called great industrialists come down and say things to him that are at odds with what he believes instinctively: austerity, rather than growth.'' Even the most prominent new-generation Democrat on Wall Street, Robert E. Rubin, a high-ranking partner at Goldman Sachs, agrees that conservative Republicans are becoming stronger in the financial world. ''I have the impression that 20 years ago, a larger percentage of successful business people identified themselves as Democrats and a larger percentage were active,'' he says. ''I see it among people I know. There's been a shift. The Republican line didn't sell while people still remembered the Depression. But now you've had years of a good economy. I think the Democrats will have a hard time appealing to people here if they don't have a position on the economy that appeals to people who are doing well.'' THOUGH THE NEW GENERAtion of politically active business people can be found in both parties, there are some common themes that run through their conversations -themes that suggest where government policy might go in the next Presidential administration if a business-backed candidate of either party wins. These newcomers tend to be libertarian on social issues like drugs and abortion and to disdain the old organization-man ethos, under which business saw itself as a force for shaping personal behavior. They are populist in the sense of mistrusting the idea of rule by a business-government elite that probably wouldn't include them. They want the government to find a way to let American companies trade on an equal footing with foreign competitors, but they aren't very much interested in noneconomic, foreign-policy causes such as aid to the contras in Nicaragua. They are, in many cases, almost religious in their devotion to tax cuts, especially in the rates for business income and capital gains. There are still corporate executives who are active and important in politics. Lee Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, among the Democrats, and James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman of American Express, among the Republicans, are two with high visibility right now. But the important new players around the country are overwhelmingly self-employed. Some representative Republican names, besides those already mentioned, are: Richard DeVos, president of the Amway Corporation, a privately held direct-sales company headquartered in Ada, Mich.; Donald Bren, the owner of the Irvine Company, a giant real estate developer in Orange County, Calif.; Ivan Boesky, the most prominent of the Wall Street arbitrageurs, who was recently appointed special adviser on Jewish affairs to the chairman of the Republican National Committee; David H. Murdock, the California financier best known for his aggressive takeovers of Cannon Mills and Castle & Cooke; Sam Walton of Bentonville, Ark., the billionaire chairman of the Wal-Mart discount retail chain. Among the new Democratic names is that of Nathan Landow, a real estate developer in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, a major fund-raiser for Walter Mondale's Presidential campaign in 1984, and the founder of IMPAC '88, a business group designed to play a king-making role in the next Democratic Presidential nomination campaign. David Stein, the developer of a large resort in southern California and an adviser and supporter in the 1984 Gary Hart campaign, has founded a substantial Democratic political action committee and a research institute in Orange County. Richard Dennis, the Chicago commodities trader and political contributor, has established a think tank called the Roosevelt Center, with branches in Chicago and Washington, and plans to publish a new liberal biweekly magazine early next year. The corporate managers aren't forever doomed to second place, though. Their hole card is that no boom lasts forever; when times turn harder, even entrepreneurs find themselves worrying about survival more than growth, and their unbridled enthusiasm for the market becomes muted. As the young regions and young industries that have incubated the new-breed business leaders mature, these men may start to put more stress on the importance of economic stability, and to see government less as an adversary. In the oil patch today, the rallying cry of the independents is not price decontrol but import taxes - in effect, government price supports. In Silicon Valley, the burning issue is not tax cuts but keeping Japanese read-only memory chips out of the American market. The time we're in now may well be remembered as the high-water mark of a certain political mood in business, rather than as the dawn of a new age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STATE TICKETS EYE L.I. VOTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/nyregion/state-tickets-eye-li-voters.html,"REPUBLICAN and Democratic officials on Long Island strongly disagree on the effect that the Republican state ticket, which is heavily tilted to the suburbs, and the Democratic ticket, which has no suburban representation, will have on the Long Island vote. The Democrats, however, expect Governor Cuomo's outspoken opposition to the Shoreham nuclear power plant, a key issue on Long Island, to draw local voters to the ticket. Despite their differences, the party officials agreed that Nassau and Suffolk Counties, with 17 percent of the state's registered voters and up to 20 percent of the state's turnout, will play a critical role in the upcoming state elections. ''State elections are won and lost out our way,'' Assemblyman Patrick G. Halpin of Lindenhurst said last week at the Democratic State Committee nominating meeting in Albany, just a few days after the Republican State Committee designated its state ticket at a meeting in Syracuse. The five-member Republican state ticket has two Nassau residents - Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of Island Park, who is seeking re-election, and Nassau County Comptroller Peter T. King of Seaford, who is running for State Attorney General - along with Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, the candidate for Governor; Ulster County District Attorney E. Michael Kavanagh, the candidate for Lieutenant Governor, and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan of Westchester, who is seeking re-election. That makes four out of five suburbanites on the Republican ticket, and the fifth, Mr. Kavanagh, is more an exurbanite than an upstater. In contrast to the suburban tilt of the Republican ticket, the ticket chosen by the Democratic State Committee is composed of Governor Cuomo of Queens, who is seeking re-election; Representative Stanley N. Lundine of Jamestown, who is running for Lieutenant Governor; Herman Badillo of the Bronx, who is running for Comptroller; Attorney General Robert Abrams of Manhattan, who is seeking re-election, and John S. Dyson of Dutchess County, the Senate designee. Mr. Lundine may be challenged by two Manhattan real-estate devopers, Abraham Hirschfeld and Gilbert DiLucia, in the Democratic primary, and Mr. Dyson may be opposed by Mark Green of Manhattan, a lawyer and writer. Another prominent Nassau politician, District Attorney Denis E. Dillon, a Democrat who has been elected three times, generally with the support of all parties, will be the Right to Life candidate for Governor. Mr. Dillon said he agreed to run after Mr. O'Rourke rejected the nomination of the Right to Life Party, whose leaders, Ellen McCormack and Mary Jane Tobin, are Nassau residents. Long Island's political strenth is shown in recent electoral arithmetic. In the last few statewide elections Nassau has had the highest vote of any county in the state, while Suffolk ranks fifth, behind Nassau, Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. Beyond those figures, both counties are no longer considered the Republican strongholds they once were in state elections. In 1982, Lewis H. Lehrman, the Republican candidate for Governor, won Nassau by 19,000 votes and Suffolk by 23,000 votes - far less than the 100,000-vote margins in each county that were once common for Republicans. Politicians generally agree that Mr. Lehrman would have defeated Governor Cuomo if he had run on Long Island as well as Republicans used to. In the preceding election for Governor, in 1978, a Suffolk resident, Perry B. Duryea of Montauk, the Republican candidate, his home county over then-Governor Hugh L. Carey by about 53,000 votes - still not a landslide - and Nassau by only 15,000 votes. In 1974, with an incumbent Republican Governor, Malcolm Wilson, and Nassau County Executive Ralph G. Caso as the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Carey won both Nassau and Suffolk. At the same time, Long Island's share of the total state vote has been creeping up toward 20 percent in recent years. But Republicans and Democrats differed on the impact of the two major-party tickets on Long Island. Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau Republican chairman, echoed many Long Island Republicans when he said that the candidacies of Mr. D'Amato and Mr. King would spur the Republican voter turnout on the Island and help not only the Republican state ticket but also local Republican candidates for the Legislature and the House of Representatives. ''I think it will help - it will stimulate the local vote,'' said Mr. Mondello, who nevertheless acknowledged that ''Mario Cuomo is an extremely strong candidate even in the suburbs.'' Mr. Mondello said that the election for Governor could affect close contests for the legislative seats of State Senators Dean G. Skelos of Rockville Centre and Michael J. Tully Jr. of Roslyn Heights and Assemblyman Daniel Frisa of Westbury, all Nassau Republicans, and the contest for the seat of retiring Assemblywoman Mae W. Newburger, a Democrat of Great Neck. But Nassau Republican officials said privately that polls by the Nassau Republican organization show Mr. Cuomo to be a formidable candidate and even more popular than Mr. D'Amato, the native son. William M. Blake, the Suffolk Republican chairman, said his polls show both the Governor and Senator D'Amato to be as popular as President Reagan, who won Suffolk by 164,000 votes in 1984. Mr. Blake said that ''one of our frustrations'' has been that such huge Republican pluralities in Presidential elections have not been reflected in state elections. Long Island Democratic leaders, trying to make the best of the contrast between the two tickets in suburban representation, said that Republicans were in effect trying to hold their own in the suburbs by the composition of their ticket. ''They're not coming from strength,'' said Martin Mellman, the Nassau Democratic chairman. He said that the strong suburban cast of the Republican ticket was designed to compensate for a ''weak'' state ticket. ''The Republicans need some cover to protect their incumbents in the Legislature,'' Mr. Halpin said. ''They can't have Mario Cuomo running through the suburbs like gangbusters,'' he added. Democrats also look to the Shoreham issue, which has been politically potent, to help Governor Cuomo counter the strong suburban representation on the Republican ticket. He has joined Suffolk politicians of both parties in flatly opposing the plant's opening. He referred to Shoreham in his acceptance speech last Tuesday at the Democratic State Committee nominating meeting, saying, ''Shoreham must not open.'' Mr. O'Rourke started out the campaign for Governor supporting the opening of Shoreham if it were found to be safe. He has since retreated, voicing doubts that Long Island could be safely evacuated in the case of a nuclear accident at Shoreham, after Suffolk Republicans warned him that they might have to disassociate themselves from his position on the Shoreham issue. Mr. Dillon, as the Right to Life candidate, could also have an impact on the Republican and Democratic vote for Governor on Long Island. ''Too many people are afraid of the abortion issue,'' Mr. Dillon said in explaining why he took the unorthodox route of running on another party's line. ''If you really believe that these are human lives, you have to give more than lip service.'' Mr. Mellman, the Nassau Democratic chairman, criticized Mr. Dillon, contending that he was in effect abandoning his own party. The Dillon candidacy could be very important to the Right to Life Party, which is threatened with losing its official status if it drops below 50,000 votes for its candidate for Governor.

A strong run by Mr. Dillon, particularly in Nassau, where he has been elected three times, would be critical for the party's statewide vote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"REAGAN'S LEGACY HINGES, IN PART, ON NOVEMBER FIGHT FOR THE SENATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/09/us/reagan-s-legacy-hinges-in-part-on-november-fight-for-the-senate.html,"The struggle for control of the Senate involves not only the 34 seats at stake, political leaders and analysts say, but whether the Democrats can turn President Reagan into a truly lame duck, by thwarting him in such areas as judicial appointments and his increasingly aggressive and conservative foreign policy. Since they are certain to retain control of the House of Representatives, the Democrats would also be able to advance legislative initiatives in such fields as military spending, the environment, health care and trade that differ sharply from Mr. Reagan's priorities. Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, summed up the common view on Capitol Hill when he said that a Democratic victory would cause Mr. Reagan to have ''a very irritating and frustrating two years - that I can assure you.'' In all likelihood, the lawmaker added, the President ''would become Captain Veto, with his cloak flying down Pennsylvania Avenue.'' Theme for Fall Campaigns But political leaders disagree over whether the voting public wants to see a frustrated President. Both parties are planning to use control of the Senate as a theme in their fall campaigns. From the Democrats' viewpoint, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the minority leader, said that a change would ''pull the Senate back to the center, and away from the agenda of the New Right.'' Senator Simpson, however, said that some Republican candidates will argue: ''Do you want the Reagan Revolution to continue through 1988? Or do you want to let the last two years fall into the basement?'' In addition to the legislative issues at stake, political analysts in the capital say that the November elections will also have a major impact on the Presidential election of 1988. The party controlling the Senate, they say, will have an enormous psychological boost, and secure an important forum for propounding its ideas. ''If the Republicans maintain control of the Senate under this assault, and defeat the historic trend toward the opposition party in an off-year election, I'd say they begin the 1988 Presidential campaign with a very strong, positive outlook,'' said Joe Rothstein, a political consultant who works for Democrats. ''But if the Republicans lose the Senate, you will stop seeing stories about the realignment of the parties. There will be a feeling that the Democratic Party is on the way back.'' The stakes for individual aspirants for the Presidency are less clear, but most agree that a Republican victory would probably help Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader. Conversely, a Democratic triumph could boost the visibility of some younger Senators who are possible contenders for that party's nomination. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, for instance, would probably become chairman of the Judiciary Committee when that panel could be handling contentious judicial appointments. Sam Nunn of Georgia would assume the chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee, and Bill Bradley of New Jersey would have a larger role in the deliberations of the Finance Committee. Greater Ideological Zeal To many political leaders and analysts, the fight for the Senate has become increasingly important in light of the Administration's greater determination to pursue Mr. Reagan's ideological precepts in his last years in office. In foreign policy, for instance, these analysts point to the recent statement by Mr. Reagan that he will abrogate the strategic arms limitation treaty, unless the Soviet Union changes its behavior. They also cite his persistent attempts to aid anti-Communist insurgents in Nicaragua and elsewhere. In domestic policy, goes this argument, Mr. Reagan's ideological bent is probably most visible in judicial appointments, which have already sparked a backlash on Capitol Hill. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week rejected the nomination of Jefferson B. Sessions 3d of Alabama to a Federal District Court post. ''I think the Administration over-interpreted the 1984 elections,'' said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. ''They went into an ideological mode and are still in it.'' The Republicans now hold a 53-to-47 margin in Senate seats, so the Democrats must make a net gain of four. If the results end in a tie, the Republicans would organize the chamber because Vice President Bush would cast the deciding vote. This would be a dismaying prospect for Mr. Bush, who would be obliged to remain in Washington and cast votes on controversial issues rather than campaign throughout the country for the Presidency. Result of 1980 Landslide Of the 34 seats up in November, 22 are now held by Republicans, and ever since the Reagan-led landslide of 1980, Democrats have been pointing to 1986 as their best chance for regaining control of the Senate. But many of the Republican newcomers spent a lot of energy shoring up their political bases. And the economic recovery continues to produce stable inflation, declining interest rates, and a booming stock market. In recent weeks, however, the political news has raised Democrats' hopes a bit. In Oregon, where the sputtering timber industry is a major problem, Senator Bob Packwood received a scare in the Republican primary. Democrats hope this foreshadows a growing impatience with Republican incumbents in states that rely on agriculture, oil and gas, textiles, steel, and other industries that have not benefited from the recovery. In Pennsylvania, the Democrats nominated Representative Bob Edgar, a highly regarded candidate, to oppose Senator Arlen Specter. In Alabama, Representative Richard C. Shelby won the Democratic nomination without a runoff and will face Senator Jeremiah Denton, one of the most vulnerable Republicans, in the fall. The only gloomy news for Democrats came from California, where Representative Ed Zschau survived a huge primary field to win the Republican nomination. The incumbent, Alan Cranston, would have preferred a more conservative opponent. Outcome Very Much in Doubt Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, predicts flatly that his party will have 53 seats in the next Senate. Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania, his opposite number for the Republicans, says that ''absent a major economic downturn, there is virtually no chance that the Democrats can regain control.'' Most independent analysts say that while the odds still favor the Republicans, the outcome is very much in doubt. Even if the Democrats hold only a one-vote margin, they would take over the majority leader's office and the chairmanship of all Senate committees, chairmanships that control the flow of Senate business. That means, for instance, that such issues as abortion or school prayer, which have long been pushed by Reagan Administration and Republican leaders, would have a much harder time reaching the Senate floor. In Senator Cranston's view, a key battleground will be foreign policy. Administration initiatives like aid to the Nicaraguan rebels would be more easily blocked by the Democrats. Financing for major weapons projects, like the space-based shield against nuclear attack, could be significantly reduced by a Democratic Senate. Domestically, said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican from Utah, it would be ''virtually impossible'' for President Reagan to leave a ''lasting legacy'' in the form of conservative Federal judges. Passing Alternative Program Senator Heinz argues that a Democratic Senate would hinder White House initiatives in the economic area, but would not have the power to pass an alternative program. ''I think it would result in gridlock between Congress and the President,'' he said. ''The President would lose his ability to get his programs that are driving the economy forward.'' Representative Edgar, the Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania, argues that a Congress dominated by his party would pass a whole string of bills, from a stronger program to clean up toxic waste to a more aggresive policy on international trade. If the President vetoed such measures, Mr. Edgar added, the result would be to ''flush out some of the President's real policies'' and create some political issues for 1988. But Senator Simpson warns that Democrats who haul out their old ''laundry list'' of social programs would give the Republicans a good opportunity to score political points of their own, and make ''Captain Veto'' a hero as he ends his political career.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OBSCENTIY DEBATE FOCUSES ATTENTION ON MAINE, WHERE VOTERS WEIGH ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/us/obscentiy-debate-focuses-attention-on-maine-where-voters-weigh-issue.html,"A statewide referendum on obscenity Tuesday is drawing the attention of civil libertarians around the country. They describe the vote as an unusual test of public attitudes at a time of increasing debate about a link between obscene materials and rape and child abuse. According to experts, the Maine vote will be the first statewide referendum ever held on obscenity. The proposed statute borrows language from a 1973 Supreme Court decision on the method to be used to define obscenity. If the measure passes, it would mandate prison terms for those who sell, promote or ''give for value'' materials that are found to be obscene. But specifically what its effects would be has become the major issue of the debate here. Besides the referendum, voters in Maine will also nominate candidates in a race to succeed to Gov. Joseph E. Brennan, a Democrat. There are also primary elections in Virginia, South Carolina and North Dakota, while voters in the New York City Borough of Queens will choose a replacement for the late Representative Joseph P. Addabbo. Federal Report's Repercussions The Maine referendum is being held as a Federal commission appointed by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d is preparing to release the final form of a report that says pornography plays a role in ''sexual violence, sexual coercion or unwanted sexual agression.'' While some researchers have complained that their findings have been misused as the basis for the report, thousands of convenience stores have reacted to the study by removing sexually oriented materials from their shelves. In April the Southland Corporation, parent company of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, announced that it would stop selling Penthouse, Forum and Playboy magazines. The Lawson Milk Company, which has 700 convenience stores in Ohio, has temporarily removed Playboy and Penthouse from its shelves and is asking customers to vote on whether it should stock those periodicals. Last year Gray Drug Inc. of Cleveland removed adult magazines from its 443 stores and Revco D.S. of Twinsburg, Ohio, did the same at its 2,101 stores. How Playboy Is Selling A spokesman for Playboy, David D. Salyers, said the magazine's newsstand sales had held steady at 1.6 million, although he said it was not possible to know if sales might have increased if the stores had not acted. Total circulation is 4.1 million a month, he said. Playboy magazine and the American Booksellers Association, which represents most of the nation's largest book chains, filed suit last month against Mr. Meese and the pornography commission. They charged that the panel was illegally attempting to suppress sexually explicit books and magazines, accusing it of harassing major retailers by creating a ''blacklist'' of stores that sell Playboy and other publications. The link between pornography and violence is debated. Many social scientists say there is no concrete relationship, although many agree that pornography can desensitize some people who view it. Lines Drawn in Maine In Maine the obscenity referendum has pitted Yankee propriety against Yankee independence. Opponents of the measure, including librarians, feminists and civil libertarians, say it would lead to purges in libraries, the banning of sex education texts and perhaps other limitations on what citizens can read and see. Supporters, who brought the issue to the ballot by gathering 50,000 signatures, say it is aimed only at hard-core material. They say that Playboy and Penthouse would have never been judged obscene under the definition they propose. ''Rape and child abuse and pornography are a statewide problem,'' said George A. Smith, campaign manager for the proposal. The Power of Prayer ''It's not to say what people can and cannot do; it's to protect the innocent,'' said Cliffa Shackelford, who has been working for months for the proposal, which she described as a way of ''fighting Satan.'' Mrs. Shackelford, whose husband, Billy, is the pastor of the Kennebec Valley Baptist Church in Waterville, said the church had assigned scores of volunteers to pray for 15-minute intervals Tuesday, because ''prayer affects the outcome of everything in life.'' Proponents have sponsored television advertisements in which an expert on child abuse blames pornography for cases of abuse, and another in which a priest's hand is seen lighting candles, while the text of an endorsement of the referendum by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Maine appears on the screen. In a television spot by the opponents, a pile of books, including the Alice Walker novel ''The Color Purple,'' Steinbeck's ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and the American Heritage Dictionary, is seen burning, viewed over the shoulder of a leather-jacketed policeman. The setting seems improbable. Mr. Smith acknowledged that there are so few stores around the state selling hard-core pornography that ''you could virtually name them.'' But Edith Smith, his sister and the treasurer of the campaign, said, ''We're not Times Square, we're not the Combat Zone, but we have a problem in the state of Maine.'' A leaflet distributed by Concerned Citizens for Decency says, ''Today in Maine, a child is sexually assaulted every 9 hours and 33 minutes.'' Conservative, evangelical Christians are powerful in Maine. The referendum's proponents are credited with the resounding defeat of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution here two years ago, after a campaign in which they raised questions about whether it would mean free abortion and sanction homosexual marriage. The obscenity measure far overshadows the gubernatorial primary, in which five Democrats, all opposed to it, and two Republicans, both in favor, are seeking their parties' nominations. Portland Has Taken Action ''It's really a question of whether you view the disease as worse than the cure,'' said David A. Lourie, the Portland city attorney who is responsible for the enforcement of a local ordinance on which the proposed state law is based. ''I have no doubt that the cure will occasionally be abused,'' said Mr. Lourie. But he added, ''when you look at the stuff, it really is so bad that it defies description.'' Portland's ordinance, passed in November 1982 by a margin of 384 votes out of 26,380 ballots cast, provides fines of $50 to $500. It has not closed any of the city's handful of adult bookstores, according to Mr. Lourie, who said ''It's become a a cost of doing business for them, basically.'' Portland is the only city in the state with such a rule. The state measure, if passed, would specify penalties of up to five years in jail. Like the Portland ordinance, it is based on a United States Supreme Court definition from a 1973 case, Miller v. California, that imposes a three-part test, including that the material, ''taken as a whole, lacks serious literary artistic, political, or scientific value.'' Under another test, the material would be deemed obscene if ''the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that taken as a whole'' the magazine, book, film or performance ''appeals to the prurient interest in sex.'' Effect on Libraries Debated The proposed law covers depiction of ''normal or abnormal'' sex and does not exempt libraries. Opponents say magazine subscribers could be prosecuted under a clause of the measure that says, ''A person who possesses six or more obscene articles or six or more obscene devices, whether such articles or devices are similar or identical, is presumed to possess them with intent to promote them.'' Determining exactly what would be covered by the law is one of the major focuses of debate. ''Does this mean that you could read a book in Bangor you can't read in Brewer?'' asked Betsy Sweet, executive director of the Maine Commission for Women, which opposes the referendum. But Mr. Smith, pointing to the differing vigor with which a law against driving while intoxicated is enforced around Maine, argued: ''That's our criminal justice system. That's not a reason not to pass this.'' The outcome is being closely watched elsewhere. ''For the citizens of this state to vote and to reject this referendum would be an extraordinary statement of support for the First Amendment,'' said Barry W. Lynn, legislative counsel in Washington for the American Civil Liberties Union. ''A small group of very zealous people are promoting the censorship causes,'' he said, adding that outside the privacy of the voting booth, ''a lot of people are embarrassed to say they are wrong.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BRIEFING; Destinations, Denver",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/us/briefing-destinations-denver.html,"Two Washington-based organizations with opposite philosophies, National Right to Life and the National Organization for Women, are planning to head west for Denver later this week, partly to set policy but also to set their political pots bubbling. National Right to Life hopes to draw 1,500 participants Thursday through Saturday for a march, rally and speeches, including talks by three aspiring Republican Presidential contenders: Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and the Rev. Pat Robertson. Among the missing Republican aspirants will be Vice President Bush, who is scheduled to be in Canada for talks on acid rain, and former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, who will be politicking in Florida. Any chance of a Democratic hopeful who would be acceptable to the group as a supporter of the constitutional amendment outlawing abortion disappeared when Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri dropped his long-standing backing. ''He has backed off his support of a constitutional amendment,'' said Dan Donehey, a spokesman for National Right to Life. A spokesman for Mr. Gephardt, Andy King, said Mr. Gephardt had changed his position on the question but remained strongly opposed to abortion. ''He came to the conclusion several years ago that the constitutional approach to the abortion problem was not practical,'' the aide said. Meantime, the National Organization for Women, which opposes National Right to Life on most issues, most especially abortion, hopes to have 1,000 participants in Denver Friday through Sunday, but the two groups are not expected to cross paths. No Presidential hopefuls have been invited to the NOW meeting because, a spokesman said, the organization plans to assess the possibility of starting an independent political movement. One possibility, the spokesman said, would be a third party, perhaps one headed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1984.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Business and the Law; Contraceptive Suits a Concern,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/business/business-and-the-law-contraceptive-suits-a-concern.html,"FOR many years, a woman's right to choose has been an issue in the legal morass surrounding abortion. Now the question of choice in contraceptives is becoming a legal issue as well - but for very different reasons, having to do with economics rather than religion or ethics. Because of litigation and insurance costs, American women have already lost their access to the most popular intrauterine devices on the market. In February, G.D. Searle, whose IUD's were used by more than two million women, announced it would stop selling the devices. Searle said the IUD's had spawned nearly 800 lawsuits, claiming that the devices caused pelvic infections, sterility and birth defects. Recently, litigation has also become a threat to the continued viability of the most popular spermicide on the market: Johnson & Johnson's Ortho-Gynol, used by more than 2.5 million American women. Although Ortho-Gynol has been on the market for about 40 years, the spermicide only began to pose legal problems in 1982, when a Nashville woman filed suit saying that her daughter's birth defects, including a missing arm, a misshaped hand, and a blind eye, had been caused by the mother's use of Ortho-Gynol. She won a $5.1 million award in Federal district court, and last month the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the decision, reducing the damages to $4.7 million. But spermicides produce profits of only about $3 million a year for Johnson & Johnson - and some analysts wonder how long the company will keep the product on the market if it has to pay more in damages than it earns in profits. Johnson & Johnson, which faces several other birth-defect suits arising out of Ortho-Gynol, has asked for a rehearing of the case by the full circuit court. Although the company denies reports that it plans to stop selling spermicides, a spokesman concedes that the Ortho-Gynol judgment is a serious worry. And it is not only the company's worry. Doctors, lawyers and women's rights advocates say that, ultimately, what is at stake in these individual damage suits is every woman's access to the birth control method of her choice. ''The contraceptive choices do seem to be dwindling, and I don't have a solution to offer,'' said Eve Paul, legal counsel to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ''We believe that the Searle IUD's are safe, and we are still using our existing supplies, but they are rapidly being used up. From our review of the scientific studies, we also believe that Ortho-Gynol is a safe product. It would be a tragedy for women if Ortho-Gynol were to be taken away.'' Some plaintiffs' lawyers have suggested that Johnson & Johnson should put a warning on its spermicide, but the company says that is not a solution. ''The clear scientific consensus is that Ortho-Gynol does not cause birth defects,'' James Murray, a company spokesman, said. ''Given that we know of no link to birth defects, we could not in good conscience write a warning. It would have to be so vague as to be useless, and it would create unnecessary anxiety, and maybe unnecessary abortions.'' Warnings can be a two-edged sword. On one hand, a company that knows of a hazard has a duty to warn - and a proper warning can provide some legal protection against lawsuits. But warnings can hurt legally, too: ''The presence of a warning could generate more lawsuits, if plaintiffs' lawyers took it as evidence that we knew about a problem and sold the product anyway,'' Mr. Murray said. Indeed, warnings have not provided much protection for the manufacturers of oral contraceptives, who in the early 1970's began inserting into their packages elaborate warnings listing many possible health hazards. ''Despite the warnings, there are still lots of lawsuits being filed against the oral contraceptive manufacturers,'' said Sheila Birnbaum, a New York product liability lawyer. ''The problem with warnings is that you never know in advance whether they are going to protect you or not. The perfect example is an oral contraceptive case where a jury found that a woman who had a stroke should get damages even though the insert warned that there was a risk of blood clots, and death. The jury said that because the warning didn't say the word 'stroke' and this woman considered the complications of her stroke even worse than death, the warning was inadequate.'' In addition, she said, some courts let claimants use the fact that a company added a warning as evidence that it previously did not give adequate warning. The legal standard on when a company must provide warnings varies from state to state, Miss Birnbaum said, but courts generally rule that a manufacturer should warn of possible hazards ''when a reasonable person would want to know about the risk.'' ''You can't wait until there's a proven cause and effect relationship,'' she said. ''If there's some evidence of a risk, you can go ahead with a warning that says something like, 'It has been reported that this product can cause birth defects, but other experts believe it is safe.' '' What would be needed to insure that women will retain a range of contraceptive choices, Miss Birnbaum added, would be some sort of agency that could rule on the adequacy of warnings, and guarantee that adherence to that warning would protect the company against liability. ''The Food and Drug Administration rules on when warnings are required, but the courts say that doesn't mean you're off the hook, because it's just minimal regulation,'' she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TAX DEBATE PACE SLOW IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/11/business/tax-debate-pace-slow-in-senate.html,"No senators were willing to be the first to step forward to offer amendments to the tax-revision bill today. The Senate continued with slow-paced discussion without votes. ''My hunch,'' said Senator Bob Packwood, the bill's floor manager, ''is that no one wants to go first if their amendment is to be beaten, 55 to 45 or 60 to 40.'' Tonight Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican, proposed a ''sense of the Senate'' amendment. It states that Senate conferees, when they meet with House conferees to resolve differences in the two chambers' tax bills, should agree to fuller deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts than would be allowed by the Senate bill. Conferees are not bound by such an amendment. Comparison of the 2 Bills The House bill, which was passed last December, would maintain deductions for all I.R.A.'s; the Senate bill, as it stands now, would allow such deductions only to taxpayers not covered by company pension plans. Senator Packwood and the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, supported the Roth plan, apparently to try to head off amendments meant to actually put the full I.R.A. deductions in the Senate bill. Senator Packwood said he hoped the Roth amendment would be voted on Wednesday and would ''break the logjam'' so that ''we can move with some speed through the legislation.'' President Reagan urged senators at the White House this morning to approve the bill this week, and Senator Dole chided his colleagues for their lack of activity in the Senate's second week on cable television. ''It's discouraging to watch C-Span and all you see is a quorum call,'' Senator Dole said. ''We told the people this would be exciting. Tune us in. I think we have to redeem ourselves if we're going to be TV stars.'' Packwood Shows Confidence Senator Packwood, an Oregon Republican, said he was confident he had enough votes to defeat amendments suggested so far, including those that would maintain all I.R.A. deductions and place curbs on organizations involved with abortions. At the White House meeting, President Reagan said he opposed an amendment advocated by three Republican senators - Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, William L. Armstrong of Colorado and Jesse Helms of North Carolina - that would deny tax-exempt status for hospitals where abortions are performed and charities that finance abortions. The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said the President felt that the anti-abortion proposal should be considered on its own and not as part of the tax bill. ''The President favors anti-abortion legislation,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''He also favors a tax bill that doesn't have any amendments on it.'' One issue that is expected to be debated in the days ahead is the effect of the tax bill on taxpayers in various income categories. The staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation released data today showing that about one-third of all middle-income taxpayers would have their taxes increased by the Senate bill. The staff provided the data reluctantly at the request of Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat. It said too little information was available to be confident of its reliability. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum assailed the bill's ''transition rules,'' giving special exceptions from general tax rules to particular companies, individuals and communities. Mr. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, said he would offer amendments to strike many of these provisions. ''Some of them must be just,'' he said. ''But Joe Average Taxpayer does not have the opportunity to have a special exemption carved out for himself or for his wife.'' In an interview, Senator Packwood said he had used several criteria in deciding which transition rules to include in the bill approved by the Finance Committee, which he heads. For one thing, he said, he did not allow exceptions from the principle -intended to curb tax shelters - that would keep investment losses from being used to offset other income. Later, in a Senate floor response to Mr. Metzenbaum, Mr. Packwood said the senators who sponsored transition rules would be called on to defend them against his amendments. Republican and Democratic senators hold regular party luncheon meetings on Tuesdays, and much of the discussion today, according to senators, dealt with I.R.A.'s. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said most of the Democrats seemed to agree that full deductions should be preserved but that they disagreed on how to raise the more than $20 billion of revenue over five years that such a proposal would cost. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, proposed that the money be raised by increasing the minimum tax applied to corporations and individuals to 22.6 percent from the 20 percent rate in the Senate bill. Today President Reagan addressed about 100 supporters of tax revision, many of them business executives, in the Old Executive Office Building. He told them, ''Of course this bill will not solve all the problems, but it will be progress with a capital P.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOW SEEKS TO CURB ANTI-ABORTIONISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/11/us/now-seeks-to-curb-anti-abortionists.html,"The National Organization for Women announced today that it had filed a lawsuit seeking to put people who try to drive abortion clinics out of business under the same legal restraints that have curtailed the activities of the Ku Klux Klan. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del., was prepared by the Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala., which brought a similar type of suit against the Klan in 1982. In that case, the center was granted an injunction under the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibiting the Klan from harassing members of the Vietnamese Fishermen's Association of Galveston Bay, Tex. The Wilmington suit seeks no monetary damages, but it asks for a nationwide injunction under the antitrust laws against anti-abortion leaders, contending that they have been traveling throughout the country organizing efforts to harass and intimidate people who operate legal abortion clinics and force them out of business. ''This is clearly a nationwide criminal conspiracy, which the Federal Government has refused to treat as such,'' Eleanor Smeal, president of NOW, said at a news conference here announcing the suit. Pro-Life Leader Named One of the principal defendants named in the suit is Joseph M. Scheidler, who heads the Pro-Life Action League, based in Chicago, and is the author of a manual entitled ''Closed: 99 Ways to Stop Abortion.'' J. Richard Cohen, chief attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the suit was filed in Delaware because Mr. Scheidler had ''targeted it to become the first state in the Union to be free of abortion facilities.'' Mr. Scheidler issued a statement in Chicago terming the action a ''harrassment lawsuit,'' and asserting that it would only cause him to redouble his efforts against abortion clinics. In a telephone interview before the suit was filed, Mr. Scheidler agreed that the aim of his organization was to close the clinics, adding, ''I have closed at least 40 clinics.'' But he said he operated within the law, creating through demonstrations and other actions a community climate that made it difficult for the clinics to operate. Arrested in Delaware Protest Mr. Scheidler, who was arrested last April 12 on charges of trespassing in a demonstration against the Delaware Woman's Health Center in Wilmington, also said he had picked Delaware as the first state to be free of abortion clinics because ''it is a small state with only about eight abortion facilities,'' and closing them would be a reasonable goal for his group to achieve. The suit charges that Mr. Scheidler, other members of his organization and a related group, the Pro-Life Direct Action League, headed by John Patrick Ryan of St. Louis, go from community to community organizing campaigns that, that through a series of harrssing actions, create a community climate that makes it impossible for the clinics to continue in operation. Morris S. Dees, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the center's interest in the lawsuit was that ''continued illegal harrassment of women's clinics and their medical personnel will result in fewer low-cost clinics available to deal with unplanned pregnancies and to assist in family planning in small towns.'' Mrs. Smeal said that although the police had been deligent in enforcing the law, they had not been able to stop the defendants from engaging in what she said were illegal acts. U.S. Declines to Intervene She said the defendants were usually charged with misdemeanors and, if convicted, paid the fine and went on to the next community, adding, ''Some of them have been arrested hundreds of times, but that has not stopped them.'' Mrs. Smeal said her organization turned to civil legal action because the Justice Department had declined to intervene on the ground that violence against abortion clinics was under the jursidiction of the local authorities, not the Federal Government. The National Abortion Federation, an organization allied with NOW that advocates allowing women the freedom to choose an abortion, said there were 224 reported acts of violence last year against abortion clinics throughout the country. Anti-abortion activists have disavowed any connection to the nationwide violence. While noting that a number of abortion clinics had been bombed or damaged over the last several years, Mr. Dees said that action had been less effective in closing the clinics than the tactics now being used by Mr. Scheidler and his followers. Doctors are often so intimidated by demonstrations and charges that abortion is murder, he said, that they frequently withdraw from the clinics. Mr. Dees also said many women did not want to go through the ordeal of having the clinic ''invaded'' by anti-abortion demonstrators while preparing for or undergoing an abortion. ----Kansas Abortion Clinic Bombed WICHITA, Kan., June 10 (AP) - A bomb damaged an abortion clinic that had been the scene of protest marches and picketing, causing $60,000 in damage, the police said today. No one was in the Family Medicine Center when the bomb exploded shortly before midnight Monday, and there were no injuries, said Capt. B. Q. Price of the Wichita Police Department. ''No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing,'' he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Court Pushes Back; Landslides Do Not Legitimize Extremists,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/opinion/the-court-pushes-back-landslides-do-not-legitimize-extremists.html,"These have not been good days for the crusaders of the Reagan Justice Department - but they have been good for justice and a credit to the Supreme Court. In case after case the Court has been striking down cold, sometimes cruel Administration actions that shatter the bipartisan social consensus developed over three decades. The zealots have behaved as though the President's landslides gave them license to swing every pendulum hard to the right. Yesterday's abortion ruling is the latest example of Court decisions that push back, resolutely, to a decent center. President Reagan's lawyers have argued for the narrowest imaginable interpretation of laws intended to insure equal employment. Last month, the Court made clear that it rejects the Justice Department's cramped view of affirmative action and still thinks that the law is meant to foster positive steps toward an integrated workplace. The Administration cut disability benefits truly ruthlessly, using criteria never approved by Congress. When courts ordered them to stop, the Government's lawyers ignored the orders. Finally last week a unanimous Supreme Court told them to stop laying bureaucratic traps for claimants. Mr. Reagan said he would get Government off people's backs, yet his lawyers wrote regulations injecting a Federal presence even into the family anguish felt over the proper treatment for babies with severe birth defects. Judges, the President says, should interpret law, not make it; but as the Supreme Court ruled earlier this week, his lawyers' ''Baby Doe'' regulations wildly exceeded anything ever authorized by Congress. Just as admirably, the Court now rejects the Justice Department's pitch for overruling Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that vindicated a woman's freedom to choose whether to bear a child. The Court has recognized once again that state laws regulating medical practice, although neutral-looking, must be struck down if they erase a woman's liberty in the name of health and safety. Taken together, these recent rulings should concern the President and his lawyers. The Solicitor General's office formerly enjoyed the Court's confidence regardless of which party was in power. Now a social and political agenda clouds its legal arguments and erodes its reputation. When this Supreme Court, no hotbed of social or legal activism, again and again pushes back to the center, it's pretty good evidence that conservatism was being carried to law-offending extremes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NETWORKS VS. FREE SPEECH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/opinion/networks-vs-free-speech.html,"One would think that organizations that espouse the value and necessity of free speech would be reluctant to adopt rules that inhibit robust and wide-open debate. But that is exactly what the three commercial television networks have done in rejecting an advertisement about the Federal deficit produced by W. R. Grace and Company. The advertisement depicts a trial in the year 2017 in which an old man, supposedly responsible through inaction for our current deficits, is called to account by a younger generation in a setting of decay and deprivation. The purpose of the ad was not to recommend solutions to the problem but to call attention to the possible consequences of unchecked deficit financing. In rejecting this message, all three networks said in essence that the advertisement deals with a controversial issue of public importance that should be dealt with only through the process of journalism by news professionals. We find that position indefensible in a free and democratic society. One of this country's guiding principles has been the view that it is essential to have more debate on public issues, not less. By closing down this kind of commercial advertising, the networks arbitrarily limit an important and vital avenue for debate. Other media, particularly newspapers and magazines, have long accepted so-called issue advertising that appears alongside news columns. Over that long history, no one has raised questions about journalistic independence, and Grace's requests for commercial time on network TV would in no way inhibit the networks' journalistic integrity. The networks sell commercial time to advertise soap, deodorants, cars, hamburgers, beer and wine. Can it really be argued that allowing the same time to be used at the same rates to convey facts or ideas on important public issues will be detrimental to the interests of the country or the three networks? The out-of-hand rejection of important policy messages would be bad enough were it not for the fact that in enforcing their policies the networks have been inconsistent and capricious. In the past, they have accepted ads from the Committee for Energy Awareness promoting increased uses of coal and nuclear power, ads urging Americans to buy goods ''Made in the U.S.A.,'' and even ads by Grace about the budget deficit. All involve issues about which there is some (or considerable) public controversy and dispute. How can they accept one and reject another? What are the rules? How are they enforced? Finally, the networks can't be serious when they argue that only news divisions and their people should deal with matters of public controversy. They should spend some time glancing at the programs broadcast by their entertainment divisions. There is hardly a public issue affecting American life that is not in some way touched upon by these programs: abortion, the right to life, nuclear holocaust, homosexuality, drug addiction, racial discrimination, crime, the activities of intelligence agencies. Is there really any doubt that controversial issues are an integral part of the totality of television - and that their ''coverage'' goes way beyond their news programs? Moreover, who can tell where news divisions end and entertainment divisions begin? ''Good Morning America,'' a program awash in controversial issues, is produced by ABC's entertainment division, and we further venture a guess that neither the talk show host Phil Donahue nor evangelist Pat Robertson report to the presidents of anybody's news division. When we discuss First Amendment rights, it is important to remember that in 1969 the Supreme Court stated, ''It is the rights of the viewers and listeners, not the rights of the broadcaster, which are paramount.'' We recognize and respect the First Amendment rights of the networks. We hope that they, in turn, will respect not only Grace's First Amendment rights but those of the public as well. The only thing we're asking for is a set of rules that allow many voices to be heard - rules applied in a way that is fair, equitable and, more importantly, in a way that makes sense in a pluralistic society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM COURT OPINIONS ON ABORTION REGULATION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/excerpts-from-court-opinions-on-abortion-regulation-law.html,"Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision today striking down a Pennsylvania law that regulated abortion. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and John Paul Stevens. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented. Justice Byron R. White dissented separately, joined by Justice William H. Rehnquist. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor also dissented separately, joined by Justice Rehnquist. From the Opinion By Justice Blackmun This is an appeal from a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reviewing the District Court's rulings upon a motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals held unconstitutional several provisions of Pennsylvania's current Abortion Control Act. Among the provisions ruled invalid by the Court of Appeals were portions of Sec. 3205, relating to ''informed consent''; Sec. 3208 concerning ''printed information''; Secs. 3210(b) and (c) having to do with postviability abortions; and Sec. 3211(a) and Secs. 3214(a) and (h), regarding reporting requirements. The Abortion Control Act was approved by the Governor of the Commonwealth on June 11, 1982. By its own terms, however, it was to become effective only 180 days thereafter, that is, on the following Dec. 8. After the passage of the act, but before its effective date, the present litigation was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The District Court concluded that with one exception the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits and thus were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. The Court of Appeals, with one judge concurring in part and dissenting in part, ruled that various provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. Review of Challenges Less than three years ago, this Court reviewed challenges to state and municipal legislation regulating the performance of abortions. In Akron, the Court specifically reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, (1973). Again today, we reaffirm the general principles laid down in Roe and in Akron. In the years since this Court's decision in Roe, states and municipalities have adopted a number of measures seemingly designed to prevent a woman, with the advice of her physician, from exercising her freedom of choice. But the constitutional principles that led this Court to its decisions in 1973 still provide the compelling reason for recognizing the constitutional dimensions of a woman's right to decide whether to end her pregnancy. The states are not free, under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life, to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies. Appellants claim that the statutory provisions before us today further legitimate compelling interests of the Commonwealth. Close analysis of those provisions, however, shows that they wholly subordinate constitutional privacy interests and concerns with maternal health in an effort to deter a woman from making a decision that, with her physician, is hers to make. We turn to the challenged statutes: 1. Section 3205 (''informed consent'') and Sec. 3208 (printed information). Section 3205(a) requires that the woman give her ''voluntary and informed consent'' to an abortion. Failure to observe the provisions of Sec. 3205 subjects the physician to suspension or revocation of his license, and subjects any other person obligated to provide information relating to informed consent to criminal penalties. Sec. 3205(c). A requirement that the woman give what is truly a voluntary and informed consent, as a general proposition, is, of course, proper and is surely not unconstitutional. But the state may not require the delivery of information designed ''to influence the women's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.'' Information for Woman Seven explicit kinds of information must be delivered to the woman at least 24 hours before her consent is given, and five of these must be presented by the woman's physician. The five are: (a) the name of the physician who will perform the abortion, (b) the ''fact that there may be detrimental physical and psychological effects which are not accurately foreseeable.'' (c) the ''particular medical risks associated with the particular abortion procedure to the employed,'' (d) the probable gestational age, and (e) the ''medical risks associated with carrying her child to term.'' The remaining two categories are (f) the ''fact that medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal care, childbirth and neonatal care,'' and (g) the ''fact that the father is liable to assist'' in the child's support, ''even in instances where the father has offered to pay for the abortion.'' Secs. 3205(a) (1) and (2). The woman also must be informed that materials printed and supplied by the Commonwealth that describe the fetus and that list agencies offering alternatives to abortion are available for her review. If she chooses to review the materials but is unable to read, the materials ''shall be read to her'' and any answer she seeks must be ''provided her in her own language.'' She must certify in writing, prior to the abortion, that all this has been done. The materials must describe the ''probable anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two-week gestational increments from fertilization to full term, including any relevant information on the possibility of the unborn child's survival.'' The printed materials required by Secs. 3205 and 3208 seem to us to be nothing less than an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician. The mandated description of fetal characteristics at two-week intervals, no matter how objective, is plainly overinclusive. This is not medical information that is always relevant to the woman's decision, and it may serve only to confuse and punish her and to heighten her anxiety, contrary to accepted medical practice. Forcing the physician or counselor to present the materials and the list to the woman makes him or her in effect an agent of the state in treating the woman and places his or her imprimatur upon both the materials and the list. All this is, or comes close to being, state medicine imposed upon the woman, not the professional medical guidance she seeks, and it officially structures - as it obviously was intended to do - the dialogue between the woman and her physician. The requirements of Secs. 3205(a)(2)(i) and (ii) that the woman be advised that medical assistance benefits may be available, and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in the support of the child similarly are poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision. The requirements of Secs. 3205(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) that the woman be informed by the physician of ''detrimental physical and psychological effects'' and of all ''particular medical risks'' compound the problem of medical attendance, increase the patient's anxiety, and intrude upon the physician's exercise of proper professional judgment. This type of compelled information is the antithesis of informed consent. Report by Physician Section 3211(a) requires the physician to report the basis for his determination ''that a child is not viable.'' It applies only after the first trimester. The report required by Secs. 3214(a) and (h) is detailed and must include, among other things, identification of the performing and referring physicians and of the facility or agency; information as to the woman's political subdivision and state of residence, age, race, marital status, and number of prior pregnancies; the date of her last menstrual period and the probable gestational age; the basis for any judgment that a medical emergency existed; the basis for any determination of nonviability; and the method of payment for the abortion. The report is to be signed by the attending physician. Despite the fact that Sec. 3214(e)(2) provides that such reports ''shall not be deemed public records,'' within the meaning of the Commonwealth's ''Right-to-Know Law.'' The scope of the information required and its availability to the public belie any assertions by the Commonwealth that it is advancing any legitimate interest. Section 3210(c) requires that a second physician be present during an abortion performed when viability is possible. The second physician is to ''take control of the child and . . . provide immediate medical care for the child, taking all reasonable steps necessary, in his judgment, to preserve the child's life and health.'' Violation of this requirement is a felony of the third degree. In Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Ashcroft, (1983), the Court, by a 5-4 vote, but not by a controlling single opinion, ruled that a Missouri statute requiring the presence of a second physician during an abortion performed after viability was constitutional. No Express Exception Like the Missouri statute, Sec. 3210(c) of the Pennsylvanian statute contains no express exception for an emergency situation. While the Missouri statute, in the view of Justice Powell, was worded sufficiently to imply an emergency exception, Pennsylvania's statute contains no such comforting or helpful language and evinces no intent to protect a woman whose life may be at risk. Section 3210(a) provides only a defense to criminal liability for a physician who concluded, in good faith, that a fetus was nonviable ''or that the abortion was necessary to preserve maternal life or health.'' It does not relate to the second-physician requirement and its words are not words of emergency. All the factors are here for chilling the performance of a late abortion, which, more than one performed at an earlier date, perhaps tends to be under emergency conditions. Constitutional rights do not always have easily ascertainable boundaries, and controversy over the meaning of our nation's most majestic guarantees frequently has been turbulent. As judges, however, we are sworn to uphold the law even when its content gives rise to bitter dispute. See Cooper v. Aaron, (1958). We recognized at the very beginning of our opinion in Roe that abortion raises moral and spiritual questions over which honorable persons can disagree sincerely and profoundly. But those disagreements did not then and do not now relieve us of our duty to apply the Constitution faithfully. Our cases long have recognized that the Constitution embodies a promise that a certain private sphere of individual liberty will be kept largely beyond the reach of government. That promise extends to women as well as to men. Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, that a woman's decision -with the guidance of her physician and within the limits specified in Roe - whether to end her pregnancy. A woman's right to make that choice freely is fundamental. Any other result, in our view, would protect inadequately a central part of the sphere of liberty that our law guarantees equally to all. The Court of Appeals correctly invalidated the specified provisions of Pennsylvania's 1982 Abortion Control Act. Its judgment is affirmed. From Dissenting Opinions By Chief Justice Burger In my concurrence in the companion case to ''Roe v. Wade in 1973, I noted that ''Plainly, the Court today rejects any claim that the Constitution requires abortions on demand.'' Later, In Maher v. Roe, (1977), I stated my view that ''the Court's holdings in Roe . . . and Doe v. Bolton . . . simply require that a State not create an absolute barrier to a woman's decision to have an abortion.'' I based my concurring statements in Roe and Maher on the principle expressed in the Court's opinion in Roe that the right to an abortion ''is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.'' In short, every member of the Roe Court rejected the idea of abortion on demand. The Court's opinion today, however, plainly undermines that important principle, and I regretfully conclude that some of the concerns of the dissenting Justices in Roe, as well as the concerns I expressed in my separate opinion, have now been realized. The extent to which the Court has departed from the limitations expressed in Roe is readily apparent. In Roe, the Court emphasized ''that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protectng the health of the pregnant woman . . . '' Yet today the Court astonishingly goes so far as to say that the state may not even require that a woman contemplating an abortion be provided with accurate medical information concerning the risks inherent in the medical procedure which she is about to undergo and the availability of alternatives if she elects not to run those risks. Can anyone doubt that the state could impose a similar requirement with respect to other medical procedures? The Court's astounding rationale is that such information might have the effect of ''discouraging abortion,'' as though abortion is something to be advocated and encouraged. 'Another Legitimate Interest' The Court in Roe further recognized that the State ''has still another important and legitimate interest'' which is ''separate and distinct'' from the interest in protecting maternal health, i.e. an interest in ''protecting the potentiality of human life.'' The point at which these interests become ''compelling'' under Roe is at viability of the fetus. Today, however, the Court abandons that standard and renders the solemnly stated concerns of the 1973 Roe opinion for the interests of the states mere shallow rhetoric. Undoubtedly the Pennsylvania Legislature added the second physician requirement on the mistaken assumption that this Court meant what it said in Roe concerning the ''compelling interest'' of the states in potential life after viability. The Court's opinion today is but the most recent indication of the distance traveled since Roe. Perhaps the first important road marker was the Court's holding in Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth, (1976), in which the Court held (over the dissent of Justice White joined by Justice Rehnquist and myself) that the State may not require that minors seeking an abortion first obtain parental consent. In discovering constitutional infirmities in state regulations of abortion that are in accord with our history and tradition, we may have lured judges into ''roaming at large in the constitutional field.'' Griswold v. Connecticut, (1965) (Harlan, J., concurring). The soundness of our holdings must be tested by the decisions that purport to follow them. If Danforth and today's holding really mean what they seem to say, I agree we should re-examine Roe. By Justice White, With Whom Justice Rehnquist Joins Today the Court carries forward the difficult and continuing venture in substantive due process that began with the decision in Roe v. Wade, (1973), and has led the Court further and further afield in the 13 years since that decision was handed down. I was in dissent in Roe v. Wade and am in dissent today. In Part I below, I state why I continue to believe that this venture has been fundamentally misguided since its inception. In Part II, I submit that even accepting Roe v. Wade, the concerns underlying that decision by no means command or justify the results reached today. Indeed, in my view, our precedents in this area, applied in a manner consistent with sound principles of constitutional adjudication, require reversal of the Court of Appeals on the ground that the provisions before us are facially constitutional. Cases like this one involve our assumed power to set aside on grounds of unconstitutionality a state or Federal statute representing the democratically expressed will of the people. Because the Constitution itself is ordained and established by the people of the United States, constitutional adjudication by this Court does not, in theory at any rate, frustrate the authority of the people to govern themselves through institutions of their own devising and in accordance with principles of their own choosing. But decisions that find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document usurp the people's authority, for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation. For this reason, it is essential that this Court maintain the power to restore authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that, on reconsideration, are found to be mistaken. Overruling Decisions The Court has therefore adhered to the rule that stare decisis is not rigidly applied in cases involving constitutional issues and has not hesitated to overrule decisions, or even whole lines of cases, where experience, scholarship, and reflection demonstrated that their fundamental premises were not to be found in the Constitution. In my view, the time has come to recognize that Roe v. Wade, no less than the cases overruled by the Court in the decisions I have just cited, ''departs from a proper understanding'' of the Constitution and to overrule it. Roe v. Wade posits that a woman has a fundamental right to terminate her pregnancy, and that this right may be restricted only in the service of two compelling state interests: the interest in maternal health (which becomes compelling only at the stage in pregnancy at which an abortion becomes more hazardous than carrying the pregnancy to term) and the interest in protecting the life of the fetus (which becomes compelling only at the point of viability). A reader of the Constitution might be surprised to find that it encompassed these detailed rules, for the text obviously contains no references to abortion, nor, indeed, to pregnancy or reproduction generally; and, of course, it is highly doubtful that the authors of any of the provisions of the Constitution believed that they were giving protection to abortion. As its prior cases clearly show, however, this Court does not subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possible be limited to the ''plain meaning'' of the Constitution's text or to the subjective intention of the Framers. Constitution Is Not a Deed The Constitution is not a deed setting forth the precise metes and bounds of its subject matter; rather, it is a document announcing fundamental principles in value-laden terms that leave ample scope for the exercise of normative judgment by those charged with interpreting and applying it. In particular, the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, which forbids the deprivation of ''life, liberty, or property without due process of law,'' has been read by the majority of the Court to be broad enough to provide substantive protection against state infringement of a broad range of individual interests. I can certainly agree with the proposition - which I deem indisputable - that a woman's ability to choose an abortion is a species of ''liberty'' that is subject to the general protections of the Due Process Clause. I cannot agree, however, that this liberty is so ''fundamental'' that restrictions upon it call into play anything more than the most minimal judicial scrutiny. Fundamental liberties and interests are most clearly present when the Constitution provides specific textual recognition of their existence and importance. Thus, the Court is on relatively firm ground when it deems certain of the liberties set forth in the Bill of Rights to be fundamental and therefore finds them incorporated in the 14th Amendment's guarantee that no state may deprive any person of liberty without due process of law. When the Court ventures further and defines as ''fundamental'' liberties that are nowhere mentioned in the Constitution (or that are present only in the so-called ''penumbras'' or specifically enumerated rights), it must, of necessity, act with more caution, lest it open itself to the accusation that, in the name of identifying constitutional principles to which the people have consented in framing their Constitution, the Court has done nothing more than impose its own controversial choices of value upon the people. Constraints Upon Court Attempts to articulate the constraints that must operate upon the Court when it employs the Due Process Clause to protect liberties not specifically enumerated in the text of the Constitution have produced varying definitions of ''fundamental liberties.'' One approach has been to limit the class of fundamental liberties to those interests that are ''implicit in the concept of ordered liberty'' such that ''neither liberty nor justice would exist if [ they ] were sacrificed.'' Another, broader approach is to define fundamental liberties as those that are ''deeply rooted in this nation's history and tradition.'' Their utility lies in their effort to identify some source of constitutional value that reflects not the philosophical predilections of individual judges, but basic choices made by the people themselves in constituting their system of government and they seek to achieve this end through locating fundamental rights either in the traditions and consensus of our society as a whole or in the logical implications of a system that recognizes both individual liberty and democratic order. Whether either of these approaches can, as Justice Harlan hoped, prevent ''judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field,'' is debatable. What for me is not subject to debate, however, is that either of the basic definitions of fundamental liberties, taken seriously, indicates the illegitimacy of the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. The Court has justified the recognition of a woman's fundamental right to terminate her pregnancy by invoking decisions upholding claims of personal autonomy in connection with the conduct of family life, the rearing of children, marital privacy and the use of contraceptives, and the preservation of the individual's capacity to procreate. Issues in Cases Differ The issues in the cases cited differ from those at stake where abortion is concerned. As the Court appropriately recognized in Roe v. Wade, '' [ t ] he pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy,'' the termination of a pregnancy typically involves the destruction of another entity: the fetus. However one answers the metaphysical or theological question whether the fetus is a ''human being'' or the legal question whether it is a ''person'' as that term is used in the Constitution, one must at least recognize, first, that the fetus is an entity that bears in its cells all the genetic information that characterizes a member of the species homo sapiens and distinguishes an individual member of that species from all others, and second, that there is no nonarbitrary line separating a fetus from a child or, indeed, an adult human being. Given that the continued existence and development - that is to say, the life - of such an entity are so directly at stake in the woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy, that decision must be recognized as sui generis, different in kind from the others that the Court has protected under the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy. Accordingly, the decisions cited by the Court both in Roe and in its opinion today as precedent for the fundamental nature of the liberty to choose abortion do not, even if all are accepted as valid, dictate the Court's classification. The Court's opinion in Roe itself convincingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people, as does the continuing and deep division of the people themselves over the question of abortion. As for the notion that choice in the matter of abortion is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, it seems apparent to me that a free, egalitarian, and democratic society does not presuppose any particular rule or set of rules with respect to abortion. Differences on the Issue And again, the fact that many men and women of good will and high commitment to constitutional government place themselves on both sides of the abortion controversy strengthens my own conviction that the values animating the Constitution do not compel recognition of the abortion liberty as fundamental. In so denominating that liberty, the Court engages not in constitutional interpretation, but in the unrestrained imposition of its own, extraconstitutional value preferences. A second, equally basic error infects the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. The detailed set of rules governing state restrictions on abortion that the Court first articulated in Roe and has since refined and elaborated presupposes not only that the woman's liberty to choose an abortion is fundamental, but also that the state's countervailing interest in protecting fetal life (or, as the Court would have it, ''potential human life,'' becomes ''compelling'' only at the point at which the fetus is viable. As Justice O'Connor pointed out three years ao, the Court's choice of viability as the point at which the state's interest becomes compelling is entirely arbitrary. The governmental interest at issue is in protecting those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb. The substantiality of this interest is in no way dependent on the probability that the fetus may be capable of surviving outside the womb at any given point in its development. Both the characterization of the abortion liberty as fundamental and the denigration of the state's interest in preserving the lives of nonviable fetuses are essential to the detailed set of constitutional rules devised by the Court to limit the states' power to regulate abortion. If either or both of these facets of Roe v. Wade were rejected, a broad range of limitations on abortion (including outright prohibition) that are now unavailable to the states would again become constitutional possibilities. Hotly Contested Issue In my view, such a state of affairs would be highly desirable from the standpoint of the Constitution. Abortion is a hotly contested moral and political issue. Such issues, in our society, are to be resolved by the will of the people, either as expressed through legislation or through the general principles they have already incorporated into the Constitution they have adopted. Roe v. Wade implies that the people have already resolved the debate by weaving into the Constitution the values and principles that answer the issue. I believe it is clear that the people have never -not in 1787, 1791, 1868, or at any time since - done any such thing. I would return the issue to the people by overruling Roe v. Wade. The Court begins by striking down statutory provisions designed to ensure that the woman's choice of an abortion is fully informed - that is, that she is aware not only of the reasons for having an abortion, but also of the risks associated with an abortion and the availability of assistance that might make the alternative of normal childbirth more attractive than it might otherwise appear. One searches the majority's opinion in vain for a convincing reason why the apparently laudable policy of promoting informed consent becomes unconstitutional when the subject is abortion. The majority appears to reason that the informed consent provisions are invalid because the information they require may increase the woman's ''anxiety'' about the procedure and even ''influence'' her in her choice. Both observations are undoubtedly true; but they by no means cast the constitutionality of the provisions into question. It is in the very nature of informed consent provisions that they may produce some anxiety in the patient and influence her in her choice. This is in fact their reason for existence. Reporting Requirements The majority's decision to strike down the reporting requirements of the statute is equally extraordinary. The requirements obviously serve legitimate purposes. Given that the subject of abortion is a matter of considerable public interest and debate (constrained to some extent, of course, by the pre-emptive effect of this Court's ill-conceived constitutional decisions), the collection and dissemination of demographic information concerning abortions is clearly a legitimate goal of public policy. I can accept the proposition that a statute whose purpose and effect are to allow harassment and intimidation of citizens for their constitutionally protected conduct is unconstitutional, but the majority's action in striking down the Pennsylvania statute on this basis is procedurally and substantively indefensible. Finally, in addition to being procedurally flawed, the majority's holding is substantively suspect. It is implausible that a particular patient could be identified on the basis of the combination of the general identifying information and the specific medical information in these reports by anyone who did not already know (at a minimum) that the woman had been pregnant and obtained an abortion. Accordingly, the provisions pose little or no threat to the woman's privacy. The majority resorts to linguistic nit-picking in striking down the provision requiring physicians aborting viable fetuses to use the method of abortion most likely to result in fetal survival unless that method would post a ''significantly greater medical risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman'' than would other available methods. The majority concludes that the statute's use of the word ''significantly'' indicates that the statute represents an unlawful ''trade-off'' between the woman's health and the chance of fetal survival. Not only is this conclusion based on a wholly unreasonable interpretation of the statute, but the statute would also be constitutional even if it meant what the majority says it means Ruling Seen and Inconsistent The Court's ruling in this respect is not even consistent with its decision in Roe v. Wade. In Roe, the Court conceded that the state's interest in preserving the life of a viable fetus is a compelling one, and the Court has never disavowed that concession. The Court now holds that this compelling interest cannot justify any regulation that imposes a quantifiable medical risk upon the pregnant woman who seeks to abort a viable fetus: if attempting to save the fetus imposes any additional risk of injury to the woman, she must be permitted to kill it. The Court's ruling today that any trade-off between the woman's health and fetal survival is impermissible is not only inconsistent with Roe's recognition of a compelling state interest in viable fetal life; it directly contradicts one of the essential holdings of Roe - that is, that the state may forbid all postviability abortions except when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant woman. The Court strikes down the statute's second-physician requirement because, in its view, the existence of a medical emergency requiring an immediate abortion to save the life of the pregnant woman would not be a defense to a prosecution under the statute. I cannot accept the majority's conclusion that the statute does not provide for the equivalent of a defense of emergency. The decision today appears symptomatic of the Court's own insecurity over its handiwork in Roe v. Wade and the cases following that decison. Aware that in Roe it essentially created something out of nothing and that there are many in this country who hold that decision to be basically illegitimate, the Court responds defensively. Perceiving, in a state implementing the State's legitimate policy of prefering childbirth to abortion, a threat to or criticism of the decision in Roe v. Wade, the majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that in no way contravene the right recognized in Roe. I do not share the warped point of view of the majority, nor can I follow the tortuous path the majority treads in procedding to strike down the statute before us. I dissent. By Justice O'Connor, With Whom Justice Rehnquist Joins This Court's abortion decisions have already worked a major distortion in the Court's constitutional jurisprudence. Today's decision goes further, and makes it painfully clear that no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by this Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion. The permissible scope of abortion requlation is not the only constitutional issue on which this Court is divided, but - except when it comes to abortion - the Court",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has generally refused to let such disagreements, however longstanding or deeply felt, prevent it from evenhandedly applying uncontroversial legal doctrines to cases that come before it. That the Court's unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing the regulation of abortion has had this institutionally debilitating effect should not be surprising, however, since the Court is not suited to the expansive role it has claimed for itself in the series of cases that began with Roe v. Wade. The Court today holds that ''the Court of Appeals correctly invalidated the specific provisions of Pennsylvania's 1982 Abortion Control Act.'' In so doing, the Court prematurely decides serious constitutional questions on an inadequate record, in contravention of settled principles of constitutional adjudication and procedural fairness. The constitutionality of the challenged provisions was not properly before the Court of Appeals, and is not properly before this Court. There has been no trial on the merits, and appellants have had no opportunity to develop facts that might have a bearing on the constitutionality of the statute. The only question properly before the Court is whether or not a preliminary injunction should have been issued to restrain enforcement of the challenged provisions pending trial on the merits. This Court's decisions do not establish a likelihood that appellees would succeed on the merits of their constitutional claims sufficient to warrant overturning the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction. Under the approach to abortion regulation outlined in my dissenting opinion in Akron, to which I adhere, it is even clearer that no preliminary injunction should have issued. I therefore dissent. Because Pennsylvania has not asked the Court to reconsider or overrul Roe v. Wade, I do not address that question. I do, however, remain of the views expressed in my dissent in Akron. The State has compelling interests in ensuring maternal health and in protecting potential human life, and these interests exist ''throughout pregnancy.'' Under this Court's fundamental-rights jurisprudence, judicial scrutiny of state regulation of abortion should be limited to whether the state law bears a rational relationship to legitimate purposes such as the advancement of these compelling interests, with heightened scrutiny reserved for instances in which the State has imposed an ''undue burden'' on the abortion decision. By holding that each of the challenged provisions is facially unconstitutional as a matter of law, and that no conceivable facts appellants might offer could alter this result, the Court appears to adopt as its new test a per se rule under which any regulation touching on abortion must be invalidated if it poses ''an unacceptable danger of deterring the exercise of that right.'' Under this prophylactic test, it seems that the mere possibility that some women will be less likely to choose to have an abortion by virtue of the presence of a particular state regulation suffices to invalidate it. I dispute not only the wisdom but the legitimacy of the Court's attempt to discredit and pre-empt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has. In my view," today's decision makes bad constitutional law and bad procedural law. The '' 'undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket' '' in this case is not the one the Court purports to discover in Pennsylvania's statute; it is the one the Court has tailored for the 50 States. I respectfuly dissent.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Senior officials said the evidence also showed that the army commander, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is in effect Panaama's leader, has been supplying intelligence information to both the United States and Cuba for 15 years. [ Page A1, Columns 1-2. ] The President has not firmly decided to abandon observance of the terms of the 1979 treaty on limiting strategic arms. Mr. Reagan told reporters his decision would depend on whether the Kremlin changed its arms control policies. [ A1:3. ] Three bombings in Sri Lanka killed up to 43 people and injured 80. Government officials said the time bombs had been set by Tamil terrorists. The bombings occurred in two buses in Sri Lanka's troubled eastern district and outside a movie theater in the capital, Colombo. [ A3:4-6. ] National The Supreme Court upheld abortion and struck down a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion, 5 to 4. But the unusually harsh dissenting opinions suggested the Court might consider reversing itself and restricting or even abandoning constitutional abortion rights if any member of the majority were replaced by a Justice who shared the dissenters' views. [ A1:6. ] Mandatory Social Security numbers are constitutional, the Supreme Court ruled. The Justices held, 8 to 1, that the Government could use the numbers for adminstrative procedures even if that conflicted with citizens' religious beliefs. [ B11:1-2. ] The President backed construction of a new space shuttle at a news conference. Earlier, aerospace experts said that no shuttle could be launched for at least two years if the chief recommendations of the Presidential commission on the shuttle Challenger are carried out. [ A1:1-2. ] The Senate voted to reject proposals that would have maintained tax deductions for all Individual Retirement Accounts. The proposals, rejected by 51 to 48, were believed to be the most important challenges to the tax-revision bill approved last month by the Senate Finance Committee. Their defeat appeared to guarantee Senate passage of the measure without significant change. [ A1:4-5. ] Army opposition to smoking is reflected in a new ban on smoking in vehicles and aircraft. The Army said it sought to make nonsmoking the norm for its work areas because ''smoking tobacco harms readiness by impairing physical fitness and by increasing illness, absenteeism, premature death and health care costs.'' [ B12:1-2. ] Illegal alien families could continue living in federally assisted public housing projects if at least one member of the family is a citizen or legal resident, under legislation approved unanimously by the House. The measure was aimed at blunting the impact of a new Reagan Administration policy.

Lawsuit Fear Cuts Contraceptive Choices,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/opinion/l-lawsuit-fear-cuts-contraceptive-choices-541486.html,"To the Editor: The contraception options available to couples are dwindling fast. Last Feb. 1, G.D. Searle & Company halted sale of its intrauterine contraceptive devices in the United States, citing the high cost of defending lawsuits. Johnson & Johnson's Ortho division removed its IUD from the market last September. Both companies defended the safety of their products, but intimated that the A.H. Robins company situation had scared them out of the market. Robins, maker of the Dalkon Shield IUD, filed for bankruptcy last August after suits by more than 14,000 women, claiming a variety of IUD complications. Only one IUD remains on the market, made by the Alza Corporation. It is not the traditional IUD, as it uses hormones to stop conception and must be replaced annually. Now The Wall Street Journal (May 20) indicates that Johnson & Johnson is considering removing spermicide contraceptives from the market, in the wake of a $4.7 million damage award and the possibility of more claims. About 3.4 million women use spermicides with or without diaphragms. What will be next? Oral contraceptives, the pill, have been available in the U.S. over 25 years and remain the most widely used method of contraception, with the exception of sterilization. But problems associated with the pill include increased risk of cancer and troubling side effects. It is not far-fetched to imagine the pharmaceutical companies deciding the lawsuit risk is too great and removing oral contraceptives from the market. There has never been a truly ''good'' method of birth control. All have drawbacks, virtually all are addressed to women, and research into new methods has declined. What drug company wants to bring a new product into a market with a propensity for legal catastrophe? Unless we recognize the importance of safe, effective and readily available contraception in the U.S. and provide protections for these products, we face a future much like the dark past. It was not so long ago that safe contraception was not available; that far too many children were brought into a world that could not feed and care for them; that desperate women sought illegal abortions rather than face the delivery of a child. Faced with poverty and hunger, high teen-age pregnancy and an ever-decreasing number of ways to prevent pregnancy, we must see the need for better and more available contraception now.JEFFREY L.

PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/president-s-news-conference-on-foreign-and-domestic-issues.html,"Following is a transcript of President Reagan's news conference last night in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times OPENING STATEMENT Good evening, please be seated. I have an opening statement. I want to say a few words tonight about three important issues that are now before the Congress. We've reined in government spending, and with Gramm-Rudman we can look forward to a disappearing deficit by 1991. But there are still a few obstacles in the way on our road to a balanced budget. Rather than make the sensible adjustments we've suggested, some in Congress apparently intend to take large and dangerous cuts out of our national defense. And again we hear that constant refrain coming out of Washington, ''Raise taxes.'' It is time for Congress to take a responsible approach to spending decisions and when it comes to taxes, let's get into the spirit of the times. I've said it before and I'll say it as often as it takes: I'll veto any tax hike that comes across my desk. Not only will we not raise taxes before I leave office, I plan to make sure we have a balanced budget amendment that puts a permanent lid on taxes and doesn't let the government grow any faster than the economy. So we've made progress but we have a ways to go on the budget. Progress on Taxes I'm glad to say, though, that we're moving on tax reform that will achieve fairness and promote growth. We're looking at a tax reform bill in the Senate that's quite simply one of the best antipoverty programs, one of the best job-creation programs and one of the best pro-family bills this country has ever seen all rolled into one. I hope the House and the Senate will move quickly to bring this bill into law so America can make a fresh start in 1987 and even lower tax rates, even more jobs, and even stronger growth. Finally, there is the upcoming vote on aid to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. Congress must understand the urgency of the situation in Central America. Delay is deadly and plays right along with the Communist game plan because while we may have tied our own hands the Soviets, Cubans and Libyans haven't tied theirs. With over a billion dollars of support and some of the most fearsome weapons in the Soviet arsenal, the Communist strategy is simple: Hold off American aid as long as possible in the hope they can destroy all opposition before help arrives. It's time for an up-and-down vote on freedom in Nicaragua, an up-and-down vote on whether the United States is going to stop Soviet expansionism on the American mainland while the price is still not too high and the risks are still not too great. We must act now in a bipartisan way to do the right thing, to rescue freedom in Nicaragua and protect the national security of the United States. Now, Helen, it's your turn. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Arms Treaty Q. Mr. President, your decision to tear up the SALT treaty by the end of the year has caused great consternation among the allies, among members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, among others who fear that you are creating a more dangerous world. My question is, is this decision irreversible? And I'd like to follow up. A. I, Helen, I have to say that I can understand why they would be distressed with the way the news has been carried, but let me go back to what the situation really is. First of all, this treaty was signed seven years ago, was never ratified -no, it was more than seven years ago, I guess - but for seven years there was supposed to have been this restraint and this observation of the -this observance of the treaty's terms. And for seven years this country has been doing that. The Soviet regime, for seven years, has been violating the restraints of the treaty. We found it necessary to - or advisable to do away with two Poseidon submarines as we launched the last Trident but that, I had to make plain, was not - rather did keep us within the constraints of the SALT agreement. That wasn't the reason. Had there been no SALT agreement, we would have done away with those two submarines because - or dismantled them - because of the cost and the military value of them - or lack of it. But then what I said was that before we reached another point where this might be an issue at all several months away which has to do with the arming of the 131st B-52 with a new air-launch cruise missile. And in the interim period, I said that we could not go on unilaterally observing the constraints while the Soviet Union violated them and gained ever greater superiority over us and that we were going to be bound from now on by the necessity of maintaining a deterrent. We're not seeking to achieve superiority over them but we're certainly not going to let them go on increasing their superiority over us. I said because we have these several months before that moment comes up that we were going to do our utmost since they themselves have talked of arms reduction. But we were going to do our utmost to see if we couldn't involve them in replacing the SALT Treaty which first of all was never ratified as I said, but second of all would no longer be in power if it had been ratified because it was stated for a limited period of time that if we could replace that with a realistic program of arms reduction which has been my goal ever since I've been here. Now we have the first Soviet leader to my knowledge that has ever voluntarily spoken of reducing nuclear weapons and we want to follow up on that. Congressional Critics Q. It sounds like you are going to tear it up, Mr. President. Do you agree with Richard Perle who branded as Soviet supporters, members of Congress who want to keep you within the limits of this treaty? A. I'm not going to make any comment on anyone who wants to keep us - but I did find it rather strange that some of the senators who spoke very critically of me without really understanding what it is that I've tried to explain about this, some of them were members of the Senate when they refused to ratify the treaty to begin with. The treaty was really nothing but the legitimizing of an arms race. It didn't do anything to reduce nuclear weapons or the nuclear threat. All it did was regulate how fast and how much we could continue increasing the number of weapons. So I was always hostile to that particular treaty because it did not reduce weapons and that's what we're going to do. But again, as I say, the Soviets have an opportunity to meet us now with regard to solve the very things they've been proposing - arms reduction. And we will observe the constraints to the same extent that the Soviet Union does, but we can't go on unilaterally observing this while they take off on their own with the violations that they've already made and probably more to come. Future of Shuttle Q. Mr. President, NASA is awaiting your decision on how to replace the Challenger spacecraft. Could you tell us tonight how you would finance the fourth orbiter? And if you can't tell us that, could you explain what's holding up your decision? A. Well for one thing, we're studying the report that we've received and there are many things that have to be decided. There is a backlog now of space cargo that is supposed to be up there and we have the problem of determining whether we shouldn't increase the number of unmanned launchers for many of those things that could put them in space. And then see where we can come with the - I, believe me, I want to go forward and I think we all do - with the shuttle program, but how soon we can get to that is a question and in the meantime should we emphasize more of the unlaunched to get to move on that backlog that we have of cargo that needs to get into space. So, I don't have an answer for you on this except that, yes, I think we should go forward with another shuttle. The Rogers Report Q. A follow-up, sir. Would that, for the shuttle, would you insist that fourth orbiter incorporate all the recommendations of the Rogers commission when it is built? A. Well, again, we're still in the midst of studying that now that we've just received it, so I can't answer something as specific as that about that. Jerry? Nicaragua Policy Q. I have a two-part question, sir. You've left no doubt through your public statements of your determination not to permit Nicaragua to become another Communist Cuba or a Libya. What means are left to the United States if the contras are defeated by any means whatever? Is a naval quarantine a possibility? A. I couldn't and, Jerry, I wouldn't comment on anything that might be further actions for us because I don't think you could do that without informing them of anything we're thinking. And right now we have not, we have not planned for any contingency beyond aiding the contras because we think that - I've got to stop using that word, that was the Sandinistas' title for them, and I don't like to do anything they're doing - so the freedom fighters we believe with all the information that we have that they are capable of at the very least applying sufficient leverage that they could bring the Sandinista Government to a negotiating table for a settlement. We would prefer that over a military settlement, if that can be done. We know that there are thousands of recruits that are waiting to join the freedom fighters, and they need the weapons and ammunition and so forth for them. Effect on Summit Q. Another part of the question is -this week, in a speech you likened Mr. Gorbachev to Castro, Arafat and Qaddafi, and I'd like to ask what effect you think this statement would have on future relations with the Soviet Union in a possible summit. I'm talking about the Georgetown speech. A. Yes, but I didn't think I lumped him in with them. Q. In the speech. A. I certainly think it was a bad choice of words, because I didn't mean to do that, because, as I said, he is the first Russian leader, to my knowledge, that has ever voiced the idea of reducing, and even eliminating, nuclear weapons. So I must have goofed someplace, because believe me, I don't put him in the same category. Ruling on Abortion Gary? Q. Mr. President, with the Supreme Court's decision today allowing a woman to have an abortion, yet again another Supreme Court decision, will your Administration let this be the law of the land, or are you going to look for another case to press your position on this matter? A. Now wait a minute. Hit me again here. I think I was still answering Jerry's question. Abortion Case Q. The Supreme Court decided today to not interfere with a woman's right to have an abortion. Is your Administration going to pick another case to fight this position or are you going to let it stand as the law of the land? A. We're going to see - if we interpret the decision right of the Court, their objection was not to what we were trying to accomplish but the fact that evidently the regulations in H.H.S. that we asked for were based on that previous bill that had to do with discrimination against the handicapped and they, the Court, said they thought that this was putting the Federal Government - they were getting into something that properly was the province of the state and all. So what we have to do is look for what are the proper way we can do this. Because I feel very strongly that we're talking about a human life. And the case that prompted this entire act was one in which the determination is made that this life is to be taken away and yet it isn't done as you would with an animal, it isn't done with a merciful putting to sleep or - they can't do that so instead they just let it starve to death. And I just don't think that - if our Constitution means anything it means that we, the Federal Government, are entrusted with preserving life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Well, where do we draw the line? Can we say to someone, ''It's all right for you to in whatever way you choose and dispose of this human life, and for whatever reason''? And I think - I just don't think we're finished with this problem at all. Soviet Superiority Q. Mr. President, if I could pursue the questions on your decision on the SALT treaty? On the one hand you're saying that the Soviets have continued to increase their superiority over us. On the other hand you said that the treaty did not constrain either side in terms of the arms race, as one of the reasons you were not for it. It really can't be both ways, at the same time, when we've had a massive buildup, the Reagan defense buildup. Which way is it? Have the Soviets been able to increase superiority over this period of time? Or has the treaty not been able to stop them? A. No, it hasn't been able to. The treaty, actually, set limits, as for example what one new type of weapon now that you could develop that didn't exist, and they have developed two instead of one, and this was a violation. It also set numbers and figures so that it was a restraint to the extent of just not an all-out arms race with no limit on the way you could progress. But when you say about achieving, remember, we're still playing catchup. They were building when we were dismantling, and we feel, as I've said before, that there's no way that we can allow them to reach for and get a superiority. And we don't want a superiority over them, but also we simply want to maintain enough of a deterrent that even with whatever superiority they have, it won't be enough for them to take the chance on the followup action that could happen. Arms Violations Q. If I could just follow that up though. At the same time your own arms control director, Mr. Adelman, had said that the Soviet violations have not had any great military significance. What is the possibility now, since the violations themselves which have been disputed by some people as to their significance, what is the possibility that by abandoning the treaty now, which is, as you just admitted, has some limited significance in providing some degree of predictability, that we won't go into a complete arms race now? What's to replace SALT at this point? And why make this decision now? A. I didn't make it now. I said we've got several months here in which we're going to try to involve them in the things they themselves have been talking about and that is a definite arms reduction program. This is the only thing that makes sense in the world and I've been talking about this since 1980 and I said I was sick and tired of agreements that just said, well we'll only go at this pace in our increasing the number of weapons. Let's get around to getting rid of them as much as we can. [ Garbled comment. ] Hunger in America Q. Sir, that's true, thank you, sir, for remembering. A couple of weeks ago you said that the problem of the hungry people in America is not due to the fact that they don't have food and the ability to get food, it's that they don't know where to get it. And some poor people we talked to at the time said you're blaming the hungry people for being hungry. You're putting the blame on them. A. Well, I don't know who those people were, and I do have to say that I think there are people who lack the information, people out in the country, that maybe don't know and we've had plenty of evidence of that. But the simple truth of the matter is, we are spending on nutrition more than has ever been spent before, more than $3 billion over and above what was spent in 1981; $18.6 billion I think it is this year, that is being spent on this program. But in the interim, during this same time that we've been increasing, the private sector has gone all out in programs all over the country of meals for the hungry. Today the Federal Government is providing, I think it's 93 million meals a day and that does not count all those private agencies, too. So I think there is considerable merit for saying that it's difficult to believe that people are starving in this country because food isn't available. I just, as I say, I think that in many instances the people just don't know where or how to go about it and at the same time I find it difficult also to find any cases of starvation and undernourishment. Food Aid Program Q. But sir, if that is the problem, public education, why then did you cut out the one Federal program that did just that - educate hungry people, educate the rural poor, educate elderly shut-ins about how to get food assistance? It was there and your Administration cut it out. A. Because it was a case of - that was a case of simply food stamps and that's a program in which I think most people are aware of food stamps and the neighbors are doing it in many cases and if they haven't done it yet - and this was one in which they had us literally going door to door, knocking on the door to tell people how to become eligible or, ''Have you gotten your food stamps today?'' And we thought it was a waste, that we'd rather buy more food stamps and pay for more food stamps than pay for the bureaucracy to do a thing of this kind. Leslie? Weapons Decision Q. Mr. President, you've just said that you really haven't made the SALT decision yet. And I think there's a lot of confusion as to exactly where we stand on the SALT decision. Are you going to go over the limit of the SALT decision or are you going to dismantle another submarine and stay within the limits? Exactly what are you going to do on SALT? A. Well, Leslie, you're asking something - yes, we will have a plane coming up to be armed with a cruise missile that would put us to that extent beyond the constraints or the limitation. Now we've got several months before we reach that point. We've got several months in which to see if the Soviet Union - we have taxed them over and over again with regard to their violating the constraints. Now on that basis we're going to see if we cannot persuade them to join in the things they're talking about - arms control - or arms reduction. And if nothing is done then we'll make the decision with regard to that plane. Missile Proposal Q. There are reports that today in Geneva the Soviets made a new proposal on reducing long-range strategic missiles. Is this the kind of proposal you've been looking for and has it changed your opinion of what you're going to do on SALT A. I can't comment on it because of the confidentiality of the situation there in Geneva. But yes, as of today we have received this proposal, and now we're going to study that and see what they have in it. Sam? Challenger Liability Q. Mr. President, the Rogers commission detailed a series of actions and inactions leading up to that shuttle disaster, of individuals who knew that the O rings had a problem but did nothing about it, and in the last 24 hours before the launch, have engineers from Thiokol saying it's unsafe to launch, don't launch, but of pressure being put on Thiokol to reverse it. And yet William Rogers seems to think that the individuals involved should not be punished further, their culpability should not be established. Do you agree? A. Yes, I do. We are still studying that report of theirs. But I don't believe that there was any deliberate or criminal intent in any way on the part of anyone. I think that with the great record of success that NASA has had, all the way back to when men circled the Earth in those capsules, and then to men on the Moon and now 24 successful shuttle flights. I think there was a complacency there. And yes, it's something that has to be corrected before ever one of those takes off again, but I think it was just a carelessness that grew out of success. And I think that it's time for us also to remind ourselves of the tremendous record that NASA had, and help now in the restoration of the program and their going forward, and to see that this cannot happen again. Maybe part of it was also due -I've often wondered this - if part of it wasn't due to the balmy climate of Florida and there was difficulty for anybody to believe that they had a cold snap that could render that O ring dangerous. Negligence Issue Q. Sir, if I may, in our society if an engineer of a train falls asleep at the switch, and we pursue him for negligence, if bus drivers - all through our society when people do things -even though they don't mean to kill anyone, as you've said in this case, they're brought into court if there's evidence that they've been negligent in some sort of criminal fashion. Why should these people be exempt from that kind of just review. A. Well, let me - Sam, let me plead waiting until we see the entire report, until we get a chance to read all of the testimony and everything else before making a decision. We put a man in there that we believe is going to do much. I've got to call on at least one red dress. European Tourism Q. Thank you, Mr. President and I will have a follow. Immediately after the U.S. attack on Libya, you were particularly grateful to Prime Minister Thatcher for her help in allowing the United States to let airplanes take off from the U.K. Since then, American tourists have been staying away from England and Europe in droves and Mrs. Thatcher has made a personal plea for Americans and their dollars to come back to the continent. Do you think that it's safe in Europe for Americans to return and will you tell Americans whether they ought to go overseas this summer? A. You've asked me a very tough one in my position, with what we know about the dangers throughout the world. I certainly don't want to be quoted as advocating a tourist rush in the face of the world the way it is, but I'm going to be rather bold and just tell you that our Ambassador recently had a little talk or something that was carried in The Los Angeles Times and it was to the effect that he believed that London was probably one of the safest cities in the world, and that he saw no reason for anyone to be fearful of that. Well, I have not argued with him on his making that point. Security Precautions Q. My follow then is that we also read about the extraordinary security precautions that are going to be taken for the Statue of Liberty festivities July 4. Are you concerned that perhaps that's a pretty delectable message target? A. Yes, but I also have a great deal of confidence in our security people. And I can see where they would think that that would be a very inviting target for those who hate us in the terrorist ranks and think that they might be able to embarrass us that way. Discrimination Q. Mr. President, the Agriculture Department has been severely criticized for its treatment of minorities in employment and service delivery - this, despite your saying that you would not tolerate discrimination in the Federal Government. What are you going to do about the Agriculture Department? A. Well, it's already being done by the Secretary of Agriculture. He's heard these allegations also, and as I understand it there were allegations with regard to not being as fair as they should be with regard to women employment and on a racial basis, to black employment. And the Secretary has ordered all the far-flung and various agencies of the Agriculture Department - an investigation is under way right now to see if that's true, because he absolutely has sworn that if it is he's going to correct it because he doesn't want any discrimination either. Q. What will you do to insure that these things are carried out? A. That they are what? Q. That they are carried out? A. Well, because I feel as strongly as he does about that, I'm going to be watching this very carefully. I don't want any hint or sign in our Administration that there is any kind of discrimination of that kind. And I think I've got a record that should make you willing to believe that, because as a Governor in California I eliminated a kind of quiet discrimination that had seen an unfair balance in employment, and ended up appointing more members of the minority communities to executive and policy-making positions than all the previous Governors of California put together. So yes, I'm going to ride herd on this, but I have great confidence in the Secretary of Agriculture, because he was doing this in California at the same time that I was Governor. Offer in Geneva Q. Mr. President, the Warsaw Pact are said to be offering to withdraw a million of their troops that face us in the West. For those of us with families in Europe, that sounds like a lot. I know that you always like to deal with these offers in the confidentiality of Geneva but isn't it perhaps time, bearing in mind that nothing seems to have come out of Geneva for over a year, to go with an offer like this, run with it and see what happens? A. You mean the offer that has just been given in Geneva? Q. Yes. A. Well, as I say, we - there have been offers and we have made counter-offers, much in the same thing and with pretty much the same end result as to numbers of weapons. And where we - where the difficulties seem to come in is the Soviet Union and the United States have somewhat different mixes of weapons that we believe are essential to -well, for theirs we believe theirs is based more on an offensive nature and we believe ours is based more on a deterrent idea. And so sometimes we run into difficulties then in reconciling some of the means of getting to the same number of warheads being eliminated. This has kept us from having an agreement so far. Now this last agreement has come in and we don't know yet until we see it carefully is it a response to one of our counter-offers; does it in some way change their - some of their proposals and bring us closer to a negotiated position? And this is what we want more than anything. So you can depend on it that we're going to -we're going to make every effort. But it must be fair and balanced; it must not be an agreement in which one side is trying to maintain or increase an advantage over the other. Meeting Gorbachev Q. Sir, doesn't this make it all the more important to see Mr. Gorbachev as soon as possible this year? A. That's what I'd like. In fact, we're waiting to hear when this can take place. We suggested a date and evidently it was too early for them. They didn't suggest but they spoke publicly about a possible date and that was wrong for us because of the coming political campaign. But we still - and I still - believe that he wants a summit and I want a summit and I believe it's going to take place. I'd better spread around here someplace. Q: Mr. President? A. With the red flower. Q. With the red flower or the red coat? A. Red flower. Espionage Case Q. Mr. President, the Pollard spy case has precipitated some confusion within your Administration over the matter of how much Israeli spying there is in this country and if it goes beyond the Pollards. The Justice Department officials are telling us that it goes beyond the Pollards, and they're continuing their investigation. The State Department officials have told us that there's no more Israeli spying here, and they are satisfied and they seem to want to put an end to it. I wonder if you could clear up this confusion. A. The only thing I know is that the Israeli Government has assured us as much as they can that they have never had any program of trying to get intelligence information from our country or doing spying on us, and so far, as I say, the Justice Department has said they will look to see if there is anything they can find out, but so far there's been no evidence presented to us from anyone. Evidence on Israel Q. Well, what if they do come up with some evidence? What would you do? A. Well, I think we'll have to deal with that then and find out whether it's a surprise to the Israeli Government whether someone was off playing their own game or not. Mexican Debt Q. Our Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker made an unannounced trip to Mexico this week to discuss that country's financial problems. Are you worried that Mexico might unilaterally default or - default on payments or totally default on foreign debts? A. Well, I think this is a possibility with not only Mexico but a number of other countries that are having these debt problems that are much based on the high interest rates of the past before we reduced inflation and obviously we'd like to be of help to them within the framework of the agreements that were reached in Korea by Secretary Baker. And we want to be of help as much as we can. Mexico is a next door neighbor. Our fortunes are linked on many fronts and so we want to be of as much help as we can and that was the reason for his trip. It's over already?. Why don't you ask questions that can be answered yes or no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JUSTICES UPHOLD ABORTION RIGHTS BY NARROW VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/justices-uphold-abortion-rights-by-narrow-vote.html,"A deeply divided Supreme Court today reaffirmed its landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion, which the Reagan Administration had urged it to abandon. The 5-to-4 ruling struck down a Pennsylvania law as unconstitutional, on the ground that some provisions were intended to deter women from having abortions and others would require doctors to risk the health of pregnant women to save late-term fetuses. And it appeared to curb state power to regulate abortion further than ever before. Also, Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun's majority opinion strongly rebuffed, without explicitly mentioning it, the Administration's arguments for overruling the 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade. The vote on that decision was 7 to 2. Possible Shift in Future But the narrowing margin of support for Roe, the unusually harsh dissenting opinions and, in particular, a shift in Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's position, suggested that the Court might consider reversing itself and restricting or even abandoning constitutional abortion rights if any member of the majority were replaced by a new Justice who shared the dissenters' views. While the decision today did not dramatically change the law, the five opinions by various Justices constituted the most profound and detailed debate the Court has produced on one of the nation's most divisive constitutional and moral issues. The outcome was hailed by advocates of abortion rights and denounced by anti-abortion groups. The Justice Department said the outcome was not surprising and praised the dissenters. Rights of Pregnant Women Justice Blackmun asserted, ''The states are not free, under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life, to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies.'' He said that even though ''abortion raises moral and spiritual questions over which honorable persons can disagree sincerely and profoundly,'' the Court was bound to ''apply the Constitution faithfully,'' and that ''the Constitution embodies a promise that a certain private sphere of individual liberty will be kept largely beyond the reach of government.'' ''That promise extends to women as well as to men,'' Justice Blackmun said, stressing the ''personal and intimate'' nature of a woman's decision on whether to end her pregnancy. The provisions of the 1982 Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act that the majority struck down required that doctors provide women seeking abortion with detailed information about the risks and alternatives and file detailed reports with the state for public inspection. They also required that two doctors be present at late-term abortions and that they use the method most likely to produce a live birth unless it would pose ''significantly greater'' risk to the woman. Justice Blackmun said these provisions were all based on an unconstitutional design to deter women from having abortions, and that the latter two unjustifiably required physicians to take chances with the health of the woman for the sake of the fetus. The dissenters said these provisions were consistent with the Court's holding in Roe v. Wade that states may regulate abortion in the second three months of pregnancy to protect a woman's health and in the final three months to protect the state's ''compelling interest'' in keeping alive fetuses capable of living outside the womb. Chief Justice Burger, in a significant shift, said in dissent, ''I agree we should re-examine Roe,'' even though he was one of the seven signers of Justice Blackmun's decision in that case and one of the six signers of a 1983 decision that strongly reaffirmed it. Chief Justice's New View Asserting that ''we may have lured judges into roaming at large in the constitutional field,'' he said that contrary to his original expectation, the Court had extended Roe to require ''abortion on demand'' and had virtually abandoned its original holding that states could regulate late-term abortions to protect the fetus. Associate Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist, who were the two dissenters in Roe, said today that the 1973 decision was ''fundamentally misguided'' and ''illegitimate,'' had no basis in the language or history of the Constitution, had led the Court into ''warped'' interpretations and should be overruled. Justice White suggested that ''in the name of identifying constitutional principles to which the people have consented in framing their Constitution, the Court has done nothing more than impose its own controversial choices of value upon the people.'' He said such a ''hotly contested moral and political issue'' should be ''resolved by the will of the people,'' and that ''I would return the issue to the people by overruling Roe v. Wade.'' Even if Roe was correct, he added, the Pennsylvania law was consistent with its reasoning and should be upheld as a reasonable effort to regulate abortion without unduly restricting it. ''Aware that in Roe it essentially created something out of nothing and that there are many in this country who hold that decision to be basically illegitimate, the Court responds defensively,'' he said. ''The majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that in no way contravene the right recognized in Roe.'' Justice O'Connor's Dissent Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented separately, denouncing ''the Court's unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing the regulation of abortion'' but explicitly declining to say whether she agreed with Justice White that Roe should be overruled. Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and John Paul Stevens joined Justice Blackmun's opinion. Justice Stevens said in a separate concurrence that although he had ''the highest respect'' for Justice White's views on the issue, a woman's right to choose whether to continue her pregnancy was ''more important than the will of a transient majority.'' He said the Roe decision was correct because ''it is far better to permit some individuals to make incorrect decisions than to deny all individuals the right to make decisions that have a profound effect upon their destiny.'' Solicitor General Charles Fried said at a news briefing today that the majority's implicit rejection of the arguments in his brief was no surprise, but that Chief Justice Burger's dissent was ''very significant,'' even though he ''has not stated emphatically that Roe was wrongly decided.'' Asserting that Justice White's dissent was ''one of the most remarkable and powerful statements of constitutional principle I've read in a long time,'' Mr. Fried added that ''the more deeply the Justices think about the matter, the more likely they are eventually to come to our conclusion.'' Filing by Administration His brief for the Reagan Administration, filed last July as a friend of the Court, urged the Court to overrule Roe and leave state legislatures free to allow, to regulate or to prohibit abortion as they pleased. The case, Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, No. 84-495, began as a suit by medical groups and others seeking to strike down the Pennsylvania law. Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, a leading constitutional expert who filed a brief in the case supporting abortion rights, said today that Chief Justice Burger's apparent ''retreat'' from support for Roe was ''extremely troubling'' and raised the possibility that Roe might be undermined if any member of the majority were to leave the Court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN SEES NO WIDE ISRAELI SPYING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/reagan-sees-no-wide-israeli-spying.html,"President Reagan said tonight that the Administration had no evidence that the Israeli Government had conducted widespread spying in the United States. In a nationally broadcast news conference Mr. Reagan appeared to present a public posture similar to one voiced by the State Department in an internal Administration dispute on the extent of Israeli espionage efforts in the United States. Justice Department and senior White House officials have suggested that Israeli spying efforts were broader than what emerged in the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former Navy analyst who pleaded guilty last week to spying for Israel. The Israeli Government has said it had no knowledge of the spying and attributed it to a ''renegade'' operation. Mr. Reagan's comment on the spy case followed a statement by the State Department Monday insisting that there was no evidence of any Israeli espionage ring other than the four Israelis named as unindicted co-conspirators in the Pollard case. 'No Evidence Presented to Us' The Justice Department and some White House officials had said that Mr. Pollard, as part of a plea-bargaining agreement, was supplying information that could lead to the arrest of other Israelis involved in spying. ''So far,'' Mr. Reagan said tonight, ''there is no evidence presented to us'' by anyone that Israelis were spying in this country other than those originally implicated by Mr. Pollard. ''The only thing I know is that the Israeli Government has assured us as much as they can that they have never had any program of trying to get intelligence information from our country or doing spying on us, and so far, as I say, the Justice Department has said they will look to see if there is anything they can find out,'' Mr. Reagan said. Asked what he would do, if such evidence emerged, Mr. Reagan said, ''Well, I think we'll have to deal with that then and find out whether it's a surprise to the Israeli Government whether someone was off playing their own game or not.'' Remarks on Hunger On another matter, Mr. Reagan said ''it was difficult to believe'' that people in the United States were starving because there was not enough food available to them. The remarks reinforced, but in stronger terms, Mr. Reagan's statement on May 22 that people who were going hungry lacked information about where or how to get help. Mr. Reagan also vowed to continue an Administration effort to find a ''proper way'' to assure medical treatment for handicapped infants. The Supreme Court on Monday struck down Administration regulations designed to force such treatment even when parents were opposed. In response to a question about cutbacks in financing for informational programs on nutrition, Mr. Reagan said, ''The simple truth of the matter is we are spending on nutrition more than has ever been spent before.'' He said that more than $3 billion was being provided by the Government than in 1981 and $18.6 billion overall. Mr. Reagan said that in addition to the Federal effort, which he said totaled about 93 million meals daily, the private sector was also providing assistance. ''So I think there is considerable merit for saying that it's difficult to believe that people are starving in this country because food isn't availble,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''I just, as I say, I think that in many instances the people just don't know where or how to go about it and at the same time I find it difficult also to find any cases of starvation and undernourishment.'' Appeals for Budget Support Mr. Reagan began with a brief opening statement in which he appealed to Congress to support his policy of increasing military spending and avoiding tax increases. The President, who again vowed to veto any tax increase, has proposed that Congress make more domestic spending cuts in its 1987 budget than either the House or Senate budget committees have proposed. ''Rather than make the sensible adjustments we've suggested, some in Congress apparently intend to take large and dangerous cuts out of our national defense,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''It is time for Congress to take a responsible approach to spending decisions and when it comes to taxes, let's get into the spirit of the times.'' The President said his plan to revise the Federal tax code was ''quite simply one of the best antipoverty programs, one of the best job-creation programs and one of the best pro-family bills this country has ever seen all rolled into one.'' White House officials said that Mr. Reagan had hoped to use his opening statement in a continued effort to garner support for his key remaining legislative priorities - an overhaul of the Federal income tax system, the $100 million aid package for Nicaraguan rebels, and the $320 billion request for military spending in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1st. On Tuesday, while meeting with the Republican Congressional leadership, Mr. Reagan indicated that he opposed any Senate attempt to amend the tax legislation, including the effort led by three conservative senators to link the bill to an effort to restrict abortions. The Senators, Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, William L. Armstrong of Colorado and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, would deny tax-exempt status for hospitals where abortions are performed and charities that finance abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reagan Seems to Mix Supreme Court Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/reagan-seems-to-mix-supreme-court-cases.html,"At his news conference tonight, President Reagan seemed to mix up two decisions by the Supreme Court. In both cases, the Court refused to accept the Administration's arguments. But the cases involved substantially different legal issues. Mr. Reagan was asked about a decision today in which the Court, by a margin of 5 to 4, strongly reaffirmed its landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right of access to abortion. The decision struck down a Pennsylvania law as unconstitutional, partly on the ground that it was designed to deter women from having abortions. However, in his answer, the President discussed a case in which the Supreme Court on Monday invalidated Federal regulations that were designed to require life-prolonging treatment for newborn infants with severe physical or mental handicaps. Many opponents of abortion supported the Administration's ''Baby Doe'' rules because, they said, the rules would have guaranteed that doctors and hospitals show respect for the value of the lives of handicapped infants. Mr. Reagan said the Court's objection to the rules on handicapped infants was not based on ''what we were trying to accomplish.'' Rather, he said, the Court appeared to conclude that the Federal Government, by invoking the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to protect such infants, was ''getting into something that properly was the province'' of the states. ''If our Constitution means anything,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''it means that we, the Federal Government, are entrusted with preserving life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Well, where do we draw the line?''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MARGIN OF VOTE IS CALLED KEY TO ABORTION DECISION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/margin-of-vote-is-called-key-to-abortion-decision.html,"Advocates of a woman's right to choose an abortion fervently applauded what they saw as today's reaffirmation of that right by the Supreme Court. But there was nervousness in their satisfaction because the Court's majority upholding that position has shrunk from seven of the nine Justices who favored it 13 years ago to the barest minimum in today's ruling. That considerably eased the disappointment of anti-abortion groups, who said that although they may have lost a battle today they made a strategic gain. ''The thing that jumps out at you is that it's a 5-to-4 decision,'' Douglas Johnson, the legislative director of the National Right-to-life Committee, said by telephone from the anti-abortion group's national convention in Denver. ''That's very significant,'' he said. ''We're very encouraged by that. We're just one vote away from a Court which may be prepared to abandon Roe vs. Wade.'' In that 1973 ruling the Court basically upheld the principle that women are free to chose whether to have an abortion. Today's decision struck down a 1982 Pennsylvania law, never in effect because of legal challenges, that placed controls on abortions. Both sides said the decision focused renewed attention on the future composition of the Court. The decision ''demonstrates once again how much is riding on the next appointment to the Supreme Court, by whomever made,'' said Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, who along with 82 other members of Congress had filed anti-abortion briefs in the case. Focus on Appointments ''It will take new people on the Court to make a difference,'' said Dr. John Willke, president of the National Right-to-Life Committee. Some of Dr. Willke's opponents attached special import to the fact that Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who had voted for a woman's right to choose an abortion in 1973 and again in a follow-up 1983 case, this time dissented. Anti-abortion forces ''will now count the Chief Justice as an ally'' and will redouble their efforts, said Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University. He filed briefs in the Pennsylvania case favoring abortion rights. Nevertheless, abortion rights groups savored what they saw as a triumph. ''This is a tremendous pro-choice victory'' and ''an absolute rejection of the Reagan Administration's request to the Court to overturn that landmark decision'' of 1973, said Janet Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project. Intimidation at Issue The Court ''has told state legislatures that they cannot use their power to harass and intimidate women who seek abortions,'' said Kathryn Kolbert, a Philadelphia lawyer who argued for abortion rights before the Court. She is associated with the Women's Law Project and represented a group of plaintiffs led by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In his majority opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun also stressed that the basic liberty at stake in private decisions extends to women as well as men. Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said, ''This decision goes beyond Roe in that the Court has recognized the inseparable link between the right to choose abortion and the ability of women to enjoy the personal liberties guaranteed all Americans under the Consititution.'' The anti-abortion forces seemed undaunted. State Representative Stephen Freind, a sponsor of the law struck down today, said he was confident that this state will be the first to outlaw abortion. ''You can bet the house on that,'' he said. ''There are no such things as defeat when you're pro-life,'' Mr. Freind said. ''There are only temporary setbacks.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE STAGE: 'KATHY & MO,' A COMEDY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/13/theater/the-stage-kathy-mo-a-comedy.html,"WHEN we first see Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney, of ''The Further Adventures of Kathy & Mo,'' they are standing in a spotlight and giggling nervously. The light blacks out a second or two later, and the audience is left with an unresolved question. Are these young women laughing at themselves, laughing at us, or both? Ninety minutes later the answer remains inconclusive. ''Kathy & Mo,'' a two-woman comedy recital at the Second Stage, is a not untalented enterprise, but it's often at odds with itself. The performers, actresses from San Diego who write their own material, can't always decide whether they're unsparing satirists or smug public scolds. At their intermittent best, the women emulate the methods and themes of Lily Tomlin without precisely imitating her. Miss Gaffney, the more accomplished verbal and physical mimic of the pair, contributes a devastating, wordless sequence in which she enacts (without props) a woman's morning hygiene-and-cosmetics ritual. Not afraid to find satire in the humiliations of the flesh, Miss Gaffney turns eyebrow tweezing and dental flossing, among many other more punishing diurnal activities, into a brutal marathon of masochism. While the sketch's feminist object lesson in the dehumanizing packaging of women is hardly new, the dramatization of that lesson is mercilessly, bleakly funny. There are some other pungent bits as well. In one of them, the actresses play aspiring New York musical-comedy performers - a homosexual man (Miss Gaffney) and an overweight female singer (Miss Najimy) beaten down by the audition circuit. The couple, best friends who have all but given up hope of finding sexual companionship, bide their time by working in one of those bars where the waiters also serve as entertainers. But neither character's career or private life is going anywhere. At the sketch's end, Miss Najimy, having clobbered an appropriately despairing song (''Little Lamb'') at the microphone, disappears into the restroom to contemplate her face and self-delusions in the pasty wee hours' light. The messages of these routines bleed through the evening. ''Kathy & Mo'' consistently condemns a culture that treats female bodies as ''valuable commodities'': many of the characters are either obese or bulimic women who've been tortured by the feminine ideals of Vogue and Seventeen. The show is equally fervent in its support of lonely singles (men and women, hetero- and homosexual) who face constant rejection in their search for spiritual fulfillment. These unobjectionable views don't square, however, with the mean-spiritedness that keeps undercutting the show's ostensible ecumenism. Two recurring characters - middle-aged women with seemingly New York Jewish accents - are patronizingly camped up as vulgar morons. (One wears hideous rhinestone-studded glasses, both are prone to malapropisms.) Worse, this clownish pair is enrolling in women's studies at a college that teaches such classes as ''women in performance art.'' What follows is a series of unfunny running gags that mock doctrinaire feminism with little of the insider's intelligence or compassion that enliven Miss Tomlin's treatment of the same subject. ''Kathy & Mo'' can be just as humorless and pious as its feminist targets, in any case. A sketch presenting marital domesticity as a television game show is deadly in its didacticism. A lengthy chronicle of two Roman Catholic girlhoods never makes the characters distinct but instead tries to work up a Pavlovian audience response by sentimentally invoking generic soap-opera traumas (abortions, obesity, et al.) Two sketches featuring heterosexual couples - collegiate dates in Act I, middle-aged Texas barflies in Act II -settle for caricaturing the women as abject victims out of old Shirley MacLaine movies and the men as leering dolts. Don Scardino has directed ''Kathy & Mo'' with his customary skill, but he hasn't been able to coach Miss Najimy's impersonations of a little girl and a man into credibility. Nor has he edited out the mirthless passages - whether they be entire sketches, stray bum lines (take the Phil Donahue jokes, please!) or unneeded thematic annotations (Billy Joel's ''Just the Way You Are'' all too ironically underlines the morning ablutions sketch). Still, the real refinements needed are those that the authors must think through on their own, and, given their promise, should. One hopes for further adventures of ''Kathy & Mo'' in which the title characters are as hard on themselves as they are on almost everyone else.

NOW MARKS 20TH YEAR AMID A STRATEGY DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/13/us/now-marks-20th-year-amid-a-strategy-debate.html,"The National Organization for Women will celebrate its 20th anniversary here this weekend at an annual convention expected to draw about a thousand delegates. But the celebration comes at a difficult time of transition for NOW. The organization is trying to reverse a decline in membership, build support among younger women and develop a new political strategy that will give it both independence and influence. At the same time, the group is faced with persistent questions about its strategy and its relevance to the average American woman. Its recent tone has been set by Eleanor Smeal, elected president last year with a pledge to take the organization ''back to the streets.'' While some analysts argue that NOW needs to broaden its agenda, which has focused on abortion rights, Mrs. Smeal contends that the right to abortion is under serious assault and has brought a new militance to its defense. She led mass marches for abortion rights this year in Washington and Los Angeles and began a new litigation strategy this week directed at halting what she described as a ''reign of terror'' by protesters at abortion clinics. The convention begins at the Radisson Hotel here Friday. The National Right to Life Committee is holding its annual convention six blocks away. ''We're not hiding in the hotel,'' said Mrs. Smeal, who is to lead a march and rally Satuday for abortion rights. Arrest Is Applauded The two groups so far have kept a wary distance. But NOW's national board erupted in applause this morning when it was announced that a prominent abortion protester, Joseph Scheidler, had been arrested here. Sgt. George Masciotro of the Denver police said Mr. Scheidler was arrested at 12:30 A.M. today as he was checking into the downtown hotel where the anti-abortion group is holding its convention. The sergeant said the police had acted on a warrant issued in March by the authorities in Pensacola, Fla., where Mr. Scheidler was charged with burglary in connection with a disturbance at an abortion clinic. Dr. John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said Mr. Scheidler was not ''part of our convention.'' But he added that the timing of the arrest ''was interesting to say the least.'' Workplace Concerns In recent years, NOW has probably been most prominent for its defense of the right to abortion and its unsuccessful efforts to win ratification of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution. ''It has a proud place in history, and no one can take that away,'' said Betty Friedan, one of the founders of the group. But Miss Friedan and others have argued that NOW needs to place greater emphasis on issues central to American women today, particularly child care programs and job leaves for parents to care for newborn or ill children. ''The question to me is whether NOW will move to these questions or stick to an agenda that was necessary for the last 10 years but doesn't necessarily go far enough for the next 10 years,'' Miss Friedan said. This argument has been spurred by the recent publication of the book ''A Lesser Life,'' in which Dr. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist, contends that American women lag behind their counterparts in Western Europe in terms of benefits for pregnancy and child care. In an interview, Dr. Hewlett said that such issues ''are not at the top of the agenda'' of NOW. Mrs. Smeal said criticism of her organization is ''normal,'' but rejected the notion that it has neglected child care and pregnancy concerns. ''We are people who have been on the front line with these issues,'' she said. Call for Action Mrs. Smeal was elected to a two-year term at last year's convention after a bitterly contested race with the incumbent, Judy Goldsmith. Mrs. Smeal said a mass mailing campaign had stabilized membership at 150,000, down from a peak of 220,000 in 1982. She predicted the number would begin to climb this summer. Since Mrs. Smeal took over, the organization has kept a determined distance from the Democratic Party, a sharp change from its policy in the 1984 elections. Under Mrs. Goldsmith, the group gave an early endorsement to Walter F. Mondale in his bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and later demanded that he name a woman as his running mate. He subsequently chose Geraldine A. Ferraro, who became the first women nominated by a major political party to run for Vice President. In the view of many Democratic leaders, the party's close identification with such interest groups as NOW was a factor in its landslide defeat. Mrs. Smeal said the organization ''went along with the establishment of the Democratic Party'' in an attempt to defeat President Reagan, ''and it didn't work.'' Both Parties Criticized No Democratic Presidential hopefuls have been invited to speak at this weekend's convention, and Mrs. Smeal was critical of both parties. ''Neither, really, is vigorously defending our rights,'' she said. ''Both are willing to scapegoat us, both are willing to cave in on these issues.'' While feminists have more supporters among Democrats, she added, ''There is too little vigor from the Democrats, and too many Democrats who are willing to tell us that we have to go to the right, that they have to get the Southern white male, that it was the blacks and the women and the progressives that caused their defeat in 1984.'' Mrs. Smeal said she viewed it as ''imperative'' that the women's movement stay politically independent, arguing, ''We're going to have to depend on ourselves.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN TERMED 'VERY UPSET' THAT HE CONFUSED QUESTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/13/us/reagan-termed-very-upset-that-he-confused-questions.html,"President Reagan was described by a White House official today as ''very upset'' over his performance at nationally broadcast news conference Wednesday night, when he misunderstood two questions. The problem, the official said, was Mr. Reagan's intention to select reporters whom he usually ignores and use a cue card to pick the names of correspondents. ''He was concentrating on logistics, not on the questions,'' the official said. He said that in a briefing before the news conference, Mr. Reagan asked Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, ''Why do I always call on the same people?'' Mr. Reagan habitually calls on the news service and then network television correspondents seated in the front row facing him, and then other reporters. Inevitably, Mr. Reagan looks for a familiar face, but he sometimes calls on strangers or off-beat reporters or people wearing red, his favorite color. 'Wasn't Happy at All' It was decided to give Mr. Reagan a three-by-five-inch card with the names of several correspondents he had not called on, as well as notations on where they were sitting. As a result, ''he wasn't giving his usual concentration to the questions,'' the White House official said. Mr. Reagan confused two questions. Asked about the Supreme Court ruling Wednesday on abortion, he replied with a discussion of an earlier decision on handicapped infants.

TAX BILL KEPT INTACT IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/13/business/tax-bill-kept-intact-in-senate.html,"With a sizable majority of senators opposing all amendments to the tax-revision bill whatever the merits, the Senate today warded off proposals dealing with sales tax deductions, abortions and consumer interest. ''Everybody has religion now,'' said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat. The bill, which would sharply reduce tax rates and eliminate many tax deductions and other tax preferences, now seems certain to pass without significant change before the end of next week. One of the most disputed elements of the bill, its denial of deductions for state and local sales tax payments, was set aside without a recorded vote when senators who wanted to allow those deductions saw they would be defeated handily. Issue of Abortion Omitted The chief sponsor of a proposal to deny tax-exempt status to hospitals and other charitable organizations involved with abortions was persuaded by President Reagan not to offer the amendment. And, after several hours of spirited debate, a proposal to prevent home-owners from using tax-deductible mortgage loans to finance other purchases was withdrawn before it came to a vote. At one point, the bill's floor manager, Senator Bob Packwood, spoke forcefully against removing a tax shelter for oil and gas investors from the bill even though he said he did not think the shelter was justified. Mr. Packwood, an Oregon Republican, said he had ''made an ironclad commitment to stand firm against any amendments that would undercut the greater good of the amendment.'' Development of Majority The solid majority against all consequential amendments developed after the Senate's narrow rejection Wednesday night of an amendment that would have retained tax deductions for all Individual Retirement Accounts. The first proposal to retain deductions for state and local sales taxes was rejected this afternoon by a voice vote. Its sponsor, Senator Alan J. Dixon, an Illinois Democrat, said afterward that he did not ask for a recorded vote when he realized the amendment would fail badly. The bill as it stands now would permit full deductions for state and local income and real estate taxes but would allow no deductions for sales taxes. The companion bill passed by the House of Representatives last December would retain deductions for income, property and sales taxes. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who supports sales tax deductions, opposed efforts to retain them in this bill because he said he did not want to jeopardize the overall legislation. Last month Governor Cuomo challenged Mr. Moynihan on that point, but the Governor subsequently relented and agreed to leave Congressional strategy to the Senator. Tonight, Senator Daniel J. Evans, a Washington Republican, proposed a two-part amendment. The first part would have allowed taxpayers to choose between deducting state and local sales tax or income tax payments. That would have primarily benefited taxpayers in Connecticut and seven other states that have sales taxes and little or no income taxes. The second part of the Evans amendment would have disallowed deductions for the interest payments on second mortgages that were taken out to finance purchases other than homes. The Senate bill would permit deductions of mortgage interest but not of interest on other loans. Some senators see this as a loophole. After a long debate, Mr. Evans withdrew his amendment, conceding that it could not pass. The Senate went on to approve, 76 to 21, a ''sense of the Senate'' resolution urging its delegates to the Senate-House conference on the bill to put sales tax deductions in the final bill. Such resolutions often have little effect. For example, the Senate voted Wednesday, 96 to 4, to instruct the Senate conferees to support the ''maximum possible tax benefits'' for I.R.A.'s. Afterward, Senator Packwood, who will head the Senate conferees, said he felt no obligation to back full deductions for retirement accounts. The House bill would retain deductions for all I.R.A.'s, but the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., said today that he was not sure that was such a good idea. ''It's a mighty loophole for the wealthy of America,'' said the Speaker, a Massachusetts Democrat, whose views could be influential when the conference committee meets. The Senate also defeated tonight, by a vote of 77 to 20, an effort by Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican of Connecticut, to remove from the bill a particular tax break for investors in oil and gas exploration. It would be one of the few tax shelters allowed by the bill. Senators from oil-producing states argued that, without the exception, investment in petroleum exploration would dry up and that the result would be devastating to the country's already suffering oil region. Senator Weicker disagreed. ''I wasn't for an exception for New England when oil prices were high,'' he declared, ''and I'm not for an exception for the oil industry when oil prices are low.'' The tax rule in question would allow certain investors in unsuccessful drilling operations to continue to use their losses to offset their other income for tax purposes. Senator Packwood said several members of the Finance Committee had insisted on the rule as a condition for voting the bill out of the committee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION FOE SEES HOPE INMORTALITY OF JUSTICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/14/us/abortion-foe-sees-hope-inmortality-of-justices.html,"The Rev. Pat Robertson, in a sharp attack on the Supreme Court, said today that opponents of abortion could look to the ''wonderful process of the mortality tables'' to change the composition of the Court and bring about a reversal of its latest decision on abortion. The television evangelist, a potential Republican Presidential candidate, drew rousing applause at the National Right to Life Committee's national convention here as he denounced the Court's 5-to-4 decision on Wednesday reaffirming a constitutional right to abortion. Mr. Robertson described the Justices as ''despots'' who had turned the Federal Constitution into ''a sentence of death.'' The tone of Mr. Robertson's remarks was in stark contrast to the more temperate speech delivered later in the day by Representative Jack F. Kemp, Republican of upstate New York, another Presidential hopeful. Mr. Kemp received four standing ovations and was repeatedly interrupted by applause as he recited the legislative victories to restrict abortion that his side has won in recent years. He made only a passing reference to the latest Supreme Court decision. Kemp Outlines Strategy In his remarks, Mr. Kemp urged the anti-abortion forces to broaden their movement by supporting economic and social policies to ''foster stronger family life and to build stronger communities.'' Legal battles alone will not win the fight against abortion, he said, adding, ''We need not just a change of law, but a change of heart.'' On Wednesday the Court struck down as unconstitutional a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion. Mr. Robertson said he saw ''a silver lining'' in that decision in a suggestion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger that the time had come for the Court to review its landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. ''That means with the wonderful process of the mortality tables only one more is needed to get a judicial reversal'' of the 1973 decision, Mr. Robertson said, referring to the prospect that death or retirement could create a vacancy on the Court before President Reagan leaves office. A few blocks away, where the National Organization for Women was holding its convention, Eleanor Smeal, the group's president, responded to Mr. Robertson attack on the Court. ''Neither ministers nor Elie Smeal knows the date of anyone's departures,'' she said in response to questions at a news conference. ''It's not chronological all the time.'' Referring to anti-abortion activists, she said, ''Obviously, these folks are not for euthanasia - you know that. They won't allow anyone to pull anything.'' Prospect of a Reversal Mrs. Smeal acknowledged that the Supreme Court decision on abortion might not stand up after Mr. Reagan's next appointment to the Court. ''It is shocking how close we are to losing legal abortion and birth control,'' she said. At the news conference, Mrs. Smeal harshly criticized attempts to outlaw abortion. ''The Fascists in Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy and in Japan in the pre-World War II period all outlawed abortion,'' she said. ''They have always promoted population growth. They have always promoted no rights for women.'' Mr. Robertson's language in attacking the Supreme Court majority was in line with the reaction of other anti-abortion leaders at the convention. Dr. J. C. Willke president of the Right to Life group, said Thursday that as long as Mr. Reagan was in office, there was a possibility of a reversal of the Court's position on abortion. ''The votes to maintain abortion are those five old men,'' Dr. Willke said. ''But time is on our side and everything is moving our way.'' ---- Protest Marks NOW Session DENVER, June 13 (UPI) - Anti-abortion protesters today marked the official start of the National Organization for Women's 20th annual conference with a noisy demonstration at an abortion clinic in which 21 people were arrested. Demonstrators at the Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood clinic said they were trying to block the door of the clinic to ''stop these babies from being killed.'' Leaders of the National Right to Life Committee, meeting six blocks away from the NOW conference, said the protesters were not associated with their group. Leaders of both the Right to Life and the NOW delegations have said that they hope to avoid confrontations between their groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Must Mr. Reagan Tolerate Abortion Clinic Violence?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/14/opinion/must-mr-reagan-tolerate-abortion-clinic-violence.html,"President Reagan's affable tolerance of anti-abortion violence threatens more than the women who need abortions and the doctors who perform them. It threatens the fabric of civilized society. The Administration's failure to condemn in any but the mildest words those who have bombed and set fire to abortion clinics has given these tactics respectability - even as some anti-abortion leaders have begun to shrink from the results of their own harsh words. In a National Right to Life newsletter in February, the organization's president, John C. Wilke, issued a fervent appeal to the abortion clinic bombers. ''Don't do it,'' he said, arguing that bombing clinics will ''hurt our cause.'' Mr. Wilke has also been quarreling editorially with radical anti-abortion leaders Paul Brown and Joseph Scheidler, who have been trying to get Mr. Reagan to pardon the abortion clinic bombers. But Mr. Wilke's concerns seem largely tactical. Further, he ignores the fact that his own inflammatory rhetoric contributes heavily to the atmosphere of violence. Mr. Wilke presides over an organization and a publication that regularly portrays doctors and other professionals involved with abortion services as ''murderers.'' The newsletter's review of my textbook ''Abortion Practice'' called it ''Nazi-style medicine.'' Mr. Wilke and other anti-abortion leaders regularly use words like ''violence'' and ''butchery'' to describe what goes on in abortion clinics. Meanwhile, Mr. Reagan honors men like Mr. Wilke and Mr. Scheidler with invitations to the White House. Mr. Scheidler, confident that he has the most popular man in America on his side, goes forth to harass women, doctors and others connected with abortion with the most abusive language imaginable. Mr. Scheidler stood on the sidewalk in front of my office last Oct. 21 and 22 calling me a ''murderer . . . hit man . . . paid executioner.'' During the next two weeks, I received a half dozen threats on my life. We had several bomb threats, and the harassment continues every day. In a recent brief survey of abortion clinics and physicians belonging to the National Abortion Federation, I found that 30 percent of the 150 respondents had experienced serious violence (including total destruction of facilities, sometimes more than once); 26 percent have been visited by Mr. Scheidler; 45 percent have experienced increasingly aggressive harassment, frequently associated with his visits; 35 percent have lost insurance coverage; and 26 percent have received death threats or bomb threats or both. A live bomb was delivered to a Portland, Ore., clinic in December, and three more were found in the city's postal system the same day. More than 40 abortion clinics and doctors' offices have been firebombed since Mr. Reagan took office in 1981. A Toledo, Ohio, clinic was burned down on May 20. A Wichita, Kan., clinic was bombed June 9. At a national conference of anti-abortion activists in Appleton, Wis., held in 1985, participants wore buttons saying ''Have a Blast.'' Members of Mr. Reagan's Administration have said that there is no national conspiracy to terrorize abortion service providers. Those of us who are providing abortion services think otherwise. Having a brick hurled through the window of a doctor's waiting room where patients sit may seem like small potatoes, but it's terrorism. Listening to the police tell you that you must now drive home a different way each night and check the mail and your automobile for bombs is frightening. An obscene death threat at 3 A.M. is terrorism. It is even more frightening to know that this kind of activity receives the tacit support of a powerful Government. The scheduled speakers at this week's National Right to Life meeting in Denver included Senate majority leader Bob Dole, Representative Jack Kemp and and the Rev. Marion G. (Pat) Robertson, the television evangelist. All are contenders for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination. Mr. Wilke's sanctimonious appeal to the bombers is self-serving and hypocritical. Anti-abortion activists are plainly using terrorism, subversion and repression to interfere with the provision of abortion services. We are being terrorized by Mr. Reagan's followers, and we are terrified. Death threats in the night and bombs are real and dangerous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STATE TO HALT MEDICAID FOR SOME PREGNANT YOUTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/nyregion/state-to-halt-medicaid-for-some-pregnant-youths.html,"The Cuomo administration is planning to halt Medicaid assistance for abortions and prenatal care for young women with family incomes above the poverty line. The decision will drop as many as 4,000 pregnant women a year from the Medicaid rolls. The plan requires no legislative approval and is expected to take effect late next month. It is expected to save the Federal, state and county governments $6.1 million annually. Under current state regulations, pregnancy is the only exception by which someone financially dependent and under 21 years of age can qualify for Medicaid without family income being taken into account. Pregnant women under 21 and living with their parents now qualify for Medicaid as long as the woman's own income is below the poverty line. The exception, intended to give needy teen-agers immediate access to prenatal care, has allowed as many as 4,000 young women to get Medicaid cards to finance abortions and prenatal care even if their parents' income surpassed the poverty level of $7,400 for a family of four. Most of those women use Medicaid for prenatal care rather than abortions, according to the State Department of Social Services. Praise and Criticism The revision has drawn praise from groups that oppose abortions and criticism from groups that favor a woman's right to have an abortion. The plan eliminates controversial language in the agency's regulations that allowed young women to apply for benefits by citing the unborn child, without reference to the ability of the woman's parents to pay the medical costs. ''The applicant was the fetus, the girl was the parent,'' said Cesar A. Perales, Commissioner of the Social Services Department. That language was unacceptable to groups that favor abortion rights because it presumed that the unborn child was a person. And it was nettlesome to opponents because it allowed benefits won in behalf of the unborn child to be used to abort it. The executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City, Alfred Moran, said his organization would lobby vigorously against the revision. He said to advance ''the idea that the state is paying for abortions for daughters of millionaires is an attempt to distort reality.'' He said the revision would force some teen-agers, who might be unable to consult their parents, into delayed and unsafe abortions or into giving birth to children they were unprepared to care for. But Mr. Perales said that Medicaid benefits were intended to help only the most impoverished families and that women ineligible under the new statute could get assistance through programs with less stringent requirements run by the State Health Department. ''My primary concern is the integrity of the Medicaid program,'' Mr. Perales said, ''to make sure we don't invite fraud and abuse.'' There were also these developments in Albany this week: Power of Attorney Banks would be required to honor a short form concerning power of attorney, under the terms of a bill given final legislative approval by the Senate. The forms are often used by people who represent an elderly relative or client. The bill is intended to help elderly New Yorkers conduct their financial dealings more easily, according to State Attorney General Robert Abrams, who requested the legislation in response to complaints by consumers about banks' refusal to recognize the forms. The legislation now goes to Governor Cuomo. Banks often require that their own forms be used, and some banks require a written statement from a physician attesting to the competency of the individual who executed the power of attorney, Mr. Abrams said. Chemical Spills Legislation intended to prevent a chemical accident like the one in Bhopal, India, two years ago was introduced by Mr. Abrams and key legislators. The bill would require businesses to identify potential hazards at their sites, start programs to reduce the hazards and start emergency preparedness plans to respond to accidents. Under the bill, violators could face a maximum fine of $25,000 for a civil offense and $50,000 for a criminal offense. A criminal violation would be a Class E felony carrying a maximum prison sentence of four years for failure to notify officials of a chemical accident. Potassium Iodide In response to the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union, two proposals were offered to alter the dispensing of potassium iodide, a chemical used to block radiation in a nuclear spill. One plan, proposed by Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, would ban over-the-counter sales of the drug except in nuclear emergencies, to prevent unnecessary use and to protect people allergic or sensitive to the drug. The other, introduced by Assemblyman Eliot L. Engel, a Bronx Democrat, would require the State Commission of Disaster Preparedness to stockpile potassium iodide pills for distribution in an emergency. The Federal Food and Drug Administration currently permits the over-the-counter sale of the drug to allow consumers immediate access in an emergency. The drug is intended to be used before or four hours after exposure to radiation. Student Aid College tuition aid and eligibility requirements would increase under a bipartisan agreement announced by key legislators this week. Under the bill, the top annual grant in the Tuition Assistance Program would rise to $2,850 from $2,700 for dependent undergraduate students and to $2,000 from $1,800 for those who are independent. For graduate students, the maximum grant would double from the current $600 a year to $1,200. Dependent undergraduates could qualify for aid with a family income of up to $32,000 a year, compared with the current $29,000 maximum. Undergraduates who claim financial independence could earn up to $10,000 a year and still qualify for tuition aid, up from $5,666 under current law. Teen-Agers in Taverns A bill that gained final approval by the Senate would allow children under age 16 into bars and taverns unaccompaniesd by their parents if no alcoholic beverages were served. The measure is designed to allow establishments with liquor licenses to sponsor dances and other events for young people without violating the law. The bill was sent to Governor Cuomo, who has advocated methods to steer teen-agers away from alcohol abuse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOW MARCHES IN SUPPORT OF THE RIGHT TO ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/us/now-marches-in-support-of-the-right-to-abortion.html,"Members of the National Organization for Women, holding an annual convention here this weekend, marched through the streets today in support of legal abortion. The crowd was awash in purple and white, the colors of the women's suffrage movement. They wore banners that read ''March for Women's Lives,'' and such buttons as ''Another Mother for Choice'' and ''I'm Pro-Choice and I Vote.'' Led by the president of NOW, Eleanor Smeal, the group rallied at the State Capitol, not far from where the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee was holding its annual convention. That group had its own Capitol rally earlier this week. As the NOW marchers and their supporters reached the Capitol, they were greeted by a small group of abortion protesters shouting ''Abortion is murder'' and ''Baby-killer!'' The protesters focused their attention on Mrs. Smeal and others at the head of the march who, over the angry anti-abortion chants, were singing ''We shall not be moved.'' The marchers chanted, ''Not the church/Not the state/Women shall decide their fate,'' and ''Right to Life/ Your name's a lie/You'd let women die.'' NOW and Right to Life leaders have said they hoped to avoid confrontations during their meetings here, and leaders of the anti-abortion organization have disavowed any connection with groups picketing the NOW delegates. ''You're beautiful,'' Mrs. Smeal said as she looked out over the crowd at the Capitol, which the police estimated at 2,500 to 3,000 people. ''And there is absolutely no question that the vast majority of Americans are with us today.'' She added: ''We're on a roll. We won't be intimated. We're not going back.'' Mrs. Smeal repeated earlier calls for greater involvement by the Federal law-enforcement authorities in investigations of violence at abortion clinics. ''We want the Department of Justice to defend women's health centers,'' she said. ''But if they don't, we will.'' At a news conference earlier, Mrs. Smeal denounced the fire this morning at a St. Louis health center offering abortion services, in which the police suspect arson. There, she said that while some of her members worried that the march would lead to confrontations with abortion protesters, she was determined to proceed. ''We are doing nothing wrong,'' Mrs. Smeal said. ''We are exercising free speech.'' Comparison to Blacks Earlier She compared the situation of low-income women seeking abortions at such clinics to that of blacks trying to exercise constitutional rights in the 1950's and 1960's. Mrs. Smeal, her voice rising, told reporters: ''We are really defending modern life practices. People do practice birth control. Women do have abortions.'' ''There is a reign of terror against women who are trying to live a modern life,'' she added. The NOW convention, at which the organization is celebrating its 20th anniversary, also heard from Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado. She assailed the Justice Department for its treatment of clinic violence, saying, ''Somehow, they do not see this as terrorism.'' The Congresswoman added, referring to the Attorney General, ''Giving Ed Meese the authority to protect women's rights is like turning your car over to Evel Knievel and telling him to watch it.'' ----Fire at Missouri Clinic MANCHESTER, Mo., June 14 (UPI) - A flammable liquid was used to start a fire that caused an estimated $100,000 in damage to a health clinic in this St. Louis suburb, fire officials and the clinic's director said. No one was injured in the early-morning blaze. Arson investigators are looking into the fire at Reproductive Health Services, which provides abortions. Judith Widdicombe, the executive director, said officials had told her that a flammable liquid had been used to start the fire outside the waiting room door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LOS ANGELES ARCHBISHOP LEADS DRIVE TO AID HISPANIC CATHOLICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/us/los-angeles-archbishop-leads-drive-to-aid-hispanic-catholics.html,"At a time when the National Conference of Catholic Bishops is moving to ask for changes in the nation's economy to aid the poor, the Archbishop of the country's largest archdiocese has issued a sweeping call to social activism in behalf of the Hispanic majority of his pastorate. In recent days the Archbishop, Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, has personally set the activist tone in a variety of ways, calling for opposition to the Government's plan to evict illegal aliens from public housing, asking Roman Catholics to picket stores that sell pornography and moving to help pregnant unmarried teen-agers. Fifty thousand Hispanic Catholics, in what was billed as the largest such assembly in American history, turned out June 1 at Dodger Stadium at the invitation of Archbishop Mahony in recognition of the large Hispanic presence in the archdiocese. The gathering officially initiated a five-year plan aimed at focusing the power of the church in a concerted advocacy for Hispanic Catholics. The plan includes proposals for tuition and day-care assistance to families, aid to the homeless and immigrants, and help for the jobless and youths in gangs. Reputation as Activist Archbishop Mahony was elevated to his post last September after gaining a reputation as an activist for Hispanic rights as Bishop of Stockton in California's farming region. In recent weeks he has embraced controversy as he has put his activist philosophy into play in the sprawling three-county Los Angeles Archdiocese. Membership of the archdiocese, consisting of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, is officially put at 2.6 million, but the Rev. Joseph Battaglia, a spokesman, said that because estimates of the number of illegal aliens in the region were believed to be unreliable, the figure might be as high as 3 million. More than half the membership, and perhaps as high as two-thirds, is Hispanic, according to the archdiocese, but in recent years large numbers have become inactive in the church or have been won over to evangelical Protestant denominations. Late last month the National Conference of Catholic Bishops released the third draft of a key pastoral letter terming employment a basic right. The pastoral letter is set for final consideration by the full 300 members of the conference in November. Admiration and Criticism Archbishop Mahony, at the age of 49 the youngest archbishop in the United States, is generally known as a liberal on social issues and a conservative on church doctrine. He has drawn criticism from some lay Catholics for his emphasis on the needs of the poor but admiration for what others call his innovative and energetic leadership. ''There are no illegal aliens in the Catholic Church,'' the Archbishop declared recently in announcing that the archdiocese would sponsor a group to help Hispanic Catholics fight a Reagan Administration housing policy requiring all residents of federally subsidized public housing over the age of 18 to have proof of citizenship or legal immigrant status. The policy calls upon the Department of Housing and Urban Development to begin eviction procedures July 30 for those who do not qualify under the policy, but this week the House passed a bill that would permit aliens already residing in public housing to remain. The Archbishop has thrown his support behind efforts by the United Neighborhood Organization, an influential Hispanic community group in Los Angeles, to amend the policy to apply only to future residents and to win a reprieve for current residents who are in this country illegally. ''The church has a mission to respond to the immediate needs of the people who are already there,'' Father Battaglia said. ''The Archbishop is saying, 'Don't throw them out, where are they going to go?' '' Support for Pregnant Teen-Ager The Archbishop is firm in his support of the Pope's opposition to abortion. But two weeks ago he evoked consternation among some Catholics by intervening in the decision of a Catholic school in Los Angeles to bar a pregnant unmarried teen-ager's participation in the school's commencement ceremony. Some Catholics said the move gave the appearance of condoning unwed pregnancy. Because the Archbishop overruled a policy of the parochial schools of the archdiocese, the teen-ager, Lisa Martinez, a 17-year-old honor student at Mary Star of the Sea High School in San Pedro who is six months pregnant, was graduated with her class at the ceremonies June 6. The Archbishop held that the church should support pregnant girls who resist ''the pressure to conform to the unacceptable abortion option'' and ordered the policy revised. Last month, in a departure from tradition, the Archbishop publicly blessed 14 pregnant unmarried teen-agers at St. Anne's Maternity Home in Los Angeles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SOUTHERN BAPTISTS ARE FACING A SCHISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/weekinreview/southern-baptists-are-facing-a-schism.html,"SOUTHERN BAPTISTS have long been the victims of Northern misconceptions. Lumped in with the fundamentalist tide that swept the nation during the 1970's, the Southern Baptists were often seen as resisting modern culture, science, social programs. In fact, the opposite was often true. But over the last eight years the fundamentalist tide has swept over the Southern Baptists too. Last week, the election of Adrian Rogers, a riveting Memphis preacher, as president at the Southern Baptist Convention's annual meeting put the fundamentalists in arm's reach of finally taking over the 14 agencies and 6 seminaries that do the denomination's work of winning converts, training pastors and publishing tracts. The Southern Baptist seminaries turn out pastors who conduct widely recognized scholarly research. Southern Baptists run soup kitchens, shelter the homeless and send food to Africa. Until a few years ago, the denomination opposed prayer in public schools and its moderate officials asserted that abortion should be allowed in some cases. But after watching power slip from their hands during the three-day meeting last week, the moderates wonder how long they can protect their activities and ideological positions. The fundamentalists, who hold that the Bible is without error and must be interpreted literally, first captured the 14.4 million-member denomination's presidency in 1979. They have won it each year since, though they have only gradually gained influence in the seminaries and agencies. Their latest victory, however, may be a cresting of power rather than a step in an inexorable ascent, given underlying currents that could provide some comfort to moderates. Nancy T. Ammerman, a professor of the sociology of religion at Emory University here, has surveyed 1,000 Southern Baptist pastors and lay people and predicts that the fundamentalists' ranks will thin. The fundamentalist surge, Professor Ammerman says, was largely due to the turmoil many people experienced in venturing to the South's booming cities. She said some found refuge in the fundamentalist certainties of repentance, salvation and an unerring Bible. But many, she suggests, will grow more comfortable with urban life and with the diversity that is a strong Baptist heritage. In the meantime, though, the fundamentalists, with a well-organized political apparatus, a growing old-boy network and several magnetic leaders, will begin wielding true power. This year they could capture a majority on the Home Mission Board, whose activities contributed to the 351,071 baptisms and the establishment of 675 new churches last year. A touchy issue has been the board's support for women as military and hospital chaplains. In the Southern Baptist system, individual churches can ordain anyone they believe has a calling, and 250 women are now pastors. But fundamentalists like Mr. Rogers oppose the ordination of women. Those with the most to lose are the moderates in the seminaries, whose boards the fundamentalists could control within a year or two. ''Those who teach the New Testament take their lives in their hands because of the rigid position these people have taken,'' said Kenneth Chafin, a professor at Southern Seminary in Louisville, Ky. Fundamentalists reply that their control of the seminaries would not mean wholesale firings. Professor Ammerman said, however, that fundamentalist-run seminaries might require a professor to sign a stricter statement of faith than is now sought or to submit book lists for approval, and that many professors might choose to leave. And while Baptist principles have long encouraged separation of church and state, the denomination might now promote the political goals of the religious right. ''You'd have to be some kind of blind man not to see that,'' said James M. Dunn, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, a Washington lobbying group of nine Baptist denominations. Like many, he was struck by a letter from President Reagan, asking for help in ending abortion and restoring prayer in the schools, that was read after Mr. Rogers's victory. Mr. Dunn in particular may pay for his views. Fundamentalists angered by his resistance to prayer in schools came close to ending Southern Baptist participation in his lobbying group. They will probably try again next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ABORTION IS AFFIRMED, BUT IN A LOWER VOICE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/weekinreview/abortion-is-affirmed-but-in-a-lower-voice.html,"THE Reagan Administration, which has been more aggressive than any recent predecessor in pushing its political agenda in the Supreme Court, met with two sharp setbacks there last week, in cases that raised profoundly divisive moral and ideological issues. A narrow majority of the Court, spurning a highly unusual Administration request that it reverse itself and allow states to ban abortion, strongly reaffirmed its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that the Constitution guarantees a right to abortion. The Court also struck down the Administration's ''Baby Doe'' rules, which were designed to prevent parents and doctors from allowing severely handicapped newborn infants to die. The vote to strike down a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion was 5 to 4. Because only two of the dissenters explicitly rejected the view that the Constitution protects abortion, the vote did not necessarily mean that four Justices would now allow states to prohibit abortions. But it the margin of support for abortion rights was narrower than at any time since the Roe case was decided by a vote of 7 to 2. At the same time, the majority curbed more severely than ever before a state's power to regulate abortion, striking down some provisions resembling laws that the Court had previously upheld. Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist, the two dissenters in the Roe case, said last week that it should be overruled. The two other dissenters, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, did not go as far. But Chief Justice Burger did shift his position significantly. A somewhat hesitant member of the original Roe majority who has dissented from what he considered unwarranted extensions of that decision, he said for the first time that ''I agree we should re-examine Roe.'' Justice O'Connor denounced the reasoning of Roe, as she had in a 1983 opinion, along with ''the Court's unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing the regulation of abortion.'' But she declined to say whether she would overrule Roe fully. Her opinions seem ambiguous on whether states should be free to ban most abortions. It is thus clear that the Court would allow states to restrict abortion - but unclear whether it would allow them to ban abortion - if President Reagan replaced any of the five majority Justices with someone who shared his views. Even if Roe were overruled, some states would presumably allow abortion, as New York and a few others did before 1973. In striking down Pennsylvania's ''informed consent'' requirement and other provisions last week, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote in the majority opinion that some of them were designed to ''intimidate women into continuing pregnancies.'' The dissenters said the law would pose no real obstacle to women seeking abortions. Justice White accused the majority of responding ''defensively'' by indiscriminately striking down regulations that were consistent with Roe. In the ''Baby Doe'' case, the Court ruled that a 1973 law barring discrimination against the handicapped did not give the Federal Government the authority to intervene in sensitive decisions by parents under doctors' advice or to ''conscript'' unwilling state agencies as ''foot soldiers in a Federal crusade.'' Justice John Paul Stevens's plurality opinion was hostile to what medical groups described as ''Federal Baby Doe squads'' descending on hospitals to investigate alleged discrimination against handicapped newborns. But the Court left open the possibility of some Federal role. And a 1984 Act of Congress, which was not before the Court, directs state child protective agencies that receive Federal money to take steps to prevent ''withholding of medically indicated treatment'' from handicapped newborns. Another Social Policy Defeat Last week's decisions followed the Court's unanimous and somewhat reproachful rejection of the Administration's effort to block thousands of mentally ill New Yorkers from suing the Government for cutting off disability benefits. This has not been a winning month for Solicitor General Charles Fried, whose argument that the Court should overrule Roe was not supported by the State of Pennsylvania, but he hopes to fare better in some important cases to be decided before the term ends in late June or early July. He said in an interview that the Administration's role in the abortion case was ''useful and proper'' and may have contributed to the Court's consideration of ''fundamental issues.'' Noting that the Court had agreed with the Administration's reasoning in some significant cases this term, Mr. Fried said, ''If they agreed with us every time, then I think that would be a fair sign that I was really only telling them what they thought already, and that wouldn't be much of a conversation.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 G.O.P. ASPIRANTS GIVE HINT OF '88 STRATEGIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/us/2-gop-aspirants-give-hint-of-88-strategies.html,"When his turn came, Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York did not try to match the passion of the Rev. Pat Robertson's earlier speech attacking the latest Supreme Court decision reaffirming the right to abortion. Instead, Mr. Kemp, addressing a gathering of the nation's largest anti-abortion organization, called for both political action and tolerance, saying the battle against abortion had to be won in the court of public opinion and not just in the court of law. The performances of these two Republican Presidential hopefuls revealed much about their political strategies as they compete for the support of conservative activists. Both received rousing receptions Friday at the annual convention of the National Right to Life Committee. The three-day meeting ended today after hearing from a third potential Republican Presidential candidate, Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Robertson's message, laden with scorn for the Justices he denounced as ''despots,'' brought the convention to its emotional high pitch and demonstrated his ability to move an audience. But despite the television evangelist's challenge, Mr. Kemp's claim to strong support among anti-abortion activists appeared unshaken. He received four standing ovations, and many in the audience held up signs saying, ''Kemp '88: Keep Our Cause Alive.'' At a news conference, Mr. Kemp said one of his major concerns was that he not become branded as candidate of narrow interests as he tries to mobilize groups such as anti-abortion activists around his prospective campaign. ''I plan, if I become a candidate in 1988, to try to appeal to as broad a segment of my party and of the country as possible,'' he said. ''I'm not going to limit myself to the potential of just being a narrow-based candidate.'' Mr. Kemp's strength with anti-abortion activists comes from what one leader of the movement called his ''unassailable'' voting record and his sponsorship of major pieces of legislation to curb legal abortion. Carolyn Campbell, founder of Iowans for Life, said Mr. Kemp ''seems to have a fire about him, and he's spent a lot of time with our people.'' Mr. Dole told the gathering he was not concerned by his critics' suggestions that he was ''pandering'' to opponents of abortion. ''It's a little late for that,'' he said. ''I've been voting with them for 13 years.'' The Senate leader, like Mr. Kemp, was restrained in criticism of the Supreme Court and urged the group to help Republicans keep control of the Senate confirmation process for judicial nominees. Since 1981, he said, ''We've confirmed judge after judge who meets your standards.'' Anti-abortion activists are a significant part of the religious right that Mr. Robertson hopes to mobilize behind his candidacy, should he decide to run. But Mr. Kemp's strategists contend that the Congressman will wind up with substantial support among evangelical and fundamentalist Christians when they focus on the question of whether Mr. Robertson can win an election. Dr. John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said in an interview that Mr. Robertson was ''a very credible national figure.'' But he added, ''The big question is would he be electable, and that's not something I'm asking publicly at this time.'' Dr. Willke, a Cincinnati physician, said most of the probable Republican contenders for 1988 held positions on abortion that would make them acceptable to his group. He said Vice President Bush still went beyond the committee's position, which sanctions abortion only when the life of the mother is in danger. Mr. Bush also tolerates abortion of pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. ''He's very supportive of our goals,'' Dr. Willke said. ''If his position were adopted, the number of annual abortions in this country would go from 1,550,000 to less than a thousand.'' Mr. Bush was forced to cancel his scheduled appearance at the convention to travel to Canada. But before leaving on that trip, he met privately with Dr. Willke and other anti-abortion leaders in Washington.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIBERTY AND AUTONOMY FOR ALL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/books/liberty-and-autonomy-for-all.html,"GENDER JUSTICE By David L. Kirp, Mark G. Yudof and Marlene Strong Franks. 246 pp. Illinois: University of Chicago Press. $19.95. HERE is a book about sexual equality that supports collective bargaining for ''comparable worth'' wage equity; that supports sex-neutral cash grants to the parents of young children and opposes government supervision of the private lives of the recipients; that supports vigorous government efforts against discrimination in employment; that opposes the exemption of women from jury duty and perhaps even from combat duty in the armed forces. Feminists will probably welcome ''Gender Justice'' - but not necessarily. The authors - David L. Kirp of the Graduate School of Public Policy and the School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley; Mark G. Yudof, the dean of the University of Texas Law School, and Marlene Strong Franks, a policy analyst and Ph.D. candidate in public policy at Berkeley - insist that American institutions are constitutionally and morally obligated to promote the equality of the sexes. But they argue that sexual equality should not be understood as requiring any particular social outcome: the state should not try to make men and women indistinguishable in their public and private lives, any more than it should try to preserve ''natural'' differences in men's and women's roles. Rather, the aim of public policy should be to insure a maximum of free choice for each man and woman. In a modern state, virtually every area of public policy has implications for the position of men as men and women as women in society. This book considers a wide variety of policy issues: taxes and social security, bank credit and abortion, family policy and labor law. What gives it an admirable clarity and unity is its insistence on free choice as a yardstick of justice. Formerly, choices for women were few. Women were sharply limited in the ways they could earn a living; they were excluded altogether from many aspects of public life. But American attitudes and American laws have changed dramatically in recent decades. Today's work force is more sexually integrated, and today's home life less bound by convention, than ever before. What is the cause of the inequalities that remain? ''Naturalists'' claim it is biology: sex is destiny. Hence naturalists of the New Right demand a return to traditional roles for women and men, while idiosyncratic naturalists like Ivan Illich and Germaine Greer celebrate the ''authenticity'' of feudal or preindustrial life. Feminists, meanwhile, blame inequality on male oppression. ''Gender Justice'' rejects both the naturalist and the feminist explanations as oversimplified and misleading. Some discrimination against women persists, but the authors suggest that choices by women also contribute to the inequality of the sexes. Women, for example, are less likely than men to finish college, and more likely to seek jobs that are compatible with being a traditional wife and mother at home. While the state has a clear responsibility to prevent discrimination, this book insists that public policy should respect the choices of ''traditional'' as well as ''nonconventional'' women. Equality should mean individual autonomy, in other words, but not necessarily that men and women must become alike as groups. Applying this principle to the question of affirmative action, the authors support wide recruitment for jobs and scrutiny of ''neutral'' hiring standards to make sure they really are neutral. But ''Gender Justice'' opposes quotas. Quotas stigmatize their beneficiaries and detract from the principle of individual choice by presuming in advance to know how many women and men will want one sort of job. Numerical ''goals too easily become ends in themselves, and there is no apparent reason to make proportional representation the aim.'' OF course, people can disagree about how to apply the principle of individual choice, especially to morally complex problems like affirmative action. But it is not just the application of the principle in this book that will trouble some feminists. Liberty itself, the authors argue, requires the preservation of a private sphere of life in which people can make intimate choices without public interference. It is an idea that goes back to John Stuart Mill and to Isaiah Berlin's ''negative liberty'' - the basic freedom from being pushed around. This principle is at odds with an article of faith among many feminists that there should be no distinction between private and public: ''the personal is the political.'' The most radical feminists are surprisingly suspicious of free choice. ''No woman should be authorized to stay home to raise her children,'' said the late Simone de Beauvoir. ''Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one.'' This outlook is deeply foreign to ''Gender Justice.'' ''Gender Justice'' has the rarity value of being a book about public policy that is literate, jargon-free and even entertaining. The authors make a fascinating case for a gender policy centered on personal liberty. Freedom of choice rightly appeals to most Americans, whatever the reservations of some naturalists and some radical feminists. ''Gender Justice'' does have very little to say about the problems of illegitimacy and family breakdown that increasingly plague the underclass in this country. But perhaps these are problems of public justice, or of cultural leadership, that transcend the specific question of gender justice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING; The Moving Pen Writes,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/16/us/briefing-the-moving-pen-writes.html,"Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court seems to enjoy ferreting out and noting in his opinions what he considers inconsistencies in the positions of both his colleagues and the Justice Department. In Wednesday's abortion decision, he was the only member of the Court who made any mention at all of Solicitor General Charles Fried, author of the Administration's brief urging the Court to reverse itself and rule that states may prohibit abortion. Mr. Fried is the Government's top lawyer before the Supreme Court. Justice Harry A. Blackmun's majority opinion ignored Mr. Fried's brief, while implicitly rejecting its arguments and reaffirming that a woman's right to choose abortion is part of the ''liberty'' protected by the Constitution. Justice Stevens, in a concurring opinion, also ignored Mr. Fried's brief. But he did quote from Mr. Fried's scholarly writings as a Harvard Law professor before he joined the Administration. In a 1978 book, Mr. Fried wrote, ''What a person is, what he wants, the determination of his life plan, of his concept of the good, are the most intimate expressions of self-determination, and by asserting a person's responsibility for the results of this self-determination we give substance to the concept of liberty.'' And in a 1977 article, he cited the ''moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole.'' Justice Stevens, in quoting these statements, indicated that they supported the Court's view that the Constitution bars society from telling women they cannot terminate their pregnancies. Mr. Fried has made it clear that he does not see it that way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING; Justice Under Scrutiny,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/16/us/briefing-justice-under-scrutiny.html,"In the wake of the Administration's narrow defeat in the Supreme Court in its effort to curb abortions, public television will broadcast an hourlong special early next month maintaining that the Justice Department has become highly politicized under Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, possibly to the detriment of evenhanded enforcement of the law. The program, ''Justice for All, a Special Report on the Meese Justice Department,'' is scheduled for airing on Public Broadcasting System stations in the nation's top ten television markets July 2 and July 8. Written and narrated by Fred Graham, for 15 years judicial correspondent for CBS News, the program includes extensive footage of normally private staff meetings and other behind-the-scenes material. In one scene, President Reagan appears at a staff meeting with a rotatable paperweight in front of him that reads ''Yes,'' ''No,'' ''Maybe'' and ''Scram.'' He doesn't use the device. In an interview, Mr. Meese candidly concedes that the Justice Department under his stewardship ''vigorously implements the President's philosophy,'' but insists that it nonetheless remains ''fiercely independent.'' Others on the program disagree, among them Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who served as Attorney General under President Johnson. Mr. Katzenbach says he does not ''believe that the law supports what the Attorney General and his colleagues are doing.'' Benno C. Schmidt Jr., president-designate of Yale University, who has been dean of Columbia University Law School, goes even further, maintaining the department caters to ''ideological soulmates on the right wing.'' He described the department's approach to the adminstration of justice as ''radical and reactionary.'' But President Carter's attorney general, Griffin B. Bell, suggests that the Justice Department, like Mr. Dooley's Supreme Court, simply follows the election returns. ''That's why you have elections,'' says Mr. Bell, noting that President Reagan carried 49 states in 1984. Because the Justice Department allowed cameras in normally private meetings, PBS said that it had previewed the film for any transgressions of law such as pretrial publicity that could influence a pending case, but ''found none.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; ABORTION CLASH IN DENVER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/16/us/reporter-s-notebook-abortion-clash-in-denver.html,"Their paths crossed little, if at all, and when they spoke to each other, it was generally through reporters. But the National Right to Life Committee and the National Organization for Women, separated by about six blocks and a world view, transformed this city into a vast debating hall over the weekend. The topic was abortion. Each group was here for its annual convention and each asserted that political momentum was on its side. Dr. John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said there was a ''tidal'' movement in the country against legal abortion, despite ''wishful thinking down the street.'' Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, countered, ''The more attention they call to this issue, the more our numbers will just multiply.'' The debate was sharpened by outside events - the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision last week striking down a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion, and attacks on clinics offering abortion services in Wichita, Kan., and in a suburb of St. Louis. Both Sides Are Encouraged Mrs. Smeal hailed the Court's decision as one that expanded women's rights to abortion, but she acknowledged the narrowness of the vote. Anti-abortion activists were ''elated'' by the one-vote margin and particularly by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's statement that the Court's 1973 abortion decision should be re-examined, Dr. Willke said. NOW leaders responded angrily to the attacks on abortion clinics and called for greater Federal efforts to protect such clinics. Mrs. Smeal also assailed what she described as widespread harassment of clinic patients by protesters. ''This could be your daughter being chased out of an examining room, your wife or your loved one,'' she said. Dr. Willke said he would like to see peaceful picketing at every ''abortion center'' to inform patients of the consequences of abortion and the alternatives. But he said his group had repeatedly denounced violence, which he described as ''terribly damaging to our movement.'' NOW had a varied agenda, dealing with matters ranging from child care to pornography, but the abortion issue was never very far away. A small group of anti-abortion demonstrators, who said they were not affiliated with the National Right to Life Committee, were on hand when the feminist group began its convention Friday. As many women arrived at their hotel that afternoon, they were met by a sidewalk preacher shouting, ''Repent, NOW, repent and be the women God intended you to be!'' Nearby were a handful of pickets, one of them a man shouting over and over again, ''Twenty million dead babies!'' Most of the NOW members ignored the picketing, but many expressed anger. ''I'm a mother of six,'' Dorothea Sewter of Blackwood, N.J., told a reporter. ''Do I look like a baby-killer to you?'' Dr. Willke said that to avoid confrontations, everyone who registered at his group's convention had been advised not to picket during the session. He also said exhibitors had been asked to sign an agreement not to use their booths to promote outside events. The agreement also said, ''Exhibitors may not advocate any illegal acts or violence.'' ''This is the most peaceful, middle-class group of people you'll ever find in your life,'' Dr. Willke said. He said the extent of the police presence for his convention was ''comical.'' There were children at both conventions. At the NOW child-care center, 9-year-old Xochi said she had come with her mother from Austin, Tex. She said she knew all about the National Organization for Women. ''It's a good organization to help women get their rights,'' she said. ''Women are stuck up in the kitchen. Men can be in the kitchen too.'' The National Right to Life Committee convention included workshops solely for teen-agers on topics such as ''public relations'' and ''lobbying and political activities.'' Both groups had exhibits. At the NOW convention, there were booths ranging from one on ''Financial Planning for Women'' to one offering a cookie cutter in the shape of the circle-over-cross symbol for women, yielding cookies ''great for consciousness-raising at work, P.T.A. meetings, church suppers, fund-raisers or holiday gatherings.'' At the Right to Life Committee's meeting there were booths on ''Children's Pro-Life Art and Science Activities'' and several tables offering literature such as ''Abortion Clinics: An Inside Look.'' Three aspirants for the Republican Presidential nomination addressed the Right to Life Committee: the Rev. Pat Robertson, who is a television evangelist; Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. The group's program included a message of support from President Reagan. Across town, Mrs. Smeal said her group had decided not to invite any of those seeking the Democratic nomination because NOW wanted to be politically independent. ''We've been there,'' she said, referring to the group's involvement in behalf of Walter F. Mondale in the 1984 campaign.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BATTLES PAST AND FUTURE BLEND AT NOW'S PARLEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/us/battles-past-and-future-blend-at-now-s-parley.html,"The National Organization for Women held a historical T-shirt contest at its annual convention here last weekend, as part of the celebration of its 20th anniversary. Members showed up in faded shirts that were resonant of past battles, won and lost. Many of the shirts hearkened back to the unsuccessful effort to win passage of an Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution, including one that read, ''E.R.A. - The Dream Will Never Die.'' Other women wore the shirts of 1984, including one bearing the smiling face of Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, with the simple slogan, ''Finally!'' Throughout the convention, which adjourned Sunday night, it was clear that memories of those past battles hang heavily over the organization. What they have produced, in a chord struck repeatedly by NOW's president, Eleanor Smeal, is a sharp independence. ''We know something we maybe didn't know a few years ago,'' said Mrs. Smeal. ''We're going to have to depend on ourselves.'' In a strongly worded keynote address, Mrs. Smeal recited a litany of problems, internal and external, confronting the feminist group. She denounced as ''revisionist history'' the charge that NOW has failed to aggressively push for child-care and pregnancy benefits, a criticism that particularly rankles the group. And she ridiculed the notion that the country was in a ''post-feminist era,'' adding: ''Some powers that be want us to go out of business. They wish they were in a post-feminist era.'' Need to Erase Debt She acknowledged that the organization was in debt, and declared, ''We must become obnoxious in our fund raising.'' And she asserted that NOW would not be an ''auxiliary or arm'' of any other movement. In some ways, this push toward political independence is born of necessity. After the Democrats' overwhelming defeat in 1984, many party leaders attributed much of the blame to the party's close identification with interest groups, including NOW, which gave an early endorsement to Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential nominee, and later pressed him publicly to name a woman as a running mate. Many feminists, on the other hand, felt the Democratic Party had not done enough to advance their causes, and reacted angrily to what they viewed as post-election ''finger-pointing.'' Bridge-building to the Republican Party is unlikely, with Mrs. Smeal regularly denouncing the Reagan Administration on a host of issues. Coalition-building with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has courted a variety of disaffected Democrats, is a possibility that was discussed here. But Mrs. Smeal, while praising Mr. Jackson, said, ''We don't want to be an arm of anybody.'' At the convention, a resolution was introduced to investigate the possibility of from a new political party, but the session adjourned before delegates could vote on it. Mrs. Smeal said she neither pushed nor opposed the resolution. ''We know what some of the realities are,'' she said. ''But I still think there is a lot of desire for something different.'' While the organization considered its political strategy, it reaffirmed its committment to activism on several issues. The convention approved a strong resolution on abortion rights, calling for litigation against ''terrorist activities'' at clinics, the creation of a strike force to ''systematically track activities of anti-abortion extremists,'' and the continuation of demonstrations and conferences on the issue. Stance on Abortions The group also vowed to fight any abortion-related referendums on the ballot this year that would restrict ''a woman's right to choose.'' While NOW has long been on record in support of child care, it passed another resolution calling for ''full public funding'' of such programs. It also called for continued commitment to ending wage discrimination based on sex and race, and improvement of the rights of women in marital property laws. Mrs. Smeal, who has one year to go in her term, said she viewed the convention as an affirmation of her policies, including her active defense of legalized abortion through lawsuits and demonstrations. ''We know we have to do it,'' she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Editorial Notebook; The Abortion Dialogue at Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-the-abortion-dialogue-at-court.html,"''I have always had the highest respect for his views on this subject,'' wrote Justice John Paul Stevens of his colleague Byron White. The subject was abortion; the occasion was the Supreme Court's reaffirmation of 1973's Roe v. Wade, and that opening remark was a sure sign that Justice Stevens was about to blast Justice White. Their exchange, drowned out in the day's news, was the Court's liveliest in print in years. They are normally the coolest of judges. Justice Stevens may vote ''liberal'' much more often than Justice White, but their tough-minded intellectualism often makes their votes hard to predict. This time they pulled no punches. ''At times Justice White's rhetoric conflicts with his own analysis,'' said Justice Stevens in complaining of his colleague's dissent. Here, he said, was Justice White conceding that a woman's decision about an abortion is ''a species of liberty'' - yet voting against that liberty. Justice White replied that treating this liberty as ''fundamental'' was to indulge personal, not constitutional values, and refusing to protect ''those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb.'' ''Quite wrong,'' Justice Stevens shot back. The Court, he said, has consistently held that reproductive decisions are for the individual, not the state. ''If Federal judges must allow the state to make the abortion decision, presumably the state is free to decide that a woman may never abort, may sometimes abort or, as in the People's Republic of China, must always abort if her family is already too large.'' Justice White scorned the majority's view that state and individual interests can change over time, that a woman's liberty is due more deference early while the state's interest in preserving ''potential life'' gains force later in pregnancy. Justice Stevens said Justice White had a powerful ''theological argument,'' but insisted that the Court should deal only in ''secular interests.'' To which Justice White replied that ''a state cannot avoid positions that may correspond to some religious beliefs and contradict others.'' That, he said, is just why courts should defer to legislatures. What can the nation learn from such heated but obviously sincere debate? Perhaps only that there won't be any knockout punches if these two heavyweights can't deliver them. The only clear loser of their debate was Attorney General Edwin Meese, who keeps asking for a ''jurisprudence of original intent'' that hews to the Founding Fathers' precepts. As Justice White wrote: ''This Court does not subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possibly be limited to the 'plain meaning' of the Constitution's text or to the subjective intention of the Framers.'' Justice Stevens concurred. Another lesson is that principled and vigorous discussion of this issue is still possible. Since American society is unlikely to vote a respite from the abortion battle, let the passions be sublimated in this kind of sharp but civilizing debate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feminism's Next Challenge: Support for Motherhood,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/opinion/feminism-s-next-challenge-support-for-motherhood.html,"The most urgent problem facing modern American women is reconciling the demands of childbirth and child rearing with those of earning a living. For them, conditions are onerous and getting worse. We live in a society where 60 percent of working women have no right to job-protected maternity leave. Most women do not work for pin money: they need to hang on to their jobs to buy groceries and pay the rent. We live in a society where 75 percent of working women are either single mothers or are married to men earning less than $15,000 a year. And we live in a society where half the babies under one year of age have mothers in the workplace but where, perversely, Federal funds for day care assistance have been cut by 25 percent since 1980. Women take a nose dive when they become mothers. Pregnant workers are routinely fired; others are defined as ''new hires'' when they come back to work after childbirth and lose seniority rights; and large numbers of new mothers fail to find affordable child care and are forced to take a third-rate job with short hours close to home. Overall, women lose 20 percent of their earning power in the immediate aftermath of childbirth. American feminism has given short shrift to issues of motherhood and children. For many early leaders of the women's movement, ''family'' was part of the problem, not part of the solution. In the late 60's and early 70's, feminists were trying to escape the boundaries of traditional domestic roles. The focus of the struggle was to win formal equality of rights between the sexes - to get out there and clone the competitive male model. Many of the battles that were fought by feminists in the 70's were important. We did manage to break down barriers and open up the marketplace, and women gained new access to jobs, education and credit. But as we dressed for success in our business suits and little string ties, we tended to forget that 90 percent of women choose to have children at some point in their lives and that women would remain seriously handicapped in the workplace unless we established a new system of family supports. Most other Western democracies provide elaborate family supports so that working women are not derailed by childbirth. In Europe, the average maternity leave is five months at full pay. In France, 90 percent of 3-year-olds spend their days in Government-sponsored pre-schools. In Sweden, parents can opt for a six hour workday until a child is 8 years old. In Italy, working women receive two years' credit toward seniority every time they give birth to a child. Partly because of these family supports, European women have done better in the labor market. In Sweden and Italy, women earn approximately 80 percent of the male wage; in France, West Germany and Britain, 70 percent. All over Europe, women have steadily increased their earning power in recent years. Not so in the United States: here women still earn 64 percent of a man's wage, as they did in 1939. European feminists got it right when they decided to push not only for equal rights in the sphere of work but also for benefits and services to ease the family responsibilities of working women. Women need more than equal treatment. Swimming in the mainstream and taking your chances doesn't produce equal results if you are bearing and rearing children in your spare time. Equal access to jobs and education has to be supplemented by family support systems if women are to improve their economic position. Eleanor Smeal, who was re-elected to the presidency of the National Organization for Women 10 months ago, has passionately reaffirmed the movement's commitment to two central goals - the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion. She is putting a large part of the organization's scarce resources into a campaign to ''move the issue of the E.R.A. back onto the front burner of our national agenda,'' and has just begun a large-scale offensive to collect one million petitions to win passage of the amendment in Vermont. In my view, this demonstrates poor judgment. Even Judy Goldsmith (president of NOW between 1982 and 1985) has described the organization's further pursuit of the amendment as ''an exercise in futility.'' As for abortion, we simply have to widen the pro-choice agenda. Let us demonstrate on the streets and fight for the benefits needed to do a better job for the children we choose to have. Let us march in Washington for prenatal care, maternity benefits, job-protected parental leave and high-quality child care. The fastest growing segment of the labor force consists of mothers with preschool children. Easing the lives of working mothers, insuring a better start in life for children - these are among the central problems of our age. Put them at the top of the feminist agenda, and the movement will have a new lease on life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE SUPREME COURT: DECISIONS IN THE OVAL OFFICE; SELECTION PRAISED BY G.O.P. SENATORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/the-supreme-court-decisions-in-the-oval-office-selection-praised-by-gop-senators.html,"Republican leaders of the Senate today praised President Reagan's selection of Justice William H. Rehnquist to become Chief Justice of the United States and predicted that he would be easily confirmed. But some Democrats said they had ''grave doubts'' about what they described as Mr. Rehnquist's ''extreme right-wing views,'' and they vowed to scrutinize his record very carefully before deciding whether to support his nomination. Mr. Reagan's intention to nominate Judge Antonin Scalia to replace Mr. Rehnquist as an Associate Justice stirred less controversy, in part because his views on many issues are not well known. In addition, lawmakers from both parties said that Judge Scalia's reputation for intellectual brilliance would mute criticism from senators who disagreed with his conservative rulings. Lawmakers differed on what impact the two nominees would have on the Supreme Court, should both be confirmed. Senator Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, said that both men share the conservative views of Chief Justice Warren Burger and added: ''I don't think the balance of the court will be changed.'' But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who serves on the Judiciary panel, said both nominees are ''more conservative'' than Justice Burger, and predicted that they would pull the court to the right. The Senator described the retiring Chief Justice as ''a moderate with conservative leanings,'' and he mentioned Mr. Burger's support for the decision that legalized abortion in 1973. Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California, the chairman of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, agreed with Senator Hatch and explained: ''On balance, this change will likely result in a more conservative court.'' Mr. Edwards expressed doubts that the shift would alter the Supreme Court's view toward abortion. ''But due process, affirmative action and the rights of individuals against the government may suffer,'' he said. The Californian also predicted that a Rehnquist court would produce more decisions that were hostile to civil rights advocates and that would ''hurt the rights of women, minorities and the handicapped.'' From a political standpoint, the choice of Judge Scalia drew praise from Italian-Americans in both parties. Senator Pete V. Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, called the nomination a ''magnificent tribute'' to Americans of Italian origin, and Representative Mario Biaggi, a Bronx Democrat, added: ''Of course, there is a special pride I feel as an Italian American. Our community has always asked for consideration based on merit.'' The Republican reaction to Mr. Reagan's surprising announcement was led by Bob Dole, the majority leader, who said ''I can think of no finer choice'' than Justice Rehnquist to replace Chief Justice Burger. Senator Cranston called the timing of Justice Burger's retirement ''very interesting.'' As a result, he added, it would be more difficult to delay action on the nominations until the end of the Congress, should a surge of opposition develop in the weeks ahead. Many lawmakers have noted that if the Democrats regain control of the Senate in November's election, one of the primary results could be greater trouble for judicial nominations in Mr. Reagan's final two years in office. Many lawmakers were cautious today about passing judgment on the two selections, but Senator Cranston said he was particularly concerned about how Justice Rehnquist might perform as the chief administrator of the Supreme Court. ''The question is: can a man, who has an extreme right-wing ideology, manage the court in a fair and balanced way?'' the California Democrat said. The developments regarding the Court were greeted with dismay by some feminist and liberal groups. Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, said that Mr. Rehnquist ''has consistently been against the women's rights and feminist position in a whole host of cases.'' Conservative groups, on the other hand, were generally elated. ''In my view, Mr. Burger was a transition figure, from the radical activism of the Warren court to the principled restraint of the Rehnquist era,'' said Patrick B. McGuigan, director of the judicial reform project for the Free Congress Foundation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIFE IN THE 30'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,"DOMINUS vobiscum. Et cum spiritu tuo. These are my bona fides: a word, a phrase, a sentence in a language no one speaks anymore. Kyrie eleison. Confiteor dei. I am a Catholic. Once at a nursing home for retired clergy, I ate lunch with a priest 90 years old, a man who still muttered the Latin throughout the English mass and ate fish on Fridays. When he learned how old I was, he said with some satisfaction, ''You were a Catholic when being a Catholic still meant something.'' What does it mean now? For myself, I cannot truly say. Since the issue became material to me, I have not followed the church's teaching on birth control. I disagree with its stand on abortion. I believe its resistance to the ordination of women as priests is a manifestation of a misogyny that has been with us much longer than the church has. Yet it would never have occurred to my husband and me not to be married in a Catholic church, not to have our children baptized. On hospital forms and in political polls, while others leave the space blank or say ''none of your business,'' I have no hesitation about giving my religion. We are cultural Catholics. I once sneered at that expression used by Jewish friends at college, only because I was not introspective enough to understand how well it applied to me. Catholicism is to us now not so much a system of beliefs or a set of laws but a shared history. It is not so much our faith as our past. The tenets of the church, which I learned as a child, have ever since been at war with the facts of my adult life. The Virgin Birth. The Trinity. The Resurrection. Why did God make me? God made me to know Him, to love Him and to serve Him in this world and to be happy with Him forever in the next. I could recite parts of the Baltimore Catechism in my sleep. Do I believe those words? I don't know. What I do believe are those guidelines that do not vary from faith to faith, that are as true of Judaism or Methodism as they are of Catholicism: that people should be kind to one another, that they should help those in need, that they should respect others as they wish to be respected. And I believe in my own past. I was educated by nuns, given absolution by priests. My parents were married in a Catholic church, my grandfather and mother buried from one. Saturday afternoons kneeling on Leatherette pads in the dim light of the confessional, listening for the sound of the priest sliding back the grille on his side. Sunday mornings kneeling with my face in my hands, the Communion wafer stuck to the roof of my dry mouth. These are my history. I could no more say I am not Catholic than say I am not Irish, not Italian. Yet I have never been to Ireland or Italy. Some of our Jewish friends have returned to the ways of their past, to Shabbat without automobiles and elevators, to dietary laws and the study of Hebrew. We cannot do the same. There is no longer a Latin mass, no communion fast from midnight on. Even the inn is gone from the Bible; now Mary and Joseph are turned away from ''the place where travelers lodged.'' The first time my husband and I went to midnight mass on Christmas Eve in our parish church, we arrived a half-hour early so we would get a seat. When the bells sounded 12 and the priest came down the center aisle, his small acolytes in their child-size cassocks walking before him, the pews were still half empty. We were thinking of a different time, when the churches were packed, when missing mass was a sin, when we still believed that that sort of sin existed - sins against rules, victimless sins. There are more families coming to that church now, families like us with very small children who often have to leave before the Gospel because of tears, fatigue, temper tantrums. (I remember when I was growing up my family's parish church was shaped like a cross, and one of the short arms was for the women with babies. It had a sheet of glass walling it off and was soundproof. And through the glass you could see the babies, as though in a movie with no audio, their little mouths round, their faces red. Inside that room the noise was dreadful. But missing mass was a sin.) I think perhaps those families are people like us, people who believe in something, although they are not sure what, people who feel that in a world of precious little history or tradition, this is theirs. We will pass down the story to our children: There was a woman named Mary who was visited by an angel. And the angel said, ''Do not be afraid'' and told her that though she was a virgin she would have a child. And He was named Jesus and was the Son of God and He rose from the dead. Everything else our children learn in America in the late 20th century will make this sound like a fairy tale, like tales of the potato famines in Ireland and the little ramshackle houses with grape arbors on hillsides in Italy. But these are my fairy tales, and so, whether or not they are fact, they are true. I was born a Catholic and I think I will die one. I will ask for a priest to give me extreme unction, as was given to my mother, and to her mother before her. At the end, as in the beginning, I will ask for the assistance of the church, which is some fundamental part of my identity. I am a Catholic. =",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toward a Rehnquist Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/opinion/toward-a-rehnquist-court.html,"With two unambiguous Supreme Court nominations, President Reagan has done what he said he'd do, what his warmest supporters hoped and strongest foes feared he'd do. Permitted to name a new Chief Justice, he chose William Rehnquist, once a lonely dissenter on the Court's extreme right wing. And to fill the vacancy he picked Antonin Scalia of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, who most closely promises the judicial philosophy of the President. The nominees are not only of like ideology; both are skilled and energetic. These able lawyers would not be our choices for the Court, but it was Ronald Reagan's landslide. The Senate must carefully weigh their appointments, but given the nominees' qualifications, we assume confirmation. Given that assumption, the Court will have a noticeably different look, with a sharper and younger profile for its conservative wing. Whether the Court immediately speaks with a different voice is another question. Over the 17 years of his leadership, Chief Justice Burger had already nudged the Court away from its decidedly liberal bent under his predecessor, Earl Warren. So on the major issues that currently divide the justices and ignite politicians, the Court is unlikely to rush to abandon some recent hard-fought settlements. The 20-year-old Miranda v. Arizona ruling against illegally obtained confessions has been toned down in some of its restrictions on the police and prosecutors but it has been affirmed as law by the Burger Court, notably also by another Reagan appointee, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Just the other day the Court refused, with Chief Justice Burger among the dissenters, to reconsider basic holdings on a woman's right to choose abortion. The Court has so far refused to retreat on core principles of civil rights. Judge Scalia may be more hostile to abortion and affirmative action than the retiring Chief Justice, but his ascendancy would not alter the balance in these areas. Of legal as well as anecdotal significance now will be how a Chief Justice Rehnquist applies his genial nature and collegial spirit. He has dissented from rulings that extend the rights of minorities, women, the disadvantaged and the poor. Yet he seems not to have angered his more liberal colleagues in doing so. His service may yet test the assurances he gave, in an off-the-bench speech during the 1984 campaign, that Presidents trying to reshape the high court in their own image usually fail. Chief Justice Burger's desire to give fuller attention to next year's bicentennial of the Constitution may fully explain the timing of his retirement. But surely he and the President were aware that Republican control of the Senate is assured only until November and that other Presidents have found it difficult to win confirmation for Court appointees in their last years. Warren Burger, ever the white-haired central casting ideal of a Chief Justice, would now yield to a leader 17 years younger, the very model of an aggressive advocate bent on change. At 61, Justice Rehnquist would look to the support of a 50-year-old Justice Scalia and, often, to Justice O'Connor, Justice Rehnquist's 56-year-old law school classmate. Chronologically, the future is theirs. Of the pre-Reagan liberals and moderates, William Brennan is 80, Thurgood Marshall 77, Lewis Powell 78, Harry Blackmun 77, Byron White 69 and John Paul Stevens 66. Still, the ultimate glory of this unique institution is that each member is master only of himself, for life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE SUPREME COURT: A 17-YEAR ERA COMES TO AN END; PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON RESIGNATION OF CHIEF JUSTICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/supreme-court-17-year-era-comes-end-president-s-conference-resignation-chief.html,"Following is a transcript of a statement in Washington yesterday by President Reagan announcing the resignation of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and key questions and answers that followed, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT On May 27, 1986, Chief Justice Burger advised me that he wanted to devote his full energies in the coming year to the important work of the commission on the bicentennial of the Constitution, and for that reason would be retiring as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as of the end of the current term. Today, I received with regret Chief Justice Burger's letter formally notifying me of his retirement. And immediately after my conversation with the Chief Justice, I directed my chief of staff, together with the Attorney General and the counsel to the President, to develop recommendations for a successor. And I'm pleased to announce my intention to nominate William H. Rehnquist, currently an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, as the new Chief Justice of the United States. Upon Justice Rehnquist's confirmation, I intend to nominate Antonin Scalia, currently a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as Justice Rehnquist's successor. In taking this action, I am mindful of the importance of these nominations. The Supreme Court of the United States is the final arbiter of our Constitution and the meaning of our laws. Qualifications of Justices The Chief Justice and the eight Associate Justices of the Court must not only be just jurists of the highest competence, they must also be attentive to the rights specifically guaranteed in our Constitution and the proper role of the courts in our democratic system. In choosing Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia, I have not only selected judges who are sensitive to these matters but through their distinguished backgrounds and achievements reflect my desire to appoint the most qualified individuals to serve in our courts. Justice Rehnquist has been an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court since 1971, a role in which he has served with great distinction and skill. He is noted for his intellectual powers, the lucidity of his opinions and the respect he enjoys among his colleagues. Judge Scalia has been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1982. His great personal energy, the force of his intellect and the depth of his understanding of our constitutional jurisprudence uniquely qualify him for elevation to our highest court. I hope the Senate will promptly consider and confirm these gifted interpreters of our laws. A Period of Change and Stability And in closing, I want to say a word about Chief Justice Burger. He has led the Court, the Supreme Court, for 17 years, a time of great change and yet a period also of consolidation and stability in the decisions of the Court. Under Chief Jutice Burger's guidance, the Court has remained faithful to precedent while it sought out the principles that underlay the Framers' words. He is retiring now in order to devote his full attentions to a momentous occasion in our country's history: the observance in 1987 of the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. This is an endeavor for which all Americans will be grateful, and to which I and members of the Administration will lend our total support. I am proud and honored to stand here today with Chief Justice Burger, with Justice Rehnquist and with Judge Scalia, and to discharge my constitutional responsibilities as President of the United States. Thank you all, God bless you. QUESTIONS AND AN= SWERS Impact on Abortion Q. Mr. President, what impact do you think this will have on the abortion issue, perhaps the most emotional issue facing the Court? A. It probably won't surprise you when I tell you that I'm not going to take any questions now. Chief Justice Burger here is available for any questions you might have of him. And I think the others -- Q. Are you satisfied that the judge agrees with you on the abortion issue? A. I'm not going to answer any questions. If I start answering one --Process of Selection Q. Mr. President, what was the process which led you to Judge Scalia? Did you know him before? Or did your people come to you and recommend him? What was the process? A. (Unintelligible.) Q. Well, surely you must think, sir, that he agrees with you on such issues as abortion, affirmative action, prayer in the schools? A. That's a question. And as you said -- Q. Why didn't you appoint Mr. Meese? A. I can't say no questions, I can say no answers. Q. Yes, you're right. The New Justice Q. Could you tell us a little bit about the new Justice, whatever you can? Do you know him personally? A. (Unintelligible.) Q. Do you want to take questions on another subject? Have you heard from Gorbachev on the summit yet, sir? A. No. I think the subject today is justices. Q. Did Justice Burger recommend his successor? A. No. The Justice said that he would not presume to do that, to discuss with me individuals and give him opinion of them. Summary of Tenure Q. Mr. Chief Justice, maybe it's appropriate now to ask you to give us your thoughts, what, since 1969, 17 years on the Court? BURGER. Seventeen years, yes. Q. Sum up your tenure. What do you think you've done for -- A. That would take me about 17 years, and you don't want to spend that much time. Reason for Leaving Q. Could you explain a little bit why you're leaving the Court? A. For one primary reason: that the 200th anniversary of the Constitution got a late start, the celebration got a late start. It is vastly underfinanced, and we're going to have the Devil's own time in trying to do the kind of a job that ought to be done for this great event. John Warner, the chairman of the '76 event, you remember, was drafted from his job as Secretary of the Navy, which he did not want to leave. And he told me, he being an old friend, he told me when this subject came up last year that the job of chairman was a full-time job. I already have two full-time jobs, as you know. A job as Justice of the Court and the other job with all the vast administration problems. And it just isn't feasible to have three full-time jobs. Health Not a Factor Q. Is it a matter of health, sir? I mean, people don't leave the Court except for matters of health, normally. A. Well, you make the diagnosis. Do I look as though I'm falling apart? Q. Well, it's not how you look, it's how you feel. I mean, was it a matter of health, sir? A. Never felt better in my life. Direction of Court Q. Are you pleased with the direction the Court has taken? How would you assess your tenure on the Court? A. I wouldn't try to assess it. I'll leave that to other people to do. Q. Do you leave it with the satifaction, sir, that you have accomplished what you set out to? A. Not everything I set out to, no. Intermediate Panel Q. Would you tell us a little bit about what you've said not to have finished? A. What I did not finish was an absolute imperative, and that's to experiment with this intermediate panel that is now pending before the Congress. It's a five-year experiment. It won't cost any money, and that's perhaps why it doesn't attract much attention in Washington. It literally will cost nothing, except to bring the judges from wherever they are into Washington. Q. Did you participate in a judgment on the Gramm-Rudman ruling? A. I'm going to answer this other question first. That bill is pending. It would take about 50 cases a year off the Supreme Court. And at the present time, if you're doing your homework, those of you who are regulars on the Court, you will find that there are 50 to 100 cases denying cert where one, two or three Justices file a dissent and say this case ought to be taken. There are important cases that ought to be taken that aren't taken. You know, we've gone from Chief Justice Warren's first year with 65 signed opinions, and we've been running over 150 for the last four or five years. We've gone from 1,400 and some filings back in Earl Warren's day to nearly 5,000, nearly 100 a week. The Court's got to have some relief somewhere. I'm astonished that we haven't had some judges fall over with coronary thrombosis or some other illness of exhaustion and overwork. But going back specifically, the only health problem that I know I have is the one I have had since I was 10 years old, and that's a polio back from having polio. Apart from the ordinary mental deterioration that occurs after age 40 -- Approval of Scalia Q. Do you approve of the appointment of Judge Scalia? A. Well, the Constitution doesn't give the Chief Justice any authority on the subject. I have known each of these men - I've known Justice Rehnquist as a colleague for now -what, 15 years? REHNQUIST: Fifteen years, Chief. BURGER: And I've known Judge Scalia since the time he was an Assistant Attorney General. He's participated in extrajudicial activities, like being a member of the American team visiting England to study some of their methods. We are not close friends. I have a high regard for each of them, a high regard. Q. Sir, have you grown weary of being Chief Justice, sir? A. No, I'm not weary of it, no. I would like to have stayed until - I would like to have stayed until we got some of these - this remedy that I told you about, but I think the constitutional celebration is more important and, after all, there are some other people that can carry on this work. It's just up to the Senate. Comments by Rehnquist Q. Justice Rehnquist, could we ask you your thoughts about being nominated for the highest judicial post in this country? REHNQUIST: Well, I'm deeply gratified by the confidence that the President has shown in me by making the nomination. I'll do my best to deserve that confidence. Q. Mr. Rehnquist, how is your health? You've had some problems in the past. A. I think I won't answer any further questions of the kind that might come up before the Senate confirmation committee. Comments by Scalia Q. Mr. Scalia, could you share your thoughts with us as a new nominee, as much as you can say? SCALIA: Yes, on the substance of it I think I'm with Justice Rehnquist. I know a good idea when I hear one. Q. What about your personal thoughts, though? A. My personal thoughts are, for somebody who spent his whole professional life in the law, getting nominated to the Supreme Court is the culmination of a dream, of course, and I'm greatly honored that the President would have such confidence in me and hope that the Senate will do so as well. And I'll certainly do whatever I can to live up to it. Questions on Abortion Q. Did Administration officials, sir, question you on your views on Roe v. Wade? A. I think I'll respond the way Justice Rehnquist did. Q. I didn't ask you your personal view of that subject, sir. I'm wondering whether you were questioned before your selection was made on that subject. A. If the Senate wants to ask that, they may, but I don't want to get into it. Q. Do you expect controversy in the Senate confirmation? A. I have no idea. I'm not a politician. Civility on the Court Q. Mr. Chief Justice, some people suggest that the Supreme Court has become more sharply divided under your tenure. First of all, do you agree with that? And how would you characterize the general level of comity among the Justices today? BURGER: It has not become more sharply divided. If you go back and read the opinions over 35, 40 years, you'd find there just isn't any substance to that. The reason there are nine people up there - and there are days when I'd like there to be just one - the reason you have nine is to have this interchange and interplay. It goes on all the time. In the 17 years I have been there presiding over the conferences, never once, never once, has a voice been raised in any discussions. They're vigorous discussions, as they should be - always will be, I hope. We have cordial and good relations. We can disagree in a civilized way, and we do. Judicial Philosophy Q. Since you are not going before the Senate, perhaps you can give us your views on whether these new appointments will change the philosophy or direction of the Court in the next few years. A. Well, I could if I thought about it a great deal, but I haven't thought about it so I would not undertake it. Timing of Resignation Q. When did you first hear that it was going to be announced? A. I don't know, a day or two ago. Q. Sir, what will you miss most about being Chief Justice? A. Really, nothing.Q. Justice Burger, was your decision to retire at this time related at all to a desire to have President Reagan appoint your successor? A. Well, if that had been my desire I'd have quite a bit of time to wait here. Q. Chief Justice, can you tell us a little bit about your tendering of the resignation with the President? Did you personally -- A. I just gave it to him 10 minutes ago. Q. And what happened? Can you talk a little of the conversation? A. He said, ''Thank you,'' as I remember. I think maybe he and his staff were a little relieved. All they had was word of mouth from me before, and if I hadn't shown up with that letter today they'd have really had a problem. Q. Mr. Chief Justice, what was the reason for the timing of the announcement today of the change in the Court? The President said you decided on your resignation last month; why was it all announced today? A. You'll have to ask the President that, I don't know the timing. Q. Mr. Chief Justice, if it were not for the bicentennial, would you have retired when? Do you have any views -- A. My letter, as you will see, fixes the effective date as July 10. We hope to conclude the term before that, but there's always a certain amount of debris, administrative debris, to be cleared up. Q. Were it not for the bicentennial, would you have retired? At what --A. No, if it were not for the bicentennial, I would not have retired. The Toughest Cases Q. What was your toughest case? Some people have suggested it was the Nixon tape case. After all, he appointed you to the Court and you joined in a unanimous judgment which forced him to turn over those tapes, which were his undoing. A. That was not the toughest. Q. What was it? A. I really don't know; I'd have to give you a list of about 25 or 30. In fact, a couple that are coming down very soon, and that one last week that you fellows all missed. Q. When will we get that Gramm-Rudman opinion? A. Sometime before the 10th of July, I hope. Screening Process Q. Judge Scalia, would you call yourself a tough judge? SCALIA: I think that's in the category of questions I think --Q. Can you tell us when you were first approached by the Administration? Just give us a sense of the timing, when you first heard and your feelings. A. I think if the President wants that to be known, I'm sure he'll tell us. Q. Judge Scalia, many of the judges appointed by this Administration are said to have been subjected to a rigorous screening process conducted under Attorney General Meese. Were you at all, Roe v. Wade aside, asked any of your positions on various points of law? A. I have no idea what the screening process was. You'd have to ask the Attorney General. Q. No one spoke to you, sir? A. I speak to people all the time. Q. No screening process directly with you? A. I'd prefer not to -- Q. Judge, I have a question that you can answer. Can you give us the pronounciation of your name? A. I'd be happy to do that: Skuh-LEE-yuh. Burger's Workload Q. Mr. Chief Justice, did you at any point consider just telling the President that, you know, you just don't have time to run the bicentennial commission, the constitutional - as a matter of fact, you're the Chief Justice of the United States and you've got to do that? BURGER: Nobody that I know of could do all three of the jobs that I spoke of that I've been trying to do for this last year. One week recently, after I had been carrying around a walking flu bug, one of my staff informed me that I had logged 105 hours that week. Now 80 and 90 I can handle, but I'm getting a little too old for 105. Q. What has us all astounded here is the fact that you're the Chief Justice of the United States and you're putting that aside to handle a job that in fact is going to be over in a year. A. No, three years. Q. Well, three years, whatever. I think -did you figure perhaps you could let the President take that burden off you so you could remain as Chief Justice? Or were you simply weary of being Chief Justice? A. No, I wasn't weary of being Chief Justice. It's a lot of fun. But I go back to what I said first. We have inadequate preparation for the bicentennial of the Constitution. It's a remarkable story; it's one of the great, great stories in American history, and it's our job to tell it. And we're just getting organized; we haven't got a main headquarters yet, we're scattered in three buildings. We've got, for Washington, a piddling appropriation of $12 million, and over 10 years ago, John Warner had over $200 million. If we're going to celebrate this thing in the proper way, and have people get an understanding, in this country and elsewhere, about what freedom means, and that this is the instrument that gave that freedom and how it works, there's a lot of work to be done. I expect to be working literally full time. Q. You said this was the primary reason that you were resigning. A. That's right. Q. What was the secondary reason? A. I didn't have a secondary reason. Rehnquist's New Job Q. Justice Rehnquist, you have had a reputation more as a thinker and writer on the Court than as an administrator. Do you, too, consider it the culmination of a dream to be Chief Justice and thus have to take on all these administrative tasks? REHNQUIST: I wouldn't call it the culmination of a dream, but it's not every day when you're 61 years old that you get a chance to have a new job. And you take on some things you don't like along with a lot of things that you do like. BURGER: That strikes as a perfect parallel. Bill Rehnquist is the same age as I was when I was nominated - back in the Garfield Administration, I think it was. Changes in the Court Q. Mr. Chief Justice, how have you seen the Court change philosophically during your tenure? A. Well, if you would go to the history of the Supreme Court of the United States, or of the country, you'll find that at different periods there are different needs and different problems, and there are different answers. And then sometimes you find that an answer that you gave two years ago, or three or five, doesn't quite fit, and you adjust it. We have been doing some adjusting. That was done in the previous 15 years, but we haven't done a fraction of that adjusting that was done in the 15 years before my tenure began. Q. Do you regret any of your decisions, sir? Any of the opinions you wrote? Would you like to change them, looking back? A. I wish some of them were a little shorter. Q. Are you at all concerned that the A.B.A. was not consulted, apparently, about your replacement on the Court? A. I don't know anything about the procedures, not a thing. I have never understood that the appointments to the Supreme Court automatically were cleared with the American Bar. Sometimes they're consulted and sometimes they're not. Q. Mr. Chief Justice, if I could follow up on that. You said that there had not been nearly the changes during your tenure as in the preceding 15 years. Does that mean there was less need for change, or it just did not happen? A. I'll leave that to you; objective observers are a better judge of that than I.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON; Hear Ye in the Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/opinion/washington-hear-ye-in-the-court.html,"The surprising thing about the coming changes on the Supreme Court is that they have not occurred earlier. With President Reagan approaching his sixth year in the White House, and five of the nine members over 75, it was expected even in the last Presidential election that by now Mr. Reagan would have been able to appoint a clear conservative majority. The timing of Chief Justice Burger's resignation was a surprise. It was known that he had become increasingly preoccupied in the last year with the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution, and he gave this as the sole reason for stepping down next month. At the same time, though saying he was in excellent health, he has been suffering from a painful back and respiratory difficulties, and he told the press that working 105 hours a week was a bit much for a man of 78. There seems to be general agreement here among students of the Court on two points: First, that Associate Justice William Rehnquist, nominated to succeed Chief Justice Burger, and Judge Antonin Scalia of the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, nominated to fill the resulting vacancy, are highly qualified conservative judges and will have no trouble being confirmed. This might have been different if the Democrats were to gain control of the Senate in this November's elections, and may help explain why the Administration is pleased with the present moves. The result, therefore, is that the new Court will include Chief Justice Rehnquist at 61, Associate Justices White, 69, O'Connor, 56, and Scalia, 50, all conservatives, plus Justice Stevens, 66, and Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun and Powell, all over 75. The Democrats, fearing that Mr. Reagan will leave behind a young conservative Court that will sustain his policies long after he's gone, are complaining that these appointments are clearly political. But as Associate Prof. David M. O'Brien, of the University of Virginia, notes in an excellent new book on the Supreme Court, ''Storm Center,'' ''the reality is that every appointment to the Court is political.' Justice Rehnquist left no doubt on this point in a speech he made at the University of Minnesota just before the Presidential election of 1984. There is no reason, he said, that a President should not appoint people to the Court who are sympathetic to his political and philosophical principles, and nothing really to worry about. ''The institution [ of the Court ] ,'' he observed, ''is so structured that a brand new Presidential appointee, perhaps feeling himself strongly loyal to the President who appointed him, and looking for colleagues of a similar mind on the Court, is immediately beset with the institutional pressures. . . . He identifies more and more strongly with the new institution of which he has become a member and he learns how much store is set by his behaving independently of his colleagues.'' On such delicate constitutional questions as abortion, prayer in the schools and desegregation of the schools, Justice Rehnquist has been the most outspoken advocate of conservative policies. He has managed to take these positions without personal animosity among his colleagues and is a great favorite with his clerks, whom he allows to make the first draft of his opinions. Also, he has backed Chief Justice Burger in the effort to establish a national court of appeals to ease the case load and work load of the Court. And while he is less interested in the administrative duties of the Court than Chief Justice Burger, he indicated today that he could put up with them. There is perhaps one surprise in the appointment of Judge Scalia. While it is agreed here that he is articulate and personable, it was thought that Robert Bork, a former Yale University law professor who is also on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, had a more brilliant career, and having been passed over once despite the recommendation of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, would this time be chosen. Judge Bork, wrote Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona to President Ford, ''is young and is a strict constructionist and would give continuity to the kind of Court that you want for at least 25 years.'' Mr. Ford, however, refused and so did Mr. Reagan. Judge Scalia, a Roman Catholic who would be the first Justice on the Court of Italian descent, is thought to be a more reliable conservative, perhaps halfway between Justices Rehnquist and O'Connor. But in any event, the long-anticipated switch in the balance of power on the Court, though not assured by these moves, is undoubtedly on its way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BURGER RETIRING, REHNQUIST NAMED CHIEF; SCALIA, APPEALS JUDGE, CHOSEN FOR COURT",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/burger-retiring-rehnquist-named-chief-scalia-appeals-judge-chosen-for-court.html,"President Reagan today announced the retirement of Warren Earl Burger as Chief Justice of the United States after 17 years and the intention to nominate Associate Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to replace him. Mr. Reagan also announced that, upon Justice Rehnquist's confirmation as Chief Justice by the Senate, he would nominate Judge Antonin Scalia, of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to the Supreme Court. Republican leaders of the Senate praised the selection of Justice Rehnquist, but some Democrats expressed doubts about his record. Lawmakers from both parties said Judge Scalia's reputation as a legal scholar was likely to dissolve opposition to his nomination, and many said the selections would shift the balance of the Court perceptibly to the right. [ Page A32. ] A Decisive Move With the announcement today, Mr. Reagan moved decisively to insure that on the central issues of his social agenda - civil rights, abortion and the constitutionality of independent Federal agencies - the Supreme Court would include a forceful number of Justices supporting the President. White House officials insisted that there was no ''litmus test'' for selecting Judge Scalia and that he was not subject to any specific screening for opinions on school prayer, abortion or other issues. But officials who studied the records of the potential nominees to the Court were well aware that Judge Scalia was a deeply conservative thinker whose views on major issues were quite compatible with the Administration's policy agenda. An Unexpected Activism Chief Justice Burger's years heading the Supreme Court were marked by an unexpected activism, even in areas such as civil rights and criminal law. Mr. Burger was appointed by President Nixon in 1969 in an effort to seek ''judicial restraint'' in the Court's decisions. Chief Justice Burger said he was retiring to devote his time entirely to organizing ceremonies for the 200th anniversary of the Constitution in 1987. Chief Justice Burger, 78 years old, who is chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, denied he was leaving the Court because of poor health or weariness with the job. ''I wasn't weary of being Chief Justice,'' he said with a grin. ''It's a lot of fun.'' Asked if he was leaving for reasons of health, Justice Burger said: ''You make the diagnosis. Do I look as though I'm falling apart? I never felt better in my life.'' White House and Administration officials said today that Chief Justice Burger, at a private White House meeting three weeks ago, told the President unequivocally that he wanted to retire. Mr. Reagan, who made the announcement at 2 P.M. today at the White House before a national television audience, said Judge Scalia was ''noted for his intellectual power, the lucidity of his opinions and the respect he enjoys among his colleagues.'' ''His great personal energy, the force of his intellect, and the depth of his understanding of our constitutional jurisprudence uniquely qualify him for elevation to our highest court,'' said Mr. Reagan, who stood in the White House beside Chief Justice Burger, Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia. White House officials said they expect no substantive opposition to Judge Scalia in the Senate, where a majority vote is required for his confirmation. He would be the first American of Italian descent to serve as a Justice, the Supreme Court said, and at 50, he is younger that any sitting Justice. Quick Hearings Promised Senator Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the nominations, promised to hold hearings quickly. ''I expect no problem in having either of the President's nominations confirmed,'' he said. Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, who was involved in the selection process, said the President had adhered to three basic criteria in nominating Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia. ''One is intellectual and lawyerly capability,'' he said, ''secondly, integrity, and thirdly, a commitment to the interpretation of the law rather than being a lawmaker.'' A senior Administration official, also involved in the selection process, said the nominations ''will have enormous influence on the direction of the Court for many years.'' Republican leaders of the Senate praised Mr. Reagan's selection of Justice Rehnquist, who was named to the Supreme Court in 1971 by President Nixon and has long been the Court's most conservative member. Democrats vowed, however, to examine his record carefully before deciding whether to endorse his nomination as Chief Justice. The views of Judge Scalia are not widely known. He has criticized the Supreme Court's approval of affirmative action plans that include racial preferences, hinted at disagreement with the Court's broad rulings limiting libel suits, questioned the constitutional basis for the independence from the President of such agencies as the Federal Reserve Board and is said to be personally opposed to abortion. Departure Is Set for July 10 The effective date of Chief Justice Burger's departure is July 10, when the Court expects to finish work on its current term, although he said he would stay longer if needed. A spokesman for the Court said Mr. Burger would draw his full annual salary of $108,400 in retirement. Mr. Reagan said Chief Justice Burger informed him three weeks ago of his desire to leave the Court to devote full time to the commission. Chief Justice Burger said today, ''It is vastly underfinanced and we're going to have the devil's own time in trying to do the kind of a job that ought to be done for this great event.'' White House officials said Chief Justice Burger's intention to retire surprised the President and his chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, who quickly established a high-level committee to find a replacement. Chief Justice Burger, in his letter of resignation, said that his work heading the commission on the Constitution was a ''full-time enterprise'' and was ''an enormous and challenging task.'' The responsibilities of serving as Chief Justice as well as running the commission were far more than he could handle, the Chief Justice indicated. Chief Justice Burger, in a joking mood, was asked by reporters if he would change some of the opinions he had written. ''I wish some of them were a little shorter,'' he said. Justice Renhquist, asked if the nomination to replace Chief Justice Burger was the culmination of a dream, said: ''I wouldn't call it the culmination of a dream, but it's not every day when you're 61 years old that you get a chance to have a new job.'' Chief Justice Burger said: ''That strikes me as a perfect parallel. Bill Rehnquist is the same age as I was when I was nominated back in the Garfield Administration, I think it was.'' The two Justices and Judge Scalia broke into laughter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE SUPREME COURT: DECISIONS IN THE OVAL OFFICE; RESHAPED COURT TO FACE MAJOR ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/supreme-court-decisions-oval-office-reshaped-court-face-major-issues.html,"In the next few years the Supreme Court will probably face a series of momentous cases dealing with civil rights, abortion, church-state relations and the constitutionality of independent Federal agencies, according to lawyers who follow the Court. The Court's agenda became the object of increased attention today as President Reagan announced that Warren E. Burger was retiring after 17 years as Chief Justice of the United States. Mr. Reagan said he would nominate William H. Rehnquist to be the next Chief Justice and Antonin Scalia to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Mr. Scalia has been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia since 1982, when he was appointed by Mr. Reagan. Major undecided questions, according to lawyers who closely follow the work of the High Court, include the legality of various types of affirmative action in employment and education; the propriety of state efforts to restrict access to abortion; the permissible forms of state support for church-related institutions, and the legal status of independent Federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission. In his judicial opinions and essays, Judge Scalia has generally insisted on a rigid separation of powers among the branches of Government, raising questions about the constitutionality of independent agencies. He has indicated that he is receptive to the Justice Department argument that such agencies are an anomaly, a ''headless fourth branch'' of Government, outside the legislative, executive and judicial branches explicitly authorized in the Constitution. Ruling on Budget Law Judge Scalia was a member of a three-judge panel that struck down a key provision of a new budget-balancing law in February. The court held the law unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the principle requiring separation of powers. In a passage widely assumed to have been written by Judge Scalia, the panel cast a legal shadow over independent agencies, saying, ''It is not as obvious today as it seemed in the 1930's that there can be such things as genuinely 'independent' regulatory agencies.'' The Supreme Court may be asked to consider numerous cases challenging the legal authority of such agencies in the next few years, and Reagan Administration officials have encouraged such challenges in some of their public remarks. Other issues likely to face the Court include exceptions to the rule that generally bars use of illegally seized evidence in criminal cases; Government regulation of electronic communications media such as cable television, and the proper balance of power between the Federal Government and the states in regulating economic activity. Since 1978, the Supreme Court has enunciated a few general principles about the use of racial preferences designed to overcome the effects of discrimination. The Court has approved certain types of affirmative action and disapproved others, but its rulings have given rise to conflicting interpretations. Yale Kamisar, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said that in terms of its importance to the Administration, ''the abortion issue is in a category by itself, and everything else pales into insignificance.'' Ruling on Abortion By a 5-to-4 vote last week, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. But in coming years, lawyers said, the Court will undoubtedly be asked to rule on the legality of other state efforts to regulate or restrict access to abortion. The Court will also probably be asked again to overrule its 1973 decision, in which the vote was 7 to 2. Kenneth S. Geller, a former Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, said the Court would probably also be asked to reconsider the three-part test it has used in determining whether a state or Federal law represents an unconstitutional ''establishment of religion.'' This test stipulates that to pass muster, a law must have ''a clearly secular legislative purpose,'' must neither advance nor inhibit religion and must ''avoid excessive government entanglement with religion.'' Experts on the Supreme Court said there would be no difficulty in making the transition envisioned by President Reagan because the Court would, by the end of the current term next month, issue decisions in virtually all cases that had been briefed and argued. There will be few if any cases to carry over to the next term. Outlook on Libel Issue On another First Amendment issue, the key question is whether the Court will begin cutting back on the protection it has given to news organizations in libel cases. In a 1964 case, The New York Times Company v. Sullivan, the High Court ruled that a state could not award damages to a public official for a defamatory falsehood unless he proved that the statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with ''reckless disregard'' of whether it was true or false. Judge Scalia has suggested that there is a ''distressing tendency'' for political commentators and columnists to ''descend from discussion of public issues to destruction of private reputations.'' In a 1984 opinion, he wrote that the rough treatment of people who entered the ''public political arena'' was ''fulsomely assured'' by the standards laid down in the 1964 case relating to defamation of public figures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE SUPREME COURT: A LEGACY AND A LOOK AHEAD; BURGER RESHAPED OFFICE IF NOT LAW HE INHERITED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/supreme-court-legacy-look-ahead-burger-reshaped-office-if-not-law-he-inherited.html,"Warren E. Burger will be leaving a Supreme Court that in terms of judicial doctrine has not been notably different from the one he inherited 17 years ago when President Nixon named him the 15th Chief Justice of the United States. That fact is striking, because President Nixon selected the 61-year-old Federal appeals court judge to fulfill a campaign pledge to name Justices who were ''practitioners of judicial restraint'' and who would turn back the activist tide of the Earl Warren years. Seventeen years later, no major doctrine of those years has been overruled. In many ways, the Court under Chief Justice Burger proved to be every bit as ''activist'' as the Court that Richard M. Nixon campaigned against. Endorsement of Busing In the field of civil rights, for example, it was an opinion by Chief Justice Burger that for the first time endorsed busing as a permissible tool for school desegregation. On another subject, the Chief Justice joined the 1973 majority that established the constitutional right to abortion, although in a dissenting opinion just last week he indicated some doubts about that decision. Even in criminal law, although the Court did draw back somewhat from some precedents of the Warren era, there was no sweeping retrenchment of the sort that had been widely predicted. The very symbol of the Warren Court, the Miranda decision that required suspects to be informed of their rights before interrogation in police custody, survived basically unscathed. In fact, the Court under Chief Justice Burger remained essentially so faithful to the precedents it inherited that a 1983 collection of essays, published under the sponsorship of the Society of American Law Teachers, was titled, ''The Burger Court: The Counterrevolution That Wasn't.'' Prof. Vincent Blasi of Columbia Law School, who edited that book, wrote that the Court under Chief Justice Burger displayed a ''rootless activism,'' inspired not by a particular ''moral vision'' but rather ''almost exclusively by discrete, pragmatic judgments regarding how a moderate, sensible judicial accommodation might help to resolve a potentially divisive public controversy.'' But if Chief Justice Burger did not transform the Court or the law, he did transform the office of Chief Justice. He liked to say that he took his title seriously: He was Chief Justice not of just the Supreme Court, but of the United States, and he took as his mandate the stewardship of the entire judicial system, state as well as Federal. He was one of the most active Chief Justices in history, second in this century perhaps only to William Howard Taft. He used the office as a platform from which to expound views on everything from legal education to prison reform to the administration of justice. An array of new institutions was created under his aegis, including the National Center for State Courts, the Institute for Court Management, the National Institute of Corrections and the Federal Judicial Center. A Special Aim Is Not Realized But the Chief Justice did not accomplish one of his cherished goals, the creation of a new Federal court that would ease the Supreme Court's workload by taking some of its cases. He campaigned tirelessly for the new court, which he called an ''intercircuit tribunal,'' but never persuaded Congress such an institution was needed. It was an irony of Warren Burger's years as Chief Justice that Supreme Court commentators frequently questioned the degree to which he actually led the Court over which he so energetically presided. It was occasionally said of the Chief Justice that the attention he paid outside the Court to judicial administration came at the expense of the actual craft of judging, of building and holding coalitions, and of shaping doctrine. A Chief Justice has only one of nine votes. As Chief Justice, Mr. Burger had the power to assign opinions in which he was in the majority, and he gave himself a share of highly visible cases, particularly when the Court was united or nearly so. But when the Court was closely divided on a case likely to require delicate in-house diplomacy and sustained effort, he often called on Justice William H. Rehnquist, named today to be the next Chief Justice. Impact in Key Legal Areas Nonetheless, Chief Justice Burger leaves a personal imprint in several key areas of the law. His 1973 opinion on obscenity, Miller v. California, ended some 15 years of legal turmoil by changing the focus of the search for a definition of obscenity from the entire country to local communities, applying ''contemporary community standards.'' He wrote several of the Court's most important cases interpreting the free speech and free press guarantees of the First Amendment. These included the 1976 decision that effectively prohibited judges from imposing prepublication restraints to protect criminal defendants from negative pretrial publicity. He was also one of the Court's most prolific writers on the constitutional relationship between church and state. He wrote the 1971 decision, Lemon v. Kurtzman, that set up the test for determining whether a particular government policy creates an unconstitutional ''establishment'' of religion. In 1983, he wrote the opinion that permitted the City of Pawtucket, R.I., to display a Nativity scene in the Christmas season. But he was in dissent in 1984 when the Court struck down an Alabama law providing for a moment of silent prayer in the public schools. Chief Justice Burger made the Court more interesting and accessible to the general public, turning a sterile ground floor area into a kind of museum with art displays and changing exhibits. But conversely, he refused to take part in the morning ritual of announcing the Court's opinions from the bench to the courtroom audience. Each of the other eight Justices typically reads a summary of his or her opinion or gives a brief, off-the-cuff explanation of the case. But Chief Justice Burger simply announces the name of the case and whether the lower court was affirmed or reversed. Asked once why he did not join the practice of his colleagues, he said he considered it a ''waste of time.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MORE VIGOR FOR THE RIGHT; COURT WOULD EASE TOWARD CONSERVATIVISM WITHOUT ABRUPTLY CHANGING IN DIRECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/more-vigor-for-right-court-would-ease-toward-conservativism-without-abruptly.html,"The ideological balance of the Supreme Court is likely to shift perceptibly to the right if the Senate confirms President Reagan's selections of Justice William H. Rehnquist to become Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia to become an Associate Justice. But legal experts do not expect these changes alone to produce dramatic reversals of the Court's precedents on major issues. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who is retiring, is also a conservative, although less so than Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia. The two selected today are said by most students of their records to be more consistent, more energetic and more intellectually formidable advocates of conservative views, and of judicial restraint, than Chief Justice Burger has been. Persuasive Abilities Cited Both are regarded by ideological friends and foes alike as first-rate legal minds who have a clear view of where they want the Court to go and the persuasive powers to influence wavering colleagues in close cases. But they may often find themselves outvoted on politically charged issues in which the Court's two consistent liberals, Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, are joined by some of the five in the shifting ideological center - Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Lewis F. Powell Jr., Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor. Conservatives who have been unhappy with some of Chief Justice Burger's votes on major issues, including school desegregation through busing, abortion, affirmative action, sex discrimination, separation of church and state and press access to court proceedings, hope for a more consistent ally in Judge Scalia. Judge Scalia, of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, has, for example, criticized the Supreme Court's approval of affirmative action plans that include racial preferences, embraced an expansive view of Presidential power, questioned the constitutional basis for the independence from the President of such agencies as the Federal Reserve Board, criticized the Freedom of Information Act and hinted at disagreement with the Court's First Amendment rulings limiting libel suits. He has also questioned the basis for the Supreme Court's recognition of a constitutional right to sexual privacy, including abortion rights, and has joined a ruling that the Constitution does not protect private homosexual acts between consenting adults. A Roman Catholic, he is said by acquaintances to be personally opposed to abortion. But even if Judge Scalia were, as a Justice, to vote to allow states to restrict or prohibit abortion, there would still be five solid votes for broad abortion rights, as demonstrated by last week's decision striking down a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion. Role of the Courts More generally, Judge Scalia has, like Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and other Administration officials, criticized the courts for invading the sphere of elected officials, and assigning to themselves ''social judgments that ought better be left to the democratic process.'' A Reagan appointee to the Appeals Court, Judge Scalia has said he has an obligation to follow Supreme Court precedents even if he thinks them incorrect. He has refrained from criticizing the Court's decisions as overtly as he did in his writings as a University of Chicago law professor. While some members of the Court, like the Chief Justice Earl Warren, have done things that surprised and horrified the Presidents who appointed them, this is much less likely in the case of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia, whose legal philosophies seem remarkably compatible with Mr. Reagan's political philosophy. They are known quantities, having expressed consistent views on a range of political and legal issues over the years, both in judicial opinions and, in Judge Scalia's case, in academic writings. Professor Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School said today that two issues on which Judge Scalia's presence on the Court could make a difference are sex discrimination, in which Chief Justice Burger interpreted the Constitution to strike down some state laws as discriminatory, and freedom of speech, in which Chief Justice Burger has written some opinions applauded by press groups and libertarians. Another issue on which Judge Scalia might make a difference is affirmative action, on which the Court has been splintered. Tipping the Balance If, as some experts speculated, he were to support the Administration's broad attack on affirmative action plans that grant racial preferences, it could tip the balance of the Court in some cases. Chief Justice Burger has been something of a swing vote in affirmative action cases, expressing concern about broad use of racial preferences but voting to approve such preferences in some cases, including a 1980 decision upholding an act of Congress that required a specific percentage of Federal construction grants to be set aside for minority-owned businesses. Justice Rehnquist has long been the Court's most conservative member. Although Chief Justice Burger has often been aligned with him, Mr. Tribe and other scholars said Justice Rehnquist was much better equipped to be an intellectual leader. As Chief Justice, he would still have only one vote in a group that he himself said in 1984 was marked by ''the extraordinary independence that each Justice has from every other Justice.'' But he would have more power to shape the Court's deliberations and to influence the national legal agenda. The Chief Justice presides at the Court's private conferences, assigns opinions when he is in the majority, administers the Federal judiciary, and can command far more attention from the news media and public than any other member of the Court. ''The Chief Justice has a lot of subtle power to push the Court in the direction in which he wants it to go,'' said Kenneth Geller, a Washington lawyer who was for years one of the top Supreme Court litigators in the Solicitor General's Office. ''I think it could make a big difference'' to have Justice Rehnquist in the job. This would not necessarily mean that issues that have gone one way by close votes would start going the other way with Justice Rehnquist as Chief Justice and Judge Scalia on the Court, presumably as his ally. Stable Voting Pattern ''The voting pattern should remain stable,'' predicted Burt Neuborne, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, because Chief Justice Burger was aligned with Justice Rehnquist in the great majority of cases. He added: ''Burger's tenure demonstrates that merely being Chief Justice isn't enough to make you a leader of the Court. Either you have to have a natural ideological majority or you have to have qualities of mind and heart that make you a natural leader.'' Chief Justice Warren, who led the Court's liberal majority as it became an engine of change in the 1950's and 1960's, had both the ideological majority and leadership qualities, other experts said. While Justice Rehnquist has the mind and may have the heart, he does not yet have enough allies on the Court to have a similar impact. Mr. Neuborne added that with the retirement of Chief Justice Burger and the addition to the Court of Judge Scalia, ''even if they were absolutely identical in their views, you're replacing a 78-year-old man who is tired with a 50-year-old man who is energetic and very gregarious.'' The Guard Changing At the High Court In the Oval Office, a surprise announcement by the Chief Justice three weeks ago set off a high-level secret search for his replacement. Page A32.

ORDER OF NUNS DEFIES VATICAN ON MOVE TO OUST 2 DISSENTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/order-of-nuns-defies-vatican-on-move-to-oust-2-dissenters.html,"An international order of Roman Catholic nuns said yesterday that it would refuse a Vatican request to dismiss two Americans who signed an advertisement supporting the right to dissent from the church's teaching on abortion. However, the leaders of the Rome-based order, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, reprimanded the two nuns for what they saw as a ''lack of respect'' for the church's teaching authority, for ''an attitude of intransigence'' and for taking a stance favoring a woman's rights to abortion. The nuns, Sisters Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey of Charleston, W.Va., are the only two of the four priests and 24 nuns who signed the October 1984 advertisement who have not resolved their cases to the satisfaction of the Vatican. The advertisement, published in The New York Times, said there was a ''diversity of opinions'' among Catholics on abortion. Its publication stirred an uproar in the church, partly because it seemed to some leaders to suggest that there was more than one Catholic teaching on abortion. Cardinal Orders a Retraction After the advertisement was published, Jerome Cardinal Hamer, prefect of the Vatican's Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes, directed the signers to retract their statement or face dismissal. The other signers have all taken undisclosed steps to heal the breach. The 1,200-word statement from the Notre Dame order was read to both nuns Tuesday in a telephone call from Rome and made public yesterday. Sister Elizabeth Bowyer, a leader of the 4,000-nun order, acknowledged in a telephone interview from Rome that the statement might be seen by some Catholics as defying the Vatican. But she said the order believed that its superior, and not the Vatican, had the prerogative of deciding whether a member should be dismissed. Sister Barbara declined yesterday to answer specific questions about her order's statement, saying she had not seen the full text. But, speaking for herself and Sister Patricia, she said: ''We are glad that our congregation has claimed their autonomy as a religious community.'' In its statement, the order said that many of the advertisement's signers saw it as a ''call for dialogue about the church's teaching on abortion and not as a pro-abortion statement.'' Therefore, it said, ''We do not see in this action sufficient cause to initiate a process for dismissal.'' The statement went on to praise the two nuns for their work among poor and sexually abused women in Charleston, but it criticized the nuns for their conduct in the controversy. ''We believe Sisters Barbvara and Patricia's present position has serious potential for the giving of scandal and continues to reflect an attitude of intransigence rather than dialogue,'' the statement said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS; ABORTION KNITS RELIGIOUS RIGHT INTO G.O.P. FABRIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/politics-abortion-knits-religious-right-into-gop-fabric.html,"Carolyn Thompson, chairman of the Pro Life Action Council in Iowa, a politically active anti-abortion group, said it was not too many years ago that Presidential candidates ''wouldn't even talk to us.'' That is no longer the case, at least with Republicans. ''Jack Kemp has spoken to us a number of times, Pat Robertson has been out to see us, Bob Dole wants to meet with us and Vice President Bush has asked for a meeting,'' Mrs. Thompson said. ''It's nice to have the luxury of a whole field of candidates to choose from after all those years of abuse.'' Mrs. Thompson, a nurse, is a former Democrat who finds herself increasingly involved in Republican politics for one reason: the abortion issue. Since the election of Ronald Reagan as President in 1980, the anti-abortion movement, which includes people from both parties and independents, has forged a strong political identification with the Republican Party, a development that is affecting the character of not only the party but also the movement itself. Issue Goes Out Into Mainstream Among other things, anti-abortion leaders say, this has moved their struggle from the fringe of national politics into the mainstream of a major political party. It has also underscored the importance of keeping a Republican in the White House, the anti-abortion leaders say, because a Republican President is more likely to appoint Federal judges who can be counted on to reverse more than a decade of rulings affirming the right to abortion. And that concern was reiterated by developments Tuesday at the Supreme Court when Chief Justice Warren E. Burger announced that he would retire. Dr. John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee, says the abortion issue has the potential to define the Republican Party in the 1980's in much the same way as the abolitionist movement to end slavery did before the Civil War. ''The abortion issue is clearly moving our way,'' he says. ''Time and momentum are on our side, and being identified with a major political party certainly helps our cause.'' Some Fear an Alienation Over It Not all Republicans are comfortable with their party's assimilation of anti-abortion activists. Public opinion polls show that a substantial majority of people think that abortion is a decision best left to a woman and her doctor, and some party strategists fear that the abortion issue could alienate many voters. Even so, there is no sign that the party is ready to put distance between itself and the anti-abortion movement. No other single social issue has bonded Republican conservatives as strongly as abortion. In recent years, it has become the principal source of political energy driving the religious right, which is emerging as a significant element of the Republican coalition. Last week in Denver, where Dr. Willke's organization held its annual convention, three Republican Presidential hopefuls were on the program: Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate majority leader; Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, and the Rev. Pat Robertson, a television evangelist from Virginia Beach, Va. A fourth, Vice President Bush, was out of the country and unable to be present, but he met with the group's leaders in Washington the week before and sent a message of support, as did President Reagan. Among Democrats, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri is the only 1988 Presidential hopeful whose record on abortion made him acceptable to activists on this issue. But Mr. Gephardt recently angered anti-abortion groups by abandoning his position supporting a proposed constitutional amendment that would bar abortion except when the woman's life was in danger. Dr. Willke said the influx of Protestant Christians into anti-abortion ranks ''is nearing a floodtide'' and changing the face of the movement. In its early stages, he noted, the movement's leadership came mostly from among Roman Catholics, a traditional Democratic constituency. But as the movement has swollen with evangelicals and fundamentalist Christians, anti-abortion forces increasingly have woven themselves into the fabric of Republican politics. Shift on Impact of Party In the past, anti-abortion groups have generally supported candidates strictly on the basis of their stand on abortion, regardless of party. But as they develop their political strategies for coming elections, these groups say it is in their interest to strengthen their ties with the Republican Party. The outcome of 1986 Senate elections and the 1988 Presidential contest, they say, will determine which party is to control the appointment and confirmation of Federal judges. Some anti-abortion organizations are advising their followers that even a vote for a Democrat who opposes abortion could hurt their cause. If Democrats regain control of the Senate, these groups warn, they would control the Senate Judiciary Committee and be in a position to block the judicial nominations for the rest of Mr. Reagan's term. At the news conference Tuesday with Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Reagan said he intended to nominate Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist as the new Chief Justice of the United States and Judge Antonin Scalia of United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to take Mr. Rehnquist's place on the High Court. He Can't Cite Any Decisions Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, said he knew of no opinion or writing by Mr. Scalia on the abortion issue. ''His exact views on the legal issues of abortion remain to be seen,'' he added. But some legal scholars familiar with the views of Mr. Scalia, a Roman Catholic, say he is be personally opposed to abortion and feels that the Supreme Court's 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, the 7-to-2 ruling establishing a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, went too far. Last week the Justices divided 5 to 4 in striking down a Pennsylvania law in a decision that further restricted the ability of states to regulate abortions. In his dissent, Chief Justice Burger called for a review of the Roe decision, raising hopes among anti-abortion activists that the Court could be moving toward a reversal. As important as the Supreme Court is, the National Right to Life Committee's political literature urges its followers not to overlook the importance of Federal judges at the district and appeals level to their cause. ''It is these courts that have time and time again struck down the state abortion regulations, and only a small percentage of their decisions are ever reviewed by the Supreme Court,'' the committee says in a booklet entitled ''Call to Conscience.'' Furthermore, it adds, these lower courts ''will be crucial to the interpretation of protective state legislation passed once Roe v. Wade is overturned.'' Dr. Willke says that if the Supreme Court reverses its 1973 decision, ''The issue will go back to the states, and remember that only a third of the states had legalized abortion before the Roe decision. ''When that happens, we're going to fight in every state legislature, and we have found them to be far more responsive to the will of the people.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IN HIS OWN WORDS: ANTONIN SCALIA ON ABORTION, BIAS AND LIBEL",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/in-his-own-words-antonin-scalia-on-abortion-bias-and-libel.html,"In the abortion situation, for example, what right exists - the right of the woman who wants an abortion to have one, or the right of the unborn child not to be aborted? In the past that was considered to be a societal decision that would be made through the democratic process. But now the courts have shown themselves willing to make that decision for us. That is the major objection most people have with the direction the courts are now taking, and it is the major reason why some people speak of an imperial judiciary. The courts' expansion stems, in part, from their function of deciding what are constitutional rights. Much of their activity is in that area, and I think they have gone too far. They have found rights where society never believed they existed. The Courts have enforced other rights, so-called, on which there is no societal agreement, from the abortion cases, at one extreme, to school dress codes and things of that sort. There is no national consensus about those things and there never has been. The courts have no business being there. That is one of the problems; they are calling rights things which we do not all agree on.'' - From a debate Dec. 12, 1978, at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. I have grave doubts about the wisdom of where we are going in affirmative action, and in equal protection generally. It seems to be the fact that the decisions of each of the Justices on the Court are tied together by threads of social preference and predisposition. The chaos in which we find ourselves is well-enough exemplified by Bakke itself. Four of the Justices tell us that both the Constitution and Title VI permit racial preference; four of the Justices tell us that whatever the Constitution may permit, Title VI forbids it. And the law of the land, pronounced by the one remaining Justice, apparently is that title VI is no different from the Constitution; governmental racial distinctions of any sort are ''odious to a free people'' and their validity ''inherently suspect''; they must pass ''the most exacting judicial examination,'' and can only be justified by a ''compelling'' state interest. We later learn that the ''compelling'' interest at issue in Bakke is the enormously important goal of assuring that in medical school - where we are dealing with students in an age range of 22 to 28, or in Bakke's case, 33 to 39 - we will expose these impressionable youngsters to a great diversity of people. We want them to work and play with pianists, maybe flute players. We want people from the country, from the city. We want bespectacled chess champions and football players. And, oh yes, we may want some racial minorities, too. If that is all it takes to overcome the presumption against discrimination by race, we have witnessed an historic trivialization of the Constitution. Justice Powell's opinion, which we must work with as the law of the land, is thoroughly unconvincing as an honest, hard-minded, reasoned analysis of an important provision of the Constitution. Another example of pretense or self-delusion: The Department of Labor regulations concerning goals for hiring to overcome ''underutilization'' read as follows: ''The purpose of a contractor's establishment and use of goals is to insure that he meets his affirmative action obligation. It is not intended and should not be used to discriminate against any applicant or employee because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.'' This is, quite literally, incredible. Once there is established a numerical figure, the failure to meet it will have material, adverse consequences; namely, the substantial risk of cutoff of Government contracts and the substantial certainty of disruptive and expensive Government investigations. All that we know about human nature and human motivations indicates quite clearly that discrimination often will be produced in an effort to meet or exceed the magic number. I am a businessman who has, let us say, six more jobs to fill, and I am three short of my minority ''goal.'' Reaching the goal will render my Government contracts secure and will save thousands of dollars in the expenses necessary to comply with the demands of an equal employment investigation. If I consult my self-interest, which people tend to do, I will hire three minority applicants, even if they are somewhat less qualified than others. When the results that are inevitable are compared with the results that are said to be ''intended,'' one must conclude that the drafter of the regulation is either fooling us or fooling himself. My father came to this country when he was a teen-ager. Not only had he never profited from the sweat of any black man's brow, I don't think he had ever seen a black man. There are, of course, many white ethnic groups that came to this country in great numbers relatively late in its history - Italians, Jews, Poles -who not only took no part in, and derived no profit from, the major historic suppression of the currently acknowledged minority groups, but were, in fact, themselves the object of discrimination by the dominant Anglo-Saxon majority. To be sure, in relatively recent years some or all of these groups have been the beneficiaries of discrimination against blacks, or have themselves practiced discrimination. but to compare their racial debt - I must use that term, since the concept of ''restorative justice'' implies it; there is no creditor without a debtor - with that of those who plied the slave trade, and who maintained a formal caste system for many years thereafter, is to confuse a mountain with a molehill. Yet curiously enough, we find that in the system of restorative justice established by the Wisdoms and the Powells and the Whites, it is precisely these groups that do most of the restoring. It is they who, to a disproportionate degree, are the competitors with the urban blacks and Hispanics for jobs, housing, education. But I not only question the principle upon which racial affirmative action is based; I even question its effectiveness in achieving the desired goal of advancing a particular race. When one reads the Bakke case, the most striking factual data is the enormous divergence in the average college grades and average test scores of the regular admittees and the special (minority) admittees of the Davis Medical School. Do you suppose the ''image'' of minority groups has been improved by this? I suggest that, to the contrary, the very ability of minority group members to distinguish themselves and their race has been dreadfully impaired. To put the issue to you in its starkest form: If you must select your brain surgeon from among recent graduates of Davis Medical School and have nothing to go on but their names and pictures, would you not be well advised - playing the odds - to eliminate all minority group members? The person who was so ignorant as to say ''a Negro simply cannot become a truly outstanding doctor'' can now plausibly add ''and the fact that he obtained a degree from one of the best medical schools in the country doesn't prove a thing.'' I am, in short, opposed to racial affirmative action for reasons of both principle and practicality. Sex-based affirmative action presents somewhat different constitutional issues, but it seems to me an equally poor idea, for many of the reasons suggested above. I do not, on the other hand, oppose - indeed, I strongly favor - what might be called (but for the coloration that the term has acquired in the context of its past use) ''affirmative action programs'' of many types of help for the poor and disadvantaged. It may well be that many, or even most, of thoske benefited by such programs would be members of minority races that the existing programs exclusively favor. I would not care if all of them were. The unacceptable vice is simply selecting or rejecting them on the basis of their race. A person espousing the views I have expressed, of course, exposes himself to charges of, at best, insensitivity or, at worst, bigotry. That is one reason these views are not expressed more often, particularly in academia. Beyond an anticipatory denial, I must content myself with the observation that it must be a queer sort of bigotry indeed, since it is shared by many intelligent members of the alleged target group. Some of the most vocal opposition to racial affirmative action comes from minority group members who have seen the value of their accomplishments debased by the suspicion - no, to be frank, the reality - of a lower standard for their group in the universities and professions. This new racial presumption, imposed upon those who have lifted themselves above the effects of old racial presumptions, is the most evil fruit of a fundamentally bad seed. From racist principles flow racist results. - From a 1979 article in Washington University Law Quarterly. More plaintiffs should bear in mind that it is a normal human reaction, after painstakingly examining and rejecting thirty invalid and almost absurd contentions, to reject the thirty-first contention as well, and make a clean sweep of the matter. I have no other explanation for the majority's affirmance of summary judgment dismissing what seems to me a classic and cooly crafted libel, Evans and Novak's disparagement of Ollman's professional reputation. The concurrence perceives a ''modern problem'' consisting of the ''freshening stream of libel actions, which . . . may threaten the public and constitutional interest in free, and frequently rough, discussion,'' and of claims for damages that are ''quite capable of silencing political commentators forever.'' Perhaps that perception is correct, though it is hard to square with the explosion of communications in general, and political commentary in particular, in this ''Media Age.'' But then again, perhaps those are right who discern a distressing tendency for our political commentary to descend from discussion of public issues to destruction of private reputations; who believe that, by putting some brake upon that tendency, defamation liability under existing standards not only does not impair but fosters the type of discussion the first amendment is most concerned to protect; and who view high libel judgments as no more than an accurate reflection of the fastly expanded damage that can be caused by media that are capable of holding individuals up to public obloquy from coast to coast and that reap financial rewards commensurate with that power. I do not know the answers to these questions, but I do know that it is frightening to think that the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional rule (the willfully false disparagement of professional reputation in the context of political commentary cannot be actionable) is to depend upon our ongoing personal assessments of such sociological factors. And not only is our cloistered capacity to identify ''modern problems'' suspect, but our ability to provide condign solutions through the rude means of constitutional prohibition is nonexistent. What a strange notion that the problem of excessive libel awards should be solved by permitting, in political debate, intentional destruction of reputation - rather than by placing a legislative limit upon the amount of libel recovery. It has not often been thought, by the way, that the press is among the least effective of legislative lobbyists. - From a 1984 dissenting opinion in Ollman v. Evans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SCALIA'S VIEWS, STYLISHLY EXPRESSED, LINE UP WITH REAGAN'S",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/scalia-s-views-stylishly-expressed-line-up-with-reagan-s.html,"Judge Antonin Scalia, whom President Reagan said Tuesday he will name to the Supreme Court, has criticized several major Supreme Court precedents and expressed clear views contrary to existing law on a wide range of contentious issues. His writings over the years have advocated positions almost perfectly consistent with the Reagan Administration's conservative legal and political agenda, and considerably more so than the judicial opinions of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who is retiring. Among the issues on which Judge Scalia's conservative views appear to match those of the Administration closely are abortion, desegregation through busing, preferences for women and members of minority groups, the Freedom of Information Act, and the need to curb lawsuits and to reduce the role of the courts in making policy. While largely unknown to the general public, Judge Scalia's record, both before and after Mr. Reagan named him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1982, has been closely studied by Justice Department officials. They liked virtually everything they saw and have long listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect. These officials view his planned elevation as a capstone of their efforts - which experts call the most systematic by any Administration in modern history -to reverse the course of the Federal judiciary. 'Imperial Judiciary' Assailed In opinions, articles and debates, Judge Scalia has said or strongly suggested, among other things, that the Supreme Court was wrong to recognize a constitutional right to abortion, to approve ''racial affirmative action,'' to order busing as a desegregation remedy and to strike down all existing death penalty laws in 1972. He has assailed what he calls the ''imperial judiciary'' as deciding issues it has no business deciding and as usurping the powers of other branches of Government and of the states. He has criticized Congress as ducking political responsibility by writing righteous-sounding legislation so vague as to be ''absolutely meaningless.'' The result, he said, is that ''unelected judges are left to determine its real content.'' He has questioned both the constitutional basis for and the policy justification for acts of Congress that insulate more than a dozen independent agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve Board, from Presidential control. He is viewed by libel experts as deeply hostile to Supreme Court rulings that, he has said, have ''fulsomely assured'' the protection of the press from libel suits by public officials and public figures. In expressing his views, Judge Scalia has won a reputation as one of the smartest, wittiest and most cogent stylists on the Federal courts, using a combination of rigorous logic, caustic irony and elegant rhetoric to skewer his opponents. This talent, which along with an appealing personality made him all the more attractive to conservatives seeking a champion at the Supreme Court, is viewed by some critics of his views with a mixture of concern - because it could magnify his impact - and admiration. 'He's Savagely Subtle' Bruce Sanford, a Washington lawyer and libel expert, said in an interview several months ago that Judge Scalia was viewed by press lawyers ''as one of the worst judges in the country on First Amendment and libel issues.'' Mr. Sanford added, however: ''He's enormously intelligent. Ironically he is one of the best writers currently serving on the courts of appeals. What that man does with language in opinions is beautiful. He's humorous, he's savagely subtle, he's absolutely scathing at times, and just in reading it you can feel the emotional commitment that he has to his views in the libel area.'' In a 1979 article attacking affirmative action preferences for members of minority groups, for example, Judge Scalia, stressing his own freedom from any notion of inherited racial guilt as the son of an Italian immigrant, facetiously suggested that if the nation's whites really wanted to repay a ''racial debt'' to various groups, a more finely tuned system could be devised: ''I have developed a modest proposal, which I call R.J.H.S. - the Restorative Justice Handicapping System. I only have applied it thus far to restorative justice for the Negro, since obviously he has been the victim of the most widespread and systematic exploitation in this country; but a similar system could be devised for other creditor-races, creditor-sexes or minority groups. ''Under my system each individual in society would be assigned at birth Restorative Justice Handicapping Points, determined on the basis of his or her ancestry. Obviously, the highest number of points must go to what we may loosely call the Aryans - the Powells, the Whites, the Stewarts, the Burgers, and in fact (curiously enough), the entire composition of the present Supreme Court, with the exception of Justice Marshall. 'Justices Would Not Shrink' ''This grouping of North European races obviously played the greatest role in the suppression of the American black. But unfortunately, what was good enough for Nazi Germany is not good enough for our purposes. We must further divide the Aryans into subgroups.'' Noting that ''the Irish (having arrived later) probably owe less of a racial debt than the Germans,'' for example, he added: ''It will, to be sure, be difficult drawing precise lines and establishing the correct number of handicapping points, but having reviewed the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on abortion, I am convinced that our Justices would not shrink from the task.'' Judge Scalia also used a splenetic pen in a 1982 article titled ''The Freedom of Information Act Has No Clothes,'' in which he assailed the 1974 amendments liberalizing the law, which requires Federal agencies to open their files to citizens, as a ''disaster.'' This law, he said, ''is the Taj Mahal of the Doctrine of Unanticipated Consequences, the Sistine Chapel of Cost-Benefit Analysis Ignored.'' The amendments, he asserted, have ''greatly burdened investigative agencies and the courts,'' adding: ''They were promoted as a boon to the press, the public interest group, the little guy; they have been used most frequently by corporate lawyers.'' Abortion a Societal Decision On abortion, Judge Scalia - a Catholic who is said to oppose it -said in a 1978 debate: ''In the abortion situation, for example, what right exists - the right of the woman who wants an abortion to have one, or the right of the unborn child not to be aborted? ''In the past that was considered to be a societal decision that would be made through the democratic process,'' he said, ''but now the courts have shown themselves willing to make that decision for us.'' He added, ''The courts have no business being there.'' In his judicial opinions, he has not challenged overtly the wisdom of Federal statutes or of Supreme Court precedents, which lower court judges are bound to follow. The criticial views he expressed as a law professor on the Freedom of Information Act ''would have nothing to do with my interpretation of it if I were sitting as a judge,'' he said in his 1982 confirmation testimony. Nevertheless, he has managed to delight conservatives with majority, concurring and dissenting opinions that have called for deference to Presidential decisions touching on foreign policy, cutting back on access to the courts and holding acountable in libel suits ''media that are capable of holding individuals up to public obloquy from coast to coast and that reap financial rewards commensurate with that power.'' Activism Can Be Conservative But inevitably, Judge Scalia cannot please all of the conservatives all of the time. For example, some conservatives would like to see the courts go from the present broad protection of abortion rights to the opposite extreme of ruling that the Constitution requires states to ban abortion on the ground that a fetus is a ''person'' with a constitutional right to life. Judge Scalia has not publicly suggested agreement with this view, which would clash with his statements that such issues should be decided by the elected reprsentatives of the people. It is more likely, say conservatives including Bruce Fein, a constitutional expert with the American Enterprise Institute here, that he would vote to allow states to prohibit or to allow abortions as they choose. While conservative critics of the Supreme Court have often assailed its ''liberal judicial activism,'' Judge Scalia has recognized that judicial activism is a tool sometimes used by conservatives as well as liberals - both may be tempted to use vague constitutional phrases as a mandate for striking down laws they do not like. He is a free-market advocate who favors economic deregulation as a matter of policy. But in a 1985 article, he expressed disagreement with conservative scholars who have called for striking down many economic regulations as unconstitutional. ''This issue presents something of a moment of truth for many conservatives who have been criticizing the courts in recent years,'' he said. ''They must decide whether they really believe, as they have been saying, that the courts are doing too much, or whether they are actually nursing only the less principled grievance that the courts have not been doing what they want.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SPANISH RIGHTIST IS RUNNING HARD, BUT UPHILL",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/world/spanish-rightist-is-running-hard-but-uphill.html,"This balmy Mediterranean island of stone windmills and rocky coves is one of Spain's favorite hideaways, but Manuel Fraga Iribarne was not here to relax. National elections are scheduled for June 22 and Mr. Fraga is the leader of the main conservative alliance, the Popular Coalition. It has been his frustrating job to try to overtake the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez while holding together the fractious Spanish right. An ample 63-year-old man of irrepressible energy, he toured a book fair at the foot of a Moorish castle and tousled children's hair. He acted as host of a radio call-in show, gave a luncheon pep talk to party leaders and delivered a tub-thumping speech to a nighttime rally of some 5,000 faithful in a gymnasium. Attacking a Communist-led longshoremen's strike that has backed up the port here, he was lustily cheered when he said, ''It only demonstrates that we have a weak Government that bends before problems.'' Polls indicate that while the Socialists might lose their parliamentary majority, they are still expected to win overwhelmingly and to continue governing in a minority. Even worse for Mr. Fraga, the polls suggest that the Popular Coalition is likely to some of the 106 seats it now holds in the 350-member Congress of Deputies to centrist and regional parties. Mr. Fraga is both the right's handicap and its hope. As a former minister under Francisco Franco, he is rejected even by many conservatives. But as a relative moderate and a towering figure of the transition to democracy, he has been the only conservative able so far to unite the former Francoists with much of the moderate center-right. Moreover, he appears to have no intention of stepping aside. ''I advise all of those who want to retire me to have patience, because they are going to need it,'' he said recently. Mr. Fraga is the classic case of the man who tried to change things from within. He was Franco's Minister of Information and Tourism for seven years before being replaced in 1969 as too liberal. He was appointed Ambassador to London in 1973 and on Franco's death in 1975 returned to be Interior Minister. He was widely expected to be named head of a transition government, but instead King Juan Carlos chose a relative unknown, Adolfo Suarez. Mr. Fraga, a political law professor enamored of British parliamentary democracy, rebounded to be an author of the country's liberal 1978 Constitution and was a key figure in keeping nostalgic Franco supporters in line. His own party, Popular Alliance, is made up largely of the urban upper classes and the rural lower ones. He formed Popular Coalition with two small center-right parties, the Popular Democrats and the Liberals. Mr. Fraga has fiercely attacked such legislation as the legalization of some abortions and increased state control over state-financed church schools. These moral stands have been largely unpopular, however, and in the campaign he has focused on the country's high unemployment, crime and what he calls the arrogance of the Socialists. A frugal man, Mr. Fraga flew tourist class on the flight here from Madrid while Mr. Suarez, also a candidate, was in the first-class cabin. Here he has accused the Socialists of ''living in castles'' and driving big cars. The main challenges he faces on the right are from Mr. Suarez and Miguel Roca, a Catalan center-rightist who has put together a regional-based candidacy under the Democratic Reform Party. Polls predict that Mr. Roca could pick up one of Popular Coalition's two seats from the Balearic region, which includes this and other islands. ''There is no midway,'' Mr. Fraga said at the rally here in an attempt to discredit votes for the others as wasted. ''There is Felipe Gonzalez or us.'' Walking wearily down the airport ramp here to catch a late night flight to Madrid, Mr. Fraga said: ''I'm not going to rest until the campaign is over. And then I'm going to take two or three days and go trout fishing.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE REHNQUIST FACTOR; His Supreme Court Opinions Clearly Show An Abiding Conservatism, Past and Present",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/rehnquist-factor-his-supreme-court-opinions-clearly-show-abiding-conservatism.html,"William H. Rehnquist has spent his 14 years on the Supreme Court at the cutting edge of conservative legal doctrine. The Court has not always followed him, but it has always had to respond to his strongly held views and distinctive voice. On Tuesday, President Reagan chose him for Chief Justice. As such, he would still have only one vote; a Chief Justice is first among equals only if an innate ability to lead and persuade makes him a center of gravity in an institution that has been described as nine separate law firms. Even with the addition of Antonin Scalia, who is likely to be the new Chief Justice's strong ideological ally, the Court's dominant bloc will continue to be the moderate center that has prevented any dramatic doctrinal change over the 17 years of Warren E. Burger's tenure. Power to Assign Opinions But in perhaps subtle ways, Justice Rehnquist's new position is almost certain to enhance his influence in an institution where he already casts a large shadow. The Chief Justice has the power to assign opinions in cases in which he is in the majority. This is an important power because the Justice who circulates the initial draft of an opinion, particularly in a sensitive case on which the Court is closely divided, is the one who frames the issue and defines the terms of the debate. Chief Justice Burger often called on Justice Rehnquist to play this role, and he in turn can be expected to make strategic use of the opinion-assigning power. In the past, Justice Rehnquist has been content to be a dissenter, or at least to write a separate opinion if the majority opinion did not precisely embody his views. Indications of New Interest But there are recent signs that he may have a growing interest in helping the Court to speak with one voice. For example, he joined the plurality opinion in a racial discrimination case last month although that opinion's guarded endorsement of affirmative action was at variance with his own firmly stated opposition to that approach in other decisions. William Rehnquist was a known quantity in 1971 when President Nixon, whom he served as an Assistant Attorney General, named him to the Court. He had testified before Congressional committees 18 times to present the Nixon Administration's views on criminal law and other legal issues. Those who followed his career then have rarely been surprised by his positions in the intervening years. Nine years ago, five years into Justice Rehnquist's tenure, the Harvard Law Review published a 64-page ''preliminary'' appraisal by Prof. David L. Shapiro. Its conclusions still appear valid. Professor Shapiro analyzed Justice Rehnquist's votes in hundreds of cases and concluded that the Justice was guided by these three basic propositions: * Conflicts between the individual and the Government should be resolved against the individual. * Conflicts between state and Federal authority should be resolved in favor of the states. * Questions of the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts should be resolved against such exercise. Among Justice Rehnquist's more than 200 majority opinions are several that overturned broad remedial orders issued by lower courts to correct such problems as mistreatment of the institutionalized retarded, abuse of civilians by the police in Philadelphia and overcrowding in the Federal prison in Manhattan. There is not ''some sort of one-man, one-cell principle lurking in the due process clause,'' he wrote in the opinion on prison crowding. Curb on Rights of Suspects He has provided the Court's most consistent vote for limiting the rights of criminal suspects and defendants. He wrote the 1984 opinion that created the first substantial exception to the Court's 1966 Miranda rule, permitting the police to question suspects without the requisite warnings in the interest of ''public safety.'' He has argued vigorously, in opinions and speeches, for a speedier conclusion to criminal appeals, particularly death sentence appeals. ''The existence of the death penalty in this country is virtually an illusion,'' he wrote five years ago in a dissenting opinion that within a few years came to express the majority's sentiment. One of his strengths as a Supreme Court strategist has been patience, a willingness to persist in expressing a minority view. Sometimes a majority comes to his side eventually and sometimes it does not, but in the process Justice Rehnquist succeeds in shifting the terms of the debate. He has dissented from most of the Court's decisions upholding various remedies for racial discrimination, from busing to affirmative action. The Constitution does not require school boards to ''follow a policy of 'integration uber alles,' '' he wrote in dissent in a 1979 case upholding busing in Columbus, Ohio. His was the only dissenting vote in the 1983 case that upheld the Federal Government's policy denying a Federal tax deduction for Bob Jones University, which adhered to racially discriminatory policies. Dissent on Abortion Rulings Justice Rehnquist has also been a consistent dissenter from the Court's abortion rulings. He has also argued consistently, sometimes for a majority and sometimes in dissent, that the Constitution does not require a strict separation between church and state. He prevailed in 1984, writing the opinion for a 5-to-4 majority that upheld a Minnesota law providing for tax deductions for parochial school tuition. He was the lone dissenter in 1982 from an opinion by Chief Justice Burger holding that Massachusetts could not give churches a veto power over the awarding of nearby liquor licenses. ''The state can constitutionally protect churches from liquor for the same reasons it can protect them from fire,'' he wrote. His most detailed expression of views on church and state came a year ago. He dissented from the Court's decision that an Alabama law providing for a ''moment of silence'' in the public schools was unconstitutional. The notion that the Constitution requires a ''wall of separation'' between church and state, he wrote, ''should be frankly and explicitly abandoned.'' Affinity to Meese View Justice Rehnquist has come closer than anyone else on the Court to endorsing the view of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d that the Constitution should be interpreted in light of the intention of its 18th-century framers. ''If a constitutional theory has no basis in the history of the amendment it seeks to interpret, is difficult to apply and yields unprincipled results, I see little use in it,'' he wrote in the Alabama case. If Justice Rehnquist's words are sometimes sharp, they are almost always original. He delights in aphorism and metaphor. When he invokes American history to make a point, it is likely to be a chapter from the history of the American West. The Court may well be a more collegial institution under his leadership than it has been under Chief Justice Burger. He has good personal relations with his colleagues as well as with Court employees, many of whom regarded Chief Justice Burger as aloof and overly concerned with protocol but view Justice Rehnquist as informal and approachable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
O'CONNER WAS ALSO REPORTED CONTENDER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/o-conner-was-also-reported-contender.html,"Reagan Administration officials and conservatives close to the White House said today that Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had been a key contender to replace Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States. They said, however, that she was rejected in favor of William H. Rehnquist on the ground that she was relatively new to the Supreme Court. Officials also said that Robert H. Bork, a prominent conservative legal scholar who is a judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, was seriously considered for the Supreme Court seat that will be vacated by Justice Rehnquist, if his nomination is approved by the Senate. Age Reported a Factor But Judge Bork was rejected in favor his colleague on the appeals court, Judge Antonin Scalia. Among the factors that weighed in Judge Scalia's favor was his age; Judge Scalia is 50 years old while Judge Bork is 59. Another was the political advantages for the Republican Party from President Reagan's selecting the first Italian-American to serve on the Court, officials said. White House officials, meanwhile, predicted rapid Senate confirmation of Justice Rehnquist as the nation's Chief Justice and of Judge Scalia to replace him as Associate Justice. Officials said the nominations would be transmitted to the Senate shortly after July 4 and the White House hoped confirmation could take place before a recess scheduled to start on Aug. 15. ''My reading of the reaction on the Hill has been very positive and the measure of support on both sides of the House should bring about a smooth confirmation for both nominees,'' said William L. Ball 3d, assistant to the President for legislative affairs. The Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Senate must endorse the nominees by a majority vote. Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he expected ''no particular strong opposition'' to Justice Rehnquist, the Court's leading conservative since his appointment by President Nixon in 1971. White House and Congressional aides, however, expect prolonged and aggressive questioning by Democrats of the two nominees in view of their conservative positions that generally mirror Mr. Reagan's stance on social and civil-liberties issues, including abortion, affirmative action and criminal procedure. In selecting Justice Rehnquist to replace Chief Justice Burger, as well as selecting Judge Scalia, Mr. Reagan has the opportunity to set in motion fundamental and long-term shifts in the Supreme Court that would insure conservative strength, and possibly a conservative majority, beyond the Reagan term. Moreover, Mr. Reagan may have other prospects of nominating Justices to the Court. Two of the most liberal Justices are William J. Brennan Jr., 80, and Thurgood Marshall, 77. #3 Involved in the Process The three Administration officials involved in the selection process for the Court, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, and Peter J. Wallison, the counsel to the President, declined to discuss details. Administration aides, however, as well as conservatives close to the White House, said that Justice O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, was a key figure on the list but was rejected, in part, because she was relatively new to the Court. Justice O'Connor, who is 56, was named to the Court by Mr. Reagan in 1981. Mr. Reagan had instructed the group to seek candidates among the ranks of sitting Supreme Court Justices and those already on the bench. A list of 10 to 15 candidates for Chief Justice were drawn up, White House officials said. It was unclear if Justice O'Connor's decisions in a number of cases this year, involving school prayer, libel and abortion, may have rankled the Administration. But one conservative source close to the White House said, ''It would be wrong to pick and choose one or two decisions where she may have disagreed and say, 'A-ha, she wasn't philosophically pure.' You cannot assume that.'' Instead, this source and officials said, Justice Rehnquist's 14 years on the Supreme Court, marking him as a consistent and highly articulate voice of conservative doctrine involving affirmative action, tuition tax credits for parochial schools, the death penalty, abortion and other issues made him Mr. Reagan's favored choice. ''Rehnquist had many things going for him,'' said one official, who cited the 61-year-old Justice's brilliance, his consistency, his ability to get along with colleagues. In selecting Judge Scalia over Judge Bork, Administration officials and others close to the White House cited several factors, including age. Bork Opinions Cited In addition, Judge Bork has a reputation as an accomplished intellectual scholar, but some of his opinions may have upset the Administration, including one in 1984 in favor of a Marxist professor seeking to sue the syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak for disparaging comments. Judge Scalia, on the other hand, dissented. Conservatives close to the Administration and to Mr. Meese and others said, however, that the selection of Judge Scalia was not based merely on ideological grounds or on the judge's strong reputation, even among liberals. Beyond this central fact was that Judge Scalia is the father of nine, the son of Catholic immigrants from Sicily, and the first Italian-American nominated to the Supreme Court, said sources close to the Administration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/books/books-of-the-times-430686.html,"STORM CENTER: The Supreme Court in American Politics. By David M. O' Brien. Illustrated. 384 pages. W. W. Norton. $18.95. LIKE the centers of real storms, the Supreme Court is a tranquil area. Despite clashes of ideology and personality and the occasional testy exchange, it operates by a set of rituals, traditions and customs developed over decades that make it a more orderly and courteous place than its coequal branches of Government. Nonetheless, as David M. O'Brien shows in his timely and illuminating analysis, from the appointment of Justices to their choice of cases to the phrasing of decisions, the High Court is as subject to the political weather as Congress and the executive branch. He demonstrates, in an undemonstrative way, that the power of America's pre-eminently anti-democratic and countermajoritarian institution rests upon the approval or acquiescence of the nation. Although when we think about politics, we tend to focus on the elected branches, Alexis de Tocqueville was his usual acute and quotable self when he observed, ''Scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question.'' The Court becomes what Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes called a ''storm centre'' when it addresses a passion-stirring issue - integration, crime, abortion, affirmative action. ''Storm Center'' draws its examples mainly from such bubbling issues. In reporting on the workings of the Burger Court, now in process of giving way to the Rehnquist Court, Mr. O'Brien, who teaches at the University of Virginia, is much less gossipy but more solid than Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, whose 1979 book, ''The Brethren,'' dwelt largely on the interplay of personality. Mr. O'Brien offers figures demonstrating that although the Burger Court has proved more conservative than the Warren Court, it has been even more ''activist,'' as measured by the number of laws it has overturned. It has also been notable for the number of dissents and, of special interest, the number of decisions by plurality rather than majority. Given the fact that the Court is an oligarchy and everything depends on nine lords, each of whom is likely to have strong opinions and a forceful personality, it would be surprising if personal animosities did not find their way into its proceedings. Mr. O'Brien recalls that Justice James C. McReynolds, whom he describes as anti-Semitic, would leave the conference room whenever Justice Louis D. Brandeis spoke. But Mr. O'Brien maintains convincingly that extraneous irritations play no great part in the great decisions. The Justices are constrained by the forms of courtesy built into the Court's procedures (they all shake hands before a conference), by the delicacy of its political position and by other institutional and prudential considerations; unexpected alliances are formed on touchy issues. Mr. O'Brien is less interested in blow-by-blow accounts of battles -though he provides several good ones - than in exploring the Court's structure and operations. He confirms what has become common knowledge, that Justices are often chosen for their seeming ideological affinity to a sitting President, only to disappoint their benefactor once installed. Everyone's favorite example, of course, is President Dwight D. Eisenhower's selection of Chief Justice Earl Warren. (President Reagan's advisers evidently know their history; his latest nominations to the Court seem studiously intended to avoid any such surprises.) Mr. O'Brien is clear and interesting on the way the Justices apportion their work. He reports that law clerks have gained influence in recent years, as the workload has increased, but finds their influence to be less than readers of ''The Brethren'' must have concluded. (The difference may be connected with the fact that Mr. Woodward and Mr. Armstrong obtained so much of their information from the clerks.) Despite the high value that the Court has placed on collegiality since the time of Chief Justice John Marshall and the strong desire for consensus, especially on momentous matters, major decisions have sometimes been bewilderingly fragmented. Lower courts attempting to make sense of a decade of rulings on affirmative action cases, for example, still have their work cut out. Even when the Justices can agree on a contentious issue, they often show an awareness of the limits of their powers. The most dramatic example came in Brown v. Board of Education, when a unanimous Court struck down ''separate but equal'' schools. Even the Justices on high could see that the South was in no mood to implement desegregation, and the Court added the phrase, ''with all deliberate speed,'' which everyone understood to mean, unspeedy. A degree of civil tranquillity was thus purchased by giving the South a prolonged breathing space; it would be a decade before the nation was ready for the other branches of Government to produce a civil rights act that put muscle into the 1954 decision. Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley was sharp, as usual, when he noted that ''th' supreme court follows th' iliction returns.'' The Court, Mr. O'Brien shows, has no stomach for taking on the whole country. It tends to choose its arena and its moment judiciously and even so has seen its decisions undercut by Congress. The tree of precedent has often been shaken by the winds of public opinion. Mr. O'Brien's summation is as tempered as the rest of his valuable book: ''Major confrontations in constitutional politics, like those over school desegregation, school prayer, and abortion, are determined as much by what is possible in a system of free government and in a pluralistic society as by what the Court says about the meaning of the Constitution.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ARCHDIOCESE TRIES MARKET RESEARCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/nyregion/archdiocese-tries-market-research.html,"Does your priest talk too much about money? Are you happy with his sermons? What's your opinion on the church's stand on women's issues? Is the church providing enough help for working parents, drug addicts and the homeless? The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which for generations has offered guidance on a wide array of issues, is turning the tables and asking New Yorkers, essentially, ''How are we doing?'' With market research help from the accounting concern of Arthur Young & Company and the advertising agency BBDO, the archdiocese has prepared a sophisticated questionnaire and distributed it, in seven languages, to worshipers in its 410 parishes. In an effort to seek the opinions of unaffiliated Catholics, Protestants and Jews, the questionnaire was printed yesterday in New York City's major daily newspapers, as well as in suburban papers and the ethnic press, including the Irish Echo, Il Progresso, El Diario and The New York Amsterdam News. The church began to use advertising on a large scale for the first time last year in its ''Come Home at Christmas'' campaign, which was aimed at alienated Catholics. Crateloads of Responses Once the information from the questionnaires is gathered, collated and processed, it will be used to frame the issues that will be presented before the coming archdiocesan synod. The synod, which was proposed by John Cardinal O'Connor soon after he became Archbishhop of New York two years ago, will be held either next year or in 1988. The New York archdiocese - with 1.8 million Catholics, the fourth largest in the nation - is made up of Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and seven upstate counties. Responses were coming in by the crateload yesterday at the synod office at the Catholic Center at 1011 First Avenue, at 55th Street. ''I don't know if they are positive or negative,'' said Robert Dunne, one of three seminarians sorting through the boxes at the office, ''but it is clear that people have thought out the issues.'' There are 38 questions on the form in such areas as church leadership, parish performance, family life and Catholic education. Some of the questions are geared specifically to Catholics, such as those concerning priests, the liturgy and the participation of lay people. Other questions, on international issues, interfaith dialogue and help for working parents, are for the broader non-Catholic audience. Filling in Blank Lines There are also three blank lines on the form so that people can add their own concerns and a series of questions on the demographics - including faith, education and age - of the respondent. While there are questions about ''women's issues'' and ''church teaching on sexual morality,'' some of the most controversial issues facing the church, including the church's opposition to abortion, to birth control and to homosexual behavior, are not to be found on the form. The questionnaire also does not solicit opinions on the church's opposition to women serving as priests and its insistence that priests be celibate. Neither does it deal with an issue important to many older Catholics, namely the revival of the Latin mass. ''We did not want to raise people's hopes that we could decide at the synod on areas that are already fully defined by the church,'' said the Rev. James R. Moore, who is representing priests on the coordinating committee for the synod. ''These are not under the realm of our Cardinal.'' A synod is a gathering of church officials usually called for the purpose of reviewing church policy. Last year, Pope John Paul II held a synod to assess the decisions of the Second Vatican Council. While Vatican synods are for cardinals, bishops and other members of the heirarchy, synods on the local level may also include members of religious orders, deacons and lay people. The last New York synod was held in 1950 by Francis Cardinal Spellman. At the time, the code of canon law allowed only priests to participate. The code was revised in 1983. Deciding on Issues to Study About 250 people will attend the New York synod, according to Father Moore, who is coordinating the project with Sister Janet Baxendale, representing religious orders, and Haydee Borges, the lay representative. The synod members will consider proposals put forward by commissions that will study various issues of church life. One of the purposes of the current questionnaire is to decide what issues should be included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Court Reflecting Its Country,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/opinion/a-court-reflecting-its-country.html,"How should we remember the Burger Court? Probably best as a study in contradictions. For 17 years Warren Burger tried to lead the Court away from its prior activism, and he succeeded often. Yet his Court handed down abortion decisions that made the Warren Court look strict-constructionist. Chief Justice Burger wanted to brake the civil rights revolution but he himself refused to abandon affirmative action and gave equal rights for women their first enforcement. The 15th Chief Justice lacked the votes to complete his main mission, to reduce the influence of court rulings in American life. President Nixon, who appointed him, had the same goal, yet three of the four Nixon appointees discovered a constitutional right to choose an abortion. A volatile electorate bounded from Nixon to Carter to Reagan, while the Burger Court had to speak also with the voices of Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Ford. The Court splintered more than it polarized, reflecting the fractious moods of the electorate. In a crisis, however, the Burger Court could deliver. Perhaps its proudest moment came in 1974 when it unanimously ordered Richard Nixon to turn over the White House tape that proved his undoing in Watergate. The Chief Justice referred back to John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison to tell a recalcitrant President that ''it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.'' Chief Justice Burger can be believed when he says that was not his toughest case. He venerates Presidential power and found it easy to write executive privilege into the Constitution. But as a law-and-order justice, he found it just as easy to state that even a President's privilege must yield to a legitimate grand jury inquiry. With a similarly cold eye on institutional order, the Chief Justice delivered the opinion that struck down the legislative veto. In one of history's major statements on the proper relationship among government's branches, he held that Congress could not block Presidential action without passing a proper law. At times, however, this leader was forced to follow. The Court spoke through the Chief Justice in the 1971 Swann case upholding busing as a tool for school desegregation, but the words were forced upon him by fellow justices. In time, he and the other Nixon appointees dissented in a school case, breaking years of unanimity on civil rights matters. Yet as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor observed recently, the Court had again developed ''a degree of unanimity'' on the divisive issue of affirmative action to redress job discrimination. The Court rejected Justice Burger's bid to overrule Miranda v. Arizona, which bars illegally obtained confessions. But he had more success with a campaign he brought to the Court to limit the exclusionary rule that suppresses evidence obtained in illegal searches and seizures. The Burger Court, then, should be remembered as much for registering the turbulence of its years as for its impact on them. Like the public at large, it could not finally reconcile the conflicts of values that so massively now lead contestants to court. The Burger Court was not much driven by any single purpose. It became a contentious Court for a contentious society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ACCEPTING DIVORCE: THE IRISH FACE A DELICATE VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/21/world/accepting-divorce-the-irish-face-a-delicate-vote.html,"With the campaign to introduce a civil right to divorce winding into its final stages, the Legion of Mary here in County Tipperary has called for a three-hour prayer vigil in the cathedral in order to preserve Ireland as the last European nation that is constitutionally committed to the Roman Catholic ideal of an indissoluble marriage bond. Proponents of a proposed constitutional amendment that is to be put to the voters in a referendum next Thursday say it is needed to deal with the spreading problem of marital breakdowns in Ireland, which may involve as many as 70,000 of an estimated 800,000 couples. Ireland, they say, has an increasing number of couples living together in stable unions who want to wed but cannot do so under the law because one of the partners has been in a marriage that failed. The argument is easier to make in middle-class areas of Dublin that would like to be seen as cosmopolitan than it is here in the rural heartland, 75 miles southwest of Dublin, where an unmarried couple living together can still cause a scandal. Fine Gael, the dominant party in the minority coalition Government in Dublin that called the referendum, is finding it harder than usual to get people here to distribute leaflets making the case for the yes vote sought by Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald, the party leader. Questions For Canvassers ''Those campaign workers the party has recruited drop the leaflets and move on quickly to the next house,'' one of them said, ''without seeking to engage voters in conversations that might prove embarrassing.'' Andy Callanan, a boiler operator who has been going door to door for the Labor Party, said he is met with a lot of sullen looks and pointed questions about how he will ever find the nerve to go to mass again. Still, Mr. Callanan added, this referendum campaign is proving to be less vicious than the one three years ago that resulted in the passage of a constitutional amendment enshrining the law against abortion. Tony O'Brien, the leader of the opposition Fianna Fail Party in the local council, who is doubling as leader of the anti-divorce campaign here although his party has avoided taking a stand on the issue, acknowledged that this referendum is a totally different matter. ''The people were going to vote against abortion no matter what,'' he said. ''But everyone knows someone who has a marriage problem.'' The recognition of the problem appeared to be widespread eight weeks ago, when Mr. FitzGerald called the referendum in fulfillment of a longstanding pledge by his party. At the start of the campaign, a poll indicated that Fine Gael had the support of only 26 percent of the voters, but 57 percent of those surveyed seemed to feel that the time had come for change on divorce. Margin of Support Narrows Later polls still showed that supporters of change on divorce had the edge, but the margin narrowed and the number of voters who said they were undecided on the issue rose sharply as the anti-divorce campaign advanced counterarguments. Mr. FitzGerald and other advocates of divorce change had been prepared to defend the amendment against an attack on religious and moral grounds by the Roman Catholic bishops. But they seemed to be thrown on the defensive when the anti-divorce groups met them on their own secular ground with arguments about property, inheritance rights and the status of women. The bishops underscored the teachings of the church but avoided stark polemics in their joint statements. The strongest condemnation from an ecclesiastical source came from Archbishop Kevin McNamara of Dublin, an outspoken conservative, who compared the effects of divorce on society to the radioactivity spread by the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. This was balanced by the spokesman for the Catholic hierarchy, Bishop Joseph Cassidy of Clonfert, who said a Catholic could vote yes on the amendment after prayer and reflection without incurring moral fault. Divorce's Money Issues The arguments that seem to be chipping away at support for the amendment focus on injustices that might occur if divorced wives and the children of a first marriage lost the family home, pension or other inheritance rights in a property settlement at the time of divorce. Behind this lurks a debate on whether Ireland would or should become more like other Western societies as a result of the introduction of divorce. Opponents of the measure have been citing statistics on family breakdown in Britain and the United States to support their case that stable marriages would be subtly undermined. One anti-divorce leaflet asserts that 93 percent of all divorced women in the United States end up below the poverty line. The American Embassy, apparently trying to avoid being drawn into the campaign, sidestepped the question when asked whether this was so. Mr. FitzGerald has complained bitterly that the anti-divorce campaign has been misrepresenting both the status quo in Ireland and the likely effects of his amendment. At present, he says, abandoned wives have no property rights and the Government is forced to spend $35 million a year to maintain them. The amendment, he says, would secure rights never previously recognized. Strict Limits Set He also says the amendment offers divorce on a highly restrictive basis, requiring proof that a marriage has failed for five years. The Government promises to introduce further legislation stiffening that constitutional requirement by requiring a legal separation lasting two years before a divorce could be granted. Still, a brochure circulated by the Anti-Divorce Campaign, a single-issue group, contends that divorce in Ireland would be less restrictive than anywhere else in the world. Speaking in the lower house of Parliament, Mary Harney, a liberal member, said Irish hypocrisy on various issues involving the family was being exposed in the campaign. ''Divorce is not new in Ireland,'' said Miss Harney, a leader of a new party called the Progressive Democrats. ''We have divorce Irish style. We have people living in marriages who do not speak to each other for many years.'' The Problems of Partition The liberal appeal also involves an argument that divorce is a necessary step toward an eventual resolution of the problems presented by Ireland's partition. Northern Ireland's Protestants have to be shown, it is argued, that the Catholic majority here is prepared to live in a secular, pluralistic society. The contentions that Ireland needs to change or that something needs to be done to assuage the fears of Protestants tend to inspire a Catholic backlash, however, and have not been pressed in the campaign. Certainly the liberal appeal is not often helpful here in County Tipperary, where the amendment banning abortion was backed by an overwhelming 8-to-1 margin three years ago. Mr. Callanan's Labor Party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, has made compassion for broken families its campaign theme. Mr. Callanan said he could sense that he was struggling against the current after doing some doorbell ringing in a middle-class section of Thurles this afternoon. A teacher, a nurse and a university student - the sort of people he felt the campaign should be attracting - had given him responses ranging from wary to hostile. ''In an area like this we should be clicking,'' he said edgily as he rang Sheila Craddock's bell. 'Betwixt and Between' ''You devil, you,'' Mrs. Craddock said, laughing, when she realized she was being asked to vote yes on divorce. Initially, she said, she thought she would support the amendment but now she was ''betwixt and between.'' ''It's too late for this lot,'' she said, meaning her generation, ''but it might matter to the next one. I've got seven of them myself, five of them daughters. I hate to think of them being knocked around in a few years' time.'' With one Sunday to go in the campaign, supporters of the amendment are waiting nervously to see whether the church will make a final effort to solidify opposition to the amendment. One possibility would be to read out a statement made by Pope John Paul II in Limerick, during his visit to Ireland in 1979. ''May Ireland always continue to give witness before the modern world,'' the Pope said, ''to her traditional commitment, corresponding to the true dignity of man, to the sanctity and indissolubility of the marriage bond.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPAIN'S NEW FACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/magazine/spain-s-new-face.html,"ASALSA BAND LED by two bare-bellied young women and a balding singer wearing a bow tie had been working up the crowd. Across the top of the green and white outdoor stage, an election banner read ''Por Buen Camino'' -On the Good Road. Then someone on the top tier of the grandstands saw him, and a thundering chant of ''Felipe, Felipe'' spread. Felipe Gonzalez Marquez, Prime Minister of Spain, stepped before the crowd in Valencia. He blushed as the cheering swept over him. AFTER NEARLY FOUR YEARS IN office, Felipe Gonzalez has emerged as one of Europe's brightest political stars. While the rest of the Continent is dominated by older leaders such as Helmut Kohl in West Germany or Margaret Thatcher in Britain, the handsome, boyish-looking Gonzalez draws throngs of cameramen and squealing teen-age fans when he visits foreign capitals. His forceful, forward-looking visions for Spain and a politically integrated Europe have made him a prized guest and speaker abroad. European Socialists are on the defensive, but he stands out as a proud exception, ''Latinizing'' the European left, as he puts it. Forty-four years old, Gonzalez is running for his second term as Prime Minister in elections scheduled for today. Even his principal opponents -Manuel Fraga Iribarne of the center-right Popular Alliance and former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez of the moderate Social Democratic Center - say that, barring any unforeseen last-minute events, the question is not whether he will win, but by how much. The elections thus seem to matter less than the attention they have focused on the country and its leadership. What lies behind the dynamism of Gonzalez and a whole new generation of Spanish political figures is a new Spain itself. The nation, which next month will observe the 50th anniversary of the start of the Spanish Civil War, has over the last decade undergone a quiet but dramatic revolution. The arts are flourishing. The famed senoritos, the idle sons of the Spanish rich, have become young professionals with rolled-up shirt sleeves, and the sons of blue-collar workers are getting college degrees. The country's young democracy is being held up as an example to other countries still laboring under dictatorships. Gonzalez has moved aggressively to restore Spain's identity and importance as a part of the West. Spain in the last six months has joined the European Community and voted to stay in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In Latin America, Gonzalez has worked to reassert Spanish influence, and has clashed with both the Reagan Administration and the Sandinistas over politics in Nicaragua. Gonzalez himself is a Latin paradox. Despite his charismatic hold on the nation, he is little known beyond his public persona. A modern television politician, he tries to avoid face-to-face campaigning. Yet, he relishes parliamentary debate. And while his party has suffered some in opinion polls, Gonzalez's own ratings have remained steadily high. He has abandoned the ideology of the old Spanish left and replaced it with large doses of pragmatism and moderation. ''What socialism, and even the left, has often represented in the south of Europe,'' he said in a recent interview, ''was this curious idea of permanently inventing the future while allowing the right to permanently govern the present. We have broken that dynamic a little. What we're dealing with here is not inventing the future. We're dealing with governing the present and transforming it with a practical vision of a freer, more equal, more just society.'' HE MAYOR OF VA-lencia, a professorial looking Socialist with horn-rimmed glasses, was the first to rise. ''Welcome to a free city, to a European city, to a democratic city,'' he said proudly. The Socialist president of the Valencian regional government spoke next in Catalan, the old language of Valencia that was banned by Franco but is now taught in the schools. Finally it was Gonzalez's turn. He strode to the podium, ran his fingers through his thick, dark hair and then surprised everyone. ''We have made errors,'' he began. ''We know you understand.'' GONZALEZ COMES OUT OF A political class marked by its youth. He was elected Prime Minister when he was 40 years old. Today, the average age of his Cabinet is barely 45. The same is true of most major opposition leaders. In the years before his party came to power, Gonzalez made a point of not wearing a tie, and though he has outgrown that small act of youthful defiance, his normal attire is an off-the-rack sports jacket. He rose to high office in the image of the boy next door - a little fiery, but honest, idealistic, even innocent. Despite the gray fanning from his temples, and despite the wear of four years in office, some of that image remains. Gonzalez and his wife, Carmen Romero, were strolling with this reporter one day recently on the leafy grounds of the Moncloa, the Prime Minister's palace. The talk turned to last year's visit by President and Mrs. Reagan. The Gonzalezes said they liked the openness of the Americans, and, as the conversation flowed, Gonzalez repeatedly referred to the Reagans as ''Nancy and Ron,'' pronouncing ''Ron'' with a Spanish-accented roll of the tongue. He did so without implying familiarity. Gonzalez and Reagan, despite their different political views, have gotten along well in three separate meetings, but Gonzalez is often uncharacteristically stiff around Reagan - not least because Reagan is fully 31 years his senior. Talking about that awkwardness during our garden stroll, Gonzalez seemed to be stepping back and looking upon himself in slight disbelief - disbelief that he was Prime Minister and his wife was first lady, that they were on equal footing with the Nancys and Rons of the world. Paradoxically, Gonzalez has Francisco Franco to thank for much of his success. Franco executed many of his political opponents, then outlived most of the rest. He ruled 36 years before his death in 1975, at the age of 82. The way was then open for a new generation. But the challenge faced by Gonzalez and his peers was not simply political. They found the need for an extraordinary national renewal, involving a shift in the Spanish character itself and a break with 400 years of Spanish illusions. The Spanish empire flourished in the 16th century, then began a slow rot for the next 400 years. European bourgeois values, liberal intellectualism, and political and religious tolerance were shut out in deference to a medieval code of honor, piety and order. Spain closed its borders to the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and even much of the Industrial Revolu-tion. Franco was only the last in a long line of leaders who sought to keep Spain ''Catholic, anti-Communist, anti-liberal and free from all outside influences,'' as he put it. Republican politicians, the few who came to power, were hardly wiser. Republican governments pursued their own wild social experiments and intolerances with an equally absolutist conviction. It all came to a head in the three-year Civil War. Gonzalez was born March 5, 1942, three years after the war, in Seville, the heart of the romantic Spain of bullfights and flamenco, of Moorish castles and whitewashed villages. The only one of four children of a dairy farmer to go to college, Gonzalez studied law at the University of Seville. It was there that he was drawn to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party by a slim bespectacled youth with an acerbic tongue, Alfonso Guerra. Twenty-five years later, Guerra, a brilliant organizer, remains Gonzalez's alter ego as Deputy Prime Minister and party disciplinarian. Gonzalez studied for six months in Belgium, then returned to set up practice as a labor lawyer. He won a reputation as a vigorous defender of workers as he and Guerra rebuilt their party - illegal activity in those days. His dedication to the party was such that in 1969 he missed the civil ceremony of his wedding to Carmen for a meeting of the party's executive committee in Bayonne, France. By 1974, Gonzalez and his colleagues had wrested control of the Spanish party by winning the backing of the Socialist International, and by befriending world-famous Socialist leaders such as Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Olaf Palme. Those men, with other European Socialists, were looking to head off a Communist takeover in Spain after Franco. They were impressed by Mr. Gonzalez's moderation, courage and organizational abilities. He counts them among his mentors. Gonzalez was arrested for his political activities in 1974, though he was freed on bail and the case was later dismissed. On the night Franco died, Gonzalez was in a Madrid apartment with friends. A Socialist sympathizer telephoned from Franco's hospital with the news. Someone joyously proposed a champagne toast, but Gonzalez objected. ''I ask please that we don't toast the death of anyone, much less a Spaniard,'' one of those there remembers Gonzalez as saying. It was indicative of the restraint and leadership that would take him through the heady years of the transition: the writing of a new Constitution, the election of two center-right governments, and finally his landslide victory in 1982. Along the way, he led the Socialists in their reconciliation with the monarchy, and today Gonzalez enjoys a warm working relationship with King Juan Carlos, still a politically influential figure after yielding the powers left him by Franco and supporting the transition to democracy. Today, the Socialists hold 202 of the 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies. They also sit as heads of 11 of the 17 autonomias, or regional governments, and overwhelmingly dominate the local boards in the country's cities and towns. The once-mighty Spanish Communist Party now holds only four seats in the Congress, down from 23 in 1979. Though the Communists under Santiago Carrillo, one of the few civil- war veterans in politics, adopted a mild form of Eurocommunism, Spaniards were as fearful of the extreme left as of a right-wing backlash. Internal divisions further weakened the party. Carrillo was finally replaced by a 40-year-old former coal miner, Gerardo Iglesias. A center-right coalition, the Popular Alliance, has 106 seats under the leadership of Manuel Fraga Iribarne, whose former post as a Franco minister limits his appeal. The far right no longer controls any seats. The remaining parliamentary seats are divided among regional parties, particularly Basque and Catalan, and small centrist factions. In addition to being the largest and most united party, the Socialists under Gonzalez have been able to capture the center at a time that the electorate has been steadily moving that way on its own. This move to the center by ordinary Spaniards, rejecting extreme options on either right or left, has given Spanish democracy a new sense of stability. In today's election, parties of the far left, supported by disenchanted left-wing Socialists, are expected to pick up several seats. Parties with regional appeal, such as the Catalonia-based Democratic Reform Party of Miguel Roca Junyent, may also pick up support. But the biggest challenge to Gonzalez's single-party majority will be the candidacy of Adolfo Suarez, who is fondly remembered as the first elected Prime Minister of the post-Franco era. Handsome and debonaire, Suarez is another member of the Gonzalez generation. According to polls, he could pick up enough seats to wield important influence. But he is unlikely to pose a direct threat to Gonzalez's hold on power. W HY IS IT THAT SPAIN never lived in peace and progress?'' Gonzalez asked the crowd. ''Why did the few steps forward end in ruin?'' He was rolling at full strength now, sermonizing with Jesuit-like fervor and didacticism. ''Never had we been able to accommodate impatience with intolerance,'' he said, referring to Spain's pattern of conflict between leftist zealots and rightist reactionaries. ''We are breaking the cycle for the first time.'' ''We have begun a project of progress,'' he said, but then his finger shot into the air. ''With realism. With realism.'' REALISM HAS BECOME A GONZALEZ trademark - for better and for worse. One recent day at the Prime Minister's palace, for instance, a meeting with the board of a state company was going pleasantly, when the union man on the board raised a longstanding request to improve pension benefits. Gonzalez answered that he wished workers would ask for less and work more. Even the businessmen in the meeting were taken aback. It was an example of Gonzalez's willingness to oppose even his supporters for what he sees as the greater good. It was also an example of what his critics call Gonzalez's ''decaffeinated socialism'' and creeping arrogance. At the heart of the wrangling is the economy. Since taking office, Gonzalez has enforced austerity in an effort to overhaul an overprotected and inefficient economy. He has cut inflation from 14 percent to around 8 percent and has slowed the ballooning national budget. Failing enterprises, including banks, shipyards and steel mills, have been shut down, bought out or merged. Such hard-nosed policy, together with Spain's recent entry into the Common Market, has sent stocks soaring, and foreign investors have arrived in strength. Japanese diplomats say their country has made Spain its No. 1 investment target in Europe. But the effect on many areas of Spain's economy has been traumatic, leaving nearly 3 million Spaniards, or 22 percent of the work force, unemployed. Labor, business, and political leaders generally agree that the austerity measures were needed. ''We have undertaken an economic policy to make business healthy so that it can begin to hire workers again,'' Gonzalez explained to a rally in Murcia. ''You have to create wealth to share it.'' But this was certainly a curious form of socialism. The fact is that Gonzalez abandoned doctrinaire socialism long ago. In 1979, he even resigned as party secretary general and returned to his post only after the Socialists had deleted Marxism from their platform. The architect of the Gonzalez policies was not the Prime Minister himself - his grasp of economics is only fair - but a former minister of the economy, Miguel Boyer, a man who is now associated both with Gonzalez's greatest successes and his most embarrassing failures. Gonzalez deeply admired Boyer, a brilliant economist, but Boyer resigned last summer, less than 24 hours before Gonzalez was scheduled to announce a Cabinet reshuffle. The changes were made largely to please Boyer, but Boyer wanted also to become a deputy prime minister. When Guerra and Gonzalez balked, Boyer quit, creating a Government crisis. Gonzalez's announcement of the Cabinet changes, at a press conference in Madrid, was probably the worst performance of his political career, as he fumbled for words and contradicted himself. ''It isn't necessary to dramatize things,'' he said. ''The Government is going to continue acting as it has until now, though, if I said I weren't worried, I wouldn't be telling the truth. I assume my obligations resolutely, despite the incidents along the way.'' For the next several months, Gonzalez showed he could be morose and sullen. He used the old Franco yacht, the Azor, for a holiday cruise, a political blunder that added to criticism that he had turned rightward and grown to relish the trappings of power. He argued that the yacht was state property, not Franco's. But even his advisers were dismayed when, in a show of contrariness, he took the yacht out a second time. He grew thin-skinned about criticism. When a television interviewer asked about his changed hair style, a more modish cut, he quickly ruffled his hair and denied any change. By winter, Gonzalez seemed back to his old self, and has since appeared to edge leftward in several policy decisions, increasing Government spending and raising pension benefits for many workers. However, the charges of arrogance have lingered and grown. The Socialists, wrote Pedro J. Ramirez, editor of the centrist newspaper Diario 16, are enamored of ''carpets, protocol, armored cars, secretaries, bodyguards, trips abroad, pictures in the newspaper and contact with whomever can show some measure of fame.'' The greatest frictions have arisen in Gonzalez's relations with his union supporters - a symptom, perhaps, of his ideological drifting. The problem has been revealed most clearly in a continuing dispute over Spain's labor laws, which provide workers with some of the strongest rights in any European country. Employers' groups estimate that it costs $25,000 in required compensations to lay off an average Spanish worker. The result is that companies are afraid to discharge, hire or expand. But, given the high unemployment, the Socialist unions have refused to budge on the laws except to allow some more temporary hiring. Gonzalez, upholding his pragmatic, mostly free-market model, openly warns that the days of government protection are over and that, with Spain's entry into the European Community, businesses must either compete or fail. With their own right-wing parties out of power, businessmen have had no choice but to go along. But Gonzalez has been unable to convince his left-wing supporters to accept his approach, leaving him frustrated and willing, in an interview, to accuse many union men of Francoist, ''corporatist tendencies.'' ''It is not possible to be sectarian and at the same time try to make the productive apparatus work,'' he said. ''Listen, you can be Socialist but not stupid. I am not a Socialist to share out misery. I am a Socialist to carry out justice.'' Gonzalez's pragmatism also extends to social and legal issues, on which he has pursued reform slowly in order to avoid risking a conservative backlash. Although he faced strong pressure within his party to legalize all forms of abortion, for instance, Gonzalez, who ceased being a practicing Roman Catholic years ago, allowed abortion to be legalized only for cases involving rape, a malformed fetus, or danger to the mother. He has shown similar moderation in reorganizing the schools, the police, the judiciary and the military, and in dealing with Basque separatist terrorists. Gonzalez's decisions on such issues are influenced by the frequent private opinion polls he commissions and scrutinizes. But for all his analyzing, Gonzalez in the end relies on instinct. His most important strategic decision - rejecting Marxism, and moving his party toward the center - has been based on visceral judgments rather than cool calculation. I DON'T WANT TO BE PRESI-dent of a Spain in second place,'' he said. ''I want Spain to be the first in Europe and in the West.'' ''Who's going to integrate Spain into Europe,'' Gonzalez asked the crowd. ''Felipe!'' they shouted back. THE ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY that Gonzalez and the Socialists have brought to Spanish Government and culture has captivated the rest of Europe, bringing Spain closer to its Continental neighbors than at any time in recent memory. European art collectors have been flocking to Spain to buy new painting and sculpture. Spanish films have been winning Academy Awards and Cannes prizes. Spanish fashion designers are beginning to show their work in Paris and Milan. El Pais, a daily started after Franco's death, is compared to Le Monde and other major international newspapers. In part, the cultural boom is a result of deliberate policy. Museums have been made free for Spaniards, and the Prado museum, long venerable but tatty, has undergone a major facelift. The education budget has nearly doubled and new emphasis has been given to improving Spain's generally poor universities. But behind the cultural explosion -and Gonzalez's own rise - there is also an important social phenomenon: Spain has finally become a middle-class country. It began in the 1950's, under Franco. Spaniards went to work as migrants in Northern Europe, and European tourists came in such numbers that today Spain receives more tourists than any country in the world, according to United Nations statistics. Both movements brought money and ideas to Spain. At the same time, the economy took off, tripling per capita income in the last 30 years. Young people burgeoning with ambition have poured from the provinces into the cities. In 1955, 46 percent of the country's workers were fishermen and farmers. Today, two-thirds of those have abandoned the farm and the sea. Spain has done in 30 years what most of the rest of Europe did in 130 years, and the momentum is still pushing it forward. Therein lies the source of much of Gonzalez's success. The new middle class is the Gonzalez generation, and it shares with him middle-class values and a vision of a modern and moderate Spain. It is a vision that led Spain into the Common Market. To Spaniards, the Common Market is much more than tomatoes or rolled steel. ''What has been decided upon is Spain's great political decision to participate in a common West European destiny,'' Gonzalez said in an interview. Joining the Common Market, he added, was ''a priceless opportunity to modernize, to catch the train of history.'' For Gonzalez, it is also the starting point for a new, and active, Spanish foreign policy. Last month, for example, Gonzalez went to Moscow. What transpired there was by international protocol extraordinary. Gonzalez and the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev were secluded together for nearly five hours, each accompanied by only one aide. Gonzalez is hardly an admirer of the Soviet Union. In a lively luncheon with President Reagan in the Moncloa, the two leaders swapped jokes. Gonzalez told one about Karl Marx returning from the dead and saying over Soviet television, ''Workers of the world - forgive me.'' Now, under Gonzalez's guidance, Spain has confirmed its place in NATO. The NATO referendum was the biggest hurdle of his administration. Spain joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1982, but, upon taking office, Gonzalez halted the process of military integration, promising the referendum. He was leery of NATO then, but, in a major turnaround, admitted to a change of mind and campaigned hard in favor of Spanish membership in the alliance. In the referendum, he risked his political career - suggesting at one point that he might resign if he lost. Defying all polls, Gonzalez won the referendum by the surprisingly large margin of nearly 53 percent to 40 percent. He won by the dint of a disclipined party and his own popularity. Spain had decided once and for all to throw in its lot with the West, ending a Spanish inTellectUal fantasy that the country's ties to the Arab world and Latin America made it somehow different. But the victory was not unqualified. To win over doubters, Gonzalez, the posibilista, added three conditions to Spain's NATO membership. The first is that nuclear weapons will remain banned in Spain. The second is that. although Spain will participate in NATO military planning, its forces will not be subject to direct NATO military command, a bow to residual isolationist sentiments. The third is that Gonzalez will work to reduce the number of American troops, 12,500, already authorized in Spain under a separate bilateral treaty. Behind the third condition is anti-Americanism. ''It's understandable,'' Gonzalez said matter-of-factly. ''The Americans backed Franco.'' Gonzalez argues that visceral anti-Americanism is outdated, and also that the treaty allowing American bases in Spain is obsolete now that Spain is in NATO. The treaty, which dates back to 1953 and the cold war, is being renegotiated, and the Reagan Administration has been grudgingly amenable to Spanish demands. The negotiations are an example of Gonzalez's independence. American warplanes flying from bases in Britain to bomb Libya in April flew around Spain because of Gonzalez's reticence about allowing them to enter Spanish airspace. He never said no, but after Lieut. Gen. Vernon A. Walters, the American delegate to the United Nations, felt out Gonzalez in vague terms during a secret meeting in Madrid, the Americans never directly raised the issue. The likelihood of explosive anti-American demonstrations was clear to both men, according to Spanish officials, and Gonzalez publicly condemned the raid. In Latin America, the return of Spanish democracy has made the mother country a model and cultural magnet. Latin leaders almost weekly troop through Madrid to meet with Gonzalez. He was swarmed like a pop idol by admiring crowds when he attended the inauguration of Raul Alfonsin in Argentina two years ago. After Reagan's visit to Madrid last year, Gonzalez said he was surprised by what he saw as a lack of expertise in United States policy toward Latin America. He differed with Reagan over putting pressure on Nicaragua. But when three days later Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega Saavedra showed up, Gonzalez differed with Ortega, too. With Ortega by his side on a sofa in the Moncloa during a joint news conference, Gonzalez said he would like to see more pluralism in Nicaragua. He took umbrage when Ortega equated Reagan with Hitler. The United States fought Hitler, Gonzalez reminded him, and added, ''If a similar situation arises, the United States would do it again.'' T HE CHEERING AND hornblowing continued as the security men escorted Gonzalez off the stage and out to his waiting car. His shirt was soaked. He would travel the whole country in the campaign and the themes would be the same. He said he felt more hesitant in his speeches now that he is no longer in the opposition, and it came through. ''I like Felipe, without any titles before or after,'' he said to lusty applause at one point, but the ring of conviction wasn't there. PALME IS DEAD, FELLED by an assassin. Brandt and Schmidt are in eclipse. France's Francois Mitterrand, like Mario Soares in Portugal, is president, but has been forced to share power with opposition parties. Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi also governs by virtue of compromise, and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has had little impact outside his own country. Among Europe's Socialists, that leaves Gonzalez with unique influence and visibility. He knows his unbroken string of successes cannot last. The high unemployment rate, the charges of arrogance, the wear of decision making and political infighting will take their toll, probably some in today's vote. ''I don't hold it against anyone,'' he said. He insists he could give it all up. For relaxation, he toils weekends in a large hothouse garden he maintains down by the swimming pool of his residence. Walking through the garden, he stops to pull out a clutch of invading weeds from among the Swiss chard, and swears his ambition after he leaves office is, like his father, to own a small farm. ''Gardening is the art of patience,'' he says. ''More importantly, it is the only thing that gives me the sense of having finished a job. The plants grow. It's the exact opposite of politics.'' Still, his youth and energy are striking, and he seems unfazed by the rigors of the campaign. He says he wants to see through what he has started - put a final shape to Spanish federalism, to complete his restructuring of the economy and, most of all, to re-establish Spain's place in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAS REAGAN GOT THE COURT HE WANTS?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/weekinreview/has-reagan-got-the-court-he-wants.html,"IN the heat of the 1984 Presidential campaign, Justice William H. Rehnquist gave a speech entitled ''Presidential Appointments to the Supreme Court.'' It is natural and proper, he said, for a President to seek to shape the course of the law by naming Justices ''sympathetic to his political or philosophical principles.'' But, he added, the effort ''is apt to be only partially successful.'' If President Reagan is only partially successful in reversing the direction of the Federal courts, it will not be for lack of trying. In selecting Justice Rehnquist to succeed the retiring Chief Justice, Warren E. Burger, and Judge Antonin Scalia to join the Supreme Court, Mr. Reagan has named men of impressive talents and appealing personalities whose records on the bench seem totally compatible with the Administration's views. On issues including abortion, affirmative action, school prayer, busing, Presidential powers, the death penalty, obscenity, crime and civil liberties, Justice Rehnquist has been the Court's most conservative member since he was confirmed in 1972. Judge Scalia has been equally consistent, as a law professor and since Mr. Reagan made him an appellate judge in Washington in 1982. At least one more appointment would be needed to produce a dramatic change in the Court's moderate course - in particular to restrict abortion rights. But Justice Rehnquist's ability to persuade colleagues in close cases will be enhanced by his new position. And he and Judge Scalia are both graceful writers with the intellectual firepower to plant seeds of legal change even in dissent. Justice Rehnquist delights in the barbed epigram. Judge Scalia's writing blends analytical rigor with visceral intensity. A standard cliche about the Supreme Court - that a President has no way of telling what an appointee will do once ensconced in a lifetime job - is at least partly myth. In this respect, the choices of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia are in instructive contrast with President Eisenhower's 1953 appointment of Chief Justice Earl Warren and, to a lesser degree, with Mr. Reagan's 1981 appointment of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice Warren horrified Mr. Eisenhower with liberal rulings on criminal law and civil rights; Justice O'Connor has turned out to be a more moderate conservative than Justice Rehnquist, going against the Administration on some major issues, including school prayer. But ideological purity was not the primary criterion in those selections. Mr. Eisenhower had earlier promised the job to then-Governor Warren of California, a man of national stature. Mr. Reagan was fulfilling a campaign pledge to name the first woman Justice. In the cases of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia, however, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d is at the helm of an activist Justice Department bent on moving the courts to the right. In his radio address yesterday, Mr. Reagan said his Supreme Court nominees were ''representative of the high caliber of our Federal court appointments.'' He also urged the Senate to confirm his stalled nomination of Daniel A. Manion for a Federal appellate judgeship, assailing opponents for partisanship. ''I believe the Senate should consider only a nominee's qualifications and character, not his political views,'' Mr. Reagan said. But many Democrats and some Republicans say Mr. Reagan is not practicing what he preaches. An increasingly single-minded Administration drive to put conservative ideologues on the bench, they say, has produced some lower court candidates notable less for their legal professionalism than for their extremism or racial insensitivity - though Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia seem immune to such charges. The point of Justice Rehnquist's 1984 speech was less that people change once named to the Court - although some have - than that even Presidents and judicial nominees who agree on the current issues of importance lack ''the foresight to see what the great issues of 10 or 15 years hence are to be.'' President Roosevelt, he said, sought and got Justices who would stop the Court from striking down the New Deal, but a few years later, when civil liberties issues became central, the Roosevelt Court ''was rent asunder in rancorous squabbling.'' A dominant conservative bloc on a future Court might, for example, have to sort out the tension between conservatives' professed devotion to judicial restraint -which would mean an end to what Judge Scalia as recently as Friday called ''judicial intrusion into the business of the political branches'' - and the urge to strike down economic regulations offensive to their free-market philosophy. Such a conflict, Justice Scalia has said, ''presents the moment of truth for many conservatives who have been criticizing the courts in recent years.''

"KEMP, WITH NATIONAL DREAM, FACES FIGHT AT HOME",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/nyregion/kemp-with-national-dream-faces-fight-at-home.html,"While Jack F. Kemp was tossing a football for the Buffalo Bills 23 years ago, James Keane was showing fans to their seats. ''If he'd ever taken his nose out of the air, he would have seen me,'' said Mr. Keane, a Buffalo Common Council member who now shares the political arena with Mr. Kemp as the Democrat bidding for Mr. Kemp's House seat. The quarterback may not have noticed the usher, but the Congressman is being forced to take note of the challenger. Suddenly, instead of 1988 - the vintage many people associate with Mr. Kemp - there is 1986 for him to worry about. From the Collins Moose lodge to the Gowanda Shriner parade, from the Varysburg fire parade to the Warsaw dairy festival, Mr. Keane is tirelessly spreading his message throughout Erie County: ''Jack Kemp cannot serve two masters. He has betrayed the interests of western New York to fuel his Presidential ambitions.'' By vigorously raising dozens of issues - from charges of possible misuse by Mr. Kemp of a tax-exempt foundation fund to the fact that there are towns in his district that Mr. Kemp has never visited - Mr. Keane has became the first serious contender the Republican Congressman has had since he went to Washington 16 years ago. ''He's making me spend more money and fight harder than I would have,'' said Mr. Kemp, who is trying to divide his attention between Mr. Keane and potential rivals named Bush and Dole. ''I have to defend my reputation.'' The Democrats are crowing. ''Jim Keane's doing better than we ever could have hoped,'' said Representative Tony Coelho of California, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The committee plans to help Mr. Keane with a maximum amount of money, about $50,000, if he keeps up the pace. For not only do the Democrats have their first legitimate candidate in years in the district, but they also have a chance to curb Mr. Kemp's traveling on behalf of lesser-known Republican Congressional candidates, and to throw some gravel in his Presidential path. Veteran politicians here do not think Mr. Kemp is in any real danger. As John R. Sharpe, the Republican Supervisor of Amherst, puts it: ''Jack Kemp gets me into the White House. Jim Keane gets me into a bar in South Buffalo.'' Even some people who come to Mr. Keane's events agree. ''Keane's a smart guy, but Jack Kemp's going to come back and eat him alive,'' said John Chew, a developer who attended a cocktail party for the Democrat Thursday night. ''They love Kemp here. He's like Father Christmas and the tooth fairy and the All-American football hero rolled into one.'' But Mr. Keane has put Mr. Kemp in a difficult position. He must conduct a two-tiered campaign - an open one for his House seat, and a shadow one in the rest of the country to explore his chances for the Presidency. Although the former athlete says he is sick of football metaphors, there are times when nothing else will really do. ''It's like football,'' Mr. Kemp said. ''The worst team in the National Football League can give you a battle. If you take anything for granted, you get your head knocked off.'' For the first time, he must go on the defensive, explaining political positions on trade and taxes and Federal financing that, while they have made him a star with conservatives across the country, do not always jibe with the interests of a district that has suffered through a difficult period as a Rust Belt area where auto and steel plants have closed. Crashing a Kemp Event Mr. Keane is feeling so high about his long-shot quest these days that he even took the unorthodox move of crashing a Kemp campaign event today at a senior citizens home in Clarence, north of Buffalo. While Mr. Kemp shook hands on one side of the lot, Mr. Keane (pronounced cane) shook hands on the other. Mr. Kemp ignored his pesky challenger, as did 77-year-old Florence Perry. ''Jack's been with us for a long time and we're all hoping he's going to get something very special in Washington soon - if you know what I mean,'' she whispered conspiratorially. Mr. Keane is not daunted by Mr. Kemp's glamour and popularity - he watched, grinning, as women swooned over the Congressman and men snapped pictures. The challenger is a peppery former firefighter and son of a mailman who comes from a family of 16. He is married to a firefighter - one of the first women on the Buffalo force - and has four children. One of his favorite books is ''Trinity,'' by Leon Uris; he loves singing Irish songs over a bottle of Genesee beer, considers anyone not born in Buffalo unlucky and says his roots in Erie County are so deep that the last time they had a family picnic, 500 people came. A Nuisance, at First When the 40-year-old Democrat started telling Mr. Kemp to ''wake up and smell the coffee,'' he seemed merely a vague nuisance, like a piece of paper stuck on Mr. Kemp's shoe or a gnat buzzing round his carefully coiffed head. ''Keane is the kind of a guy,'' said Mr. Kemp's aide, John Buckley, ''who would dive head first into Lake Erie with his clothes on if he thought there was one line of publicity in it.'' When Mr. Keane charged that Mr. Kemp was a ''carpetbagger,'' a Los Angeles native who did not even live in the district, and merely owned a house in Hamburg that he rented out, the Congressman countercharged that Mr. Keane did not live in the district, either. He lives in Buffalo, five blocks from the boundary of the 31st District, which includes the suburbs of Buffalo but not the city. This week their engagement escalated. When Mr. Kemp resigned as chairman of a tax-exempt foundation - the Fund for an American Renaissance -after an article in The Buffalo News said he was using the organization to help pay for political activities, Mr. Keane had his first big issue. He filed a suit in Federal District Court in Buffalo on Thursday, saying the fund violated an Internal Revenue Service regulation preventing a tax-exempt fund from participating in a campaign on behalf of any candidate. Kemp Defends Foundation ''The Buffalo Bills paid $100 for Jack Kemp on waivers,'' Mr. Keane said. ''Now the price has gone up. Contributors pay $50,000 to his foundation. How much influence in Washington does that buy?'' The Congressman dismisses the charges about the foundation, which he said had been established to study public policy and ''was not engaged in partisan activity.'' ''Maybe there should be a debate about these kinds of foundations,'' Mr. Kemp said, ''but right now the law says they're legal.'' Mr. Kemp, who is 50, has been averaging 20 appearances a month around the country, and one or two trips back to the district a month. His peripatetic style was lampooned in a cartoon in The Buffalo News featuring Mr. Kemp coming back to his Washington office from a Presidential campaign swing only to find there had been an election held in a place called Buffalo. ''Buffalo, Buffalo,'' mused the Congressman. ''Rings a bell.'' A Split Personality While he said he planned to come to the district more often, he will not sacrifice his national agenda. Last week alone, he was in Cleveland, Akron, Denver, Houston and Orlando before he arrived in Buffalo this morning. He spent several hours in Buffalo before flying off to be the guest star at two speaking appearances in New Hampshire for Robert C. Smith, a freshman Republican Representative. Showing one side of a split political personality, Mr. Kemp talked to the editorial board of The Amherst Bee about transit funds and Ellicott Creek flood-control funds and the New York State tax rate, which he said drove Bethlehem Steel from the state. Then he traveled to the Quality Inn in Dover, N.H., for the fund-raising event for Mr. Smith and switched to a more highly charged, Washington insider mode. ''I've been here in New Hampshire a few times,'' he said, with a broad grin. ''You may even see me again.'' Quoting Thomas Jefferson and Victor Hugo, he sounded his familiar visionary themes of less Federal government and more opportunity for growth and more opportunity for minority groups, finishing with a rousing cry for freedom - ''America will once again be a city set on a hill.'' Mr. Keane is as conservative as Mr. Kemp on many social issues - the Democrat does not believe in abortion under any circumstances, or in racial quotas or special laws protecting homosexuals. He believes in the death penalty and in school prayer. But he is hitting hard on differences - like the trade issue and Federal aid. Defense of Principles Mr. Kemp is passing out press releases detailing the urban development grants and Federal flood-control funds he has obtained. But he has to spend more time these days defending his conservative principles about cutting Federal money and encouraging free trade. When Mr. Keane talks about the industry that has left the area and driven out young residents because the country does not have enough protectionist measures, Mr. Kemp rebuts, ''The way to help the industrial Northeast improve opportunities for trade is not to bash Japan for being successful. ''Pretty soon we'd be xenophobic,'' he said. ''The legislators who want protectionism are often the ones who drive Toyotas and have Sony television sets. The world doesn't work that way. We're interdependent.'' For a long time, Mr. Kemp has taken his seat for granted. He was so popular and felt so safe - helped by redistricting that spliced in some rural Republican areas and cut out blue-collar Democratic ones - that he spent more time traveling in other parts of the country than at home. Mr. Keane delights in painting his opponent as an absentee Congressman. ''There was an article in Esquire magazine that said Jack Kemp visited 30 states and made 150 speeches last year,'' he said. ''The article is dated Oct. 24, 1978. It's all right to take a year off to campaign for President, but a decade?'' He points out that Mr. Kemp's voting average is 88 percent, several points under the national average and that of his fellow western New York Congressman. ''Why isn't he in Washington or western New York instead of flitting about the country giving speeches on the gold standard?'' Mr. Keane asks. Apologies to Java Mr. Keane recalled a press release last May, announcing the appointment of a consultant to Mr. Kemp's re-election campaign. As reported in the local newspaper, it described the Congressman's district as ''including suburbs of Buffalo, stretching east all the way to the edge of Monroe County.'' Actually, the district extends at least 45 miles farther east, to the edge of Seneca County. Mr. Kemp is still confident enough to laugh when asked about Mr. Keane's charge that he has never even visited the town of Java in his district. ''No, I've never been there, and I apologize to the people of Java,'' said Mr. Kemp. He seems comfortable at the moment with blending his local and national ambitions. After his speech tonight in New Hampshire, Mr. Kemp expressed confidence. He talked about his national persona, and said he was trying to shorten his speeches so that he did not bore people. ''You know,'' he said, driving toward a helicopter that would take him back to Logan International Airport in Boston, ''John Kennedy never spoke more than 15 minutes.'' But then, after a few moments of silence, the Congressman spoke again, and he was not thinking about the White House. ''We'll get to Java,'' he said, almost to himself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE REAGAN LEGACY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/magazine/the-reagan-legacy.html,"HE COMPARES HIS legacy to F.D.R.'S. and if Franklin D. Roosevelt's impact on the nation remained powerful years after his departure, Ronald Reagan believes -and numerous politicians, academics and economists agree with him - that his impact will prove just as far-reaching. ''Like F.D.R., may I say I'm not trying to destroy what is best in our system of humane, free government, I'm doing everything I can to save it,'' President Reagan remarks. As if expressing his own credo for the Presidency, Mr. Reagan recently said of F.D.R., ''He gave confidence to the people. He never lost faith in this country for one minute.'' While it seems evident that Mr. Reagan's legacy will be seen as having both positive and negative aspects, it is clear that his impact, like F.D.R.'s, rests in large part on restoring the primacy of the Presidency as an institution after nearly two decades of White House disarray marked by Vietnam, Watergate and the hostages in Iran. ''First of all, he has contributed a spirit of good will and grace to the Presidency and American life generally and turned the Presidency into a vigorous and forceful instrument of national policy,'' says Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who, nonetheless, criticizes Mr. Reagan's economic, social and civil-rights policies. Says Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, ''What he's reminded me of is the importance of a leader being perceived as a force. By his personal conduct when he's shot, when he's told he has cancer, when he goes to Normandy - the way he's deported himself has been a moral instruction to my children.'' By virture of Mr. Reagan's victories, says Mr. Cuomo, the Presdient has ''generated a whole new introspection on the part of the Democratic Party.'' He adds, ''The results can only be positive.'' Perhaps even more significant for national politics after Ronald Reagan, the President has not only strengthened the conservative movement, he has also institutionalized it. Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was President Carter's chief domestic policy adviser, observes, ''What Reagan and his people have done is place a whole generation of conservative to right-wing people with no experience and given them not only a taste of power but experience in running a government, just as F.D.R. did with Democrats, who then stayed on through the 60's and 70's. ''Conservatives are in levels now that run deep in government and, unlike the people who came in with Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford who didn't have Bernard Weinraub is a White House correspondent for The Times. a burning ideology and saw it as their obligation to do public service, this group has a much more long-term commitment to staying on and shaping government,'' says Mr. Eizenstat. ''Any Administration in the future - Democrat or Republican -will have to face a bureaucracy considerably shifted to the right, and very consciously so.'' Adds Representative Jack F. Kemp, who views himself as an ideological, if not Presidential, heir to Mr. Reagan, ''There used to be a mean streak in the Republican conservative movement. Conservatives were viewed as not very concerned about people. If he hasn't removed that permanently, he's ameliorated it.'' Peggy Noonan, a departing White House speechwriter and a vocal conservative, says, ''The first thing a successful President has to do is capture the imagination of the people. In lightening the tax burden of the citizenry, by ending the age of limits and beginning the age of growth, and by instituting a more down-to-earth and less-enthralled approach to the Soviet Union, Ronald Reagan communicated this historic message: We have nothing to fear but fear itself.'' That phrase, one of F.D.R.'s best known, underlines the fact that, in speeches, President Reagan himself often stirs memories of F.D.R. - in talking about welfare as ''a subtle destroyer of the human spirit,'' about the value of prayer, about restoring the autonomy of state and local governments, even about the benefits of United States-Saudi Arabian friendship. Nearly six years into the Reagan Presidency -and on the verge of obtaining a sweeping restructuring of the tax code that has been the cornerstone of his second term - Mr. Reagan's comparison with F.D.R. seems unerringly accurate. His two remaining years in the White House leave him vulnerable, of course, to an unexpected international crisis or a domestic economic slide that could darken his Presidency. But now, as historians, economists, politicians and his own associates begin examining the Reagan legacy, F.D.R. and R.R., as some senior aides refer to him, seem perfectly - if ironically - matched. In the words of Charles O. Jones, former editor of the American Political Science Review and a professor at the University of Virginia, they are ''bookend Presidents - one in the direction of more government, and trying to make system work, and this one trying to make it work in the sense of less government. They're both radical, but in totally different directions.'' On the face of it, the idea of a link between between Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt may seem not only tenuous but also incongruous. After all, Roosevelt began the New Deal, and Mr. Reagan effectively ended 50 years of social-welfare expansion that had been engendered by that New Deal. The Roosevelt programs grew out of a need to assist the millions of citizens shattered by the Depression; under Mr. Reagan, hunger has increased, according to a number of studies, despite the nation's economic upturn, and the poverty rate is higher than it was in the 1970's, while budget cuts have resulted in the permanent loss to 700,000 families of all or part of their benefits. (Liberals concede that some of the cuts may have been warranted, and that the prospect of restoring aid to these poor and moderate-income families after Mr. Reagan leaves office seems improbable. If the President leaves a single legacy, it is that he appears to have almost totally eliminated for years to come any discussion of new social-welfare initiatives.) Roosevelt weighted the judiciary toward liberalism, while Mr. Reagan - in what may emerge as one of his most significant legacies - has begun reshaping the Federal bench with judges of a conservative bent who ''will have an enduring impact for years to come,'' says Prof. Susan R. Estrich of the Harvard Law School. She points out that many of the Reagan appointees appear to have been deliberately selected for their youth. ''Reagan will be out of the White House in two years, but we'll be arguing before these guys for the next 20 or 30 years,'' she says. By the time he leaves office, Mr. Reagan will have probably named more than half of the 761-member Federal judiciary. Their impact will probably be felt most in criminal justice, civil-rights policy, the social agenda - including abortion, prayer in school and women's rights -and business regulations. Roosevelt stabilized the economy, while Mr. Reagan's fiscal policies (centering on a deep tax cut and a sizable military buildup) have increased already-huge budget deficits that have helped devastate important sectors of the economy. Most visibly - and permanently - thousands of families have left their farms, numerous rural banks have been forced out of business and thousands of other businesses that deal with farmers have collapsed. The farm belt's debt crisis will shadow Midwest states years after the Reagan Presidency ends. Beyond this, 40 percent of income tax dollars go for interest on the national debt - a debt now standing at $2 trillion, almost half of it amassed during the Reagan years. And even though the White House has endorsed efforts to reduce the annual deficits (through the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill), economists say that the huge accumulation of debt will weigh on the economy for many years. This burden is likely to cause interest rates to remain unusually high, distort the value of the dollar, cause American industries continued difficulty in their competition with foreigners, and constrain the Government's ability to help the unemployed and the poor. On a personal level, F.D.R. was consumed by his work in the Oval Office, working deep into the night, while Mr. Reagan leaves the Oval Office by 6 P.M., positively enjoying his job as Chief Executive (unlike Jimmy Carter) and never complaining about the loneliness of making tough decisions. To many political figures, including Democrats, Mr. Reagan will have an enduring impact on future Presidents in the way he has managed the Presidency, the way in which he adheres to two or three specific goals, such as cutting taxes or raising defense spending, without appearing overwhelmed by the job, as Jimmy Carter did; his personal confidence; his ability to distance himself from crisis or bad news; his successful efforts (with a skilled staff) to plan the day around television opportunities and assure a flow of positive symbols and images. N A CHILLY MARCH evening last year, Ronald Reagan left the White House for a local hotel to address the 12th annual Conservative Political Action Conference dinner. The mood was festive, and the President quickly warmed to the partisan crowd. The tide of history, Mr. Reagan said, was now moving irresistibly in the direction of conservatism after 50 years of liberal drift. Republicans were no longer defenders of the status quo, but creators of a future marked by less regulation, lower taxes and economic growth. Beyond that, he said, perhaps the greatest triumph of modern conservatism has been to stop allowing the left and the intelligentsia to tell average Americans that they were ''hopelessly out of date, utterly trite and . . . reactionary.'' ''The normal was portrayed as eccentric, and only the abnormal was worthy of emulation,'' said Mr. Reagan. ''The irreverence was celebrated -but only irreverence about certain things. Irreverence toward, say, organized religion? Yes. Irreverence toward establishment liberalism? Not much of that. They celebrated their courage in taking on safe targets, and patted each other on the back for slinging stones at a confused Goliath who was too demoralized - and, really, too good -to fight back. But now, one simply senses it: the American people are no longer on the defensive.'' Given the President's gift for exaggeration and self-congratulation, the speech seemed unremarkable. But as a projection of Mr. Reagan's views of his legacy and a demonstration of the themes that have dominated his terms - from reshaping the national agenda to slowing the growth of domestic spending, from changing the priorities of the Federal budget in favor of more military spending to restoring a sense of national pride and endorsing certain middle-class values - the speech served as both a second-term marching call to the faithful and an embodiment of the ''Reagan Revolution.'' ''The moment is ours, and we must seize it,'' said the President in a hoarse voice. ''There is work to do.'' Although he is the most influential President in 50 years, even his aides acknowledge that Mr. Reagan, with two years left in the White House to seize a ''revolution,'' has only scraped around the edges of the welfare state, leaving it largely intact. In fact, there has actually been an an increase in the number of Federal workers (because of the shift of emphasis to defense), despite the pledge to reduce ''big government.'' And the promises to abolish everything from the Department of Energy to the Department of Education and to balance the Federal budget have been abandoned. Yet political figures, academics and economists assessing the Reagan years say that after six years, the legacy of Ronald Reagan is - even with its failures - an extraordinarily powerful one and that his impact will affect domestic and foreign policy and the Presidency itself through the 1990's. ''He has restored the Presidency as an institution after a run of basically three failed Presidencies,'' says Henry Hugh Heclo, a professor of government at Harvard. ''He had a clear idea of what he wanted - cut the budget for the domestic side and raise it for the military - and maintained command of the agenda. He's made it clear you don't have to be hyperactive to be President, to have an answer for every question. It's O.K. for a President not to know everything. He seemed to make the job manageable. And although the basic textural fact of his popularity is the sustained economic upturn, what also makes him popular is, he actually seems like a normal human being. He's knowable, he's likable. He's not weird. You think of Johnson and Nixon and Carter. And then there's Reagan. He's someone you'd be happy to have in your living room.'' But there are also contradictions in the Reagan Presidency that, according to some historians, raise the possibility that in 10 or 20 years the Reagan era will be viewed merely as a strange interlude in American politics. For example, his personal popularity ratings, especially high for a second-term President, are not matched by public support for some of his key policies. As Fred I. Greenstein, a professor of politics at Princeton, puts it: ''He is more successful than any recent President in establishing space between himself and his policies.'' Certainly, to many observers, the Reagan legacy is not an especially happy one. ''Government may or may not be able to solve the problems of inflation, unemployment and growth in an increasingly competitive world economy, but one could hope that it would at least not make matters worse in the process of trying to make them better,'' writes Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist, in ''Perspectives on the Reagan Years,'' a collection of essays edited by John L. Palmer that is scheduled to be published late this summer by the influential Urban Institute. ''Yet this is the true legacy of the Reagan years. There have been earlier periods of economic mismanagement, but few, if any, can rival the current Government's tolerance of budget deficits that virtually guarantee poorer productivity performance in the future and a further erosion of our relative standard of living.'' SIMILAR VIEW IS voiced by Senator Daniel P. Moynihan. ''Ronald Reagan as an immensely popular President has done the polity a great service,'' he says. ''We needed a popular President. The social order is peaceable and in good order. From L.B.J.'s time and Vietnam to Watergate and then the Iranian hostages, we needed that. But he has crippled the economy of the nation and this will be with us for the rest of the century.'' And Richard P. Nathan, a professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University, says, looking at Mr. Reagan's economic and social policies: ''The Reagan Administration marks a watershed in domestic policy and signals a fundamental shift in attitude in which the Federal Government takes on a much smaller responsibility for social and urban issues. The Roosevelt New Deal served as a period of ascendancy in both identifying and dealing with social needs. The Reagan Presidency marks a turning away from that agenda by stopping the growth in Federal efforts and spending in certain social programs, by turning over authority to state governments in areas where the Federal Government previously played an important role.'' In the economic field, the 1981 tax cuts, the dramatic fall in inflation from 12.4 percent to less than 4 percent and the break in the wage-price spiral, which some attribute to Mr. Reagan's determined handling of the air traffic controllers' strike, are hallmarks of the Reagan years. Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers in 1981-82, says that the break-up of the air traffic controllers' union was ''the single most important event in American labor relations in more than a decade - strike activity is at its lowest point in 30 years.'' Mr. Reagan's ability to crush the strike undoubtedly will make future Presidents far less inhibited about similar moves. The first year of the Reagan Administration was marked by its most significant legislative achievment and the pivot of the President's domestic program - the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. The measure encompassed such goals as reducing the size and scope of the Federal Government in domestic affairs (although Mr. Reagan, in his budgets, also sought big increases in defense spending), fundamental changes in welfare policy (which restricted eligibility and reduced benefits in the main Federal-state program) and the establishment of block grants, which sought to shift domestic priorities to the states. ''The budget act of 1981 is the most important piece of domestic legislation since the Social Security Act of 1935,'' writes Professor Nathan in the soon-to-be-published Urban Institute book. ''The 1981 budget act represented a marked shift in direction on social spending and encompassed fundamental changes in the substance of domestic policy and in American Federalism.'' Poor families have suffered in large numbers; the disadvantaged have borne a disproportionate share of the burden compared to politically powerful middle-class constituents ranging from some farmers, to veterans, to Social Security recipients. The new tax revision, however, if passed, has provisions for the poor that could take many off the tax rolls. ''The cuts have, let's face it, caused a considerable amount of pain,'' remarks Jack A. Meyer, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and president of a Washington social welfare research firm. He also notes that cuts in supplemental income for the working poor would send ''a long-term signal to people in low-income households that we're not going to reward work, we're not going to reward holding families together, and it'll have an effect beyond Reagan. We're restricting public assistance to split families headed by nonworking adults. What this means is, we have not addressed the issue of long-term welfare dependency, we have not addressed the issue of people in this society caught in the cycle of teen-age pregnancy and crime and long-term welfare dependency.'' It is these budget cuts involving the poor that raise question's about Mr. Reagan's future standing among other Presidents. ''When it came time, great Presidents bent over backwards to speak for the less privileged, to take a moral stance, and Reagan hasn't done that,'' says Thomas E. Cronin, an author of several books on the Presidency, who teaches at Colorado College. ''History will treat Reagan less well than the public opinion polls today because being popular is not necessarily doing the right thing.'' ''Reaganism's celebration of a nation of communities has no real answer when such communities entrench equality and merrily suppress the individualism of those falling out of the mainstream of particular small groups' norms,'' writes Professor Heclo of Harvard in the Urban Institute book. ''The economic, as opposed to the social, face of Reagan's individualism can easily be portrayed as playing to the most rationalized forms of selfishness - looking out for No. 1 is the best way of helping the country. There can arise a determined insensitivity that passes for toughmindedness. The economic losers are not victims, just incompetents. Reaganism then becomes a rationale for the nation to secede from some downcast fraction of its own inhabitants.'' T HE ECONOMY -the booming stock market, inflation of only 3 or 4 percent (thanks in large part to the oil price collapse), the move toward single-digit mortgage rates -serve as the underpinning for the President's popularity. But the huge budget deficit, sluggish productivity growth, growing foreign debt and the decline in the dollar's value, which raises import prices, create a shadowy, even ominous backdrop. Asked why the President and his chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, did not seem to view the deficit with the same concern as many economists (despite their endorsement of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget act), William A. Niskanen, former acting chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, replied: ''If the deficit were causing near-term economic problems, they'd be concerned. But it hasn't. It's just too easy to put off. It has proved to be consistent with moderately good economic conditions.'' Mr. Reagan's impact on the Republican Party - and national politics - offers one of the more striking contradictions about a conservative President who is extraordinarily popular in a nation undergoing considerable social change. The irony has not been lost on Democratic and Republican politicians. Although he embodies, for many voters, an America of small towns, tightly-knit families and religious values, Mr. Reagan came of age in show business, enjoys a ribald joke, rarely goes to church, became the first divorced man to serve as President and has had an often-strained relationship with his children. Assessing Mr. Reagan's impact on the political process, however, especially on the Republican Party, has a potentially significant negative side. The President; his Attorney General, Edwin L. Meese 3d, and his Education Secretary, William J. Bennett, have paid obeisance to the religious right. ''The religious right has been legitimized by the six years of Ronald Reagan; they're no longer regarded as a fringe group, they're part of the power structure,'' says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. ''In the same way that the Democrats had been perceived as bending too far to organized labor, to minorities, to gays, the Republicans are in danger of being seen as tilting too far to to the religious right.'' The likelihood is that the Republican agenda will be affected by the Rev. Marion G. (Pat) Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Accordingly, the Republicans face pressures to adopt programs involving social and religious values that are anathema to a relatively libertarian youthful constituency that voted heavily for Ronald Reagan in 1984. ''The growing crisis in the Republican Party is, how to do they resolve the social agenda of the religious right, which the President has done so much to legitimize?'' says Patrick Caddell, the Democratic polltaker. ''How do they restrain those impulses at a time when politics is shifting to a generation whose hallmark is tolerance on social issues?'' It is quite possible, Mr. Caddell continues, that Mr. Reagan has unwittingly created ''a monster'' that could seize the Republican Party. Even Richard Wirthlin, Mr. Reagan's polltaker, concedes that ''a social schism between economic conservatives and social libertarians could open up in 1988.'' But Mr. Wirthlin observes that one of the more unusual twists of the 1984 Presidential campaign was that Mr. Reagan received a far higher percentage of votes from those under 24 than he had in 1980. What attracted the young to Reagan were qualities that voters also saw in F.D.R. -stability and direction. M R. REAGAN'S huge defense buildup also stirs negative questions about his legacy. His campaign rhetoric about fraud, waste and abuse in government has been turned on its head, and Republicans have joined Democrats in condemning fraud, waste and abuse at the Pentagon. The consensus for increased defense spending has withered, and it seems improbable that even Republican Presidential contenders such as Vice President George Bush or Jack Kemp will focus their campaigns on the need for stepped-up military spending. Democrats concede that abroad, the United States now projects self-confidence and authority for the first time since Vietnam - no small feat, although United States-Soviet relations, arms control, the Middle East and Central America remain in a state of uncertainty. But, says William G. Hyland, editor of the journal Foreign Affairs, ''Historically, Reagan will be remembered for reopening the question of strategic defenses as a broad issue, a question that's been closed since the postwar period, a question that was buttoned up; no one was talking about it except one or two people on the fringes.'' Mr. Eizenstat says that one of the most significant results of Mr. Reagan's tenure is that ''America has finally come to terms with the Vietnam legacy.'' The Libyan raid, the Grenada invasion, support for rebels in Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and elsewhere marked a turning point that will affect future Administrations. ''The sense that America was paralyzed in projecting its power after Vietnam was ended by Reagan,'' says Mr. Eizenstat. ''Future Administrations will no longer be inhibited by Vietnam; future Administrations will have more leeway in projecting U.S. economic and military power without running into the constant argument of Vietnam.'' ''Give Reagan credit for one thing,'' says Walter F. Mondale, who gives him credit for little else. ''He's uncanny in his ability to create a sense of feeling good, of enhancing the American spirit, of pumping up the American sense of self-worth. He belongs to the marketer's school of politics; it's not substance, it's positioning and selling. It's not policy, it's polling. It's market surveys, it's film-making, it's using the skills of Hollywood to lead the country. And it's been so successful, I'd be surprised if a lot of politicians weren't influenced by it.'' But Mr. Reagan's successful political career is hardly just the result of Hollywood technique. He is a shrewd, calculating and, to some degree, manipulative politician and ideologue. And even Mr. Mondale agrees that Mr. Reagan's two landslide Presidential victories, his leadership style, have altered the nation's politics for the future. ''Reagan has made as much of a midcourse correction in the direction of American policy and politics as it is possible to make in a noncrisis environment, and his accomplishments have been extraordinary in the sense that for the last five years everybody has played off his agenda - everybody,'' says Mr. Eizenstat. ''It's not whether you cut domestic spending, it's how much. It's not whether you increase defense spending, but how much. He has captured the high ground on virtually every major issue of consequence and controlled the debate as well as any President since Roosevelt.'' Mr. Reagan's ''visionary zeal'' in seeking to turn the Republicans into the nation's majority party has transformed the nation's political scene for the near future. ''It will take an extraordinary candidate and set of circumstances for the Democrats to win the Presidency in the foreseeable future,'' says Mr. Eizenstat. Mr. Reagan's Presidential persona - his style - has impressed other politicians, who confess that they've learned from him. ''He's conducted himself with grace, with control, with generosity,'' says Governor Cuomo. ''His personal strength has produced high poll figures - certainly not his position on the economy. He's totally nonmenacing, so affable, that if you're vulnerable, you're poor, you have to believe he's a man of feeling.'' He has succeeded in changing the terms of the national debate over domestic policy: antipoverty programs were reduced, grants to the states and communities that enabled them to hire the jobless were eliminated and middle-income college students became ineligible for Government-backed loans. Yet if Mr. Reagan yearned to overturn the welfare state, he has failed in doing so. ''The current view of Reagan's legacy is that he made assaults on government and he attempted to shrink government,'' says Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey. ''He tried to do that. But the result of his eight years will be the closing of any debate on the value, acceptability and existence of the modern welfare state.'' In fact, because of overwhelming Congressional resistance to fundamental changes in domestic programs, Social Security, civil-rights acts, the Clean Air act, consumer protection and Federal aid to education remain on the books, some of them diminished but all still effective. Although, six years into his Presidency, some critics dismiss Mr. Reagan - and Reaganism - as an aberration, an interregnum in American politics with marginal impact, most academics and politicians say that the Reagan years will symbolize, as have few other Administrations in decades, the way most Americans of the era view themselves, their neighbors and their Government. ''Just as liberalism made it all right to talk about sex, Reaganism made it all right to talk about patriotism, work requirements and family values, parochial allegiances, moral purpose and, yes, imposing middle-class values on others,'' writes Professor Heclo of Harvard in the Urban Institute book. ''Reaganism has a future because Americans want to talk about these things in politics. Reaganism is an upbeat, positive political message. In this regard there is much in common with the older liberal tradition of the Happy Warrior, 'Happy Days are Here Again' and 'politics of joy.' Reaganism, like the headiest days of liberalism, offers a vision in which Americans can have it all: world leadership, economic growthmanship without guilt or hard choices. Americans have only to believe in their own dreams. ''To the experts who speak of limitations, economic contradictions, tradeoffs, United States international decline, Reaganism offers the classic American response: Nuts.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Rehnquist Court: a Watershed,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/opinion/the-rehnquist-court-a-watershed.html,"President Reagan's long-expected chance to reshape the United States Supreme Court has presented itself at last, and the President has seized it in a way that signals a watershed in the history of the Court. With Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's announcement that he will step down at the end of the Court's current term, the President's nominations of Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist to become Chief Justice of the United States and of Judge Antonin Scalia to become an Associate Justice are plainly designed to produce seismic change in the content of our constitutional law and in the role of the Supreme Court in our political system. Despite the prospects for radical change, one assumes that because of the exceptional ability and unquestioned integrity of the two men, Senate confirmation will be quick and easy. The naming of a new Chief Justice tends to produce a special sense of impending change in the Court. Partly, this is symbolic. Ever since our fourth Chief Justice, the incomparable John Marshall, put his nationalist stamp on the Court in his seminal 34-year tenure from 1801 to 1835, periods in the Court's history have tended to be identified by the tenures of Chief Justices. The Court is the symbol of continuity in our nation's Government, the institutional embodiment of our Constitution, which is, as Marshall once said, ''intended to endure for all ages to come.'' It is insulated from electoral rhythms, outlasting administrations and large enough in its membership of nine so as almost never to be recast in a stroke. The Chief Justice is the personal embodiment of this sense of continuity. It signifies in our history that alongside our 40 Presidents we have had only 15 Chief Justices and that several in addition to Marshall have served across entire eras in our nation's development. Chief Justice Burger, after all, served alongside four Presidents during 17 years of extraordinary political volatility. Beyond longevity and symbolism, a number of Chief Justices have by intellect, personal force or ability to capture the nation's constitutional ideals or anxieties dominated the work of the Court as a whole during their tenures. One thinks of the impact of Chief Justices Marshall and Roger Brooke Taney in the long sweep of their successive tenures from 1801 to 1865, of William Howard Taft in the 1920's, of Charles Evans Hughes in the 1930's and, of course, of Earl Warren in the 1950's and 1960's. A Chief Justice is only one voice and vote among nine, to be sure. But the power to preside over the conferences that set the Court's docket and canvass the merits of cases for decision, to assign majority opinions or dissents and to speak out on basic questions of Federal law and jurisdiction can be profoundly influential tools in the hands of a Chief Justice who will use them. It is hard, even when looking back, to take the measure of a period in the Court's history. When one remembers that great nation-building jurisprudence of the Marshall Court ended in an era of growing state challenges to national authority; that the Taney Court wound up with a fatal embrace of the specter of slavery; and that the demise of the main constitutional achievements of the Warren Court was confidently predicted when Chief Justice Burger and three other ''strict constructionists'' - Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell and Mr. Rehnquist - were appointed to the Court by President Richard M. Nixon within a space of three years, one sees the difficulty of appraising the historical significance of an era of the Supreme Court, even at its close. Will William Rehnquist come to be associated with the great Chief Justices? Will he lead the Court to a vision of constitutional law structure that grips the nation, to decisions that summon up in an enduring way our deep constitutional idealism? Justice Rehnquist is a person of extraordinary intellectual power and utter confidence in his own constitutional convictions. Like the man he once served as law clerk, Justice Robert H. Jackson, Justice Rehnquist is a masterly writer with a sharp and sarcastic pen. He is a warm and engaging person, without pretense. Despite his rigid and systematic constitutional ideology, he has an open and playful manner in discussions. He is a shrewd tactician in the arts of persuasion. He has the qualities of intellect, strength of conviction and personality to be an influential Chief Justice. The question is whether his reactionary constitutional vision is so out of touch with that of his colleagues and the temper of the times that all his powers of intellect and personality cannot overcome the essential isolation that has been the overriding characteristic of his service on the Court to date. Partly, of course, this question turns on who his colleagues are and will be. Judge Scalia seems likely to be strong ally of Justice Rehnquist on most constitutional issues, in harmony on general questions of constitutional structure and philosophy. Judge Scalia is himself a powerful intellect with a biting and effective pen. He has scholarly skills in massing data and argument that probably exceed those of anyone now on the Court. He has a gregarious, winning personality. He seems virtually certain to bring tremendous strengths to Justice Rehnquist's reactionary program. With Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, they will make a formidable trio. If President Reagan makes one or two more appointments, Justice Rehnquist may well preside over a Court with a like-minded majority. The consequences would be striking to contemplate and would distance the Rehnquist Court from the Burger Court almost as much as from the Warren Court. It must be remembered that the Burger Court has reaffirmed the most significant constitutional work of the Warren Court in race relations and reapportionment, has upheld and even extended the essential protections of freedom of the press created by the Warren Court and has left largely intact several major elements of the Warren Court's work in criminal procedure. Moreover, by most measures of judicial activism and doctrinal innovation, the Burger Court exceeded in its abortion decisions anything done by the Warren Court. And historians will doubtless see the Burger Court's decision to expedite the Watergate tapes case, and to rush the matter to judgment before the House of Representatives could conclude its impeachment proceedings against President Nixon, as one of the prime crisis-resolving initiatives in the Court's entire history. In short, for all its many important differences with the Warren Court, the Burger Court left most of the Warren Court's constitutional legacy intact, and embarked on several major activist forays of its own. Now, presumably, William Rehnquist will have his chance as Chief Justice to lead the Supreme Court away from the activist, constitutional premises and methods of the Warren Court. Justice Rehnquist's record is sharply at odds with virtually all major aspects of the Warren Court's constitutional innovations. It may well be that the nation is ready for a reaction in constitutional fundamentals. The Warren Court's valiant efforts to exorcise the constitutional demon of racism required the Court to upset long-held patterns of deference to state courts and state legislatures. Racism was ingrained not only in state laws dealing explicitly with race but also in the administration of state criminal laws and state election laws, and in state responses to exercises of freedom of expression, particularly in the streets. The patterns of Federal judicial dominance that emerged to promote racial equality, however, were not limited to race relations, and activism in pursuit of racial equality easily and naturally led to activism in pursuit of other constitutional ends. The Warren Court's activism rested on the notion that the Supreme Court must pursue the long-deferred vindication of the rights of blacks because of their exclusion from political participation and from the administration of criminal law, and because segregation reduced blacks to the status of legal outcasts. But now that black people are, at least in rudimentary and formal ways, participants in politics and law administration, the premise that judicial activism is essential to the constitutional protection of minorities is under challenge. This threatens further constitutional progress for black people, and once habits of judicial deference set in with respect to race they will tend to generalize themselves throughout constitutional law, as did the habits of activism before. For the past 50 years, our constitutional law has been playing out patterns set in motion by the Constitutional Revolution of 1938, when the Supreme Court, as reconstituted by Franklin D. Roosevelt, retreated from judicial activism in economic regulation and began to build a theory of activism for protection of minority rights and civil liberties. In many ways, Charles Evans Hughes, the great Chief Justice of the 1930's, is the doctrinal godfather of the Warren Court. The nominations of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia represent a major challenge to this jurisprudence of civil rights and civil liberties that traces back to the 1930's. In their approach to civil liberties, and perhaps civil rights as well, they stand for a degree of deference to the states and to the political branches that parallels the hands-off approach to review of economic regulation taken by the Supreme Court since the 1930's. Thus, these appointments constitute a greater challenge to the received tradition of constitutional law than any we have seen for a half century.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRESIDENT DENOUNCES ABORTION AS 'MURDER',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/us/president-denounces-abortion-as-murder.html,"President Reagan today called abortion ''murder'' but said he had made no effort to seek the views of his judicial nominees on this or any other social issue. Mr. Reagan made the remarks in the course of discussing social issues and his judicial appointments in a wide-ranging interview with The Los Angeles Times, a transcript of which was released by the White House. In opposing abortion, the President said, ''I don't think that I'm trying to do something that is taking a privilege away from womanhood, because I don't think that womanhood should be considering murder a privilege.'' Strong Language Used Mr. Reagan's language on abortion was some of the strongest he has used in discussing the issue. In past statements, for example, he has referred to abortion as ''taking the life of a living human being.'' In the interview today, the issue was raised in the context of whether Mr. Reagan thought his judicial nominations would bring about a change in the way the courts interpret the law on abortion, school prayer and other social issues. In nominating Federal judges, Mr. Reagan said he had ''never given a litmus test'' to any of his appointments, including his latest choice for a position on the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia. Interpreters of the Law Mr. Reagan said: ''I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law.'' Asked if he agreed with a statement by Pat Buchanan, the director of White House communications, that the Administration's court appointments, and not legislative initiatives, were the key to advancing the social agenda of conservatives, the President replied, ''Yes.'' On other matters, Mr. Reagan said: * The Government is doing ''all that we can'' to finance research to find a cure for AIDS, but until that happens Americans should store their own blood to avoid catching AIDS from a blood transfusion. * He will remain neutral in the 1988 Republican Presidential primary campaign, even if his close friend, Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, should enter the race against Vice President Bush. ''I cannot take sides in the primary,'' he said. The President also said the Supreme Court decision banning prayer in public schools ''is just not in keeping with the Constitution at all.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PAT ROBERTSON LOOKS TO SOUTH AND EVANGELICALS AS KEY TO 1988,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/us/pat-robertson-looks-to-south-and-evangelicals-as-key-to-1988.html,"State by state, through the huge new churches, the handsome new clubs and restaurants of the New South, the Rev. Marion G. (Pat) Robertson, the television evangelist, is promoting himself for the Presidency. He is a Republican, and it is in a Southern regional primary, he says, that the nomination will be won. It was in the election of Jimmy Carter, another Southerner, as President that the evangelical Christian vote became an important factor, and it has grown more potent through a decade of political awakening. In the process, television ministers of the religious right like the Rev. Jerry Falwell have become powerful brokers within the national Republican Party structure, heavily influencing the form and appearance of the party, its candidates and its platform. But Mr. Robertson, who commands the largest national television audience of them all, from the studios of his Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Va., is the first to enter the secular world of politics as a possible candidate himself. It is a historic venture and, while political strategists doubt he can win the nomination, a Robertson candidacy would affect both the nominating process and the Christian community being called upon to support a preacher for the top secular role the United States offers. None of the other television preachers have crossed the line drawn against such personal engagement in temporal affairs. But Mr. Robertson was the son of a United States Senator before he became an ordained Southern Baptist minister and the smiling host of ''The 700 Club.'' Evangelical Christians Form Core of Support As he barnstorms the region in his corporate jet, a surge of people, predominantly evangelical Christians, are rallying to his cause, providing it with money and volunteer labor. And many are doing so because they accept his quest as literally the will of God. ''We feel like if he's heard from God Himself, we ar definitely excited about having him as a candidate,'' Travis Burke, pastor of the charismatic New Life Family Church, said after listening to Mr. Robertson here. Mr. Burke and his wife, Carleta, were among a scattering of preachers and lay Christians from across north central Florida who came to St. Mary's Primitive Baptist Church one recent afternoon to hear Mr. Robertson talk about the literacy program his television ministry is promoting. The pastor nodded in agreement as Mr. Robertson, who is 56 years old, spoke of the deplorable state of American schools. ''Praise God!'' Mr. Burke exclaimed as Mr. Robertson described how his program could teach the illiterate to read. Mr. Burke said he was going the next morning to a breakfast meeting of the Freedom Council, which Mr. Robertson calls his ''political arm,'' and would gladly work through his 80-member church for Mr. Robertson's candidacy ''as long as we're not doing anything illegal.'' Part of the Freedom Council's work is to educate ministers like Mr. Burke in what political activity is legal under the Federal tax laws. In training seminars over the last 14 months in various cities in Florida, the Freedom Council has trained as many as 800 preachers, most of them evangelicals, in the political process, said Richard Pinsky, the Florida coordinator. Last month, with the help of such pastors, Mr. Robertson stunned the campaign organizations of Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York when he outperformed them both by deploying more precinct delegate candidates in the first round of Michigan's complex process for selecting delegates to the national convention in 1988. In Nebraska this month, a smaller but similar wave of evangelical Christians aligned with the Freedom Council swept control of the Republican county conventions in Douglas County, where Omaha is situated, and in Lancaster County, which includes Lincoln. ''God is calling these people to get involved,'' said Bob Garrett, the Nebraska coordinator of the Freedom Council. The Lord, he explained, ''does speak to us - He makes his mind known to us with signs, or a still small voice or an audible voice.'' ''That particular view,'' says Gary Jarmin, a Washington political consultant to organizations of the religious right, ''is most representative of Pat's base among the charismatic/Pentecostal community.'' Such charismatic Christians make up 15 to 20 percent of the approximately 50 million evangelical Protestants in the United States, he said. They believe ''that these things are ordained of God,'' he said. With important decisions, ''they always lay in the hands of God to guide them,'' Mr. Jarmin said, ''and everything they do is what God led them to do. If Pat decides to run, then, for them, that is a God-led decision.'' Number of Charismatics Is Growing Rapidly The number of such charismatic Christians is growing rapidly, and many of those religious decisions are made by people in their adult years. William S. Rosasco 3d, a wealthy business executive who is a Democratic State Committeeman from the Florida Panhandle, was a fraternity brother and close friend of Mr. Robertson's when both were members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Washington & Lee University. It was not until after college that each found his way into the charismatic fold. Mr. Robertson, scion of an old Virginia family, whose father, A. Willis Robertson, represented Virginia in the Senate, went on to graduate from Yale Law School and entered business in New York before recognizing the emptiness in his life, he says now. Thirty years ago, he says, he was dining with a missionary friend of his mother's at the Barclay Hotel in Philadelphia when the missionary confronted him with the weakness of his claim to salvation. ''At that point I confessed Jesus Christ had died for my sins,'' Mr. Robertson says. His life changed direction. He went to the Biblical Seminary in New York, and when his young son developed a high fever and a doctor could not be found, he says, he began ''begging God to please heal him.'' The fever broke, and he reached within himself to find some way to thank God. ''Something gave way,'' Mr. Robertson says. ''I began to speak in something very much like an African dialect. It was a precious experience.'' Ever since, he has practiced faith healing and speaking in tongues, all the while building an empire of three television stations, the third largest cable network in the country, an audience estimated by Nielsen at 27 million to 28 million viewers a month, and an accredited graduate school, CBN University. ''The 700 Club'' of which he is the host is a Christian talk and news program that, in its early days, needed 700 people to contribute $10 a month to stay on the air. Mr. Rosasco's own conversion came about eight years ago, after his daughter nearly died in an automobile accident, and he now shares the perspective that moves Mr. Robertson and his charismatic followers. ''If Pat runs, it's going to be because God has spoken to him,'' Mr. Rosasco says. ''If he is led to do it, then God will move whatever obstacles He needs to move to put him where He wants him to be.'' Robertson Moderates His Oratory Mr. Robertson declared himself ''a Prophet of God'' in an angry letter to a critic four years ago but now shies away from such talk. At plainly secular events, he speaks in carefully, even enthusiastically, secular terms. At the Florida Economics Club, a business luncheon forum studded with university presidents and former Governors, he spoke familiarly of the oilman T. Boone Pickens and ''the Op-Ed page of The Wall Street Journal.'' He discussed the debilitating effect of the budget and trade deficits, and of the decline of the American industrial base. And he predicted the Dow Jones industrial average would hit 3,000, even 3,500, within two or three years, creating a new wave of great personal wealth from the stock market. ''I called my broker and said, 'I want to margin right up to the limit - I think this thing is going to go big,' '' Mr. Robertson told the crowd. Gerald Lewis, a Democrat who is the Comptroller of Florida, said: ''He was saying all the right things. He was establishing his credentials as someone who really understands the national economy. ''If he were going to campaign as a minister, amid a lot of anti-abortion and school prayer talk, he's smart enough to know that's not going to take him very far.'' It is at events that are evangelical in audience and organization, as with the affluent born-again group he addressed at the Governors Club here, that Mr. Robertson raises those issues, bitterly attacking Supreme Court rulings. There, he is frequently introduced as God's answer for a troubled society. ''God, we praise You that once again a man has been given to us to meet this crisis,'' said the pastor who offered the dinner invocation. And at the close of each rally arranged by the Freedom Council, someone invariably asks if he will run for President. He responds, grinning broadly, as he did here at the Christian Heritage Church: ''Let me ask you -should I do it?'' That brought 1,500 evangelicals to their feet in a roar of joyous supplication. 'You Have to Consider What the Lord Wants' With each stop in an exhausting schedule of speeches, rallies and news conferences strung through Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, Mr. Robertson is promising to declare himself in or out of the race for the Republican nomination by this August or September. ''Of course, you always have to consider what the Lord wants,'' he was quoted as saying in The Saturday Evening Post article that first raised the subject of his candidacy 15 months ago. ''If He were to say, 'Run for President,' then obviously any man of God would have to obey.'' Mr. Robertson no longer mentions heeding God's instruction. Nor does he volunteer comment on speaking in tongues or asking God to heal the sick. Charismatics and Pentecostalists believe these gifts are signs of having the Holy Spirit within, but they are practices that seem exotic to others and are actually considered demonic by some fundamentalists. Such opposing views illustrate the warring perspectives within the evangelical tent, which houses many doctrinally different factions. The charismatics and Pentecostalists came later to the political awakening than the fundamentalists, and Mr. Robertson's ability to enlist new ranks of voters from these camps draws admiration from strategists for other leading Republican aspirants to the Presidency. John P. Newport, provost of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, said he thought the spread of charismatic Christianity was ''the fastest-growing phenomenon in North America.'' Charismatics, who stand ready to be energized by Mr. Robertson, believe they can discern the will of God, he said. ''Obviously,'' he said, ''this is sort of scary.'' Some Doubts Persist About His Appeal Mr. Robertson has proved that he can galvanize the faithful legions waiting to be ''God-led'' and that their numbers can be effective in caucus and convention situations. But it remains to be seen whether a large enough percentage of them can be persuaded to turn out and vote in Republican primaries to affect the delegate count. And it also remains to be seen, said Mr. Jarmin, the political consultant for the religious right, whether Mr. Robertson could unite all the strains within the evangelical community, or whether he could appeal to voters beyond it. Republican strategists and consultants in other quarters say Mr. Robertson cannot attract broad enough support to win the nomination. Nor is the party's ideological posture likely to be affected by a Robertson candidacy, they say, because his social stands are already the party's. But if he should run and fail, a segment of contemporary Christianity could be left stranded on unfamiliar secular ground, facing a crisis of faith. ''I've seen this happen before'' in local races, Mr. Jarmin said. ''They run. They fail. Then they say to themselves: 'I thought this was ordained of God. What happened?'

"The Hubbard Poll: Move Over, Gallup",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/us/the-hubbard-poll-move-over-gallup.html,"Members of Congress use all kinds of measures to gauge their constituents' feelings on national issues. They read and count the mail, for example, and they meet with individuals, constituent groups and lobbyists. Representative Carroll Hubbard Jr., Democrat of Kentucky, has a broader approach. While many members do at least some polling, Mr. Hubbard has made a tradition of it, his aides say. Annually for 12 years he has mailed out about 200,000 questionnaires, trying to reach every constituent in his western Kentucky district. And he says the responses, while not scientific, ''help guide my voting.'' ''I don't always vote just to please the majority,'' Mr. Hubbard emphasized. But he added that the responses to the questionnaire - he has received about 34,000 so far this year -help him to stay in touch with his constituents. ''It's always helpful to know what my constituents are thinking when I'm considering these issues,'' he said. The most remarkable thing about the poll results, he says, is that although some opinions have changed over the years, most of the answers have stayed pretty much the same. One area where Mr. Hubbard said he had noticed a discernible shift in opinion was on the abortion question. ''It used to run about 30-70, with 30 percent in favor of the Supreme Court's decision to permit legalized abortion,'' he said. ''But it gets closer every year.'' Mr. Hubbard's survey this year, which covers issues as diverse as legalized abortion and air-quality legislation, so far shows 14,340 constituents in favor of the abortion decision and 18,658 opposed. Mr. Hubbard himself is opposed. As valuable as the polling data are, the size of the sample makes compiling the results an onerous task. So, to relieve his staff of the time required to pull the responses together, Mr. Hubbard has enlisted the support of several Kentucky political science professors and their students. Mr. Hubbard's wife, Carol, also takes a turn at tabulating, he added. And while the constituents' views are always important, they sometimes have to vie for attention with other powerful voices. On the issue of aid to anti-Communist guerrillas in Nicaragua, for instance, Mr. Hubbard's constituency registered its disapproval, though by a close margin. But Mr. Hubbard, who said he was ''genuinely undecided'' on the issue, noted that he was on his way to a luncheon today at the White House, where Reagan Administration officials were preparing to make their case, poll or no poll.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OBSERVER; Stand-Ins for Shy Darth,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/opinion/observer-stand-ins-for-shy-darth.html,"There hasn't been enough conservatism on the Supreme Court lately, but from now on there will be plenty. This is the burden of the news stories about President Reagan's remaking of the Court. All agree that when the President finishes with the Court it will be an instrument for enforcing the conservative Reagan philosophy well into the 21st century. Such speculation must be as depressing as Sunday night to Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia, whose promotions are causing the stir. A judge, after all, even when he's on the Supreme Court, is only a lawyer who happened to find favor with a successful politician. Most judges manage to put this deflationary fact out of mind when they ascend the bench, and it cannot be pleasant for them to be publicly reminded of it, as Messrs. Rehnquist and Scalia have been these past few days. If I were an intellectual whiz, as both these men are said to be, I would be a bit sour about having it said I got promoted not because I was a crackerjack benchster, but only because some politician thought I'd remain his faithful agent long after history turns him out to pasture. I would also be sensitive to that eerie criticism with which the more passionate conservatives tax Mr. Reagan; to wit, that he is not Reagan. ''Let Reagan be Reagan,'' they constantly urge him. And when he declines, ''If only Reagan would be Reagan,'' they cry in despair. Who is this Reagan that President Reagan is so reluctant to be? We all know who President Reagan is: he is the Gipper, the most lovable old regular-guy softie who ever went down the pike. He is the fellow who drove David Stockman up the wall by turning to mush when told that a lot of poor and hard-luck people would have to be hurt to balance the budget. He is the fellow with the grin who says he must have goofed when he classified Soviet Boss Gorbachev with the bad guys like Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas of Nicaragua. He is the fellow who talks a great fight against legal abortion and for school prayer, but has yet to twist a single arm in combat for either. There are other things he would have to do to be Reagan, and most of them are not the kind of things that create a landslide consensus for a fellow the public thinks of lovingly as the Gipper. If President Reagan decided to be Reagan to the complete satisfaction of his most earnest conservative backers, the public would forget the Gipper and think of Darth Vader. Curiously, though, while the President personally shuns the task of being Reagan, he seems to feel obliged to surround himself with people who are willing to be Reagan for him. He apparently feels so guilty about his pleasure in being the Gipper instead of Reagan that he cannot resist any chance to atone by packing the Government with people who would rather be Reagan than the Gipper. The chief eminence being Reagan this year is Attorney General Edwin Meese, whose task it is to dismantle the legal scaffolding erected in the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations in efforts to cope with intractable social problems. For Mr. Meese, of course, this is a joyous, not a dreary task, for he was born to be Reagan, just as Mr. Reagan was born to be the Gipper. I am blissfully uninformed on behind-the-scenes doings at the White House and am, therefore, certain it was Mr. Meese who proposed the Rehnquist and Scalia appointments. For one thing, had the choice been left to the President, the appointments would have gone to old Judge Hardy (Andy's dad over on the M-G-M lot) and the late Spencer Tracy (whose fine performance in ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' will reinforce memories of great screen acting well into the next century). Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia are entitled to wonder why, if the President doesn't want it even briefly, the job of being Reagan, and remaining Reagan for decades to come, is being offered to them. I can imagine two less extraordinary men privately sharing their suspicions: Scalia to Rehnquist: It's a swell job, all right, Bill, but if President Reagan doesn't want to be Reagan in the 1980's when it's easy . . . Rehnquist: I know where your head's at, Nino: like me, you're thinking, ''Wait a minute! Maybe being Reagan won't be as much fun up there in 2021 A.D. as it will the next few years.'' Scalia: And, also, I'll have grown grandchildren by that time and . . . Rehnquist: Sure, Nino. Nobody wants the grandchildren thinking of him as Darth Vader.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Topics; Presidential Insults: On 'Murder',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/opinion/topics-presidential-insults-on-murder.html,"Last January, the President of the United States told a member of the National Right-to-Life Committee that an end to bombings and other violence would earn the movement ''a lot of Brownie points.'' This week, he himself committed the crudest rhetorical violence. In opposing abortion, Mr. Reagan said, ''I don't think that I'm trying to do something that is taking a privilege away from womanhood, because I don't think that womanhood should be considering murder a privilege.'' Mr. Reagan has long opposed abortion and it's no secret that he would like to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, its decision that made abortion legal. But one does not expect the President - precisely because he is the President - to hurl such gratuitous invective at those who hold different views. By calling the millions of American women who have chosen to end their pregnancies murderers, Mr. Reagan moves from the picket line against abortion toward the ranks of those who aim to punish and even harm people who disagree. Their cause was always Mr. Reagan's cause and so, it seems now, is their language.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nothing Centrist About Abortion Decision,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/opinion/l-nothing-centrist-about-abortion-decision-708886.html,"To the Editor: Your editorial praising the latest Supreme Court abortion decision (''The Court Pushes Back: Landslides Do Not Legitimize Extremists,'' June 12) proclaims that the Court has saved us from the ''hard right'' positions which the Reagan Administration would impose upon the country, and has pushed us back to the ''decent center'' and the ''bipartisan social consensus developed over three decades.'' If the Reagan opposition to abortion is the ''hard right'' position, what is the ''hard left'' position that puts the Court in the center? It is difficult to imagine any position to the left of the one taken by the Court: that abortion is a constitutionally protected right, which prohibits a state even from collecting information about abortions or requiring that women be informed of the risks involved or the alternatives to abortion. What would the more extreme left position be? That women are constitutionally required to have abortions? It might be argued more plausibly that Associate Justice Byron R. White's dissent is in the center: that the Constitution says nothing about abortion pro or con and that the American people should be free to resolve the issue through their elected representatives. There was an uneasy ''bipartisan social consensus'' on abortion enacted into law by majorities in the several states before the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. But the Supreme Court disrupted that consensus by the Roe decision, pushing the country to the ''hard left.'' There has been no consensus since. You may disagree with the Reagan position, but you can hardly argue that the President has disrupted a ''social consensus'' that was destroyed by the Court itself more than a decade ago. GLEN E.

RESULTS OF ALABAMA PRIMARY MAY BE CHALLENGED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/26/us/results-of-alabama-primary-may-be-challenged.html,"State Attorney General Charles Graddick said today that unofficial returns proved he won a razor-thin victory in the Democratic gubernatorial runoff primary Tuesday in Alabama. But his opponent, Lieut. Gov. Bill Baxley, would not concede and may demand a recount. While Mr. Graddick paid a 55-minute courtesy call this morning on Gov. George C. Wallace, the venerable but ailing political icon he aims to succeed, Mr. Baxley huddled with aides to go over returns that show him losing by 6,602 votes of 926,569 cast. It was the narrowest margin ever recorded in a statewide political race in Alabama. Mr. Graddick said that Mr. Baxley told him today that he would not challenge the vote. But aides to Mr. Baxley, who was not available to reporters, said privately that a vote-by-vote challenge was being considered. Party officials will canvass the tally this weekend and the results will be sent to state officials Monday for certification. Mr. Graddick's margin is fewer than two votes for each of the state's 4,230 precincts. Election Materials Impounded Because of the close vote and fears of vote tampering, Mr. Graddick asked an Alabama judge Tuesday night to issue an order impounding all election materials to prevent tampering. But the judge's order caused confusion among county voting officials, and today the state Democratic Party chairman, John Baker, said that a national accounting firm would be employed to help party officials insure an accurate canvass of county returns. Mr. Graddick's victory in an election to choose the Democratic successor to Mr. Wallace would mean that the post-Wallace political era in Alabama would begin on a conservative political footing. Mr. Graddick, 41 years old, a former Republican from Mobile who switched party allegiance 10 years ago, is a staunch conservative. His support Tuesday was described by political experts as nearly identical with the constituency of the surburban and rural, upper- and middle-income white voters who carried Alabama for President Reagan in 1984. He received little support from black voters, who make up about 25 percent of the Democratic Party's registration in the state. Only a few months ago, Mr. Graddick, who finished second to Mr. Baxley in a crowded field of five Democrats in the first primary June 3, was given little chance of winning. 'A Two-Party Election' ''The election Tuesday was not a Democratic primary,'' said Gerald Johnson, a political science professor at Auburn University. ''It was a two-party election between a conservative Republican who happened to be running as a Democrat, and a traditional Democrat.'' Some supporters of Mr. Baxley said they were concerned that voters who cast ballots in the Republican primary on June 3 might have crossed over in Tuesday's balloting to vote for Mr. Graddick in the Democratic primary. Marty Connors, the executive director of the Alabama Republican Party, said Republicans provided the vital margin for Mr. Graddick. ''They were panicked that a liberal like Mr. Baxley might win,'' he said. But Mr. Baker said he thought that the number of crossover voters was ''statistically insignificant.'' He said that the party did not plan to challenge the crossover ballots, although Mr. Baxley might choose to do so. Mr. Baker was among Democratic Party leaders who had gone to court in an attempt to block the crossover voting by Republicans earlier this week, saying it violated party rules. But a Mobile County judge said any attempt by election officials to block such crossover voting was itself illegal. In the November election, Mr. Graddick would face Guy Hunt, a 52-year-old farmer and businessman, who won the Republican Party's gubenatorial nomination June 3. But Mr. Hunt is given little if any chance in the race. The defeat of Mr. Baxley, a former Attorney General who was once described as the ''boy wonder'' of Alabama politics, seemed to deal a sharp setback to more liberal elements in the state, including blacks, labor leaders, state employees and school teachers, who in recent years had come to dominate the Democratic Party leadership. Mr. Graddick said, ''One thing the election showed was that the Democratic Party in Alabama had wandered too far away from mainstream Alabamians, and I think we got to bring it back'' In his campaign, Mr. Graddick did not seek endorsements from the state's major black political leaders, and he critized Mr. Baxley in television commercials for having the support of ''black politicians.'' Mr. Graddick, who has served for eight years as Attorney General, is an advocate of capital punishment and a foe of abortion. He vowed in the campaign to purge the schools of homosexual teachers. Name-Calling Campaign ''Mr. Graddick won by galvinizing white voters by appealing to racism,'' said J. L. Chestnut Jr., a lawyer in Selma who is the chairman of the New South Coalition, one of the two key black political groups that had endorsed the 45-year-old Mr. Baxley. ''His election is a step backwards for Alabama.'' The three-week runoff campaign was marked by name-calling and accusations of racial politics, and was described by some as the dirtiest campaign in the state since 1970, when Mr. Wallace played on white fears to defeat Gov. Albert Brewer. Governor Wallace announced last April that he would not seek a fifth term as Governor, citing failing health and the pain from an assassination attempt in 1972 that left him paralyzed below the waist. Mr. Wallace, 66, who dominated the state's political scene over three decades, declined to endorse any gubernatorial candidate in the primary. His son, George Wallace Jr., won the Democratic nomination as State Treasurer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ADOPTION MARKET: A VARIETY OF OPTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/26/garden/the-adoption-market-a-variety-of-options.html,"EILEEN thought she would never have a child of her own. She had put off starting a family because of her career and then found herself, at the age of 41, a vice president of a Wall Street brokerage firm, divorced and infertile. When she tried to adopt a baby, she learned that licensed agencies rarely arranged adoptions of infants for single parents, and almost never if a parent was 40 or over. She tried to adopt a foreign-born infant, but it took her a year just to get the proper forms. ''Everybody in the world had to know what I was doing,'' said Eileen, who is attractive, has gray hair, bright blue eyes and, until recently, lived alone with a Persian cat. ''It was the most humiliating kind of process.'' Finally, Eileen, who asked that her last name not be used, turned to the ''gray market,'' the legal but controversial world of private adoption. A lawyer suggested she place ads in several small-town newspapers, and three months later she stood in a hospital delivery room as her adoptive son, Andrew, was born. In exchange, she paid the biological mother's hospital bills. ''I spent so many years believing it was impossible,'' Eileen said the other day at her home as Andrew, now almost 3 months old, wriggled beside her on the couch. ''Now, when I see a young couple around, I want to stop them and say, 'Don't put it off!' '' At a time when parents seeking to adopt outnumber adoptable American infants - as much as 100 to 1, by some estimates - more people, frustrated in their search to adopt infants from agencies, are turning to lawyers, doctors, the clergy and other sources to arrange what are known as independent adoptions. In 1982, the number of children adopted in this gray market actually exceeded the number adopted through licensed private agencies, the first time that has happened since 1961, according to the most recent statistics collected by the National Committee for Adoption, a Washington-based lobbying group for adoption agencies. The number of adoptions made through licensed private agencies decreased, to 14,549 in 1982, from 18,100 in 1975, while the number of independent adoptions increased to 16,743 in 1982 from 11,000 in 1975, according to the committee's statistics. There are three ways to adopt a child: through a public agency, when the child has become the responsibility of the state; through a private adoption agency, when a child is either referred by the state or the mother goes directly to the agency, or through a private adoption, independently arranged by the child's parents with the help of a third party. The majority of infants are adopted independently, said Dr. William L. Pierce, the president of the Committee for Adoption. The agencies simply do not have the infants the couples are looking for, he said. The New York Foundling Hospital, for example, one of the most respected and oldest private adoption agencies in the country, last year arranged for two adoptions by white couples seeking infants of their own race, according to Cecilia Rivera Healy, the director of adoption. She said her waiting list for such adoptions has ''hundreds'' of couples on it. ''For white infants, it's been very scarce for a number of years,'' she said. ''There was a time, about 20 years ago, when New York Foundling had many, many white infants. It's decreased, and I think now it's less than ever.'' Adoption agency officials say that they are looking for people to adopt older children and children with disabilities. Adoptions of foreign-born children have nearly doubled, from 4,868 in 1981, to 8,327 in 1984, Dr. Pierce said. Some 60 percent of the children adopted are born in Korea. But the number of American infants put up for adoption, child-welfare officials say, has shrunk because today there are fewer taboos against abortion and against a mother's raising her child out of wedlock. At the same time, according to adoption officials, more people are seeking to adopt, because more women, like Eileen, are delaying having children to pursue careers. Infertility therapy groups estimate that as many as one in five couples of reproductive age have difficulty conceiving. Both the increased demand for adoptable infants and the decreased supply has led to what Dr. Pierce describes as a ''baby chase'' atmosphere in the country, which has has spurred more gray-market adoptions and the controversy surrounding them. An American Bar Association committee, which has been trying since 1981 to devise an adoption statute that could be used as a national model, has been unable to agree on one because of the debate within the lawyers' association over independent adoptions. Sanford N. Katz, a law professor at Boston College who has written three books on adoption, including ''When Parents Fail,'' appointed the original A.B.A. adoption committee in 1981. It was disbanded two years later after its proposed statute was voted down, Mr. Katz said, and a new committee plans to release a new version of the model act at the A.B.A.'s winter meeting. ''The controversy surrounds not independent versus agency placement, but rather the question is 'Should there be regulation of the placement of children?' '' Mr. Katz said. Dr. Pierce and the adoption agencies he represents object to independent adoptions because the intermediaries, for the most part lawyers, have not been trained to find homes for children. They also say that the confidentiality of adoptive parents is not protected; that custody fights have resulted when biological parents have later sought, and successfully won, the return of a child; that adoptive couples are not adequately screened, and that biological parents do not receive enough counseling about their options, such as temporarily placing a child with foster parents. On the other hand, parents who have adopted children independently and the lawyers who represent them say that the biological mothers get a chance to screen prospective parents, that the mothers and babies get better medical care because adoptive parents pay for it, and that adoptive couples who feel they are qualified to be parents - although they have been rejected by agencies - get a chance to adopt. Blanche L. Gelber, a Manhattan adoption lawyer who works with agencies and advises clients on private adoptions, said biological mothers often chose private adoptions to avoid the ''constant intervention of a social worker'' from an agency. They also have more control and information about the adoptive parents, she said. Eileen paid $15,000 to $20,000, primarily in medical costs, which were higher than average because Andrew was born prematurely. In general, legal fees range from $1,500 to $3,500. Independent placements are illegal in nine states: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Virginia. They are restricted in four others: Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey and Wisconsin. But that may be changing. There has been pressure in the Connecticut Legislature to make independent adoptions legal. ''There is a move by states to liberalize adoptions,'' Dr. Pierce said. ''Many of the protections which would otherwise be present are being eroded.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; MOST AIRLINES HELD EXEMPT ON HANDICAPPED RIGHTS RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/28/us/supreme-court-roundup-most-airlines-held-exempt-on-handicapped-rights-rule.html,"The Supreme Court ruled today that almost all commercial airlines are not covered by a 1973 Federal law that bars discrimination against handicapped people. The Justices, in a 6-to-3 vote, reversed a Federal appellate court's ruling that upset Federal regulations exempting most airlines from detailed antidiscrimination rules. Those regulations had been challenged by groups representing handicapped passengers. The fact that airlines benefit from Federal aid to airports and the Federal air traffic control system, the Supreme Court ruled, does not bring them under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which bars discrimination against handicapped people in ''any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.'' Only airlines that actually receive Federal financial aid are covered by the law in their on-board activities, Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote in the majority opinion. Only a few small airlines receive such aid. Reagan Administration's Victory The decision today also appears to affect three other similarly worded Federal civil rights laws, which bar discrimination on grounds of race, sex and age. It would appear that those laws, too, would apply only to recipients of direct or indirect Federal aid. It was a victory for the Reagan Administration, which had appealed the Federal appellate decision. Today's ruling was based in part on the Court's ruling in the 1984 Grove City College case, which accepted the Administration's narrow reading of a similarly worded Federal law that bars sex discrimination by colleges that receive Federal money. The Court ruled then that the law barred sex discrimination only in those departments or programs that received Federal aid, not by a college as a whole. Legislation pending in Congress to overrule the 1984 decision has broad support but has been stalled by a dispute over a relatively minor abortion regulation. Supporters of the legislation said they hoped the decision today would give it new impetus. The Court's ruling may be important chiefly as a legal precedent exempting from antidiscrimination laws activities by private concerns that benefit from Federal programs but do not directly receive Federal money or other aid. It will probably have little immediate practical effect on air travel by handicapped people. They have a general, vaguely worded right not to be discriminated against in air transportation under a section of the regulations that was not challenged in the case decided today. But Arlene Battis, alawyer with the Paralyzed Veterans of America, which had challenged the Department of Transportation regulations, said today that full Section 504 coverage was needed to prevent some airlines from continuing such practices as requiring handicapped people to have attendants with them when they fly and to sit on blankets in case they are incontinent. Even if the decision had gone the other way, it would not have required airlines to make costly structural alterations to planes to accommodate handicapped people. Appeals Court's Ruling A three-judge Federal appeals court panel here had ruled that the law covered all commercial air travel because airlines benefited so pervasively from Federal assistance to airports. Justice Powell said this reasoning was contrary to the intent of Congress, for it would give section 504 ''almost limitless coverage,'' drawing in ''whole classes of persons and businesses with only an indirect relation to aviation,'' as well as trucking concerns that use federally financed interstate highways and those that use port facilities. ''The airlines do not actually receive the aid,'' he said. They only benefit from airports' use of the aid.'' Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissent joined by Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Harry A. Blackmun, said commercial airlines that required handicapped passengers to submit to conditions not imposed on other passengers ''discriminatorily deny the handicapped the benefits of federally funded programs or activities supporting the airport and airway system.'' He said airlines ''necessarily act as gatekeepers controlling who shall enjoy, and under what conditions, important benefits under federally funded and conducted programs.'' Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Byron R. White, William H. Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor joined the majority opinion in the case, United States v. Paralyzed Veterans, No. 85-289. The Court also took these actions today: Food Stamp Rules The Justices voted 6 to 3 to uphold amendments to the Federal Food Stamp Program that make it harder for parents, children and siblings who live in the same home to obtain benefits than for more distant relatives or groups of unrelated people who live in the same home. The amendments, enacted by Congress in 1981 and 1982 to protect against fraud and abuse, generally treat parents, children and siblings who live together as a single household, even if they do not buy food and prepare meals together, assigning them smaller benefits than they would receive if they were treated as separate households. In the case, Lyng v. Castillo, No. 85-250, the Justices reversed a Federal District Court in Texas and upheld the amendments as a ''rational'' way of seeking to prevent fraud or mistakes in a huge program. Sex Discrimination The Court unanimously ruled that a Federal appellate court should not have blocked an investigation by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission of a sex discrimination complaint by a former teacher against a religious school. The case, Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools, No. 85-488, began when a teacher at Dayton Christian Schools became pregnant and school officials told her she could not work the following year because of the school's religious belief that a mother should stay home with small her chldren. When the teacher consulted a lawyer, she was dismissed. She filed a sex discrimination charge with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, but the school obtained an order from a Federal appellate court barring the commission from proceeding against it. The appellate court said enforcement of the sex discrimination law against the school would violate its First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and the separation of church and state. Justice Rehnquist wrote for the High Court that the lower Federal courts should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction over the case because of the need to respect ''comity and Federalism.'' Four members of the Court did not join his opinion but agreed that Federal court intervention at the investigative stage was premature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G.O.P. GATHERING CONSIDERS POLITICAL LIFE AFTER REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/us/gop-gathering-considers-political-life-after-reagan.html,"Republican Party leaders today ended a three-day meeting here that publicly celebrated the political vitality of the Reagan Presidency and privately wrestled with the long-term implications of his latest victories on Capital Hill. ''Our main advantage right now is the strength of Ronald Reagan and the weakness of the Democrats,'' said one participant at this meeting of the Republican National Committee. ''The question is, how will the party fare on its own?'' That question seemed to be at the center of the discussions here. Despite the party's dramatic gains under Mr. Reagan's leadership, officials said its national coalition was fragile. ''Our party cannot afford to rest on its laurels,'' Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., the committee chairman, told the gathering. ''The fact that a majority of Republicans today are under 40 presents us with a responsibility to look to the future, to promote bold solutions for the 21st century. This is the only way we can continue our growth as a party.'' Mitch Daniels, a White House political aide, urged party leaders to savor ''one of the most dramatic and historic weeks of the Reagan Presidency.'' Mr. Daniels, saying that even some of Mr. Reagan's aides were surprised by his success on Capitol Hill, called attention to the Senate's passage of a major tax bill and the Democratic-controlled House's approval of the $100 million in aid Mr. Reagan had sought for the Nicaraguan rebels. He said that only a parliamentary maneuver by Democrats kept the Senate from confirming the nomination of Daniel A. Manion as a Federal appeals court judge in Chicago. Better Prospects Seen Mr. Daniels, assistant to the President for political and intergovernmental affairs, said these issues had strengthened the President's authority and the re-election prospects of Republican Senate candidates this fall. He said the tax bill would erase ''the lingering stereotype that we are the party of wealth and big business.'' Some Republicans and political professionals said they saw no signs that the tax bill, which cleared the Senate on a vote of 97 to 3, was emerging as an issue in the fall campaign. They also expressed concern that the issue of aiding the Nicaraguan rebels could be risky for their party. Most public opinion polls show that Americans, by a substantial majority, are opposed to Mr. Reagan's policy toward Nicaragua. Another uncertainty, some Republicans said in interviews, was how voters would react to Mr. Reagan's appointment of conservative Federal judges, especially if their decisions reversed longstanding court rulings on abortion, school prayer and other social issues. The Manion nomination appears to have already created political problems for at least one Republican Senator, Slade Gorton of Washington. Mr. Gorton voted in favor of the nomination after the White House agreed to clear the Senator's choice for a Federal district judgeship in his state. His Democratic opponent, Brock Adams, accused Mr. Gorton of ''selling out his principles'' and vowed to make vote an issue in their campaign. Concern Over Blacks In panel discussions, Republicans exchanged views on how to expand their party's base, especially among blacks. Mr. Fahrenkopf, in his address Friday, said Republicans could not afford to wait for blacks to come to the belief that they had benefited from Mr. Reagan's economic policies. ''We as a party have an additional challenge with the black community,'' he said. ''Republicans do not intend to turn their backs on black America, its history or its problems.'' In private conversations, some Republicans expressed concern that the party's effort in this area would be futile if the Reagan Administration was seen as abandoning civil rights programs and those seeking to increase job opportunities for blacks. There also seemed to be mixed views on how the religious right would fit into the party's future. Some Republican state chairmen said Christian fundamentalism in politics had the potential to bring into the party conservative Democrats and voters who have not been active in either party. But Don Moseley, a district party chairman from Virginia, said that in his state religious fundamentalists had shown more interest in promoting single candidates or single issues. ''I don't think the majority of these single-issue people stay in the party for long,'' he said. ''They're in and then they're out. We want people in our party as individuals and not as a bloc.'' ----White House Assailed on Manion WASHINGTON, June 28 (AP) - A Democratic senator today accused Mr. Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d of threatening the independence of the Federal judiciary by making deals to win Senate confirmation of Mr. Manion. ''Judicial pork barreling is dead wrong,'' Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware said in the Democrats' weekly radio address. ''It was clear that a majority of the Senate did not favor the Manion confirmation,'' Mr. Biden said. ''But when it came time to vote, the White House made a deal with some senators by agreeing to appoint individuals to the Federal bench that the President or Ed Meese had opposed only hours ago.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE NATION; ALABAMA PRIMARY ENDS UP A SQUEAKER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/weekinreview/the-nation-alabama-primary-ends-up-a-squeaker.html,"WHEN voters went to the polls here in last week's Democratic gubernatorial runoff, they were not only choosing a candidate to succeed the retiring George Corley Wallace; they were also helping to chart a new political course for Alabama, or so they might have thought. For years, this has been one of the few remaining New South states with an Old South-style governor. But the post-Wallace era got off to a shaky start. After a mean-spirited campaign fraught with name-calling, suggestions of marital infidelity and accusations of racial politics, conservative state Attorney General Charles Graddick claimed a wafer-thin victory over Lieut. Gov. Bill Baxley, a populist who had been the longtime favorite to succeed Mr. Wallace. The election was so close that the results are almost certain to be challenged in a recount. With more than 926,500 votes cast, unofficial returns showed Mr. Graddick with a 6,602 vote lead, the narrowest margin ever recorded in a statewide political contest. At week's end, Mr. Baxley still had not conceded. Mr. Graddick, citing fears of vote tampering, caused some confusion among local officials when, late on election night, he obtained a court order impounding ballot boxes. Democratic party leaders subsequently hired an accounting firm to help canvass the results before turning them over to state election administrators this week for formal certification. To the distress of many Democrats here, Mr. Graddick, a former Republican who switched parties only 10 years ago, had urged Republicans to vote for him in Tuesday's runoff. Republicans have their own nominee, Guy Hunt, a farmer and businessman, in the November election. If Mr. Graddick eventually prevails, the post-Wallace era in Alabama politics will have a distinctly conservative tone. An outspoken foe of abortion and advocate of capital punishment, Mr. Graddick portrayed himself as an independent-minded politician not beholden to any camp. His constituency last week was not unlike the one that carried Alabama for President Reagan in 1984 - conservative white voters from the small towns and well-heeled suburbs of Alabama's larger cities. Blacks in Alabama, who make up a fourth of the registered Democrats, voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Baxley. After helping re-elect Mr. Wallace to his fourth and final term in 1982, black leaders wasted little time in describing the election of Mr. Graddick as a step backwards. The contest between the two men, who emerged in front of a field of five Democrats on June 3, seemed more like a general election than a party primary. If Mr. Graddick was the choice of white Republican-leaning conservatives, Mr. Baxley's candidacy was founded on the traditional Democratic coalition of blacks, union leaders and school teachers who have dominated the party leadership and the Legislature in recent years. Mr. Graddick vowed last week to work against those groups, and to bring the party leadership more in line with what he called the mainstream thinking of Alabamians. But first, Mr. Graddick, who began his campaign last winter as an underdog, will have to survive possible challenges to an election that was decided by fewer than two votes apiece in each of the state's 4,230 precincts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHOOSING TO DIE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/books/choosing-to-die.html,"THE END OF LIFE Euthanasia and Morality. By James Rachels. 204 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $17.95. MORE than 5,500 people die every day across this country, one every 16 seconds or so. But there is something dramatically new in many of these deaths (no one knows exactly how many) - they are negotiated, arranged, even scheduled by doctors, families and the dying patients themselves. In ''The End of Life: Euthanasia and Morality,'' James Rachels explores the other side of medical technology's advancing ability to prolong life - its ability not to. By whom, how and when can the decision be made that the marvelous machines, medicines and methods are no longer prolonging a life but are instead prolonging a death? More than a quarter-century into our age of advanced medical technology, the moral debate over when and how the biological end of life officially arrives is just beginning in this country. If the emotions and even violence of the abortion debate shock many, the national debate over euthanasia will only cause greater trauma. Earlier this month, in its first foray into the controversy, the Supreme Court struck down the Reagan Administration's ''Baby Doe regulations'' mandating life-saving treatment for severely handicapped newborns - a measure of the forces already coming to bear on a topic many of us prefer to ignore. Mr. Rachels, a professor of philosophy at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, carefully probes the subject for social lessons and guidelines in ''The End of Life,'' the latest volume in Oxford University Press's series on new ethical issues in medicine and science. With 80 percent of America's deaths occurring in institutions now, chances are good the end of life for many of us will not come when the fates decide it should. It will come when a technician unplugs the respirator, turns off the chemical ''food'' or decides against restarting a stricken heart. Mr. Rachels has thoughtfully and provocatively addressed the question of how to articulate humane rules for governing this process and considers the difference between having a life and simply being alive. Some of his philosophical ruminations are ponderous, though they may be necessary to his argument. But he painstakingly strips away the myths about death that people in distress find so comforting. He traces the religious and historical roots of our attitudes toward killing and dwells on the circumstances in which we accept it - war and self-defense. He notes how the concept of mercy killing, or euthanasia (from the Greek meaning ''good death''), has been accepted by various cultures from ancient Athens, whose citizens routinely killed deformed infants, to modern America, where juries have on occasion refused to indict or condemn those who admit they killed a terminally ill spouse or relative in severe pain. FOLLOWING Hume, Mr. Rachels makes the telling point that ''if it is for God alone to decide when we shall live and when we shall die, then we 'play God' just as much when we cure people as when we kill them.'' He notes the difference between passive euthanasia (allowing someone to die) and active euthanasia (assisting someone to die). He documents how courts and medical associations have recently shown an increasing approval of withholding respirators, medicines and even artificial foods from terminally ill or vegetative patients when there is no hope of a meaningful recovery. And he demolishes the ''slippery slope'' argument: that by allowing some merciful deaths, our society will slide, Nazilike, into ever widening circles of homicidal permissiveness. He points out that from the start Nazi Germany cast a wide net for its victims and that we already have established degrees of seriousness in taking human life -including manslaughter, self-defense, first-degree premeditated murder, murder by reason of insanity. He suggests a new plea category: mercy killing, with the same proofs of innocence required as in the case of self-defense. If the accused could show that the victim, when competent, requested death and was suffering from a painful terminal illness, the defendant would be acquitted. This would place legal responsibility firmly on the mercy killer. Events are moving quickly in this field. Mr. Rachels does not note, but readers well might, that the Netherlands is already practicing a form of legalized euthanasia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Risk to Nonsmokers Debated,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/us/risk-to-nonsmokers-debated.html,"Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has warned again that people who do not smoke run a high risk of getting lung cancer from breathing the smoke of others. Testifying at House hearings Friday, the head of the Public Health Service said past studies and others that were soon to be published strongly linked ''passive smoke exposure'' with increased risk of lung cancer. But the findings were challenged by Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, who said, ''The evidence is not there.'' In response to a question from Mr. Bliley about the relative risks of smoking and abortion, Dr. Koop said, ''I consider a dead fetus to be a serious health matter. I have stated over and over again that smoking is the greatest health hazard.'' Dr. Koop testified before a subcommittee headed by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, that is considering bills requiring the separation of smoking and nonsmoking areas in Federal buildings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Senators' Judicial 'Litmus',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/30/opinion/the-senators-judicial-litmus.html,"For more than a year now, the Senate Judiciary Committee has struggled to thwart President Reagan's constitutionally rooted power of appointment. First, William Bradford Reynolds failed to win approval to be associate attorney general. More recently, Jefferson B. Sessions 3d was refused support for a district judgeship. And now the confirmation of Daniel Manion, under attack from the liberal left in and out of Government, has been held up by parliamentary maneuver. What has been common to all three cases is the alleged objectivity of the attack: competence, not ideology, was said to be the Senators' primary criterion. But now the ideological cat is out of the senatorial bag. Following the President's recent nominations to the United States Supreme Court, Senator Paul Simon confessed that ''ideology is a reasonable consideration'' for the Senate to make in judging the qualifications of Judge Antonin Scalia and Justice William H. Rehnquist. The partisan politics involved in this process is interesting in and of itself. But it is not the cause for the deepest concern. Much more troubling is the nearly suffocating liberal juridical dogma that pervades the media and the legal professoriate. The real problem is not the Senate, but the opinions of those - men like Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard University Law School and Herman Schwartz of American University Law School - upon whom many Senators are likely to depend. The basic ideological argument being raised against the Reagan appointments is that they are too much in lockstep with the President's own conservatism. The need, the critics are already insisting, is for judges who are truly independent, judges who will have the moral fortitude to stand against the ideological tides that wash through our politics. This is, at best, a disingenuous argument. For what the critics demand is not in fact intellectual independence but slavish intellectual conformity - conformity with the Warren Court liberalism that has for so long corrupted our law schools and tainted our judicial politics. It is a mindless and strident liberalism that Ronald Reagan twice showed to be on the way out - if indeed not already vanquished. Critics of the Reagan judiciary have long bewailed the Administration's alleged use of a conservative ''litmus test'' in choosing whom to appoint to the Federal bench. Yet now the Senate is threatening to do exactly that: many critics now insist that it is essential to question Judge Scalia and Justice Rehnquist on particular substantive issues such as abortion and school prayer. What this means, in a nutshell, is that the critics would have the Senate approve only judges who subscribe to the current academic orthodoxy that holds that there should be no difference between constitutional law and moral theory. This view dangerously stretches the Constitution, yet those who reject it are branded as heretics and readied to be burned at the stake of academic opinion. These scholarly fires of ideological loathing are regularly stoked by publications such as the Harvard Law Review and The New York Review of Books. The fact of the matter is that there are two majorities out there. One is the general public, whose sentiments have been galvanized and expressed by the President. The other is the legal profession, especially in the law schools. It is not clear why the biases of a single profession should be more compelling than the general sense of the American people as a whole. But what is clear is that a judge or justice should be both willing and able to resist both majorities in defense of constitutional principle. And that is what those nominated by the President have all been about. The ever prescient Alexis de Tocqueville observed long ago that Federal judges must be statesmen able ''to steer out of the current when the tide threatens to carry them away, and with them the sovereignty of the Union and obedience to its laws.'' Steering out of the rushing, swirling currents of contemporary academic opinion may very well be the greatest task facing any judge or justice today. What bothers the critics the most, apparently, is that the President's nominees seem quite capable of meeting that challenge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"EAST, A SENATOR FROM CAROLINA, A SUICIDE AT 55",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/30/us/east-a-senator-from-carolina-a-suicide-at-55.html,"Senator John P. East was found dead on the floor of the garage at his home in Greenville this morning. The County Medical Examiner ruled the death a suicide. The police said the garage was sealed and full of fumes from a station wagon inside. Dr. Stan Harris, the Medical Examiner, said after conducting an autopsy that Senator East had asphyxiated from breathing carbon monoxide. The Senator, a 55-year-old Republican, who had driven from Washington with an aide on Saturday, was alone in the house this weekend. Here in the state capital, Gov. James G. Martin Jr. called the death ''a tragic loss for North Carolina,'' and ordered state flags flown at half-staff. He Wasn't Running for 2d Term The Senator announced last year that he would not seek a second term this fall because of ill health. The Governor's office said that someone would be appointed to serve the remaining six months of the term but that Governor Martin would have nothing to say about that appointment until the memorial period had passed. Senator East, a thoroughgoing conservative who planned to return to teaching political science at East Carolina University in Greenville, had just begun to edit proofs of his book of political essays, aides said. ''It was a total shock,'' Jerry Woodruff, the Senator's press secretary, said of the death. The Senator's wife, Priscilla Sherk East, was out of town. ''It would be hard to say that he was despondent, but he would occasionally remark that he didn't feel like his old self,'' Mr. Woodruff said. Senator East used a wheelchair to move about as a result of polio suffered in his mid-20's. The Senator also suffered from hypothyroidism, for which he was hospitalized last year. The illness, in which the thyroid gland stops making the hormones necessary to regulate the body's metabolism, caused him to miss much of the Senate's work in 1985. The Senator took medicine daily for this disorder, Mr. Woodruff said. Mr. Woodruff said he understood ''that hypothyroidism often causes depression.'' ''There is some sort of hormonal relationship there,'' he said. The Senator ''would occasionally remark that he regretted very much that hypothyroidism forced him into announcing his retirement last year,'' Mr. Woodruff said. But he added that the Senator had given no indication of being depressed. ''He kept to himself a lot,''Mr. Woodruff said. ''He was a very independent sort of guy.'' Senator East was selected for the Senate race six years ago by Jesse Helms, the state's senior Senator, also a conservative. And with Mr. Helms's support and strong financing from his National Congressional Club here, which enabled Mr. East to buy heavy television advertising, Mr. East defeated the incumbent Senator, a conservative Democrat, Robert B. Morgan, by 10,411 votes out of 1.8 million cast. Few Public Appearences Mr. East made few public appearances himself, and in his term remained in Mr. Helms's shadow. He offered a bill that would have negated the United States Supreme Court decision permitting abortion by declaring that an embryo became a human being at the moment of conception. The legislation failed. But Mr. Woodruff said Senator East seemed to be calm about his transition back to private life. ''To us it appeared that he was making plans for the future,'' he said. Prof. Maurice D. Simon, chairman of the political science department at East Carolina, said that just last week Mr. East wrote to accept the university's invitation to return as a tenured full professor. He last spoke to him on Thursday by telephone in Washington, the professor said. ''He seemed in very good spirits, and he seemed very positive about returning to academic life,'' Professor Simon said. He Kept the Same House Mr. East kept the same comfortable one-story brick house in the Brook Green residential area here that his family had lived in when he taught. It was in the garage of that house, on Long Meadow Road, that an aide, John Petree, found Mr. East at 8:15 A.M., Sgt. Roger Benton of the Greenville police said. Mr. Woodruff said that Mr. Petree had frequently accompanied the Senator on his trips between Washington and Greenville, and that Senator East had driven back to North Carolina with him on Saturday. Mrs. East was on Hilton Head Island, S.C., helping her mother move to a new home, when Mr. East returned Saturday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HIGH COURT, 5-4, SAYS STATES HAVE THE RIGHT TO OUTLAW PRIVATE HOMOSEXUAL ACTS; PRIVACY LAW AND HISTORY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/01/us/high-court-5-4-says-states-have-right-outlaw-private-homosexual-acts-privacy-law.html,"With its decision today that the constitutional right to privacy does not extend to homosexual conduct, the Supreme Court interrupted the expansion of the concept of privacy on which it embarked more than 60 years ago. The 5-to-4 majority drew a sharp line of demarcation between those choices that are fundamental to heterosexual life -whether and whom to marry, whether to conceive a child, whether to carry a pregnancy to term - and the decision to engage in homosexual acts. The heterosexual choices fall within the ''zone of privacy'' that the Court has defined, with greater or lesser clarity, in dozens of cases. The line stretches back to a pair of decisions in the mid-1920's that gave parents the right to make basic choices about their children's education, and more recently includes rulings on contraception and abortion. No Resemblance to Precedents Writing for the majority today, Associate Justice Byron R. White canvassed those precedents and then observed, ''We think it evident that none of the rights announced in those cases bears any resemblance to the claimed constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy that is asserted in this case.'' Arguments to the contrary, Justice White said, were ''insupportable'' and ''facetious.'' The Court looked to history for reasons that the constitutional boundary should be so immutable, why the zone of privacy should not extend to intimate relations between people of the same sex. Condemnation of homosexuality, Justice White wrote, has ''ancient roots.'' The Georgia law at issue dates to 1816. The original 13 states all outlawed homosexual acts, as did all 50 states until 1961. Since then, either legislation or court decisions have made private homosexual acts between consenting adults no longer criminal in 26 states. Second Basis for Decision The Court frequently uses history as a guide, although not invariably. For example, it overlooked history in 1967 when it declared unconstitutional a Virginia law that barred interracial marriage. Sixteen states had such laws at the time, and Virginia defended its statute on the ground that it protected ''traditional moral values.'' But there was a second basis for the decision today that offers an insight into the Court's current mood, extending beyond the constitutional question at hand. The Court would not seek to ''discover new fundamental rights,'' Justice White said, because ''the Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy'' when its decisions are not rooted ''in the language or design of the Constitution.'' He said this was ''painfully demonstrated by the face-off between the Executive and the Court in the 1930's,'' a reference to President Roosevelt's abortive effort to ''pack'' a Supreme Court that had invoked the Constitution to block many New Deal programs. By expanding the list of fundamental rights, Justice White said, ''the judiciary necessarily takes to itself further authority to govern the country without express constitutional authority.'' The Consensus Factor This portion of the opinion was an unusually explicit discussion of a factor that is always present when the Court finds itself at the frontiers of constitutional law: the Court's sense of where its judgment fits within the broader social consensus. Historically, many Justices have believed that to place the Court too far ahead of the consensus too often is to hurt the institution, to make it ''vulnerable,'' to use Justice White's word, to attack from the political branches. In this context, Justice White did not mention the Court's landmark privacy decision, Roe v. Wade, which established abortion as a constitutional right. But he and William H. Rehnquist, the Chief Justice-designate, who also joined today's opinion, were the two dissenters in the 1973 abortion case. They have dissented from all the subsequent decisions expanding on the principles of Roe v. Wade. The Court is keenly aware that the political furor over Roe v. Wade has yet to die down. The fact that Justices White and Rehnquist garnered a majority for the decision today may indicate that the Court simply has no appetite for venturing once again into uncharted territory. The expected arrival of Antonin Scalia will not change that mood; it is virtually certain, based on his judicial and scholarly writing, that he would have voted with the majority. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who is retiring next month, voted in the majority. Other Challenges Possible In addressing itself to the issue of homosexual acts, the Court did not foreclose other constitutional challenges to other laws affecting the rights of homosexuals, such as a challenge, based on the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee, to laws that discriminate against homosexuals in such areas as housing and employment. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who provided the majority's crucial fifth vote today, suggested in a concurring opinion that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment might bar prison sentences for homosexual acts. The four Justices who dissented, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, offered a drastically different vision of the right to privacy. Justice Blackmun said the issue was more profound than merely the choice of sexual act, but rather encompassed as well what he called ''the fundamental interest all individuals have in controlling the nature of their intimate associations with others.'' His dissenting opinion was a strongly worded plea for expanding the zone of privacy to encompass human sexuality in all its forms, traditional or not, approved by society at large or not, as long as the parties involved are consenting adults. That is not an invitation that the Court is likely to accept in the foreseeable future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PRIVATE-EYE DRAMA, ABC'S 'SPENSER: FOR HIRE'",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/01/arts/private-eye-drama-abc-s-spenser-for-hire.html,"AFTER tumbling to the bottom of the ratings, ABC is hard-pressed to find bright spots on its programming schedule these days but, in a pinch, ''Spenser: For Hire'' would be a moderately promising candidate. The ratings for the detective series in its first season were of the borderline variety but, given the rest of ABC's lineup, the show attracted enough interest and reviewer support to merit renewal. ''Spenser: For Hire'' will be back in the fall. Considering its promise more than its achievement, the show deserves the break. Based on the novels of Robert B. Parker, who has been devising approximately one Spenser caper a year since the early 1970's, the series stars Robert Urich as the Boston private detective who left the police force because the rules cramped his unorthodox, wisecracking style. When not disabling or annihilating the standard mix of urban thugs and swindlers, Spenser is partial to quoting poetry, especially Wordsworth. Today, Mr. Parker's Spenser would be fiftyish. Mr. Urich's, developed for television by John Wilder, is a well-preserved fortyish. Such, presumably, are the ''hunk'' demands of prime time. Spenser lives with a woman named Susan (Barbara Stock) and has a complicated, tough but tender friendship with a man named Hawk (Avery Brooks). In any event, played to a spiffily wicked turn by Mr. Brooks, Hawk is an intriguing creation, whether working out with Spenser at the local gym or prowling around the city in his expensive clothes and luxury car. He always seems to know a little more than anyone else and he is apparently physically invincible. In fact, he almost steals the show. One curious problem with the series so far is that Spenser is a touch too nice. He has lost the ironic edge of the original. Mr. Parker's hero is indeed, like most fictional detectives, mired in hard-boiled sentimentality. He can dream of a more comforting past where, as one novel puts it, ''there's a kind of mellowness and a memory of another time and another America.'' But, a moment later, he can sadly admit that it ''probably never was America, though.'' Television's Spenser shies away from the more uncomfortable perspective. Still, if Mr. Parker had to produce one novel a year, this single season of the television series has been forced to churn out some 28 episodes, which ABC is currently running on Tuesdays at 10 P.M. Not surprisingly, many of the plots are merely serviceable, dotted with the perfunctory shoot-outs and car chases. Nevertheless, the series has managed to establish a distinctive personality. The key characters are well conceived, as are such regulars as the police lieutenant (Richard Jaeckel) and the police sergeant (Ron McLarty). Furthermore and not least, a good deal of the location shooting is actually done in Boston, lending the shows a precise and well-defined sense of place, which is rare in American prime time. Tonight's installment has Spenser looking for an illegal alien. The twist: the man's helpless son is being held as bait by an overzealous immigration official. This is fairly ordinary Spenser and rather pedestrian television. But occasionally the series takes an unexpected turn, getting into areas that are beyond the average private-eye thriller. In one episode, for instance, rebroadcast last week, Spenser and Susan find themselves confronting the fact of her pregnancy. Written by Robert Hamilton, that story begins with Spenser killing, after the requisite chase through crowded streets, a two-bit hoodlum who had been contracted to murder him. But then Spenser learns from Hawk that the dead man had two young children, both of whom seem delighted that they will never have to see their father again. Taking the youngsters under his wing temporarily, Spenser begins to notice that Susan is looking troubled and distant. Finally guessing that she's pregnant, he urges her to have the baby, but she is reluctant to give a child life with a father who is constantly on the edge of violence and uncertainty. Watching Spenser winning the affections of the dead man's children, Susan, exasperated by his sense of justice and obligation, asks, ''Are you ever going to realize you can't take on the world?'' Sure, he says, ''when I grow up.'' Susan is charmed but not convinced. In the final scene, she is in a hospital bed, obviously having had an abortion. A disappointed Spenser confides: ''Susan and I had gone to war but still, unyielding, loved each other. Guess that's the only road to peace.'' Any private-eye format has its limitations. There is not much room for character development. The only significant change in Mr. Parker's Spenser over nearly 14 years is that he has switched from bourbon to Irish whisky. Still, as a reciter of poetry and an amateur chef of some sensitivity, tough, sarcastic Spenser should be able to snare a quality television run for himself. Kojak did it with a lollipop. And Mr. Urich is prettier than Telly Savalas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HIGH COURT, 5-4, SHARPLY LIMITS CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION FOR ADS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/business/high-court-5-4-sharply-limits-constitutional-protection-for-ads.html,"The Supreme Court, sharply limiting First Amendment protection for commercial speech, today ruled 5 to 4 that governments may sometimes ban truthful advertising of products and services that are legal to sell.

It also appeared to support the constitutionality of restrictions on advertising of liquor and, perhaps, of cigarettes and other products. Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority opinion suggested broadly, but somewhat ambiguously, that states can ban or restrict advertising ''of products or activities deemed harmful, such as cigarettes, alcoholic beverages and prostitution.'' A Lesser Step for States Justice Rehnquist reasoned that if it would be constitutional for a state to prohibit the sale of a product ''deemed harmful,'' then the state may also take the lesser step of banning or restricting advertising of that product without banning its sale. He rejected arguments by major news organizations, advertising groups, the American Newspaper Publishers Association and others, as friends of the Court, that Puerto Rico's restrictions on casino advertising were contrary to the Court's previous First Amendment rulings. Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr., dissenting, accused the majority of ''dramatically shrinking the scope of First Amendment protection available to commercial speech, and giving government officials unprecedented authority to eviscerate constitutionally protected expression.'' Associate Justice John Paul Stevens dissented separately. Associate Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun signed both dissents. Justice Brennan said the Puerto Rico law ''clearly violates the First Amendment,'' because a government may not ''suppress truthful commercial speech in order to discourage its residents from engaging in lawful activity.'' Puerto Rico had argued that the advertising curbs were supported by its interest in allowing casinos to operate to attract tourist dollars while protecting the island's own residents from excessive involvement in casino gambling, saying it would lead to the ''disruption of moral and cultural patterns'' and increase local crime, such as prostitution and corruption. A Puerto Rico court, in upholding the restrictions on casino advertising in 1984, interpreted them as allowing ''an advertisement in The New York Times'' or in other print or electronic media aimed at tourists rather than local residents. Today's decision, Posados de Puerto Rico v. Tourism Co., No. 84-1903, came in an appeal by a casino owner who had been fined for violating the restrictions. Justice Rehnquist said the case was different from previous cases in which the Court has struck down state laws banning advertisement of contraceptives and abortion clinics. In those cases, he said, ''the underlying conduct that was the subject of the advertising restrictions was constitutionally protected and could not have been prohibited by the state.'' ''Here, on the other hand, the Puerto Rico Legislature surely could have prohibited casino gambling by the residents of Puerto Rico altogether,'' he said. ''In our view, the greater power to completely ban casino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban advertising of casino gambling.,'' Justice Stevens said in his dissent that the Puerto Rico law ''blatantly discriminates'' between publications by applying ''one standard to The New York Times and another to The San Juan Star.'' He said, ''Perhaps, since Puerto Rico somewhat ambivalently regards a gambling casino as a good thing for the local proprietor and an evil for the local patrons, the ban on local advertising might be viewed as a form of protection against the poison that Puerto Rico uses to attract strangers into its web.'' The effect of today's decision on various existing and proposed restrictions on cigarette advertising is somewhat unclear, partly because it is unclear whether it would be unconstitutional for a government to ban cigarette smoking. States are empowered to ban liquor sales under the 21st Amendment. Leonard Orkin, a New York lawyer who specializes in advertising and First Amendment law, said the decision was not likely to lead to immediate changes in advertising policies for cigarettes and other products. ''The Puerto Rico case is of interest because of the unusual legal question of whether it is acceptable to distinguish between local advertising and other advertising, not because of any broad impact it will have,'' he said. Curbs on Cigarette Ads In 1972, before the Court had explicitly recognized that the First Amendment provides a degree of protection for commercial speech, it summarily affirmed, without explanation, an act of Congress barring radio and television advertising of cigarettes. More recently, the American Medical Association and others have called for a ban on all advertising, including print advertising, of all tobacco products. Last month seven members of the House of Representatives introduced such legislation. The Tobacco Institute assailed the proposal as ''blatantly unconstitutional.'' The American Civil Liberties Union and some First Amendment experts agreed. But today's decision could encourage advocates of such legislation. The majority opinion suggested broad deference to what Justice Rehnquist called the interest of Puerto Rico, or any government, in restricting activities it deems harmful to the ''health, safety or welfare of its citizens.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sister Marjorie Tuite, Advocate for Women",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/obituaries/sister-marjorie-tuite-advocate-for-women.html,"Sister Marjorie Tuite, a social activist who was an advocate of women's rights in the Roman Catholic Church, died Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan and in Chicago. Sister Tuite, a member of the Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs order in Columbus since 1942, was director of Ecumenical Action for Church Women United, a national organization. In recent years, she traveled extensively in Central America and in 1984 served as a delegate to the First Congress on Human Rights. Her opposition to United States policy in Central America and her advocacy of women's rights brought her into sharp conflict with the church hierarchy, and at one time she was threatened with expulsion for being among 24 American nuns who signed a newspaper advertisement calling for dialogue with the church on the abortion issue. A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of Fordham University, earned a master's degree from Manhattanville College and a doctorate from the St. Mary of Lake Seminary in Chicago. There are no immediate survivors.

Crime in the Bedroom,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/opinion/crime-in-the-bedroom.html,"A narrow Supreme Court majority, taking a narrow view of the rights at stake, has given states renewed license to regulate sexual conduct they deem deviant. In a 5-to-4 ruling endorsing Georgia's right to declare sodomy a crime, the Court crudely rejects as ''facetious'' the argument that such a law invades privacy and strikes at deeply personal, basic liberties. Though many states and cities have lost interest in searching bedrooms, all are again free to pry into the private lives not only of homosexuals, as in the case at court, but also of heterosexual partners and even married couples. This was a gratuitous and petty ruling, an offense to American society's maturing standards of individual dignity. The Court says such intrusive laws have ''ancient roots.'' So do laws against racial intermarriage, contraception and abortion that the Court has rightly struck down as unconstitutional invasions of liberty. So does reverence for the home, from which British judges long ago barred the King. Surely a Constitution that safeguards the individual's right to choose a mate and plan a family without the state's instruction has room for a privacy right that protects the most intimate and personal human relations. Writing for the Court, Justice Byron White mocks the challengers for supposedly claiming that ''the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.'' Surely that formulation perverts the case if not the law. It is the right of states to criminalize anal and oral sex - and every American's private sex - that was at issue. Having belittled the danger to liberty, Justice White imagines dangers to law. He worries that striking down a sodomy law would leave the state powerless to legislate against, say, incest. The easy answer comes in Justice Harry Blackmun's eloquent dissent. Obviously no right of privacy can bar the state from protecting the health and safety of minors or innocent offspring. And decidedly not at issue, though perhaps unduly infecting the Court's judgment, was the widespread debate about the state's power to regulate sexual practices in public. Justice Blackmun addresses these lurking questions squarely: ''It is precisely because the issue raised by this case touches the heart of what makes individuals what they are that we should be especially sensitive to the rights of those whose choices upset the majority.'' Disapproval of homosexuality, Justice Blackmun adds, cannot justify ''invading the houses, hearts, and minds of citizens who choose to live their lives differently . . . no matter how uncomfortable a certain group may make the majority of this Court.'' Appealing to a calmer time, a higher wisdom and a broader grasp of liberty, he hopes, as all Americans should, for a Court that will reconsider and conclude that legislating for the bedroom ''poses a far greater threat'' to constitutional values than tolerance of nonconformity could ever do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inconsistent Policy on South Africa and China,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/03/opinion/l-inconsistent-policy-on-south-africa-and-china-652186.html,"To the Editor: The Reagan-Shultz rationale for opposing economic sanctions against South Africa to protest that Government's racist policies is that United States investments in South Africa are too small to matter. President Reagan says that the U.S. investment in South Africa accounts for only one percent or less of that country's total foreign investment, therefore our disinvestment would hardly influence the Pretoria Government. The same Reagan Administration threatens total withdrawal of United States support from the United Nations Fund for Population Activities because that organization provides one percent or less of the funds for China's allegedly coercive family-planning program. If that one percent were withdrawn, would it change the course of the Chinese program? A ban against U.S. investment or loans in South Africa, according to Mr. Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, would leave no further leverage for us to press for reform. Would the same reasoning not apply to economic sanctions against the United Nations population fund? If the allegations against the Chinese program are true, coercion ought to be stopped; but if U.S. financial support is withdrawn, where's the leverage to persuade the Chinese to change their ways? The reluctance to apply economic sanctions against South Africa becomes even more ludicrous when one considers the haste to cut off U.S. funds to the U.N. Fund for Population Activities in the following light: There is no question that apartheid is the policy of the white Government of South Africa, but the Chinese Government steadfastly denies allegations of coercion in its family-planning program. Furthermore, the U.N. agency categorically denies that it finances abortions - coercive or voluntary -in China or anywhere else. Moreover, U.S. funds for the U.N. population fund is in a segregated account to insure that it cannot be spent in China. When a government uses a cynical double standard to justify a selective concern for human rights, it is guilty of contempt for the very cause it purports to espouse.

REBUFF TO ADMINISTRATION; DECISION MAY HALT ITS EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE EMPLOYMENT PLANS THAT SET RACIAL GOALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/03/us/rebuff-administration-decision-may-halt-its-efforts-dismantle-employment-plans.html,"The Supreme Court's rulings today on affirmative action amount to a rejection of the policies and arguments that the Reagan Administration has been advancing for six years in the field of civil rights. Since President Reagan took office, Justice Department officials have argued that numerical hiring and promotion goals were invalid as a remedy for employment discrimination, and that relief could be awarded only to identified victims of discrimination. The Court explicitly and forcefully rejected that argument today in cases involving a New York labor union and the Cleveland Fire Department. Race-conscious remedies, including goals, ''may be appropriate where an employer or a labor union has engaged in persistent or egregious discrimination, or where necessary to dissipate the lingering effects of pervasive discrimination,'' Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in a passage summarizing the logic of a majority of the Court. Rebuffs for the Administration The ruling is the latest in a series of defeats suffered by the Administration in Supreme Court cases concerned with the essence of Mr. Reagan's domestic agenda. The other cases this year involved abortion, voting rights, Social Security disability benefits and the treatment of handicapped infants. William Bradford Reynolds, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, has denounced race-conscious remedies and numerical goals as ''morally wrong.'' He has led the Administration's campaign against consent decrees in which state and local governments agreed to use hiring goals to undo the effects of discrimination against black and Hispanic workers and women. The Court today said that an employer and employees could voluntarily adopt broader remedies through a consent decree than a judge might have awarded after a trial. In practical terms, the new decisions will force the Administration to reconsider its all-out assault on hiring goals. Police and fire departments with affirmative action plans designed to correct historical patterns of discrimination can now keep those programs in place with greater confidence that they will not be struck down. But the Administration can plausibly contend that the decision in the New York case applies only to the most blatant instances of race discrimination. Repeatedly since 1964, the Court said, the sheet metal workers' union had been ''found guilty'' of discrimination against black and Hispanic workers and the union was twice cited for contempt of court. The hallmark of the Reagan Administration's civil rights policy, as enunciated by the Justice Department in courts throughout the country, has been broad categorical statements about the illegality of racial preferences and numerical goals. The Court today delivered 135 pages of opinions full of nuance and thoughtful distinctions, thus rejecting the broad prohibition urged by the Solicitor General of the United States, Charles Fried. ''We have said that race-conscious remedies which are not victim-specific are never permissible,'' Mr. Fried explained. ''The Court has said: 'Not never, but hardly ever.' '' In the New York case, the High Court upheld a goal remarkable for its specificity: 29.23 percent of the union's members are to be black or Hispanic by Aug. 31 next year. This figure reflects the ''percentage of nonwhites in the relevant labor pool'' in the New York area. The goal was first set by a Federal district judge in 1975, and the deadline for compliance has been repeatedly extended. The Supreme Court took these extensions as evidence that the goal was indeed a goal to be reached for, not a rigid quota. 'A Tremendous Victory' Seen Barry L. Goldstein, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., called the decisions ''a tremendous victory for affirmative action.'' Together, he said, they constitute ''a clear rejection of the position argued by the Reagan Justice Department.'' The Justice Department position was enthusiastically endorsed by some members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, including the chairman, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., who insisted that remedies for discrimination should be limited to individual victims. The Court's rulings today reject the logic of these officials' arguments as well. The rulings may have a decisive effect on the outcome of a battle between Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Labor Secretary Bill Brock. The issue is the Justice Department's effort to revise a 1965 executive order under which Federal contractors have been required to hire and promote women and members of minority groups. The order is enforced by the Labor Department, which requires many contractors to set goals to correct ''underutilization'' of women and minority-group workers. Justice Department Undercut Justice Brennan's opinion today in the New York case cited the executive order as evidence that Congress and the Labor Department understood and accepted the use of ''racial preferences'' in the years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Today's decisions severely undercut the Justice Department's effort to rewrite the executive order to outlaw all racial preferences. The Supreme Court did not pass judgment on the Labor Department program for Government contractors. But today's decisions strengthen the hand of Secretary Brock in resisting the Justice Department's effort. And it virtually guarantees that the current Justice Department proposals will remain stalled at the White House, without approval from President Reagan. Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, Mr. Reagan's nominee for Chief Justice, voted against a majority of the Court in both cases today. He condemned what he called ''the evil of court-sanctioned racial quotas,'' and he said the civil rights law ''does not allow us'' to grant relief to blacks who were not actual victims of discrimination. His words, combined with the cautious, careful opinions of Associate Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Sandra Day O'Connor, strongly suggest that the outcome might be different another day in another case, depending on the details of the affirmative action plan under review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE GROUP, 12 YEARS LATER",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/magazine/the-group-12-years-later.html,"ALL FIVE women in Norma Goldstein's living room on the Upper West Side of Manhattan feel as if they've come home. Norma, a 54-year-old pianist, settles into a corner of the couch. Alice Campagna, a 44-year-old restaurant owner, scours the room for an ashtray. Andrea Sedlak, a 39-year-old senior research scientist, pours herself a glass of wine. Brenda Boozer, 38, an opera singer, and Carol Morra, 45, an actress, catch up on news of each other as they fill their plates with chicken. More than a decade ago, the five were part of a women's consciousness-raising group initiated by the National Organization for Women. They held weekly meetings in the neighborhood - often in this very apartment - between 1972 and 1974. Every Tuesday night they divulged their thoughts, feelings and fears about issues prescribed by NOW as being pertinent to consciousness-raising: body image, first sexual encounters, marriage, sexism in the workplace, aging, abortion, to name a few. Their group - which included, at times, as many as 11 women - followed the format that had been created by the New York Radical Feminists and modified by NOW. A topic from the prepared list was selected for each meeting; topics were also introduced by the women themselves. Each woman was allowed ''free space'' to talk for as long as she liked, without interruption. Women who were by nature reticent, therefore had as much opportunity to speak as women who were inclined to run the show. Sometimes there were tears and expressions of anger. Sometimes there was the release of communal laughter, as on the night each of them learned she was not the only one to be obsessed about her breast size. And sometimes there were shocking revelations, when one or another confessed to having been abused as a child, or to having been raped. But mostly, there was the freedom to say what was on their minds and the comforting realization that they were all in this together. In 1974, having covered all the topics in the NOW format, the group disbanded, and this is the first time these five women have been together in the same room since. Only Norma and Alice still live in New York. Andrea has just settled in a Maryland suburb outside Washington. Brenda has moved to Westchester County. Carol lives in Beverly Hills, Calif. The reunion brims with nostalgia. ''Remember the night we talked about sexual positions?'' asks Carol, laughing. ''It changed my life.'' Norma remembers the evening they invited men, and how their presence seemed to alter the women's behavior. Alice recalls the first time she ever attended a group meeting: ''I walked into the room and said, 'Wow! This is where I belong!' '' ''There was love in that group,'' says Andrea, wistfully. Adds Brenda, ''There's been nothing like it in my life ever since.'' IN THE EARLY 1970'S, CONSCIOUS-ness-raising, a woman-by-woman, systematic program of education, was among the highest priorities of the women's movement. Some date its origins to the mid-60's, when groups of leftists met in Tampa, Fla., for self-criticism sessions, using as a focal point the teachings of Mao Zedong. The practice made its way north, where, in 1969, it was incorporated into the manifesto of the Redstockings, a radical feminist splinter group. By 1972, however, consciousness-raising had come under the umbrella of the National Organization for Women, which clearly outlined its purposes: to break down the barriers between women, to encourage open communication among them, and to help them develop pride in their sex. Some individuals, it was understood, would use the insights gained in consciousness-raising solely in their personal lives without becoming active in the women's movement. But it was hoped that the collective experience would radicalize many of the women and encourage them to become agents for change. By 1973, some 80,000 to 100,000 women across the country belonged to small feminist groups, most of which met for consciousness-raising. It is a measure of the success of the feminist activism of the 1960's and 70's that the lessons of consciousness-raising are now part of our common cultural rhetoric and that a whole generation of American women have grown up in a society familiar with feminist doctrine. Women's rights are an integral part of our social and political discourse. In culture and commerce, the contributions of women, both in general and in particular, are sought and recognized with greater consistency than they were a dozen years ago. Yet as all idealistic causes must over time, feminism has yielded its intensity to other pressing issues, and it is evident that the women's movement has slipped into a period of dormancy. Women coming of age today, though they have benefited from the efforts of the preceding generation, particularly in the area of career opportunities, have turned away from a collective focus. The dwindling number of women who remain activists find themselves largely concentrating on specific projects, the establishment of rape crisis centers, for example, or the campaign against pornography. A personalized form of feminism has taken over in the day-to-day struggles of women in the home and in the workplace; the collective outcry for equality that issued from activists of a generation ago echoes today in the demand for respect by women who refuse to be bullied by bosses, colleagues or husbands. The stories of the five women at the reunion illustrate this history on an individual scale. In 1972, each of them came to the group seeking a feminist perspective on her life. Today, they still call themselves feminists; the term suggests a value system to which they yet subscribe. But for them, as they look back, consciousness-raising appears to have been a mixed blessing. It encouraged their pursuit of careers, for example, but those among them who have not achieved their professional goals are particularly hard on themselves, and they are all confounded by the problem of combining work and motherhood. In fact, the strongest tie that unites the four women who have children is the unqualified pride they take in having been good mothers. And for the fifth, Andrea, childless as yet, getting pregnant is her first priority. The women are angry that motherhood remains devalued in our society, perhaps even more so since women have been encouraged to leave the home. They wonder why just being a mother isn't good enough. It is one aspect of womanhood they feel feminism has failed to address. The five women also discovered that a raised consciousness has not insured their happiness with men. They say that a feminist perspective has a way of sabotaging relationships with men whose expectations are rooted in traditional roles, or that striving for across-the-board equality can lead to debilitating power struggles, even in the best of partnerships. Norma maintains her marriage was saved by consciousness-raising. But Alice, a divorced mother in 1972 who is the only single woman in the group today, says that the group sessions may have made her relationships with men more difficult. Carol, realizing her marriage couldn't survive in a feminist context, submerged her feminism. For all five, consciousness-raising amounted to a ceremonial introduction to life as a woman, an organized life-support system that is largely unavailable to women in our society today. In fact, when Brenda says, ''There has been nothing like it in my life ever since,'' she could be speaking for tens of thousands of women who struggle in their daily lives to be feminists but who do so without the once-a-week shot in the arm that characterized consciousness-raising. In a way, it was a little like telling a child she should learn to ride a bike, buying the bike for the child, convincing her to get on it, then vanishing as she wobbled wildly down the street. A generation ago, feminists argued that women's groups like this one provided women with tools to combat their problems. In the portraits below, the five women who attended the reunion discuss the circumstances that brought them to consciousness-raising and the events of their lives since they last congregated. Did the group make a difference? Each of them remembers its eye-opening importance in 1972. But concerning the discoveries the women have made in the intervening years, Alice Campagna puts it most succinctly. ''Life,'' she says, ''is not a consciousness-raising group.'' NORMA GOLDSTEIN ''I have not been able to apply a lot of things I learned in the group to my personal life,'' Norma says. ''I have not pursued a career the way I dreamed it. I still feel that to be financially dependent is to be at a serious disadvantage. I've done this to myself, and it has been very hard to unravel.'' Norma's self-criticism is a little surprising, because she is so clearly an accomplished person. She went to the Juilliard School of music on a scholarship and graduated at 19. Four years ago, at the age of 50, she graduated summa cum laude from Hunter College, majoring in philosophy. She has recently taken up oil painting and this spring won a scholarship to the Art Students League. Her marriage of 34 years is thriving, and she is proud of the job she has done raising her two children, Nancy, 24, and Steven, 19 -both of whom live at home. Still, she finds it hard to account for herself. ''I'm disappointed,'' she says. Norma's dissatisfaction stems from her not realizing the lifelong goal of becoming a concert pianist. ''I want the respect that comes from that kind of achievement,'' she says. ''I've worked hard at it. I gave up my teen years for it.'' After Juilliard, she married, and though she did play a few small recitals, she concentrated on ''doing what women did then,'' settling down to raise a family. She still practices daily and gives lessons. But what was once her dream, she says, ''has settled down to a little painful pocket of frustration.'' Ironically, participation in the group, which promoted the notion of individual accomplishment, may have resulted in exacerbating her sense of failure. She feels herself now a victim of her past ambition and today's emphasis on success. ''I had a friend once who said she woke up every morning and asked herself how she was doing in life, and I used to think that was a little crazy,'' Norma says. ''But when I turned 50, I became one of those people.'' But if consciousness-raising was in part responsible for Norma's current unease, she nonetheless maintains it was an important step. To her group, she remains hugely grateful. ''I could cry this very minute,'' she says, ''when I think of what it did for me.'' What the group did was save her marriage. In 1972, Norma had been married all her life, or so it seemed then. At 40, she was taking motherhood seriously, but her 21-year marriage to Bob Goldstein, a commercial artist, was foundering. She heard about consciousness-raising groups at a NOW meeting. Immediately upon joining the group, she recalls, ''I began to lose the paranoid sense of 'This is happening only to me,' and to see my situation as one that all women deal with. This is not to say I didn't suffer. Even though I understand things now, I still suffer. But it helped, absolutely.'' Norma also gives credit to her husband, who, unlike many other men who were being confronted with the demands of feminism in their personal lives, listened to the news Norma was bringing home week by week. ''He was smart enough and insightful enough to listen to the issues and to see the justice,'' says Norma. ''My marriage has succeeded because of that - because he heard and he understood.'' The oldest member of the group, Norma, more than the others, brought an intellectual rigor to their discussions. She alone was fluent in the semantics of feminism, reading the works of feminist writers and insisting that the others do so. During this time she became practically obsessed with feminism. And though, over the years, the obsession has waned, she is experiencing now a rekindled passion. This spring she traveled with her daughter to Washington to participate in a pro-choice march to the White House. ''It's easy to put feminism on a back burner unless there's an issue that arouses your feelings,'' Norma says. ''Denying women the right to choose to have an abortion or not arouses me. In fact, it enrages me. But you can't just go march and then clap your hands and say, 'That's done.' You have to keep up the pressure. You have to resist the forces that are trying to take these rights away.'' In her renewed fervor, Norma fears that the past decade has turned women inward, away from one another, and away, too, from the notion that solidarity among women is ultimately a source of personal strength. ''Feminism is not separate from your life,'' she says. ''It is not an objective topic. I was telling a woman the other day about having been in a consciousness-raising group, and she said, 'Oh my god, I could never be in a group like that. I mean, I don't even like being with women.' And I was practically tongue-tied with sadness. There are still so many women who hate themselves and each other.'' ALICE CAMPAGNA ''Last night i saw 'The Killing Fields,' and I felt like adopting a child from Cambodia, but I know I won't,'' Alice says. ''I could go on marches, but I never do. I've gotten more tired. I want to read mystery books and go shopping.'' Shortly after the group disbanded in 1974, Alice's engagement with feminism receded. Consciousness-raising, though, did make a difference for her, she says: because of it, she sees her personal struggle in a feminist context. But she knows the days of her commitment are over. About her lapsed activism, she is cheerfully resigned. ''I'm ashamed to say my own issue is surviving,'' Alice says. ''I'm a lot more middle-class. I don't know if I'm more conservative, but maybe I am. I think we're all more conservative. I'm not as closed a person as I once was, but I don't have the hunger to share that I did then. Consciousness-raising takes a lot of energy, and I'm putting that energy into other things. There's a part of me that would like to belong to a group now, but there's a part of me that's just too lazy.'' In 1972, Alice had long straight hair parted in the middle, as was the style then. She dressed, she says, in ''arty'' clothes - jeans, a black leotard, and jewelry. A single parent in the days before such status became epidemic, she was raising her 6-year-old son, Adam, with little from her former husband. Living in a small apartment on the minimal wages she earned as a waitress, she was looking for a man to come along and take care of her. At 30, Alice was a nascent feminist. She'd been trapped in a miserable marriage in Michigan during her 20's, and until she met Norma Goldstein, who would introduce her to the group, she had shared few confidences with other females. In the atmosphere in which she was raised, women were people with whom you were competitive, people from whom you kept secrets. When she joined the group, she says, ''I went from being an infant to being a woman.'' Today, at 44, Alice is thinner than she was at 30; she admits that she has been nearly anorexic at times. When she is anxious, she says, she simply stops eating. She still smokes cigarettes, and says she'll give them up ''someday.'' Her hair is cropped short. ''You can't be in your 40's and have long hair,'' she says, and laughs. Alice owns a restaurant called Vintages, on Columbus Avenue. Her son Adam is now 20, and has completed his junior year at the University of Pennsylvania. When he comes home, they share her Riverside Drive apartment. She says, only half in jest, that she is now a ''capitalist,'' and that on any given day she wakes up thinking about the weather, an important consideration in her business. Asked if she's happy, she says that depends on what day it is, what time of day you call her, whether Adam is home with her, how her business is going. She thinks it's an asinine question. If feminism didn't take with Alice over the long haul, certain lessons learned in the group nonetheless stuck with her. The meetings about sex stand out in her memory. ''I was a mess of misinformation,'' she recalls. ''I thought I wasn't having the right kind of orgasm. I thought something was wrong with me, that I was a freak. But I learned through the group that sex was wonderful. It's affected not only my own life, but also the way I've taught my son about women.'' Alice is very clear about her greatest success - her son. She is proud of her mothering, and her relationship with Adam remains the most joyous part of her life. On the other hand, she says, ''My biggest failure is that I haven't had a man in my life - a successful long, long relationship.'' In the years immediately following her involvement with the group, she sometimes found it hard to find a man who understood her feminist concerns. ''A lot of the reasons my relationships with men didn't work was that the men may have been mouthing that they were feminists,'' she says, ''but at heart they weren't.'' Today she says she would take any man with two legs (''only kidding'') and that if she could change anything in her life it would be to have more money (not kidding). At heart, however, she is still much the same woman she was in 1972. ''I would describe myself as a 44-year-old human being who is still struggling. I don't know what I want - as a woman. I like being alone, yet I think I have to be married. I still have the same strings manipulating me that I did 14 years ago. I think I'll have the same problems till the day I die.'' ANDREA SEDLAK ''I just found this saying and put it on my refrigerator,'' Andrea remarks. ''It says, 'Happiness is having something to do, someone to love and something to hope for.' I guess that covers all of my bases.'' A bromide, perhaps, but one that didn't apply to Andrea Sedlak's life until very recently. She got married for the first time in October 1984, to a physical chemist she met by putting an ad in the local paper in New Haven, where she was living at the time, and last August she bought, with him, her first house. Her career, as a senior research scientist at Westat, a consulting firm just outside of Washington, is, at last, well established. Her 40th birthday will be in December; her greatest hope is to be pregnant before then. After what she describes as 14 years of ''tortuous'' meandering around the country - to Kansas, to North Carolina, to Connecticut, to Iowa and finally to Maryland - Andrea Sedlak is settling down. Unlike many of her professional peers, however, Andrea Sedlak couldn't be described as a yuppie. She isn't a consumer. Her new home is small and modest - decorated much like a graduate student's might be. At work, she still wears the suits she was given when she was in high school. As a hobby, she raises finches. The first member of her New Jersey working-class family to attend college, Andrea was exposed in the 1960's and early 70's to new ideas that still characterize her thinking. A shy, fragile-looking woman who speaks in thoughtful, measured cadences, her feminism is couched in a rhetoric that echoes that of a generation ago. But it's tinged now with personal need, as if it isn't solidarity she's speaking of, but companionship. ''Women feel alone,'' she says. ''We are usually the only mother or the only wife in the house. Our problems seem unique.'' In 1972, Andrea Sedlak was 25 and studying psychology at Columbia University. She had been politically active as a leader in a student effort to do away with comprehensive exams, but didn't know much about feminism. Because she was curious about the movement, and also because she was having personal problems with men, she joined the group. ''From it,'' she says, '' I got a very powerful message of 'You're O.K.' It was my first discovery that such a message existed.'' In 1973, Andrea left New York in search of a job. During the next 12 years, she would organize women's groups all over the country, wherever she happened to be. In the beginning, she established consciousness-raising groups. Later, she organized support groups specifically for rape victims, and she worked in a shelter for battered women. ''When I was in the group, I saw how power-(Continued on Page 32) ful a peer support group was, and I thought to myself if my feeling of relief was so great, then a person who had gone through some really bad experiences - like being raped or being battered - would stand to benefit even more.'' Of all the women reunited in Norma Goldstein's living room, Andrea feels the most hankering to belong to a women's group now. Recently, she underwent surgery in an effort to reverse her infertility, and perhaps in her concern over the outcome of the operation, she confesses to a loneliness that she can't quite come to terms with. She also admits to financial problems. Medical bills and a hefty new mortgage have sapped her resources. ''I don't exactly need basic training all over again, but I've been thinking that it would be nice to have a group right now,'' Andrea says. ''I guess what I miss is the large amount of sharing that goes on - the number of different comparisons you have for yourself.'' Andrea, like Norma, finds a link between the individual concerns of women and their collective predicament. But like Alice, she has discovered that with the advance of time her consuming passions are private ones. ''I feel I've come further than I've ever been, but I have a lot of fears about it not working out for me,'' she says. ''I want to have a child.'' BRENDA BOOZER ''I look at what I have in my life, and I say: 'These are the choices I have made.' '' You could say life has been kind to Brenda Boozer. She lives in a Stanford White brick mansion on an estate that used to belong to a Rockefeller; and at first glance it looks like a small college. She is an established opera star, a mezzo-soprano and a principal artist with the Met. She has a 2-year-old son named Alexander whom she describes as a ''miracle child.'' And she is married to the talented comedian/actor Robert Klein. At 38, she also happens to be beautiful. ''The thing about myself that I think is different from other people,'' she says, ''is that when I was 3, my grandmother said I was going to be an opera star - and from then on I was headed to be a performer. I've always been dedicated. I haven't had a lot of time for introspection. I just lived my life and went about my goals.'' Brenda seems to have been a rather unlikely candidate for a consciousness-raising group. She was not active in the women's movement, was not politically motivated and had no pressing personal problems to sort out. In fact, she has no memory of why she joined the group. In 1972, she was studying voice in New York - having had what she describes as a ''joyous'' childhood in Atlanta in the home of liberal Southern parents who were part of the civil rights movement. She was already living with Robert (they married in 1973) - whom she had met when they were both performing in ''Candide'' - in a comfortable apartment on Riverside Drive. Nevertheless, one evening she found herself the host of a group meeting in her living room. Her own sheltered life and the blinders she wore in pursuit of her chosen goal were temporarily knocked askew. She says: ''One of the most incredible things that happened to me in the group was a real bonding with other women - women who were very different from me. I grew to have compassion for the struggles women were going through. The group wasn't there to talk about how happy we were.'' Fourteen years later, Brenda isn't any more active in the women's movement than she was before she joined the group. For her, unlike the others, women's issues and her own personal strivings don't necessarily overlap. ''You can't chase two rabbits at the same time,'' she says. ''I'm happily married. I can't wait to have another child. I'm thrilled about my singing, and I'm loving the work I do. I couldn't be more fulfilled. It feels so overwhelming.'' Brenda likes to give credit where credit is due - to herself and to God: ''The biggest change in my life since I was in the group is my spiritual growth. I pray every day. I go to church regularly.'' She reports having had a religious experience looking up at da Vinci's ''Annunciation'' in a museum in Florence. It is a painting of the angel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she would bear the Child. ''I really feel like God was speaking to me,'' she says, ''that he was calling me.'' Two months later, she was pregnant with Alexander. Her husband, who is Jewish, doesn't share her religious fervor, and Brenda says that she thinks he is threatened by it, as he has been, at times, by what she describes as her ''control.'' Shortly after she left the group in 1974, Brenda auditioned for the Santa Fe Opera company and was accepted. Robert needed her with him and asked that she not go, but she went anyway. ''I'm not sure how much that decision had to do with the group. I already had the strength to go, and the group helped me in my conviction.'' Conviction remains a strong suit with Brenda; she tends to get what she wants. Her biggest problem, she says, is finding time for everything. She describes a typical day this way: ''If I don't have a performance, I get up around 8:30. I like to spend quality time with Alexander in the morning. We go to the lake or the farm across the street. We are always doing something fun. Then I'll be back here at 10 to vocalize for an hour before the pianist comes. Marion (the nanny) gives Alexander lunch, but I always put him to bed for his nap. Then I will probably have to go to the city for a rehearsal or a coaching session until 5, when I come back to play with my son. There are a thousand things with the house - 15 phone calls on the machine, someone with the wallpaper. I always put Alexander to bed around 9, and then after that, if Robert's here, we might have dinner together, and that's my time to be with him. Then I will make a couple of phone calls, take my bath and study some music. I have a real busy schedule.'' Brenda believes that ''feminism is about changing yourself.'' Yet apart from her religious awakening, she appears to have changed remarkably little. To be sure, she is richer and more well known, and she now has a son whom she dearly loves, but certain characteristics remain. The group, she says, ''gave us more strength to go in the direction we wanted to go.'' To distinguish herself from the other members of the group, she says, ''I've been successful.'' CAROL MORRA After a hiatus of nearly two decades during which she concentrated solely on her marriage and family, Carol Morra wants to be an actress again. She is a vivacious personality with a 1,000-watt smile, someone who, by her own admission, ''chooses to see the glass half-full rather than half-empty.'' It is tempting, however, to think the positive attitude an act - her biggest role to date. One of the first things she says is that after 23 years she is still ''desperately in love'' with her husband, Buddy, a personal manager for entertainers in Los Angeles, and that her life is where she wants it to be. Reminded of this later, she looks surprised: ''You mean you believed all that baloney I told you?'' Pressed, Carol admits she has serious doubts about having given up her 20's and 30's, when she was ''the most beautiful and the most creative,'' to the service of her husband and children. ''My choice was to preserve my marriage at all costs, and I try to keep a sense of joy in my household,'' she says. ''But the person who's neglected is me. I take a back seat, and I find that difficult. In all the years that Buddy and I have been going out socially for his business, only one person has ever asked me a serious question.'' Ironically, Carol made her choice during her time in consciousness-raising. ''The group forced me to look at my values and to think about what was really important to me,'' she says. ''I saw that it was possible to really screw up my marriage, because I was becoming awakened to a lot of things. A group of women sitting around do not always say great things about their marriages. So there was a little bit of a mental shake-up. Fortunately, I recovered. The marriage was my first priority.'' Carol came to the group because of her friendship with Brenda; Buddy was Robert Klein's manager, and the four had regular dinners together. Carol recalls: ''Brenda said, 'I think you should join this consciousness-raising group I'm in. We sit around and talk about different topics, and we share.' ''I said, 'Hey, that sounds cute.' ''Brenda said, 'There's nothing cute about it.' '' In the fall of 1972, Carol and Buddy were living on 94th Street and Amsterdam Avenue with their three children, Adam, 7, Paris, 2, and Ali, who was just 3 months old. Carol, who had attended the School of Performing Arts and who had been on the road for five years acting, singing and dancing in musicals, had met Buddy at a frozen-foods counter in New York and was married to him five months later. Two years after her son was born, Carol gave up her career to be, as she puts it, ''Miss Mommy.'' At the time, she had no regrets. So Carol went to her first consciousness-raising meeting with an attitude of ''Show me.'' Within the structured confines of the group she found, to her surprise, that she could allow herself to be introspective, an indulgence she had always avoided and that, in fact, she seems to have forgone since. She says she takes great pains never to be alone. ''I'm not really happy being with myself,'' she admits. ''If ever I'm alone with nothing to do, which is almost impossible to think of, I'm on the phone.'' Today, living with Buddy and the kids in Beverly Hills, Carol is trying once again to get her career in gear. She has managed to do some television work in the last five years, appearing under the professional name of Carol Gordon on ''The Love Boat,'' ''Remington Steele,'' ''Dynasty'' and ''Not Necessarily the News.'' But she is 45 now, and it's not as easy as it might have been 20 years ago. She says: ''It's only in retrospect that I realized that, hey, those were very important years for me. I could have used them.'' In fact, it is when she thinks about the scarcity of parts available to her now - because of her age and because she is a woman -that her brand of feminism is most likely to surface. ''I don't think people realize this,'' she says, ''but most of the TV work is geared to men. I see what's available, and I feel a resentment that something like 70 percent of the roles in this business are male parts.'' Carol was a participant in the first women's march down Fifth Avenue, nearly two decades ago, but when she wakes up in the morning today, she says, ''I'm not thinking about marching on the streets. I'm usually hoping that the shower will be nice when I get in. I get confused about political issues. I really do.'' She is out of the house three mornings a week at 8:15 for tap-dancing lessons. She also takes Spanish lessons, and, in addition to having three children still at home, she recently served as understudy for the lead in a local theater production. All this activity requires energy, something Carol has in abundance. It is her most striking quality, and it has stood her in good stead in her marriage (''Buddy loves watching me walk into a room and be bubbly and effervescent'') and with her children (''You give me two pillows and I've got a puppet show going''). Carol sees no room in her life for a consciousness-raising group now. ''We became women in that group,'' she says. ''It was an initiation rite -like a rite of passage. That happens only once. I said it changed my life, and it did. But it was like taking a wonderful course in school. You study for a year and later you can remember only three or four sentences about it. Those are the things that stay with you.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"RURAL, SUBURBAN AND KINKY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/books/rural-suburban-and-kinky.html,"BINDWEED By Christianne Balk. 54 pp. New York: Collier Books/Macmillan Publishing Company. Cloth, $13.95. Paper, $7.95. THE FIRE MUSIC By Liz Rosenberg. 58 pp. Pennsylvania: University of Pittsburgh Press. Cloth, $15.95. Paper, $6.95. LOCAL TIME By Stephen Dunn. 110 pp. New York: William Morrow & Company. Cloth, $14.95. Paper, $6.95. CHRISTIANNE BALK'S ''Bindweed,'' winner of the 1985 Walt Whitman Award of the Academy of American Poets as the best first book of poems by an American, shows some of the awkwardness and tentativeness characteristic of younger poets, but it also introduces an artist resonant with talent. Ms. Balk writes poems that stay close to nature, tapping the rhythms of the changing seasons for metaphors of the human life cycle and rounding out nature's powerful processes with the human qualities of joy, loss and grief. In ''The Young Widow Talks to Herself'' the husband's absence is felt to be ''a gouge in the snow / Scooped between the spruce trees,'' and just as we feel the cold concentration of the widow's sorrow, we can also project the time when spring flowers will occupy the exact same place. But poems fixed on death and tragedy, when they are written by a 33-year-old poet who, as we are told, ''is a veteran of many writing workshops,'' are sometimes hard to trust. We suspect that the privacy of suffering and the time needed to come to terms with the loss of a loved one would resist the creative writing classroom's atmosphere of formal criticism and approval by consensus. It is true that many of the poems in this book have death as their subject matter: a speaker's miscarriage or abortion, the premature death of a lover. But many of the better poems turn to less morbid concerns. In ''Artist's Room'' a violin maker becomes an alchemist who ''mixes jars of beetle resins / With tree gum, purple crystal and amber dye'' to find a finish for the instrument that is ''so pure it burns as anthracite.'' A buoyant optimism runs through ''Elegy,'' a bizarre poem about an airplane that crashes one March in a snowy mountain region. What is so strange here is that the poet conjures up ways the crash victims might save themselves: ''Snowshoe frames can be made of metal from plane keels, sleds built from wings, harnesses woven from shroud lines; / Cloudy streams of fresh water can be found; and salmon, tomcod, needlefish, and pike caught.'' In a way the poem showcases Ms. Balk's knowledge of the natural world as she tosses out more strategies and possibilities for the unfortunates: ''Bushes can be dug for the starchy roots; cup-fungus, bracken, and the inner white bark of willow, poplar, and birch can be eaten.'' But then, as if to show that silver clouds have their dark lining, she returns to the site of the accident and reminds us, ''The Brooks Range stretches from Cape Lisburne to Demarcation Point, and few of its mountains are mapped.'' The alternation between documentary reportage of the disaster and the suspenseful unfolding of the narrative makes for a wonderfully fresh and novel poem. The range of Ms. Balk's poetry is impressive, but it can also be a bit distracting. One cannot help wondering just how strong her work will be when she hones her themes and styles and perfects them. If Ms. Balk's esthetic is rooted in the rural, Liz Rosenberg's must be spoken of as suburban. In ''The Fire Music'' even a poem set near a country lake tells us ''the smell of pine unfurls like motel soap / we opened in some double room of childhood.'' Though the effect is often comic (she begins a poem titled ''A Suburban Childhood'' confessing that ''having a crush was how I existed''), the mundane situations become a little tiresome. ''The Christmas Cactus'' is about buds on a cactus, which are late in opening: All during the Christmas rush I waited for the thing to come alive. Eyed it while I gift wrapped scarves, withered it with scorn as I threw the green and silver bundles under the tree. But when the flowers do bloom ''like the girls that shine'' at a high school dance ''from their corner of the gym,'' the metaphor's power is dissipated by the ordinariness of the setting. Yet there is something extremely lovable about this book. Ms. Rosenberg is eager to jump into experience with the innocence of an enthusiast and the vulnerability of a lover. Although many poems are chaotic and vague, they do have fire and music. In ''The Longing for Eternal Life'' Ms. Rosenberg even wonders if she is connecting with all life has to offer: ''Why is it hard to live like this, / simply to live?'' she asks, the implied answer being: life is not simple. Indeed, it is when she catches the complexity of life that her work shines. In ''The Lighthouse'' the poet finds her spiritual aspirations mirrored in the beacon. ''I want to live like that,'' she declares, ''to be a great and watchful eye / that sends all its light out and takes nothing back.'' The experiences in ''The Fire Music'' are entered through doors that seem to open from the middle of rooms. Images and situations are presented to us with the immediacy of dreams. A poem about taking a trip on a train is followed by one that begins, ''I love how old men carry purses for their wives.'' Some of the titles, like ''Alone With the Shoe Manufacturer in His Memorial Park,'' have a strangeness to them that is reminiscent of Wallace Stevens. The trick, then, is to go into the book's kaleidoscope of pages and choose which patterns and images satisfy. Stephen Dunn is a more seasoned poet, having published five books of poems before his latest, ''Local Time,'' a volume in the ''National Poetry Series,'' this one chosen by Dave Smith. As one might expect, Mr. Dunn's experience as a writer gives his poems greater confidence and facility, and he explores everyday life more thoroughly, and certainly with a sharper sense of the absurd, than Ms. Balk or Ms. Rosenberg. In this book Mr. Dunn is everybody's friendly neighbor. He is what mothers want their sons to be. He is good, and his obsession with moral and ethical propriety both distinguishes his poetry and slightly alienates those of us who cannot quite resolve our own problems with gentleness and understanding. Yet on the other side of this idealistic striving lies a kind of frustration and sadness, and a downright kinkiness seeps through the seams of many poems. In ''Completion'' a man doing the woodwork on a new den wants nothing more than to show off his efforts to his wife when she comes home. However: When his wife returned from work he said: Look, it's finished, but he knew the room meant nothing to her. Many of the poems trace a contemporary American constellation of romantic love, monogamous eroticism and marital tension. Those poems are among the best in the book, and in them Mr. Dunn's struggle for sensitivity, especially in his relations with a woman he writes about in many of these poems, seems not only appropriate but admirable. Mr. Dunn reminds us that when we wake up next to someone we love, a simple thing like ''the words good morning / have a history of tones; pray to say them evenly.'' And lines from ''The Night the Children Were Away'' sound as if the incident described had to have happened in California, although the poet lives in New Jersey: When she comes home he's waiting for her on the secluded deck, naked, the wine open, her favorite cheese already sliced. Later in the same poem those pitfalls of modern marriage - routine, overbearing familiarity and boredom - are bravely banished by the poet's determination to make love profanely as if the profane were the only way to disturb, to waken, the sacred. That is tongue-in-cheek wisdom. American poets in this century have done much to expand the subject matter of poetry. William Carlos Williams wrote that ''so much depends'' on a red wheelbarrow next to a white chicken. Gary Snyder snipped a recipe out of a cookbook and declared it to be his poem. But it has taken Stephen Dunn, in ''Aerial in the Pines,'' to attack at last the problem of the tree in the backyard that is interfering with the television antenna: To cut off the top branches of the majestic pine (once unthinkable for us) was a bit of nature traded for clear reception. Sarcasm aside, these poems work; and even though they present pictures of our lives as common and sometimes dull, they manage to exalt them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE NATION; A SUICIDE IN THE SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/weekinreview/the-nation-a-suicide-in-the-senate.html,"Senator John P. East had been confined to a wheelchair since contracting polio when he was 24. Last year, after he was hospitalized for hypothyroidism, a disorder that he said frequently left him tired and depressed, he announced that he would not seek a second term. Friends said his morale appeared to have rallied in recent weeks, but last Sunday the Senator was found dead in his home in Greenville, S.C.. The County Medical Examiner said he had killed himself. At a memorial service, the Rev. J. Malloy Owen, the Senator's pastor, said Mr. East's accomplishments had been ''utterly amazing'' in view of a handicap that might have led others to ''crawl in a corner and watch television.'' An obscure political science professor before being selected to challenge an incumbent Democrat six years ago, Mr. East was closely allied with Republican Jesse Helms, the state's senior senator. Early in the Reagan Administration, as Cabinet nominees were being passed on, Mr. East and Mr. Helms cast the only votes against Caspar W. Weinberger, saying he was too liberal to make an effective Secretary of Defense. Legislatively, Mr. East's only major initiative was a bill, which failed, that would have negated the Supreme Court decision permitting abortion, by declaring that an embryo was a human being from the moment of conception. On Thursday, Gov. James G. Martin Jr., a Republican, appointed Representative James T. Broyhill to serve the remainder of Mr. East's term. Mr. Broyhill was already the party's nominee to take Mr. East's place next year. The Democratic nominee for the Senate seat is former Gov. Terry Sanford.

LIBERTY WEEKEND/THE PEOPLE; LIBERTY CONFEREES DEBATE JUDGES' ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/nyregion/liberty-weekend-the-people-liberty-conferees-debate-judges-role.html,"The spirit of concord that had settled over New York in tribute to the Statue of Liberty was disrupted yesterday, in tribute to the practice of liberty. While the rest of the city was outdoors celebrating 100 years of history, a score of officials, scholars, judges, lawyers and writers spent the day in a Times Square hotel arguing over the future of liberty in America. It was the start of a two-day meeting, ''Liberty - the Next 100 Years,'' at the Marriott Marquis, an effort, in the words of James MacGregor Burns, the Woodrow Wilson Professor of Government at Williams College and one of the panelists, ''to add cerebration to the celebration.'' It also added controversy, as the Solicitor General of the United States, Charles Fried, criticized not only the views of Floyd Abrams, the specialist in First Amendment law who served as his adversary, but also those of former Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg. Mr. Abrams, meanwhile, criticized the views of Mr. Fried, and, more pointedly, those of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d. Constitution as 'Legend' The issue had to do with the latitude the courts may permit themselves in interpreting the Constitution. Mr. Fried, a chief advocate of the Reagan Adminstration's opposition to the Supreme Court holdings on such matters as abortion and affirmative action, said he believed the Constitution should be ''interpreted rather than invented.'' He mocked the view that the Constitution is ''our legend,'' which he attributed to Justice Goldberg, who was not at the conference. If judges treat it as a legend and not as a legal document, he asked, why should not they, rather than elected legislators, have the power to make the law? Meese Criticized Mr. Fried rejected the notion of ''an unelected judiciary'' interpreting the Constitution according to its own personal morals and philosophies and concluded that there was ''no greater threat to liberty'' than for judges to create their own law. Mr. Abrams began his rebuttal with a reminder that about a year ago Attorney General Meese took exception to the generally established holding that the 14th Amendment makes the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. He called the Attorney General's view a ''radical'' proposition that would mean that the Constitution ''would permit New York to ban newspapers, California to establish a state religion and Kansas to deny criminal defendants the right to counsel.'' Although he agreed with Mr. Fried that judges' opinions should be informed by the intentions of the framers of the Constitution, Mr. Abrams observed, with regard to cases he is now handling, that ''the revered framers knew nothing of exit polls, nothing of broadcasters, nothing of outdoor advertising in the fashion in which it now exists.'' Resorting to the Courts Mr. Abrams charged that ''those who speak of 'original intent' seem only to care about that intent when it supports the social policies they find congenial.'' Midge Decter, executive director of the Committee for a Free World, sided with Mr. Fried but made her argument on political grounds. As she described the situation, powerful people, ''many of them judges and lawyers,'' who have no faith that they can achieve their favorite causes, such as the Equal Rights Amendment, in the political forum, are resorting to the courts instead. Much of the nation, she said, sees this as ''tyranny.'' A second panel, which asked, ''Can Free Speech Become Too Costly?'' found Norman Dorsen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, facing Michael Novak, the author and columnist for The National Review. Mr. Dorsen put forward a ''maximum protection'' theory, which would bar prior restraint of speech, bans on peaceful protests and laws to restrict sexually explicit material. Mr. Novak did not say no to maximum protection, but he did not say yes either. He held out the hope that a mature, liberal society would be able to find ways, preferably through community action rather than law, to deal with ''the nearby sex shops,'' which he said he had passed with his 14-year-old daughter with ''a certain shame.'' That brought murmurs of recognition from the panel and some of the 250 people in the audience, and the session ended with spirited exchanges among the panelists on just what could be done about pornography.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MIXED OPINIONS; THE SUPREME COURT WORKS AT ITS MANDATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/weekinreview/mixed-opinions-the-supreme-court-works-at-its-mandate.html,"HANDING down major decisions last week on homosexual relations, gerrymandering and affirmative action, among others, the Supreme Court also had important things to say about its role in governing the nation. Important, but deeply discordant - and, some said, inconsistent. In the face of the most determined push by any Administration in 50 years to curb the power of judges to set social policy, the Court dealt a major defeat to the Reagan Administration in two affirmative action cases. But in those, as in some of the other hard cases, it could achieve no consensus on what the law is or what its own mission should be. The Court's ambivalence about what the law is was evident once again in its reluctant embrace of affirmative action. A solid majority of the Court firmly rejected the major premise of the Administration's civil rights policies - that court-ordered racial preferences in hiring and promotion are illegal except to benefit individuals who were personally victims of discrimination. A solid majority also stressed that judges should impose affirmative action only as a last-ditch remedy for ''egregious'' discrimination, and renounced rigid ''quotas.'' But the 5-to-4 vote in a case involving a New York City sheet metal workers' local upheld a court-ordered 29.23 percent ''goal'' for minority membership in the union. And a 6-to-3 vote in a case involving firefighters in Cleveland gave lower courts broad latitude to approve consent decrees that include racial preferences. The practical effect of the decisions will be to insulate from challenge many employment plans the details of which the Court might not itself approve. Two Decisions, Two Views The Court's ambivalence about what its mission should be was encapsulated in two decisions handed down together, both announced by Justice Byron R. White. In one, the Court took a narrow view of its role in protecting privacy, ruling, 5 to 4, that the Constitution does not protect homosexual relations between consenting adults, even in their own homes, from prosecution. In the other, it assumed, 6 to 3, the power to obliterate election districts anywhere in the nation if a dominant political party in a state legislature has drawn them so as to ''consistently degrade'' its rivals' voting strength. Superficially unrelated, both cases raised in its starkest form a question that lies in the background of every constitutional decision: What mandate has a group of unelected, life-tenured judges to strike down democratically enacted laws? None at all, Justice White said, when no more is at stake than the interest of homosexuals in conducting their intimate relationships as they please. His majority opinion upheld - as applied to homosexuals - a Georgia law making any oral or anal sex a criminal offense. Whether such laws ''are wise or desirable'' was beside the point, he said: ''The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made law.'' In a majority opinion reminiscent of his recent dissent calling for the Court to abandon its decisions permitting abortion,Justice White dismissed, almost scornfully, arguments for extending the Court's line of precedents recognizing a vague right of sexual privacy. Citing the ''ancient roots'' of sodomy laws, he characterized as ''facetious'' any claim that a right to engage in such conduct was secured by the Fourteenth Amendment's general protection of ''liberty.'' But in the gerrymandering case, Justice White abandoned judicial restraint for a bold new judicial incursion into what he called the ''most political of legislative functions,'' the drawing of election district lines. Despite the ''ancient roots'' of partisan gerrymandering - it began before the term was coined in 1812 - last week was the first time the Supreme Court has asserted the power to do anything about it. While the Court upheld, 7 to 2, the specific Indiana redistricting plan in the case, Justice White led the way in asserting the power to decide such cases, citing the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of ''equal protection of the laws.'' He did not suggest the authors of those words intended to outlaw partisan gerrymanders. Rather, he used the traditional process of extending the logic of precedents step by step into new frontiers. The building blocks were the Court's ''one person, one vote'' decisions and those banning racial gerrymandering. Justice White's technique was remarkably similar to the arguments made in the Georgia case - by the four dissenters - for extending to homosexual relations the Court's protection of sexual privacy. Indeed, all four joined him in asserting judicial power over gerrymandering. But three of the four who joined Justice White in the sodomy case accused him in the gerrymandering case of ''reflexive application of precedent.'' ''I do not believe, and the Court offers not a shred of evidence to suggest,'' wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, ''that the Framers of the Constitution intended the judicial power to encompass the making of such fundamental choices about how this Nation is to be governed.'' MAKING LAW AT THE END OF TERM AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. Rejecting the Administration's civil rights arguments, the Court upheld, 5 to 4, a numerical membership goal imposed by a judge on a New York City union and declined, 6 to 3, to overturn a Cleveland plan preferentially promoting minority firefighters. GERRYMANDERING. The Court ruled 6 to 3 that manipulation of election district lines by the majority in a state legislature violates the Constitution when it ''consistently degrades'' the voting power of other parties. But it upheld the Indiana districts in question on the ground that the gerrymandering was not so severe as be unconstitutional. VOTING RIGHTS. Rejecting the Reagan Administration's narrow interpretation of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act, the Court, as Congressional leaders of both parties urged, unanimously struck down four North Carolina election districts that diluted black voting power. By 6 to 3, it upheld a fifth district. SEXUAL PRIVACY. In upholding, 5 to 4, a Georgia sodomy law that makes any oral or anal sex a crime, the Court ruled that the Constitution does not protect private homosexual relations between consenting adults. But the Justices declined to say whether the Constitution would protect heterosexual couples from prosecution under the same law. THE FIRST AMENDMENT. By deciding, 5 to 4, that Puerto Rico may ban local advertising of casino gambling, the Court limited its protection of commercial speech, suggesting that states may also restrict advertising of liquor, cigarettes and other products that are legal but considered harmful. But in a 7 to 2 ruling, the Court extended to pretrial hearings its recognition of a qualified First Amendment right to attend criminal trials. STILL TO COME. . . The Court has not yet issued its ruling on the constitutionality of the automatic deficit-reducing mechanism in the balanced budget law known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The Court is expected to complete its term this week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEFINING WOMEN'S RIGHTS WILL AID ABORTION DEBATE; The Fanatic's Lexicon,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/opinion/l-defining-women-s-rights-will-aid-abortion-debate-the-fanatic-s-lexicon-401486.html,"To the Editor: There must be thousands of women in this country for whom resort to abortion was not merely a matter of choice; any number of circumstances come to mind in which such things as rape, disease, extreme mental or physical immaturity, danger of a full-term pregnancy to the mother's life, affected the decision to abort. We know that many women who had involuntarily to put an end to their pregnancies are prone to melancholy and often prolonged depression after the operation. How must such women feel, then, when they are called murderers by the President of the United States? This gross piece of insensitivity was in a newspaper interview (news story, June 24) in which Mr. Reagan said, speaking of abortion, ''I don't think that womanhood should be considering murder a privilege.'' We have become used to the cruel and wounding scurrilities shouted by partisans of the Right to Life movement at women outside abortion clinics. Abortion, with such people, is an emotional, not an intellectual, issue, and we cannot expect either rational or civilized discourse from them. We do not, however, expect our President to lift one of the favorite words - ''murder'' - from the fanatic's lexicon and apply it to what for many citizens is a most painful and tragic matter.

LIBERTY PANEL PONDERS WHEREFORES OF FREEDOM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/nyregion/liberty-panel-ponders-wherefores-of-freedom.html,"A simple-sounding question kept intruding into the weekend's conference on ''Liberty - the Next 100 Years'': as one panelist put it, ''Free for what purpose?'' In the spirit of the birthday party for the Statue of Liberty in which the nation was engaged, a couple of panelists asserted that liberty was good in itself. But as the discussion got down to specifics, it seemed to be only the beginning of a quest that no one found easy to put into words. The closest the panelists came was the faith or hope that liberty would lead to a sense of community. Two writers, Roger Rosenblatt, a liberal, and Michael Novak, who is identified with the neoconservatives, both voiced a longing for community that won sympathy from the score of scholars, officials and others in the last day of the two-day conference at the Marriott Marquis Hotel. The purpose of liberty, Mr. Rosenblatt suggested, was to enable people ''to achieve the common good.'' But the panelists brought together by the conference chairman, Richard D. Heffner, sometimes differed on what constitutes the common good. On some issues, community sentiment, far from seeming an outgrowth of liberty, seemed to be its antagonist. For example, if there was anyone in the room who had a favorable word for the X-rated movie houses not far from the hotel, he did not utter it. But when the co-author of an antipornography statute that had recently been rejected by the courts as unconstitutional, Catharine A. MacKinnon, offered a punitive approach to those who profit from pornography, she met opposition from some. Yet the aspiration toward a community that included even the opposition kept coming through. Eleanor Smeal, the president of the National Organization for Women, was severely criticized by several panelists, including Mayor Koch and the former president of the United Auto Workers, Douglas A. Fraser, for charging that religious fundamentalists who oppose her organization's views on the proposed equal rights amendment, abortion and laws regarding homosexuals are exhibiting ''neofascist tendencies.'' By contrast, the cofounder of the Parents Music Resource Center, Tipper Gore, got a warm response for her group's effort to get record companies to identify on record jackets the sexually explicit lyrics inside. The civil libertarians present liked her approach of relying on community pressures rather than legal constraints, of asking not that any record be banned but only that parents be given an opportunity to discover before a purchase was made what their children were buying. Miss Gore seemed to have found a means of making community feelings respected in a way that also respected the First Amendment. The chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, Elie Wiesel, stretched the ideal of community further, calling on America to open its doors to anyone who wanted to enter, for economic as well as political reasons. ''A father who cannot feed his children is not free,'' he said. Other panelists, too, urged that the sufferings of minorities in America not be forgotten amid the fireworks. That theme seemed to be in the mind of the Woodrow Wilson Professor of Government at Williams College, James MacGregor Burns, when he voiced his feeling in the waning minutes of the conference, that the constitutional system today is incapable of dealing with America's enduring inequalities. The Constitution, he said, ''is not a sacred document; it is a charter of government that was made by man and can be changed by man.'' Professor Burns also pointed out that two more celebrations were in America's near future; next year brings the 200th anniversary of the drafting of the Constitution, and the spring of 1989 will be the bicentennial of the new Federal Government's setting up shop in New York. Professor Burns suggested to Mayor Koch that that might be an occasion for an even bigger celebration than the one just ending, which was enough to leave most people speechless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A STUDY ASSESSES TRAITS OF WOMEN WHO KILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/style/a-study-assesses-traits-of-women-who-kill.html,"A new research study of women who kill, a group that has been given relatively little attention by social scientists, dispels some common myths about these women. They are neither more emotional nor less predictable than men who kill, the study has found. And most do not conform to the stereotype of the ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' killer, or to the pattern of figures like Bonnie Parker. But women who commit homicide do share common characteristics, the research suggests. They are likely to have experienced significant levels of loss and bereavement in both their childhood and adult lives. And often they have been exposed to high levels of family violence as children, as well as violence in their adult relationships with men. In addition, they are likely to be living extremely stressful lives as adults, while feeling overwhelming isolation associated with intense resentment against those they perceive as having wronged them. ''There have been few studies of female criminal homicide behavior,'' said John T. Kirkpatrick, co-author of a two-year study of 76 women who have killed. Although an average of 1,500 women commit homicide in the United States each year, much of the previous research has focused on male homicide offenders. 'Common Stereotypes' ''Since 85 percent of murders are committed by men, it was understandable that so much of the research focused on males,'' said Dr. Kirkpatrick, a stress researcher who is assistant dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of New Hampshire. ''There are a number of common but inaccurate stereotypes about these women,'' he said. ''One is the 'Arsenic and Old Lace' stereotype -the grandmotherly type who murders through stealth and deception. Another is that of the Bonnie Parker type, who is believed to act not on her own, but at the behest of a man.'' ''But these kinds of offenders are unusual,'' said John A. Humphrey, professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the study's other author. One who fit this pattern, he said, was Margie Velma Barfield, executed Nov. 2, 1984, for murdering her fiance, Stuart Taylor, by lacing his beer with arsenic. She also had confessed to poisoning her mother and two other elderly people she had cared for as a nurse. ''This kind of cool, deliberate killing is not only atypical of women, but also of men,'' Dr. Humphrey said. Also atypical, he said, are contract killings by women such as Elizabeth Ann Duncan, the previous woman to be executed in this country, at San Quentin Prison in California in 1962. She was convicted of hiring two men to kill her son's pregnant wife. ''Women who kill in this way are also very rare, but when it does happen the victim is usually someone they know,'' he said. ''It's not a business dealing, as it is with men who contract to kill.'' Far more common, he said, are women who kill after having been abused by a husband, a lover or an ex-husband, as in the case of Bernadette Powell, who was convicted in 1978 of killing her former spouse in a motel in Ithaca, N.Y. ''Usually these crimes occur after long-standing provocation,'' Dr. Humphrey said. The offenders studied by the researchers were imprisoned at the North Carolina Correctional Center for Women in Raleigh. The life histories of the offenders were recorded by Dr. Kirkpatrick and Dr. Humphrey in interviews lasting from three to 12 hours. The women, who were promised anonymity for participating in the study, ranged in age from 17 to 56 at the time of their homicides. The researchers' findings were presented recently at the second national Conference on Social Stress at the University of New Hampshire and will be published in scholarly journals as well as in a book. Thirty-eight percent of the offenders were white, 57 percent were black and 5 percent were American Indians. Eighty-seven percent of the women's victims were males, 51 percent of victims were black, the youngest victim was 1 month old and the oldest was 76 years. Dr. Kirkpatrick and Dr. Humphrey compared their findings with earlier research on men done by Dr. Humphrey and Stuart Palmer of the University of New Hampshire and found no evidence to support the idea that the women offenders ''were more emotional or unpredictable in their actions,'' said Dr. Kirkpatrick. This had been a contention of some previous research, ''which was biased ideologically,'' said Dr. Humphrey. He added that female homicide ''has been used in support of male sexist arguments and also to support feminist theories.'' Some feminists have theorized that female homicide was the result of ''the prolonged experience of oppression at the hands of men,'' Dr. Kirkpatrick said. ''But this seems terribly simplistic,'' he said. ''The similarities between men and women who kill were far greater than the differences.'' There were, however, variations: for example, the men interviewed in previous research had not suffered the stress of abortion or miscarriage, as some women had, and had generally assumed few child-care responsibilities. A principal difference between the men and women, he said, is this: ''Among the men, a lot of homicides occurred over the most trivial things - leaning on a car, say, or not paying 50 cents owed. It's as if these men are on the edge of violence most of the time and anything can precipitate it.'' However, he said, ''In order for women to kill, it had to be perceived by them as a life-threatening situation affecting their physical or emotional well-being.'' He said that from this finding, the researchers believe that ''women appear to have the resources to keep from murdering, the social support they give each other to put up with all manner of adversity for a longer period of time.'' Dr. Kirkpatrick said, ''Obviously, societal factors, like the fact that women don't earn as much as men do, could figure into their lives. But it's not the primary cause.'' That cause, the researchers said, seems linked to the women's life histories and to the kinds of stress, and the severity of stress, they encountered. Nearly all ''came from very violent upbringings, and experienced high levels of domestic violence -seeing their mothers and fathers fighting, often with weapons,'' said Dr. Kirkpatrick. ''Many had experienced intrasibling violence,'' he added, ''and some were beaten, and nearly tortured, by their brothers.'' One third of the women reported being sexually abused as children. ''What may be learned is that when there is conflict, you resolve that conflict violently,'' said Dr. Humphrey. ''They believe there is no point in trying to negotiate.'' In addition, more than half the women had lost a loved one in childhood, and a sixth reported the death of a child. More than half had had a family member or friend die during the women's adult years. Loss a Source of Stress ''Loss is an important source of stress because not only is it stressful in itself,'' Dr. Humphrey said, ''but it also precipitates other stress, as when they have to move in with grandparents or drop out of school due to the death of a parent.'' The women often described themselves in a way that the researchers chose to characterize as ''the only ones,'' a phrase used by the singer Rickie Lee Jones in her 1981 ''Living It Up'' album. These are women who feel at once overpowering aloneness and simmering resentment of others, Dr. Humphrey said. They feel that the world is conspiring against them, they harbor great resentment for the wrongs they have suffered, and believe they are the ''only ones'' who are so afflicted. Often, Dr. Kirkpatrick said, the feeling of isolation combined with blaming and resentful behavior becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, ''since they do not seem to seek out any social support, and reject help,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Defining Women's Rights Will Aid Abortion Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/opinion/l-defining-women-s-rights-will-aid-abortion-debate-701386.html,"To the Editor: Another 5-to-4 decision of the United States Supreme Court in an abortion-related case emphasizes sharp differences among the Justices and among the people of our nation (front page, June 12). On June 11, the Court struck down Pennsylvania legislation providing for a more ''informed consent'' by the pregnant woman and for protection of the life of an aborted but viable fetus. Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the majority, provides what appears more like a doctrinaire tract by the National Abortion Rights Action League. Strongly defensive of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, in which he also wrote for the majority, he strikes down Pennsylvania's requirement that the pregnant woman be advised of availability of medical benefits for childbirth and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in child support as ''poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision.'' Sic transit gloria justitiae! Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, in his dissent, observes that ''the Court's astounding rationale is that such information might have the effect of 'discouraging abortion,' as though abortion is something to be advocated and encouraged.'' Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Byron R. White, in stinging separate dissents, each of them joined by Justice William H. Rehnquist, assert that even on the basis of Roe, the majority has departed from that decision by abandoning the ''compelling interest'' of the state in protecting fetal life after viability. Justice O'Connor goes even further in affirming that interest in protecting life ''throughout pregnancy.'' She was not on the Court when Roe was decided, but her dissent suggests the need for a reconsideration of that decision. Chief Justice Burger states flatly that Roe should be re-examined. The Court minority deals with the conflict of rights between a woman's freedom and the right to life of the developing individual. The majority sees women's freedom, even uninformed, as all-controlling. Progress in resolving the political and juridical conflict could well be advanced by defining the categories of women's rights and distinguishing between abortion ''rights'' and other components in women's issues. The narrow focus on abortion as the symbolic women's issue has been regarded by many as a factor in the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment and of Walter F. Mondale, early and loudly endorsed by the National Organization for Women, which later demanded that he choose a pro-abortion woman as a running mate. Similar failure to distinguish among women's issues has also been characteristic of many pro-life partisans with patriarchal attitudes and practices deeply entrenched, indeed in my own church and in other quarters. Abortion opponents could further the dialogue and their cause by aggressively supporting the full range of women's rights, excluding abortion, on substantive grounds of justice, as well as tactical grounds of persuading public opinion. Our nation's people are deeply divided on this issue, which will be resolved neither by the ''single-issue'' simplicities of some abortion opponents nor by the doctrinaire simplicity of the Court majority in this case.

The Court Was 'Superficial' In the Homosexuality Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/opinion/the-court-was-superficial-in-the-homosexuality-case.html,"Last week, the Supreme Court decided one of the major open issues in American constitutional law, concluding that the Government has the power to criminalize private consensual homosexual acts. Legal scholars have been discussing this issue for several decades, stimulated by Supreme Court cases expanding the protection of privacy, by increasing public attention to homosexuality and by an extraordinarily rich philosophic literature, going back to John Stuart Mill, on the legitimacy of morals legislation. Now, after avoiding the issue for years, the Supreme Court has spoken, in a written opinion that is so superficial, peremptory and insensitive that it deserves to be criticized on this ground alone, quite apart from the Court's conclusion about the constitutionality of sodomy laws. Consider just two of the questions raised by the case. First, what is meant by the explicit provision in the Constitution protecting individual ''liberty'' from governmental infringements? The Supreme Court has already held that this provision includes the liberty to use contraceptives, to live with whom one wishes, to use pornographic material in one's home, to have an abortion if one chooses and to engage in other private conduct related to family, marriage and procreation. Does the concept of constitutional ''liberty'' reflected in those prior cases extend to private sexual conduct between people of the same sex? If not, the reason must be more convincing than the Court's one-sentence assertion: ''No connection between family, marriage or procreation on the one hand and homosexual activity on the other has been demonstrated by the Court of Appeals or by respondent.'' In truth, Michael Hardwick, the homosexual who first brought this case, the Court of Appeals that originally ruled on it and Justice Harry A. Blackmun's dissent all made a clear connection. The principle underlying the various earlier cases, they argued, was that ''liberty'' includes intimate associations and private conduct central to one's fulfillment as a person, including sexual activity, and that this principle required protection of homosexual intimacies as well as heterosexual ones. Perhaps that connection between the earlier cases and this one is not sufficient, but the Court does not tell us why. The Court does tell us that ''proscriptions against [ homosexuality ] have ancient roots.'' But as the Court itself acknowledges, the constitutional guarantee of liberty protects not only conduct that has been protected throughout our ''history and tradition'' but also freedoms that we have come to see as ''implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.'' (If ''history and tradition'' were an exclusive guide, many constitutional protections we take for granted today would not exist.) Mr. Hardwick and his defenders did not argue that history or tradition have protected homosexual rights: they argued instead that given the importance of intimate associations in a person's life and in a free society, a homosexual's right to have consensual sexual relationships in his home is an element of ''ordered liberty.'' The Court treats this argument no better than a history-based one, calling it ''at best, facetious.'' But insults do not take the place of arguments. The Court is equally offhanded about a second major issue - the question of whether or not the Government may punish private conduct purely on the ground that it is deemed ''immoral'' without any evidence of concrete harm to others. This has, for centuries, been one of the most debated issues in the Anglo-American legal tradition. Yet a Supreme Court majority has now disposed of it summarily, saying simply: ''We do not agree.'' The Court does not give reasons, or respond to the serious arguments on the other side, or explain why the Government's invocation of ''morality'' is deemed sufficient here, although the Supreme Court has rejected it in earlier cases. The Court's refusal to engage these two large questions seriously, or even respond to Justice Blackmun's dissent, is more than an intellectual failing. It is also an insult - to homosexuals, but also to any Americans who care about liberty. In characterizing one of Mr. Hardwick's weightiest arguments as ''at best, facetious,'' the Court makes its hostility explicit. Chief Justice Warren Burger's concurring opinion is pervasively hostile, calling homosexual acts ''heinous'' and asserting that eliminating laws against homosexuals ''would cast aside millenia of moral teaching.'' Perhaps even more striking than the majority's offhandedness and hostility is the opinion's failure to acknowledge in any way the human dimension of this issue. Not a single sentence expresses any understanding of the fact that this case involves human beings who have needs for intimacy, love and sexual expression like the rest of us. Not a single sentence acknowledges the human anguish that anti-homosexual statutes can create or that these laws criminalize an American minority that has been struggling for political and civil membership for many years. These are not extra-constitutional matters; they are certainly relevant in deciding what ordered liberty means. Can it be that the justices do not see this human dimension? To have addressed these things would not necessarily have required the Court to change its conclusions on constitutional law or to express approval of homosexual behavior. But such sensitivity would have made a difference. It is one thing to lose; it is even worse to lose believing one's claim has not even received respectful consideration. Fair judicial decision-making requires that consideration. The Court's insensitivity and offhandedness in this case represent more than a human deficiency; they represent a serious deficiency in the art of judging. That failing is especially troublesome in this case because it may affect the broader political response to the decision. As the Court notes, a constitutional case decides only what a legislature is allowed to do, not what is desirable. But here the Court treats homosexuals' claims in such a dismissive way that it conveys a sense that similar treatment by legislatures would be appropriate. The opinion exacerbates homosexuals' already marginal status. It will also encourage public officials to summarily dismiss as ''facetious'' any argument that anti-homosexual laws intrude upon a personal freedom worth tolerating. In short, it will encourage the adoption and enforcement of such laws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JUSTICE DEPT. CLEARS CONSUMER SAFETY OFFICIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/us/justice-dept-clears-consumer-safety-official.html,"A Justice Department investigation has cleared Terrence M. Scanlon, a member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, of charges that he had misused his office. As a result, the Senate has scheduled a vote on his confirmation as chairman of the commission for next Tuesday. The Justice Department informed the Senate and the commission of the results of its investigation on June 17, but the department's letter has not been made public. Mr. Scanlon's confirmation was held up last December when Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, blocked a vote on the floor of the Senate. They raised several objections to the appointment and said the Senate should not vote until it had received the results of the Justice Department investigation, which had been requested by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. 'Prosecution Is Not Warranted' In the Justice Department letter, John R. Bolton, an assistant attorney general, wrote: ''We wish to advise you that the department's public integrity section has conducted a thorough investigation of the allegations against Mr. Scanlon and as a result of this investigation, we have determined that criminal prosecution is not warranted. Accordingly, the department's investigation has been closed.'' The charges of impropriety had been raised by Joan Claybrook, a consumer activist who is president of Public Citizen, and others. They charged that Mr. Scanlon had used his Government office to do work for an anti-abortion organization, that he had passed secret information to companies being investigated by the commission and that he had held improper meetings with a representative of the toy industry, whose products frequently come under the commission's scrutiny. Consumer groups had hoped to block Mr. Scanlon's ascendance to chairmanship, viewing him as not sufficiently diligent in protecting consumers against faulty products. Preference for Negotiation Mr. Scanlon has disputed this, asserting that his preference for negotiating with companies to seek voluntary compliance was more effective than bringing charges that frequently are contested through long court proceedings. Mr. Scanlon is a Democrat, but he has wide support among Republicans in Congress, while most of the opposition to his appointment has come from Democrats. Mr. Scanlon, reached at his home, where he is recuperating from back surgery, said, ''I am pleased that a long and exhaustive investigation is completed.'' He said he believed he would now be confirmed by the Senate. Reaction From Opponents Ms. Claybrook said she believed the wording of the Justice Department letter meant that her allegations had been sustained and that the Senate ought to reject the nomination. ''There wasn't much question that he made false statements and that he misused Government personnel,'' Ms. Claybrook said. ''Whether or not the Justice Department felt it merited criminal prosecution, it certainly seems to me that his ethical behavior would require that he not be appointed to high public office.'' Senator Simon, reached in Champaign, Ill., said he would oppose the nomination on the floor but said he expected Mr. Scanlon to be confirmed. Asked to comment on the Justice Department statement, Senator Simon said: ''They took it to a grand jury, and he was cleared of any indictable offense. But that was a peripheral issue. ''The real issue, in my opinion, is whether he is there to protect the consumer. Clearly, his interest has been to protect the industries accused of violations. If he is approved, we ought to change the name from the Consumer Product Safety Commission to something else, because he is not interested in protecting the consumer.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV REVIEWS; CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER ON CBS NEWS SPECIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/09/arts/tv-reviews-chief-justice-burger-on-cbs-news-special.html,"WARREN E. BURGER, Chief Justice of the United States, can be seen tonight with Bill Moyers. Never before, apparently, has a Chief Justice been interviewed at such length, and never before, certainly, has a Chief Justice been interviewed in the Supreme Court in front of a television camera. That, however, is only a footnote; the question is, what does Chief Justice Burger say? In fact, he doesn't say much, and this, in a way, is reassuring. The one-hour program, ''The Burger Years,'' a CBS News special on Channel 2 at 8 P.M., was filmed June 17 and 18. On June 17, Chief Justice Burger announced that he would leave the Court, and devote his time to the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution. ''I consider that celebration,'' he says, ''more important than my staying on the Court.'' Nonetheless, Mr. Moyers, understandably, wants to talk about the Court, not the celebration, and about Chief Justice Burger. The United States has had 40 Presidents, but only 15 Chief Justices. They have been our most remote public figures, although, as heads of the judicial branch, they have held equal rank with the Presidents. So, consider the burning issues on which we want to hear Chief Justice Burger speak: capital punishment, say, school prayer or a woman's right to have an abortion. Chief Justice Burger talks about death sentences: ''Every one of the capital cases is a painful experience.'' Mr. Moyers, sensing an opportunity, puts a question. ''Are you implying,'' he asks, ''that you oppose the death penalty?'' Chief Justice Burger barely takes time to ponder. ''No,'' he says, ''I'm not implying it one way or the other.'' And abortion? Isn't that issue, as Mr. Moyers says, ''one of the most divisive in America right now?'' Chief Justice Burger says it probably is; Mr. Moyers, sensing another opportunity, says he understands that the Chief Justice has ''wrestled'' with abortion, and ''gone back and forth'' in his thinking. No, Chief Justice Burger says, ''I haven't gone back and forth.'' And school prayer? Why has this ''so stirred up the country?'' Chief Justice Burger says it hasn't stirred up the country, only certain people. But either way, he says, prayer ''would do no harm.'' Mr. Moyers and Chief Justice Burger continue then, until once again Mr. Moyers closes in. ''Now,'' he says, ''I detect you personally would be in favor of letting children pray in school.'' ''No,'' the Chief Justice says, ''you detect wrong there.'' Is Chief Justice Burger equivocating? No, he is not, and he does give us two great clues to his thinking. The first comes when he refers to a former member of the Court of Appeals as ''a very great, practical judge.'' The judge, when told that it might be unconstitutional to have the marshal begin court sessions with the words ''God save the United States and this honorable court,'' said that if his colleagues voted to ban the ritual words, he would say the words himself. That, the Chief Justice says, ended the discussion. The second clue comes when Chief Justice Burger discusses how he assigns the written opinions the other Justices write. ''I take into account,'' he says, ''who will write the narrowest opinion - the narrowest, just enough to decide that case.'' What emerges, then, is a cautious man, conscious that the Republic moves slowly and that if it does not, it can be torn apart. Indeed, Chief Justice Burger is most eloquent talking not about the present but the past. Only 125 years ago, he notes, Robert E. Lee, although he opposed both slavery and secession, chose to defend Virginia and not the Union. ''Just think,'' he says, that almost 100 years after the Revolutionary War, loyalty to the state and not the nation ''was still the frame of mind of a great many people.'' Presumably, that is no longer the frame of mind today, but the fragility, Chief Justice Burger seems to say, is still there. A Chief Justice must not strain the social fabric without cause. Chief Justice Burger says it is comforting to be criticized by both liberals and conservatives (''so-called liberals, so-called conservatives.'') It means he is in ''a safe position.'' ''The Burger Years,'' in fact, is not a bad history lesson. Mr. Moyers looks and acts very much an attentive, mildly disputatious, graduate student; Chief Justice Burger, at the age of 78, is a judicious Mr. Chips. Watch the program because it has something to say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HIGH COURT'S 1985-86 TERM: MIXED RESULTS FOR PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/10/us/high-court-s-1985-86-term-mixed-results-for-president.html,"In the Supreme Court term that ended Monday, President Reagan won a significant reaffirmation of Presidential primacy in executing the laws, but he suffered a series of major defeats on issues at the heart of his social agenda. The most notable aspect of the term was the Reagan Administration's boldness in urging its views of the law upon the Court, perhaps more aggressively than any predecessor in the past 50 years. The Court responded by rejecting the Administration's advice, firmly and sometimes testily, in major decisions on abortion, affirmative action, minority voting rights, rules designed to require medical care for infants with severe disabilities, and other issues. Some Victories for Reagan The Administration did achieve several victories, the most notable of which was the Court's decision last Monday striking down the central provision of the new budget-balancing law as an encroachment on Presidential authority. But that ruling represented a cautious extension of a decade-long trend strengthening the President against Congress, rather than a broad endorsement of this Administration's distinctive views on the separation of powers. In general, the Court steered a moderate course through a docket laden with an unusual number of politically charged issues, shifting from left to right of center from one issue to the next as Warren E. Burger, who is retiring, ended 17 years as Chief Justice. In major decisions that did not involve the Administration, the Court ruled for the first time that the Constitution bars severe forms of partisan gerrymandering and that it does not protect private homosexual relations between consenting adults. The reasoning of the latter decision, most constitutional theorists agreed, could not easily be squared either with the Court's broad reaffirmation of abortion rights, announced in another decision in the term just ended, or with its precedents recognizing a right to sexual privacy for heterosexuals. Reversing the Court's direction has been a major Administration priority since the 1980 Presidential campaign. The effort took on more emphasis last year when Edwin Meese 3d succeeded William French Smith as Attorney General and Charles Fried succeeded Rex E. Lee as Solicitor General. Conservative Activists Both Mr. Meese and Mr. Fried are conservative activists, far bolder than their predecessors in urging the Court to overrule or depart from its own precedents and adopt the Administration's views of the law. Mr. Fried filed the first brief in decades in which the Government urged the Court to overturn a major precedent, its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. The Court not only declined this invitation, but curbed state power even to regulate abortion procedures more than ever before. Critics, including some former lawyers in the Solicitor General's office who declined to be named, said the Administration's tactics in this and other cases may have backfired, irritating some of the Justices to the point that the Government may have lost some cases it would have won with a more subtle approach. 'Smart-Aleck Insiders' In an interview today, Mr. Fried dismissed such critics as ''smart-aleck insiders'' who ''show disrespect for the Court'' by suggesting that its members would be swayed by peevishness. He stressed that the Administration had won some significant cases and had apparently influenced the Court's thinking in others. The ''most dramatic example'' of the Court's adopting his arguments, Mr. Fried said, was its decision upholding, as applied to homosexuals, a Georgia law making it a crime to engage in sodomy. Mr. Fried did not file a brief or take a position in that case. But he said today that ''the argument we made in terms of constitutional methodology'' in the abortion case ''was precisely the argument that showed up just a few weeks later'' in the sodomy decision. That argument, he said, was that the Court should not ''invent rights'' not specified in the Constitution. But in some of the cases in which Mr. Fried did file briefs the Court ruled against him by lopsided margins. A Rebuff on Voting Rights The Justices were unanimous in rejecting the Justice Department's narrow interpretation of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act and in rebuffing its effort to use procedural barriers to block mental patients from suing for disability benefits. In some other cases, several members of the Court, and occasionally a majority, had unusually sharp criticism for the Justice Department's arguments, asserting in one affirmative action case that its brief ''twists the plain language'' used by Congress. The Administration's conservative views did prevail in some significant cases of lesser magnitude, such as last Monday's decision giving school officials broad latitude to discipline students for ''indecent'' speech. As has always been the case, the Justice Department won many more cases than it lost, 78 percent, Mr. Fried said. Most involved Federal Government positions that would not vary from one Administration to the next. Presidential Authority Upheld This was true of the Court's acceptance last Monday of the Administration's view that the automatic mechanism for cutting spending at the heart of the budget-balancing law unconstitutionally encroached on Presidential authority by giving executive power to the Comptroller General. While the decision in Bowsher v. Synar agreed with the constitutional doubts Mr. Reagan expressed when he signed the law in December, the Court explicitly declined to endorse Mr. Meese's attack, in two speeches, on the independence of several regulatory agencies from Presidential control. The Court also avoided adopting Mr. Fried's position that only a subordinate of the President could be given the power to order spending cuts needed to meet the law's deficit targets. Instead, it accepted his narrower, alternative argument that this power could not be given to the Comptroller General because of an obscure 1921 law subjecting him to removal by Congress. The Justice Department probably would have made both arguments, no matter who was President, Mr. Fried and some former officials noted. It was on what some Administration lawyers call ''conservative agenda'' issuesthat the Court was least receptive to its views. Following are summaries of some of the Court's most important rulings in the term that began last Oct. 7: Discrimination In three major affirmative action decisions, the Court reaffirmed its support for limited use of racial preferences for members of minority groups to redress specific job discrimination when other measures would not work. In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, the Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, struck down as unconstitutional a Michigan school board's policy of laying off white teachers ahead of members of minority groups with less seniority. It stressed both the lack of proof of any past discrimination by the school board that needed redress and the plan's severe impact on laid-off white teachers. But, contrary to the Administration view, it suggested that a public employer could make limited use of numerical hiring goals favoring members of minorities when needed to remedy its own past discrimination, or to achieve racial diversity on a faculty. In Local 28 v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Court upheld, by 5 to 4, a lower court order requiring a New York City sheet metal union to eradicate its own ''egregious'' discrimination against members of minorities by meeting a 29.23 percent minority membership ''goal.'' While rejecting the Administration's arguments against all such numerical goals, the Court stressed that they should be used sparingly, and should never be enforced as quotas or simply to achieve racial balance. In Local 93 v. Cleveland, the Court ruled that judges have broad latitude to approve, over objections by white employees or unions, ''consent decrees'' in which employers agree to adopt racial preferences to settle discrimination suits by employees who are members of minority groups. In another major civil rights ruling, the Court held unanimously that ''severe or pervasive'' sexual harassement of an employee by a supervisor violates the Federal law against sex discrimination in the workplace. (Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson.) In United States v. Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Court again upheld the Administration's narrow view of the antidiscrimination laws that apply to programs that receiving Federal money. It ruled that a 1973 law barring discrimination against people with disabilities does not apply to commercial airlines, except for the few that receive direct Federal grants. Privacy The Court reaffirmed its commitment to broad abortion rights, which the Administration had urged it to abandon. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court struck down a 1982 Pennsylvania law requiring doctors to provide women seeking abortions with detailed information about the risks and alternatives, to file reports with the state and to take specific steps to insure live births in late-term abortions. While the majority seemed more adamant then ever in barring states from attempting even to dissuade women from having abortions, two dissenters said states should be allowed to prohibit abortions. The other two were more ambiguous but said they would uphold some restrictions on abortion. (Thornburg v. American College.) In another 5-to-4 decision that bitterly divided the Court, the majority held that the Constitution does not bar criminal prosecution for homosexual relations between consenting adults, even in the privacy of their own homes. All those who had voted for broad abortion rights dissented except Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. (Bowers v. Hardwick.) Reapportionment In the gerrymandering case, the Court asserted for the first time the power to strike down election district lines if a majority party in a legislature has manipulated them so severely as to ''consistently degrade'' the voting strength of another party. But the Court upheld Indiana's state legislative districts in the case, Davis v. Bandemer. It held that the gerrymandering by Indiana's Republicans had not had such a prolonged and severe effect as to violate the constitutional rights of Democrats. In the first major test of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act, the Court rejected the Administration's narrow view of the rights of minority voters and invalidated four North Carolina election districts that it said made it too hard for blacks to elect their preferred candidiates to the legislature. Free Speech and Press The Court gave schools broad leeway to discipline students for ''indecent'' speech, upholding the two-day suspension of a 17-year-old student for using sexual metaphors to tout the virility of his candidate for student government in a speech to a school assembly. (Bethel School District v. Fraser.) Sharply limiting First Amendment protection for commercial speech, the Court upheld Puerto Rico's ban on local advertising of casino gambling. It suggested that states may also restrict advertising of liquor, cigarettes and other products that are legal but deemed harmful. (Posadas de Puerto Rico v. Tourism Company.) The Court held that local zoning officials have broad powers to use zoning laws to bar movie theaters from showing sexually explicit films near homes, schools, churches or parks. (City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres.) In Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps, the Court held that a person suing a news organization for libel must bear the burden of proving the falsity of damaging statements about him, at least when the statements involve ''matters of public concern.'' In another significant libel law victory for the press, the Court ruled that libel suits by public officials and public figures in Federal courts must be dismissed before trial unless the evidence suggests they can prove libel with ''convincing clarity.'' (Anderson v. Liberty Lobby.) The Court also extended to pretrial criminal hearings the qualified First Amendment right of the public and press to attend criminal trials. (Press-Enterprise v. Superior Court.) Criminal Law Prosecutors continued to win most criminal law cases, but there were some significant victories for defendants and civil libertarians. In the term's most important criminal law ruling, the Court overturned a 1965 decision and held that prosecutors may not exclude blacks from juries based on the possibility that they would favor defendants of their own race. The decision, Batson v. Kentucky, also established an evidentiary standard making it easier for black defendants to prove unconstitutional discrimination by prosecutors who use their ''peremptory challenges'' to exclude blacks from juries. The Court also ruled, in Vasquez v. Hillery, that the conviction of any defendant indicted by a grand jury from which members of his race had been illegally excluded must be reversed. In Turner v. Murray, it held that a black defendant facing a possible death penalty for murder of a white victim was entitled to have prospective jurors questioned about racial bias. The Court rejected one of the last sweeping challenges to the procedures used by most states in cases in which death is a possible penalty. It ruled, in Lockhart v. McCree, that committed opponents of the death penalty may be barred from juries in capital cases regardless of whether this increases the likelihood of conviction. The Court also ruled that the Constitution bars execution of convicted murderers who have become so insane they do not know they are about to be executed or the reason for it. (Ford v. Wainwright.) The Court refused to extend its curb on police efforts to elicit information from suspects on one front, while adding a new curb on anoother front. In Moran v. Burbine, it held that police may use deception, or apparently even force, if necessary, to keep a defense attorney away while they interrogate a criminal suspect, and that they need not tell the suspect that the attorney is trying to reach him. Noting that the police in the case had complied with the 1966 decision in Miranda v. Arizona by informing the suspect of his rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present, the Court declined to add a new requirement that the police cooperate with a lawyer's independent efforts to reach the suspect. Mr. Fried counted this as his major criminal law victory of the term, saying it ''put a fence around Miranda,'' as he had urged. His brief in the case made no reference to Mr. Meese's denunciation of the Miranda decision itself as ''infamous.'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion explicitly stated that Miranda ''as written strikes the proper balance.'' In Maine v. Moulton, the Court rejected the Justice Department's advice on a related issue. It held that statements an informer with a hidden transmitter elicited from an indicted defendant could not be used to convict the defendant of the crime charged in the indictment, even though the police who arranged the recording had reason to expect the defendant would discuss a plan to kill a witness. The Court ruled in California v. Ciraolo that the police do not need a warrant to spy from airplanes on the fenced yards of private homes. In Dow Chemical v. United States, it held that the Environmental Protection Agency did not need a warrant to take aerial photographs of an industrial complex. Antitrust and Business The Court encouraged trial courts to dismiss before trial antitrust suits in which the evidence of an illegal conspiracy seems implausible. The case, Matsushita v. Zenith, was a victory for 21 Japanese television manufacturers who were sued by the Zenith Electronics Corporation and another competitor. It said the alleged Japanese conspiracy to destroy American producers by depressing prices to unprofitable levels in the United States would be ''economically senseless'' because it would hurt the Japanese companies, too. The Court upheld a strict rent control ordinance in Berkeley, Calif., against an antitrust suit by landlords, holding that unilateral imposition of regulatory controls by a government does not amount to a antitrust conspiracy. (Fisher v. Berkeley.) The Court ruled that the Federal Reserve Board had no authority to regulate limited-service banks, which restrict their activities so as to skirt the statutory definition of banks and thus avoid restrictions on interstate banking and other regulations. (Board of Governors v. Dimension Financial.) Other Cases The Court ruled that the military could discipline an Orthodox Jewish officer for wearing a yarmulke indoors while in uniform, holding that the military's interest in enforcing its dress code outweighed the officer's religious obligation to keep his head covered. (Goldman v. Weinberger.) In Bowen v. American Hospital Association, the Court invalidated the Administration's ''Baby Doe'' rules, which required hospitals to give Federal investigators access to their records and included other measures to force life-prolonging medical treatment for newborn infants with severe disabilities. In Bowen v. City of New York, the Court ruled unanimously that thousands of mentally ill New Yorkers had a right to sue the Government for illegally using a ''clandestine'' policy to deny them disability benefits. It rejected the Justice Department's position that they had forfeited any right to court relief by failing to comply with statutory appeal deadlines and administrative procedures. THE SUPREME COURT SESSION: TALLY FOR LEFT AND RIGHT Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and William H. Rehnquist, intellectual leaders of the Supreme Court, voted on opposite sides in 74 of the 147 cases decided by signed opinions this past session.

ADDITION OF SCALIA'S VOTE UNLIKELY TO ALTER RULINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/11/us/addition-of-scalia-s-vote-unlikely-to-alter-rulings.html,"The Supreme Court's voting patterns in the term that ended Monday suggest that none of the major cases would have been decided differently if President Reagan's nominee to the court, Judge Antonin Scalia, had been voting instead of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who is retiring. While Judge Scalia, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is expected to add intellectual vigor and leadership to the Court's conservative wing, the balance of power on most issues is expected to remain with the moderate center. But the large number of important cases decided by votes of 5 to 4, on issues including abortion and affirmative action, suggests that a decisive shift to the right may occur if another of the aging Justices steps down while President Reagan is in office. In every major case this term, the winning side was supported either by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who at 78 years of age is the most critical swing vote, or by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 56, or by both of them. Five years after Mr. Reagan appointed her, Justice O'Connor has emerged as a key member of the Court's center group. Record of Independence While Justice O'Connor has leaned to the right, in some major cases involving affirmative action, religious freedom and other issues she has rejected the positions of the Administration, of Chief Justice Burger and of Justice William H. Rehnquist, Mr. Reagan's nominee to be the next Chief Justice. Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist were the Court's most consistent conservatives, voting together in the vast majority of the 147 cases decided by signed opinions. They were allied in 31 of the 34 cases decided by one vote. Chief Justice Burger plans to retire as soon as Justice Rehnquist is confirmed by the Senate, probably in August. Judge Scalia would fill the resulting vacancy as an Associate Justice, and his record suggests he will vote similarly to Justice Rehnquist and Chief Justice Burger. Justice Powell voted with the majority in 28 of the 34 cases that were decided by 5-to-4 votes. Justice O'Connor voted with the majority in 25 of those 34 cases. Justice Powell dissented less than any other member of the Court, 13 times, with Justice O'Connor dissenting 14 times. Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, who hold down the liberal wing, cast the most dissenting votes, 51 for Justice Brennan and 50 for Justice Marshall. In the 74 cases in which Justices Rehnquist and Brennan, the court's intellectual leaders and ideological polestars, took opposite sides, Justice Rehnquist was in the majority in 48, and Justice Brennan in 26. In all of the 30 cases that involved criminal law, Justice Rehnquist supported the prosecution and Justice Brennan the defense. The prosecution won 22 of them, the defense 8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Misguided Approach To Teen-Age Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/11/opinion/l-a-misguided-approach-to-teen-age-pregnancy-245586.html,"To the Editor: At a time when tremendous public attention has been drawn to the phenomenon of babies having babies, it seems particularly incongruous, not to mention ill advised and cruel, for New York State to be halting Medicaid assistance to as many as 4,000 pregnant teen-agers a year (news story, June 15). The state's courts have long acknowledged that young women, even those residing with and dependent on their parents, are entitled to various forms of public assistance and medical assistance on behalf of their children, despite the theoretical ability of the grandparents to support the grandchild. What these decisions reflect is that in New York grandparents do not have a legal obligation to support their grandchildren. The same reasoning has been applied to pregnant teen-agers seeking medical assistance relating to pregnancy. The decision to halt Medicaid for pregnant teen-agers on the ground that their parents' income renders them ineligible cannot be properly understood as a money saver because any withholding of medical assistance, whether it be for prenatal care or for abortions, is likely to result in greater expenditures in the long run. The most likely result of this shortsighted decision is that the young women will delay seeking medical attention and will be forced into back-alley abortions. The cost will be paid, not just with dollars, but with young lives. EILEEN KAUFMAN Asst. Professor of Law, Touro College Huntington, L.I., June 16, 1986",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OBSERVER; The Dirty Days Are Near,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/12/opinion/observer-the-dirty-days-are-near.html,"A long time ago I had a friend more candid than most. ''I like my sex dirty,'' he used to say. That was a vile confession at that time, which was the late 1940's. Since most Americans then assumed that all sex was dirty, my friend was saying that love's normal squalor was not enough for him. I could only guess at what orgies of foulness it took to please him. Gentlemen didn't exchange details of their carnal doings, though outrageous lying about them was socially O.K. in barracks situations where everybody knew you were just making it up. Later Dr. Kinsey was born, then Masters and Johnson, and suddenly something appalling had happened: Sex had been cleaned up. Generations of parents and grandparents, most of whom had learned to live contentedly with the shame of their depraved appetites, were now scorned by children and grandchildren. It was the clean-sex era. Sex was not only clean, but also healthy and good for you. People appeared on radio, even on television where you could see them shamelessly fail to blush while they talked about . . . Good Lord! can you believe they're talking about orgasms and masturbation and sodomy right there on the telly before you've even finished breakfast? There were slogans for sex like the advertising slogans for cigarettes in the old days when cigarettes were good for you. ''Sex is good for you!'' a whole generation of youth was shouting. Even better for you than war, the new clean-sex crowd shouted. ''Make love, not war.'' That was a big slogan. Big like ''I'd walk a mile for a Camel'' or ''They satisfy'' were big slogans in the old days of dirty sex and healthy cigarettes. Here is a terrible thing about the modern world with its incredible rate of change: Unless you die young, in middle age you have to unlearn almost everything you learned in youth. It's even worse if you live to be old. Having unlearned in middle age everything you learned in youth, you now have to realize it was a mistake to unlearn all that youthful knowledge, because what you learned in youth has again become correct. I am speaking, of course, of the Government's drive to put the good old-fashioned dirtiness back into sex. This has usually been accomplished from Puritan times by making sex synonymous with sin. These are the Puritan principles that will never die so long as a substantial part of the population dreads the idea of somebody having a good time: Sex is sin. Sin is not clean. Sin is not healthy. Sin is not good for you. Only Satan could insinuate that sinning is preferable to making war. Hence, not surprisingly, we are supposed to be disgusted by pictures of humans in sexual embrace and outraged if such spectacles become available to children. Watching Rambo make war, however, is so respectable that the President may announce that he enjoyed it thoroughly, and nobody minds much if the kids, too, lap up the gore. The idea of sex as sin is on the march in Washington. A recent Supreme Court opinion on states' rights, for instance, goes out of its way to put the boot into homosexuals. The latest Commission on Pornography has just reversed the findings of the 1970 Commission on Pornography, which held that pornography didn't have much effect, socially speaking. The new commission says oh yes it does too, and blames pornography for contributing to the gross national violence. Reports like this, obviously engineered by the Government to undo the sex-is-clean attitude given Federal approval by the 1970 report, indicate the wind direction in Washington just as clearly as the Administration's plan to pack the Supreme Court with judges who will undo the last generation's rules on abortion, civil rights and police and Presidential powers. The message is that another age of dirty sex is on the horizon. As one bred to the last such age, I can comfort those who have known only the era of clean, healthy, wholesome, out-in-the-open, good-for-you sex. Knowing that you're violating Georgia state law can add extra spice to an amorous occasion, as can the delicious fear that it is sinful, foul and unspeakable. As for pornography, unforbidden it can be merely tedious; to be enjoyable it must always be forbidden. Having survived the dirty-sex era and the clean-sex era, I believe Americans need not fear an onset of dirty sex. A sense of engaging in sex both squalid and criminal is not only entirely American but also more exciting than doing something that's healthy. For healthy, there are jogging and dieting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN SHORT: NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/books/in-short-nonfiction.html,"A NATURAL HISTORY OF SEX: The Ecology and Evolution of Sexual Behavior. By Adrian Forsyth. (Scribners, $16.95.) The copulation of bedbugs, sex change among coral reef fish and cuckoldry by humans and bluebirds - all are under lively scrutiny in this thoroughly engaging chronicle about why males and females do what they do. More than a catalog of sexual weirdness, the book explains ''how to look at life'' in the manner of a modern evolutionary biologist. Humans are no measure of what is natural, Adrian Forsyth notes, covering as we do ''only a conservative stretch of life's possibilities.'' He makes no apology for using politically charged words - rape, incest, abortion - to describe the sexual behavior of bugs, chimps and cherry trees. He avoids fatalism while chastising those who ignore the evolutionary strategies that influence incest taboos and other human cultural practices. Mr. Forsyth, a biologist who lives in Canada, lays to rest the ''good-of-the-species'' explanations of animal behavior still pervasive in television programs on nature, focusing instead on the often conflicting strategies that individuals use to further their genetic self-interest. We learn for instance, that wimps, sneaks and diplomatic types may succeed (breed) as often as fiercely territorial males. He debunks the contention of the anthropologists Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox, the authors of ''Men in Groups,'' that females are not political animals. The book will provide any cocktail-party naturalist with a wealth of facts. For example, of all the mammals, humans have the most highly developed armpits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Third Branch, Upheld",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/opinion/the-third-branch-upheld.html,"Warren Burger's last opinion as Chief Justice was momentous, yet the country reacted calmly. In nullifying one of Congress's most important recent pieces of legislation, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law, Justice Burger showed how far he'd traveled - and how near the public consensus the Court still stands. Eighteen years ago, in another famous case before the Court of Appeals, Judge Burger had declined to challenge the House's refusal to seat the late Adam Clayton Powell. ''The checks and balances we boast of can check and balance just so far,'' he wrote then. ''That each branch may, thus, occasionally make errors for which there may be no effective remedy is one of the prices we pay for this independence, this separateness.'' That Burger opinion was reversed in June 1969 by the last ruling of his predecessor, Chief Justice Earl Warren, who said the situation required ''no more than an interpretation of the Constitution.'' By last week, in his own final trespass on Congress's powers, Mr. Burger was just as direct: ''No one can doubt that Congress and the President are confronted with fiscal and economic problems of unprecedented magnitude, but the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.'' This was no valedictory spree. The supposedly restrained Burger Court struck down more Federal laws, more state laws and more Supreme Court precedents than even the activist Warren Court, and in about the same number of years. Nor did the Burger Court display all the deference expected of it toward the Presidency. In its last year, it was especially hard on the Reagan Administration's more extreme arguments concerning voting rights, affirmative action, disability payments and abortion. Spanning the years from Presidents Nixon to Reagan, both of whom tried to force its opinions, the Burger Court managed to retain a healthy independence. President Reagan vows to try even harder now to staff the Court with more predictable votes and to press on it even tougher legal arguments. If he gets the vacancies, he undoubtedly has the will and the candidates. But by now elevating Justice Rehnquist to Chief Justice and replacing Mr. Burger's vote with Antonin Scalia's, he will not greatly alter the Court's delicate balance. The Court has been both balanced and remarkably sensitive. It has caught the national mood, not merely followed the election returns. Like the country, the Court has admired Ronald Reagan but by no means all his policies; it has shown weariness with welfare but insisted on justice for the poor and sick; it has been distrustful of racial quotas but unwilling to countenance discrimination. Warren Burger's Court, by pursuing its separate function, wound up being an affirmative actor in the American system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OPINION NARROWS OVER HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/us/opinion-narrows-over-high-court.html,"The American public is now about evenly split on whether the Supreme Court is too liberal or too conservative in its decisions, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows. The public is also closely divided on whether the Court is doing a good job, a view it clearly rejected in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Moreover, in two key areas, abortion and the rights of people accused of crime, the public sided with the High Court and against its critics. The survey of 1,618 adults was taken last month just after Chief Justice Warren E. Burger announced his retirement and President Reagan announced plans to solidify the conservative forces on the Court with the nominations of Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist to be Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The June 19-23 telephone poll thus preceded the Court's decisions permitting states to outlaw sodomy and striking down the central provision of the budget-balancing law, but it appeared to show a long-term trend toward support of the Court. #41% Rated Court Fair For example, the Times/CBS News Poll found that 7 percent of the public rated the Court excellent, 39 percent called it good, 41 percent graded it fair and 7 percent said it was poor. The difference between those who gave positive ratings of excellent and good and those who gave negative ratings of fair and poor did not exceed the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. But in Gallup Poll measurements of the same question from 1968 through 1973, clear majorities of 51 to 54 percent rated the Court ''fair'' or ''poor.'' When the public was asked in the Times/CBS News Poll if the Court, in general, was ''too liberal or too conservative in its decisions,'' 34 percent said ''too liberal,'' 38 percent said ''too conservative'' and 10 percent said that it was ''about right.'' In a Gallup Poll taken in July 1973, 35 percent said it was too liberal and only 26 percent said it was too conservative. Seventeen percent said it was about right. In the Times/CBS News Poll, people who said the Court's decisions were ''too liberal'' were unhappier with the Court than those who called it too conservative. Forty-two percent of those who said it was too liberal rated it excellent or good, while 57 percent rated it fair or poor. Of those who called the High Court too conservative, 47 percent called it excellent or good, while 52 percent said it was fair or poor. #1973 Groups More Critical In 1973 the same pattern had emerged, although both groups were more critical of the Court than their 1986 counterparts. The Times/CBS News Poll also found that only a third of the public said that the Supreme Court was too soft on people accused of crimes. The respondents were asked, ''Do you think the Supreme Court has gone too far in protecting the rights of people accused of crimes, or do you think it has generally done what is necessary to see that the accused are treated fairly?'' While 34 percent said the Court had gone too far to protect the accused, 51 percent said it had done the necessary and another 5 percent said it had not done enough on behalf of the accused. That question had not been asked in any previous poll. But a question about the Court and abortion, first asked by Gallup in 1974, found a modest plurality, 49 to 43 percent, saying that they favored the Court's having ''ruled that a woman may go to a doctor to end her pregnancy at any time during the first three months of pregnancy.'' In 1974, 1981, and in January of this year Gallup found the country about evenly split on the issue. HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 19 through 23 with 1,618 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers. The results have also been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans. The error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those who said the Supreme Court was too conservative or those who said it was too liberal, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RHODE ISLAND CHARTER CHANGE WOULD BAR ABORTION SUPPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/us/rhode-island-charter-change-would-bar-abortion-support.html,"Voters in this heavily Catholic state will decide in November whether the Rhode Island Constitution should include an amendment prohibiting state financing of abortion. The amendment would also prohibit abortions except to save the life of the mother, but the amendment notes that the provision would not be enforced unless the United States Supreme Court reversed its stand against most state abortion restrictions. A Governor's order currently forbids use of state money for abortions in Rhode Island. The proposed amendment was placed on the ballot by a 100-member Constitutional Convention that met from January to May. Among the 14 questions that the convention agreed to place before the voters were whether the terms for the Governor and state legislators should be extended to four years from two and whether the Legislature should get its first raise in 86 years, from a daily salary of $5 to approximately $78. #64% of Rhode Islanders Catholic The abortion question was the most controversial adopted by the convention, receiving 52 votes, one more than required for approval. About 64 percent of Rhode Islanders are Catholic. The question, the last on the ballot, asks, ''Should the state be banned from using taxes to pay for abortions; and should unborn life and handicapped and criminally ill persons be given paramount constitutional protection?'' The proposed amendment is similar to one that the Massachusetts Legislature has also placed on the November ballot. The Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberies Union has charged that the wording of the question does not make clear that the amendment would restrict almost all abortions. Groups on both sides of the issue are expected to campaign diligently. The Rhode Island constitutional gathering, the first since 1973, convened in January after voters overwhelmingly approved it in the 1984 general election. One delegate was chosen from each Congressional district in nonpartisan elections last fall. According to the Constitution, voters must be asked at least once every 10 years whether a convention should be held.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New & Noteworthy,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/books/new-noteworthy.html,"THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, by John Irving. (Bantam, $4.95.) John Irving's novel explores abortion and the relationship between a spiritual father and son -Dr. Wilbur Larch, a Maine physician who performs abortions and directs an orphanage, and the orphaned Homer Wells. Benjamin DeMott wrote in The Book Review last year that ''at its best, this novel is an example, now rare, of the courage of imaginative ardor.'' THE HUNGRY SELF: Women, Eating, and Identity, by Kim Chernin. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) Why are so many otherwise ''normal'' women obsessed with food, dieting, fat and exercise instead of wholeness and autonomy, Kim Chernin asks. Her answer is that such women are fleeing self-development and that female identity is in crisis. In 1985 our reviewer, Phyllis Chesler, found this work ''an inspired psychoanalytical meditation on contemporary female identity and eating disorders.'' But she said the author ''leans too heavily on feminist or psychoanalytic insight as a way to control self-destructive behavior.'' CARPENTER'S GOTHIC, by William Gaddis. (Elisabeth Sifton/Penguin, $6.95.) At the center of William Gaddis's third novel is the stormy marriage of the Booths - Elizabeth, an heiress, and Paul, a media consultant - who live in a Victorian house on the Hudson River, north of New York City. But ''plot is what Mr. Gaddis travesties and teases and two-times and swindles,'' our reviewer, Cynthia Ozick, wrote last year. ''It is an unholy landmark of a novel - an extra turret added on to the ample, ingenious, audacious Gothic mansion William Gaddis has slowly been building in American letters.'' NICARAGUA: Revolution in the Family, by Shirley Christian. (Vintage/Random House, $8.95.) This is an updated edition of Shirley Christian's analysis of the Nicaraguan revolution, with new material on the contras by the New York Times correspondent. ''It is marvelous to find a book that spends most of its considerable length just telling us what actually happened,'' Timothy Garton Ash said here in 1985. ''Anyone seriously interested in Nicaragua will have to read it.'' Plume/New American Library has reissued FIRE FROM THE MOUNTAIN: The Making of a Sandinista ($7.95), by Omar Cabezas, who joined the rebel front against Anastasio Somoza Debayle in the 1960's and became a Government official after the revolution. Stephen Kinzer said here last year that the book, translated by Kathleen Weaver, ''contains valuable clues for those who want to know who the Sandinistas are and how they came to power.'' JADIS, by Ken Chowder. (Penguin, $6.95.) New York's Westchester County is the setting of Ken Chowder's novel about a Shakespeare-loving toy store owner whose wife leaves him for her ice-dancing teacher. Writing in these pages last year, Monroe Engel found the work ''breezy'' and ''frequently funny,'' and he praised the author's ''charm as a storyteller and his unfailing ability to create realized events.'' THE LIFE OF RAYMOND CHANDLER, by Frank MacShane. (G. K. Hall, $8.95.) This sympathetic biography quotes extensively from Raymond Chandler's fiction, magazine articles and letters, as well as analyzing his work and, according to Leonard Michaels here in 1976, drawing ''an immensely detailed portrait of Chandler the man.'' The mystery writer emerges ''as a very powerful and psychologically interesting figure . . . shy, reclusive, lonely [ and ] garrulous.'' THE DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST, by Georges Bernanos. Translated by Pamela Morris. (Carroll & Graf, $7.95.) The narrator of this novel, written in diary form, is a young priest in a poor French parish who must struggle against his parishioners' indifference and his own sickness and self-doubt. In The Book Review in 1937, Katherine Woods said the priest ''is seen in his strength and weakness as mirror and foil and battleground for salient struggles of mankind. It is a strange and sad, yet a beautiful and triumphant, story.'' METAMAGICAL THEMAS: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern, by Douglas R. Hofstadter. (Bantam, $14.95.) This collection of essays by the author of ''Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid'' is about science as well as verbal puns and their equivalents in mathematics and computer science. The work is ''enormously ambitious and hugely interesting as a kind of repository of miscellaneous information ingeniously displayed,'' John Maddox said here in 1985. But it is also ''self-referential'' and ''self-conscious to a degree that will charm many and irritate others.'' SLOW DANCING, by Elizabeth Benedict. (McGraw-Hill, $4.95.) Lexi and Nell, college roommates from the 1970's, remain close a decade later, but their alliance takes on a new dimension when one of them becomes involved with a man. Last year our reviewer, Andrea Bar-net, found Elizabeth Benedict's first novel ''well knit'' and called it ''an unsentimental homage to a generation still struggling to grow up.'' KENNETH CLARK: A Biography, by Meryle Secrest. (Fromm International, $11.95.) Kenneth Clark (1903-1983) became director of the National Gallery in London at the age of 30 and went on to become Surveyor of the King's Pictures, an art professor at Oxford, chairman of the Independent Television Authority, author of ''Civilization,'' a knight and a life peer. In 1985 our reviewer, Jeffrey Meyers, found this biography ''lively and stylish,'' and said ''it goes well beyond Clark's two discreet memoirs and is fascinating on his background, careers and the breakdown of his marriage.'' THE LADY AND HER DOCTOR, by Evelyn Piper. (Academy Chicago, $4.95.) On a routine house call, Dr. Milton Krop finds his rich, elderly patient dead in bed and her daughter, Sloane, about to swallow a handful of pills - nearby is a suicide note confessing to her mother's poisoning. The doctor decides to cover up the incident and make a wealthy marriage with Sloane. ''This story is an exercise in accidental villainy,'' our reviewer, Kenneth Fearing, said in 1956. ''It is engrossing, as a fully explored tour de force of fine motives ending in horrendous results.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DIOXIN OF '76 ITALIAN ACCIDENT REPORTED DESTROYED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/14/us/dioxin-of-76-italian-accident-reported-destroyed.html,"Ten years after a chemical plant accident sent a white cloud of dioxin-contaminated steam and gas into the atmosphere over Seveso, Italy, public health officials in Switzerland say they have finally completed disposing of the last of the contaminated wastes. Four hundred people have recovered from burns suffered in the accident at the Icmesa plant on July 10, 1976, as have 193 who got chloracne, a skin infection. Many people who had to leave contaminated homes in the area, near Milan, have returned, officials say. And the 41 barrels of wastes contaminated with dioxin, one of the most toxic chemicals known, were incinerated at a special oven run by Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss chemical concern based in Basel. Health officials of the governments of Switzerland and the city of Basel have declared that the burning involved no further release of dioxin. Report Is Submitted on It ''The wastes contaminated by dioxin were incinerated in Basel without representing a danger either for the personnel charged with the task or the local population,'' the national and city health officials said in a report on the operation. ''It shows that organic problem wastes, including those containing significant amounts of polychlorinated dioxins and furanes, as well as their predecessor substances, can be burned without danger to humans and the environment.'' Although the incineration was finished a year ago, officials say it is still too early to say if the process used in Basel can point the way to safe burning of municipal wastes. Because of the high temperatures needed for the Seveso wastes, plus specialized testing and monitoring, experts here believe the process may be too costly for general application by municipalities, which create dioxin in the burning of regular wastes. Dr. Bruno Boehlen, head of the Swiss Office of Environmental Protection, and Dr. Hansjoerg Renk, a spokesman for the Seveso plant's parent company, the Swiss chemical combine Hoffmann-LaRoche, say the incineration has paved the way for future disposal of such substances and that one immediate result may be less stringent requirements for landfills to dispose of dioxin-contaminated material. It Drew Worldwide Attention The rupture at the Reparto B reaction vessel in 1976 at the Icmesa plant, owned by Givaudan, a subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche, drew worldwide attention, even though no one was killed and earlier chemical accidents had been judged more lethal. Officials at Hoffman-LaRoche say they believe the wide attention was due in part to photographs of young children who suffered skin burns from the highly caustic gases released in the accident. But the key issue was a lack of knowledge about dioxin, or TCDD, which is formally designated 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzopara-dioxin. This byproduct is produced at temperatures above 160 degrees centigrade in some chemical processes, such as the manufacture of 2,4,5-TCP, or trichlorophenol, which is used in herbicides. In the case of Icmesa, TCP was being produced for use in the disinfectant hexachlorophene. Givaudan, a Geneva-based company, manufactures perfume, flavorings and disinfectants. 'Enormous Strains' Created Because of the lack of knowledge about dioxin, says a separate report produced by Hoffmann-LaRoche to mark the 10th anniversary, ''the extent of the danger was difficult to assess.'' ''This uncertainty places enormous strains on people in the accident zone who, though not exhibiting any symptoms, might have come into contact with the substance,'' this report said. The contamination led to the wholescale slaughter of thousands of small domestic animals in the region as well as horses, cows and goats, and long decontamination efforts, including removal of topsoil and debris from the area. Hoffmann-LaRoche maintains that no one died as a direct result of the accident. But it notes that the Seveso production manager, Paolo Paoletti, who was one of those charged with culpability, was shot dead Feb. 5, 1980, apparently in reprisal, by terrorists who identified themselves as members of Front Line, a far-left urban guerrilla group. Nevertheless, data gathered on the effects of dioxin suggested that it is one of the most toxic man-made substances, even in minute amounts, and some exposed animals ultimately died. It was discovered that some animals were more resistant to dioxin, for example hamsters, which could withstand 10,000 times more dioxin than guinea pigs. In its report, Hoffmann-La Roche said laboratory experiments with animals found that dioxin could have both inhibiting and stimulating effects on the immune system, increase enzyme activity of the liver, and cause tumors, spontaneous abortion, fetal malformation and chloracne. But Hoffmann-LaRoche officials maintain that with the exception of chloracne, ''there is no evidence of any damage to health'' of humans from dioxin. Protests in Basel Over Barrels Still, the arrival of the 41 barrels of contaminated wastes prompted environmental protests in Basel in 1983, and the authorities supervising the disposal said they took extraordinary measures to assure that as little dioxin as possible was released in the incineration. Officials say the entire process took three years, including test burnings with constant monitoring. The actual burning, at temperatures exceeding 1,200 degrees centigrade. took 100 hours and cost more than $2.5 million. ''No or only very small amounts of dioxin were registered in exhaust fumes,'' the report said, concluding that burning such substances safely required knowledge of the composition of all the wastes involved and constant checking of the emissions. ''Problematic organic wastes, particularly those containing notable quantities of dioxin and polychlorinated furanes can thus be incinerated without presenting a risk for people or the environment.'' Public Concern Persists Still, public concern has persisted, in part because of the remaining concern about the health risks of exposure to dioxin, and the complex and time-consuming nature of the incineration. ''We would only know weeks after the test whether it had actually worked,'' said Dr. Boehlen, whose Office of Environmental Protection supervised the burning. ''This was not good for public confidence.'' ''There will still be the need for landfills, because such incinerations as the one done in Basel produce lots of slag because of the mixing of 30 tons of sand with the 2.2 tons of wastes,'' Dr. Renk said. ''This slag is only very slightly toxic. So you don't need a full-fledged toxic-waste landfill.'' But the same sort of result may not apply to dioxin created in the burning of municipal wastes. Higher Levels Are Charged ''It has been shown that the levels of dioxin that go out of some municipal waste incinerators is actually higher than those that existed during the actual dioxin incineration in Basel,'' Dr. Renk said. ''I think it is above all a question of economics, because special hazardous waste incinerators work at very high temperatures, up to 1,500 degrees centigrade, and need a lot of fuel.'' ''So the problem of dioxin from municipal wastes is not solved by this,'' he added. ''Of course, we have been concerned with our own wastes during this experience, but maybe the Government will be able to find ways and means to apply it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAFETY BOARD AIDE NAMED TO 3D TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/16/us/safety-board-aide-named-to-3d-term.html,"President Reagan today nominated Jim Burnett to serve a third two-year term as chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. The announcement ended several months of uncertainty in Congress after it was learned the White House was considering other candidates for the post. Opponents of Mr. Burnett had encouraged the White House to appoint someone who would be less of a potential adversary with the transportation industry and the Department of Transportation. Mr. Burnett, a 38-year-old former Arkansas municipal judge, has infuriated some segments of the industry, particularly railroads and airlines, with his aggressive advocacy of tougher safety regulations. His efforts at reorganizing the safety board also alienated many longtime employes. Officials of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which must approve the nomination, said his chances of winning approval appeared ''fine.'' The White House declined to explain the considerations in determining whether Mr. Burnett or someone else would be asked to head the board, which investigates air, rail and gas pipeline accidents and major highway accidents and recommends safety precautions. In April, the chairmen and ranking minority members of the House and Senate aviation subcommittees wrote Mr. Reagan urging that Mr. Burnett be reappointed, asserting that it would give him a chance to continue the ''excellent'' work he had done for transportation safety. Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt, Republican of Arkansas, said speculation was that the Department of Transportation had ''heartburn'' over Mr. Burnett. It was widely known that several divisions of the department, particularly the Federal Aviation Administration, had been unhappy with Mr. Burnett's pronouncements about aviation safety, asserting he was pushing too hard. The department said today that it had never opposed his nomination and derided public reports that it had. SCANLON CONFIRMED BY SENATE WASHINGTON, July 15 (UPI) - The Senate voted 63 to 33 today to confirm President Reagan's nomination of Terrence M. Scanlon as chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Mr. Scanlon, a conservative Democrat, received a recess appointment to the post by Mr. Reagan in December 1984 but the nomination had been held up in the Senate while the Justice Department investigated charges that he had used Federal employees and equipment to promote opposition to abortion.

Praise for the Court's Unpredictability,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/16/opinion/praise-for-the-court-s-unpredictability.html,"Once again, the Burger Court has confounded its critics. The most recent batch of cases, the last to be decided during the tenure of the retiring Chief Justice, defies ideological classification. On issues ranging from capital punishment to sodomy, press reporting of judicial proceedings to tasteless speech at high school assemblies, racial preferences in employment to the separation of Government powers in the task of budget control, the Court has produced a mosaic of decisions that no one could have predicted. Perhaps that is as it should be, a fitting valedictory for an era in which the Supreme Court managed to please neither the left nor the right, neither the politicians nor the academy. Conservative politicians' reaction to the Burger Court is especially interesting. The political right is frustrated that a Court appointed almost entirely by Republican Presidents (it has been 19 years since a Democrat named a Justice) should take a measured, complex view of such constitutional issues as religion in the public schools, abortion, affirmative action and capital punishment. Emboldened by its electoral landslide, the Administration feels it is entitled to appoint judges throughout the Federal judiciary whose decisions on these and other issues are predictably in consonance with conservative political ideology. The unpredictability of the Burger Court is, in my view, one of its greatest strengths. The constitutional tradition of the United States, a tradition virtually all political factions have a stake in preserving, was built by judges whose decisions disappointed the Presidents who appointed them. Had such Justices as John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Charles Evans Hughes been more predictable in the way they decided cases, our constitutional law would be very different than it is, and much the poorer. Of course, not all forms of unpredictability contribute to the development of a vital constitutional tradition. The political community has a right to expect from its judges some fixed points of reference in the way the Constitution is interpreted. A court would act lawlessly, for example, were it to hold at this late date that the Government lacks constitutional authority to regulate labor relations in the private sector, or that the strictures of the First Amendment limit only the Congress and not state and local governments. Both decisions could be reconciled with a literal interpretation of the constitutional text, but they would defeat settled expectations that are integral to the constitutional tradition as it has evolved. There are such things as easy cases, and a court is duty-bound to decide them in a predictable way. Virtually none of the disputes that reach the Supreme Court are easy cases. Most of them concern issues for which the sources of legal authority - constitutional text, original understanding, evolving tradition, precedent - do not yield determinate answers. Even for such cases, however, the Court's decisions ought to be predictable in certain respects. There is little to be said for a court opinion that leaves lawyers who read it confused about the basis for the judgment and thereby uncertain how to advise clients or prepare subsequent cases. Basic canons of judicial craft require a good measure of predictability regarding the narrower, more immediate legal implications of specific decisions. Beyond that, it is fair to ask of judges that their patterns of decision be reasonably coherent and consistent. Precedents that are arguably at odds with a new judgment ought to be distinguished or overruled. It may even be proper to expect that major developments in constitutional interpretation be foreshadowed somewhat in earlier cases, as was true for Brown v. Board of Education (school desegregation) and Miranda v. Arizona (confessions), but not Engel v. Vitale (school prayer) or Roe v. Wade (abortion). During the 17 years of Chief Justice Warren Burger's tenure, the Court has occasionally been guilty of judgments that were disturbingly unpredictable in one or another of the ways just described, but hardly more guilty than most previous Courts. (Modern commentators tend to forget the shortcomings of craft that characterized the Court's decisions on child labor during the 1920's or labor picketing during the 1940's.) What seems to trouble the sharpest critics of the Burger Court is a different kind of unpredictability: the difficulty of knowing in advance how the Court will resolve an issue, such as the teaching of creationism in the public schools, that may arouse political passions but for which no well established line of precedents exists, and often the difficulty of knowing how an individual Justice will think about such an issue. The quality of the Court's work would suffer were this type of unpredictability to be significantly reduced. For a predictable judge is one whose ideology makes him uninterested in original arguments, new perspectives, untidy facts. He is a judge whose major premises swamp his analysis of cases. A judge whose decisions are highly predictable is not influenced much by the unique experience of reading briefs, hearing argument on both sides of a dispute and thinking carefully about an issue with the knowledge that people will actually be affected by one's conclusion. That can be an intensely personal and absorbing experience. It can also be an enlightening experience, one that the best judges use to get beneath the surface of a case and beyond their own preconceptions. The unpredictability that results from open-mindedness is the essence of good judging. It would be a mistake to equate this praiseworthy unpredictability with the absence of vision, or with adherence to any particular set of principles regarding how the Constitution should be interpreted. Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William O. Douglas were both civil libertarians, but Justice Warren's judging was far less predictable than that of Justice Douglas. Both Justice John Marshall Harlan and current Chief Justice-designate William Rehnquist can be considered deeply conservative judges, yet Justice Harlan's decisions were notably less predictable than Justice Rehnquist's have been to date. Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor have been especially impressive in their unpredictability - they consistently produce opinions that contribute fresh thinking to the problems they address. Yet their basic instincts and preconceptions differ markedly: while both Justices can be described as moderates, Justice Stevens is far more concerned with individual rights, Justice O'Connor with states' rights. What the best judges have in common is not their preconceptions but the capacity to think past their preconceptions. Depending on electoral currents that are themselves unpredictable, the next era of the Supreme Court may be dominated by Justices who are predisposed to grant Government wide power to regulate the individual and promote majoritarian morality. In time, I am confident, the pendulum will shift and people who believe in the central importance of individual rights will again be appointed to the bench, ideally without our first having to endure the kinds of object lessons, here and abroad, that kindled the Warren Court's concern for those rights. In either type of era, the nation will be well served if the Supreme Court is staffed by men and women who are as good at thinking beyond their preconceptions, and hence as unpredictable as most of the Justices of the Burger Court have been.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CENTERS' ABORTION ADS CALLED 'BOGUS',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/16/nyregion/centers-abortion-ads-called-bogus.html,"An abortion-rights group said yesterday that a number of ''bogus clinics'' are advertising themselves as centers for women seeking abortions when their main purpose is to persuade women to continue their pregnancies. The organization, the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights, said that as many as 2,100 such centers were being operated around the country by anti-abortion groups. It said that at least five operate in New York City and Westchester County and advertise in the Nynex Yellow Pages under the heading ''Clinics.'' J. Michael Byers, the business manager for the Pearson Foundation of St. Louis, which operates more than 20 of the centers around the country, said that listing them as clinics was proper. ''We wish to encourage them to advertise anywhere if they can get the attention of the abortion-bound and save their babies from death,'' he said. ''After all she's going to get the truth, which she doesn't get at the abortuary.'' Ads in Yellow Pages Some of the local centers identified by the rights coalition run advertisements in the Yellow Pages that begin ''Are you thinking of an abortion?'' and offer free pregnancy tests, birth control information and financial assistance. The coalition, founded 10 years ago by representatives of major Protestant denominations and several Jewish organizations, said women who come to the centers are given a widely available urine test that can be performed by people who have no medical license. Such tests, if not properly verified, could mislead women into thinking they are not pregnant when they are, thus preventing them from receiving proper prenatal care or being alert to such hazardous conditions as a tubal pregnancy, the coalition said. The coalition said the centers refuse to help women get abortions, are not staffed by doctors and do not examine the women after the pregnancy tests. The centers, the coalition said, try to frighten women into forgoing abortions by presenting them with misleading statistics about the hazards of abortion and showing them slides and pamphlets with pictures of dead fetuses. What Is a Clinic? Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the New York State Health Department, said an incorporated medical center offering diagnosis and treatment must receive a license from the state. However, if a place chooses to call itself a clinic but does not offer medical services it does not require such a license, he said. Lanie Accles, a spokesman for the New York State Attorney General's office, said the office had received a number of complaints saying that some centers had been misrepresenting themselves as abortion clinics. She said the office is investigating, although she did not identify any individual centers that had been the subject of complaints. Amy Sutnik, a public information associate of Planned Parenthood of New York City, who attended the news conference and spoke of visiting two of the clinics, said they exploit women who are in an emotional crisis over unplanned pregnancies. ''They're lured into these centers and given inaccurate and unobjective information so they can't decide what's best for themselves,'' she said. The coalition identified these centers in the New York area: Options, 80 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan; Manhattan Pregnancy Services, 210 East 23d Street in Manhattan; AAA Pregnancy Problem Services at 6802 5th Avenue in Brooklyn; Crisis Pregnancy Center of New York at 322 New Dorp Lane in Staten Island, and Alternative Pregnancy Care, in Mahopac Falls, N.Y. At Options, Silvana Guido, the director, refused to let a reporter inside. She described her group as a volunteer agency that offers assistance to pregnant women and said it was absurd to accuse it of trying to deceive women. The offices of Manhattan Pregnancy Services appeared much like a pediatrician's waiting room, down to the children's tables and toys. Robert Nelson, a volunteer, said the group offers free urine tests and presents slide shows on options during pregnancy. ''We always encourage them to keep the child,'' he said. ''Abortion is the worst option a person can choose.'' Mary Elias, director of the Brooklyn center, would not consent to an interview, saying: ''We offer help to women who come in. They can take it or not take it.'' The Staten Island office was closed yesterday and there was no answer at the Mahopac Falls number. Aid From Foundation Simha Rosenberg, director of the coalition, said several of the clinics are associated with the Pearson Foundation, an organization set in 1970 by Robert J. Pearson, a home builder and Roman Catholic layman who opposes abortion. Mr. Byers said the foundation may have provided advice and manuals to people trying to set up the New York area centers. Mr. Byers contended that some abortion clinics misrepresent themselves with ambiguous titles or by promising to offer reproductive services when in fact they primarily offer abortions. Meade Arble, a spokesman at the Nynex Information Resources Company, said it does not check whether advertisers listed in the Yellow Pages as clinics offer medical services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONGRESS RATIFIES SPENDING CUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/18/us/congress-ratifies-spending-cuts.html,"Congress today overwhelmingly ratified $11.7 billion in spending cuts made earlier under the budget-balancing law. The House approved the cuts by 339 to 72, a larger margin than the Democratic leadership had expected. The Senate then approved them on a voice vote with no dissent and sent them to President Reagan. Administration officials have said Mr. Reagan will sign the bill. The $11.7 billion was cut in March from hundreds of Federal programs for 1986 under the law's automatic spending-cut mechanism. But the Supreme Court struck down this mechanism last week and ruled the cuts invalid. It stayed its order for 60 days to permit Congress to affirm the cuts and keep them in effect. Domenici Sees 'Minor Test' In striking down the automatic mechanism, the Court said it violated the Constitution's separation of powers by giving to an officer of Congress, the Controller General, executive powers to estimate, allocate and order the cuts needed to meet deficit targets. Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, a Republican, who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, was not overly optimistic about the future of the fallback provision. He said before the votes in the House and the Senate: ''It will be, at least, a minor test, and I stress minor test, as to whether the fallback will work.'' After voting to keep the spending cuts intact, the House began to debate an appropriations bill for the Commerce, State and Justice Departments that is $1 billion over the target approved in the 1987 Congressional budget resolution. But, in response to calls for some fiscal responsibility, the House tonight voted a 5 percent across-the-board cut, excluding the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The vote on this amendment was 213 to 125. The bill was approved, 269 to 66, after the House adopted an amendment on a voice vote to ban the use of Federal funds abortions in prisons. Even with the 5 percent cut, the $12.4 billion is still several hundred million dollars over the budget ceiling and reflects the continued difficulty the Congress has had in cutting the deficit, especially when popular domestic spending programs are involved. The bill provides funds for many of the domestic programs that the President has sought to terminate or cut sharply in the past five years. It also sharply reduces Mr. Reagan's request for enhanced embassy security, and would gradually eliminate the Civil Rights Commission. $17.5 Million for U.N. Earlier, the House voted a $17.5 million United States contribution to the United Nations. On voice votes, it adopted amendments to eliminate the $7.5 million contribution to the United Nations Department of Public Information. The margin in the House to reaffirm the budget cuts raised some expectations for the future of the fallback provision. Under that provision, the House and Senate have to approve the same cuts and then send the bill to the President for his signature or veto. Worry Over Political Will Mr. Domenici, among others, is worried that Congress will not have the political will to approve the cuts under the fallback provision and support efforts to repair the law by revising and restoring the automatic mechanism. The three Senate sponsors of the law are to announce on Friday a proposal that would give power over the cuts to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The proposal, according to one sponsor, Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, would include provisions to limit the discretion of the director. In the House, some leaders are saying they do not like the proposal to shift the authority to the budget office because there was no way to limit the director's discretion and keep the proposal constitutional. Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Democratic whip in the House, said some members were interested in sticking with the fallback provision. But he did suggest a new proposal that would keep the present arrangement under which the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office estimate the deficit to determine if the ceiling, $144 billion in 1987, has been breached by $10 billion or more. If it is breached, across-the-board cuts are specified. This order then goes to the Comptroller. But the Comptroller's order to the President, in this case, would not be mandatory. Instead, the President would have the option of signing it or vetoing it. Much Power Would Shift Mr. Foley acknowledged that the cuts would no longer be automatic. But he and other members said such a proposal would shift much of the political responsibility for cutting the deficit to the President. Later, Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, suggested that he might favor a temporary assignment of the automatic spending cut mechanism to the O.M.B. for this year. Then Congress could take time to create a permanent mechanism more to everyone's liking. Of the $11.7 billion in spending cuts voted last March, half came in military spending and half in nonmilitary programs, excluding Social Security and a group of programs for the poor. In the military budget, the across-the-board cut was 4.9 percent in each program, while in the nonmilitary programs, it was 4.3 percent. In addition, the 1986 cost-of-living increases for Federal and military retirees were canceled. Estimates Over Ceiling The Commerce, State and Justice Departments appropriations bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is within its budget authority ceiling of $12.9 billion for 1987. Budget authority can be used over several years. But the estimated actual spending for the fiscal year 1987 was $1.1 billion over its ceiling. With the 5 percent cut, spending is still several hundred million dollars over the ceiling, according to Representative Bill Frenzel, the Minnesota Republican who proposed the cut. Among the programs this bill supports that Mr. Reagan wanted to end are the Economic Development Administration, the Legal Services Corporation and the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention program. The bill also rejects the President's proposal to gradually eliminate the Small Business Administration Mr. Reagan's $2.8 billion request for the Department of State was cut $1.1 billion. For diplomatic security, the bill approves $227 million, which is $862 million less then Mr. Reagan wanted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RESEARCHER REPORTS SUCCESS IN TESTS TO DETECT HEMOPHILIA IN FETUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/18/us/researcher-reports-success-in-tests-to-detect-hemophilia-in-fetus.html,"A high degree of success in diagnosing hemophilia before birth by analyzing DNA was reported here today at a genetics meeting. The same method has also been used to detect those who are not hemophiliacs but carry the defective gene and are capable of passing it on to their sons, said Dr. Stylianos E. Antonarakis, of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in a report to a genetics conference at the Jackson Laboratory here. It is estimated that one in every 10,000 boys born in this country will suffer from hemophilia, the hereditary disease in which the blood fails to clot properly. Hemophilia results from a defect in the DNA in the gene that is the blueprint for making blood factor 8, one of the crucial substances in blood. Defects Found by Research Dr. Antonarakis said the diagnostic tests have only become available within the past year as new research has made clear the details of the chemical defects in the patient's DNA that result in lifelong bleeding problems in people who have the disease. New research has disclosed a remarkable number of such specific defects, all different but all producing the full severity of the hereditary blood disease. The new tests are based on scientists' ability to detect the specific mutations in the individual's DNA. He said the new tests allowed much safer and more effective testing in the fetus than had ever been possible. The medical scientist said he believed the laboratory at Johns Hopkins was the only one in the country doing prenatal testing for hemophilia. Within the past year, scientists at Johns Hopkins have found a total of 10 different mutations in the gene for blood factor 8, any one of which will cause hemophilia. He said scientists at Genentech Inc., a biotechnology company in South San Francisco, Calif., have independently found five others. Throughout life, hemophilia victims are in danger of bleeding to death from minor cuts and often suffer disabling effects from internal bleeding. The patients often need transfusions of blood factor 8 to curb bleeding. Breakthroughs in Technique In the past, fetal diagnosis has only been possible by using the technique of fetoscopy to remove enough blood from a fetus to study its ability to coagulate, Dr. Antonarakis said. The new tests, require only a small sample of DNA from fetal tissue that can be obtained by taking a sample of amniotic fluid, or by taking a sample of tissue from the exterior of the amniotic sac. Dr. Antonarakis said the tests are for families in which hemophilia has already appeared. The medical research team at Johns Hopkins has studied 84 families, about half for detection of healthy carriers of the disease, the others for diagnosis in fetuses. In some cases, he said, prospective parents who were considering abortion changed their minds when the diagnostic tests showed that the baby would not have the disease. The mutations that have been detected in the gene for blood factor 8 are of two kinds: deletions of parts of the gene and changes that substitute a single subunit of the DNA for another, thus changing the message that is encoded in its chemistry. The single subunit changes equivalent to a change in one letter of a word that would change it to a different word that has an entirely different meaning; for example, replacing an ''h'' with a ''p'' and thus changing the word from ''hill'' to ''pill.'' The molecules of DNA that serve as a person's genetic archive are made of long chains of four basic subunits repeated many times in various combinations. A single gene will contain several thousand of the subunits. The four are the relatively simple chemicals adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine. Dr. Antonarakis said scientists have discovered recently that the sequence of cytosine followed by guanine in such a chain is often particularly susceptible to mutation. Enzymes that cut the DNA strand when it encounters a sequence that contains a cytosine-guanine sequence have proved valuable in detecting the point mutations that result in hemophilia, he said. The genetics meeting here is sponsored by the Jackson Laboratory, the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation and Johns Hopkins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SOLICITOR GENERAL'S OFFICE; Tasting the Salty Air of Politics and Criticism,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/18/us/solicitor-general-s-office-tasting-the-salty-air-of-politics-and-criticism.html,"The Solicitor General's Office, an elite corps of lawyers who represent the Government in the Supreme Court, has usually been viewed as a place where law takes precedence over politics. But in the Reagan Administration, it has become a focus of intense political debate. Critics say the Administration has politicized the office, especially since Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Solicitor General Charles Fried took office last year, by aggressively urging the Court to bring the law into step with the Administration's policies and to repudiate the Court's own precedents. Former Solicitors General Archibald Cox, Erwin N. Griswold and Wade H. McCree, and some lawyers who have worked under Mr. Fried, have expressed more muted concern that the Administration's assertive posture may have damaged the special stature of the office. Mr. Fried rejects such criticisms as ''nonsense.'' He said this week that most of the critics were so hostile to the Administration's views that ''they can't bear to even have them stated.'' 'The Worst Drubbing' As support for their views, the critics cite the Court's firm rejection in the term ended last week - sometimes in unusually barbed tones - of Mr. Fried's ideologically charged arguments on issues at the heart of the Administration's political agenda. The Court handed major defeats to the Administration by reaffirming support for abortion rights and for affirmative action in the workplace and by unanimously rejecting Mr. Fried's narrow interpretation of the 1982 Voting Rights Act amendments. The past term was ''the worst drubbing the Solicitor General's Office has taken in the Supreme Court'' in many years, according to Burt Neuborne, litigation director for the American Civil Liberties Union. Bruce Fein, a constitutional specialist who supports the Administration, calls it the worst term for any Administration ''in half a century.'' Mr. Neuborne says the Administration lost cases it could have won because it acted like just ''another interest group'' and made ''politically tinged arguments that stampeded the Court's middle against them.'' Several former Justice Department lawyers made the same observation. At the center of the storm is Mr. Fried, a tall, 51-year-old native of Czechoslovakia with the scholarly demeanor of the law professor he was until last year. He attracted a heavier barrage of criticism than perhaps any other Solicitor General in modern history even before he got the job, when, as Acting Solicitor General last summer, he urged the Supreme Court in a brief to abandon its protection of abortion rights. Mr. Fried, noting that he won a respectable 71 percent of his cases this year, said that ''the clarity of our arguments'' had helped shape the long-term evolution of the law even when those arguments had not won the Court's ''triumphant embrace.'' His bitterness at any suggestion that he has subordinated legal integrity to political expediency was evident in his angry response to a gibe by Mr. Griswold, who as Dean of Harvard Law School hired him to join its faculty 25 years ago. Mr. Griswold, the Solicitor General from 1967 to 1973, had said in a televised interview that Mr. Fried's abortion brief was so contrary to the office's traditional deference to the Court that it ''apparently was filed pursuant to instructions.'' This, Mr. Fried said Monday, ''was a shameful thing for him to say.'' Today he revised himself, saying, ''I think that charge is shameful because it's false.'' Mr. Griswold, for his part, said this week that he might have been ''too hard'' in his comment. With Mr. Meese assailing the Supreme Court's decisions, the Solicitor General's Office has certainly been a hotter spot than in the past, when it was viewed as almost an appendage of the Court. Aside from bitter attacks by some ideological adversaries and more measured criticisms by some subordinates, in opinions of the Court Mr. Fried has been the target of barbed asides of a kind rarely if ever aimed at his predecessors. In a plurality opinion rejecting the Administration's broad attack on affirmative action preferences, for example, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. copiously documented the conflicts between Mr. Fried's brief and earlier Justice Department positions and said his positon ''twists the plain language'' used by Congress. Meantime, three of four top career lawyers in the office, with nearly 40 years of experience among them, resigned in the past year. Each said he had personal reasons for leaving, but colleagues say unhappiness with the Meese-Fried regime was a factor. Mr. Fried counters that ''we have a very warm and friendly office now'' and that ''the quality of the lawyers is as high as it's ever been.'' Even critics credit Mr. Fried with bringing in top-notch legal talent to fill the vacancies and filing well-crafted briefs, with a few exceptions. ''The briefs were well-reasoned,'' Mr. Neuborne said. ''The problem was that they staked out extreme positions, and if you stake out an extreme position in this Court you're going to lose because the balance of power is held by pragmatists.'' Such criticism obscures the fact that Mr. Fried has been far less aggressive in challenging existing law in his arguments to the Court than Mr. Meese has been in his public statements. On the other hand, Mr. Fried has been far less deferential to the Court than his immediate predecessor, Rex E. Lee, who avoided broad positions that the Court was clearly unprepared to accept. Mr. Lee won praise from some of Mr. Fried's critics, but was excoriated by conservative activists close to Mr. Meese for not pushing hard enough. Mr. Lee says both he and Mr. Fried are ''victims of what I think is the reality of today's world.'' That reality, he adds, is that ''you cannot be the Solicitor General of the United States and avoid one of two images - either that you're not boldly conservative enough or that you're not respectful enough of the Supreme Court.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS DELAYED A WEEK,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/19/us/supreme-court-nominations-delayed-a-week.html,"The Senate Judiciary Committee decided today to postpone confirmation hearings for President Reagan's two nominees to the Supreme Court by a week. The decision followed intense negotiations with Democrats and civil rights groups. ''Everyone would like more time for the hearings,'' said one Democrat on condition he not be identified. ''Both sides agree more time would be better.'' A hearing on the nomination of Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist to become Chief Justice had been scheduled to begin Tuesday, and a hearing on the nomination of Circuit Judge Antonin Scalia to become an Associate Justice had been scheduled to begin July 29. Each hearing was delayed a week. In exchange, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee agreed not to delay motions to bring the nominations to the Senate floor. The Democrats made no agreement about staging a filibuster once the nominations are debated. Mr. Reagan nominated Justice Rehnquist to replace Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who is retiring. The President nominated Judge Scalia, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill Justice Rehnquist's seat on the Court. Both are well known as conservative jurists. A Week of Negotiations The delay in the confirmation hearings comes after a week of negotiations involving the White House; Senate Democrats; Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and Senator Strom Thurmond, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Democrats complained they were not given enough time to investigate both nominees before confirmation hearings. The National Abortion Rights Action League said Thursday that it would campaign against the two nominees on the ground that they are committed to overturning legalized abortion. Justice Rehnquist, 61 years old, who was first appointed to the High Court by President Nixon, wrote the dissent in 1973 when the Court recognized a constitutional right to abortion. Judge Scalia, who has been on the appellate bench since 1982, has not ruled on the abortion issue as a judge. His public statements indicate that he is opposed to courts' getting involved in the question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS & TRENDS; Some Misleading Abortion Ads,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/20/weekinreview/ideas-trends-some-misleading-abortion-ads.html,"The clinic ads ask, ''Are you thinking of an abortion?'' If you are, it turns out, the clinic will not give you one. The New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights said last week that at least five centers that advertise in the Nynex Yellow Pages under the heading ''clinics'' provide no medical services except a pregnancy test that can be performed by nonprofessionals. The clinics do offer counseling -which, according to the coalition, consists of showing slides of dead fetuses and issuing misleading warnings about the hazards of abortion. A St. Louis foundation that operates more than 20 such centers defended the approach. ''We wish to encourage them to advertise anywhere if they can get the attention of the abortion-bound and save their babies from death,'' said J. Michael Byers of the Pearson Foundation. While there is no state licensing requirement for facilities that do not have medical services, a spokesman for the New York State Attorney General said the office was investigating complaints that some centers had misrepresented themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VATICAN REPORT THREATENS PRO-CHOICE NUNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/22/world/vatican-report-threatens-pro-choice-nuns.html,"The Vatican today formally threatened to take disciplinary action against two American nuns who signed an advertisement during the 1984 presidential campaign supporting the right of Roman Catholics to dissent from the church's opposition to abortion. In a statement, the Vatican office that deals with religious orders also said it had cleared an additional 25 American nuns, priests and brothers who also signed the advertisement but have since made ''public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion.'' The two nuns under threat, Sisters Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey, who work in a shelter for the homeless in Charleston, W. Va., have refused to make such a declaration. In the announcement today, the Vatican's first formal comment since the case began, Jerome Cardinal Hamer, the prefect of the Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes, appeared to be issuing a direct challenge to the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, the order to which the two nuns belong. In a statement last month, the order said it would resist a Vatican request to dismiss them. The statement criticized the two nuns for their endorsement of the advertisement, but said, ''We do not see in this action sufficient cause to initiate a process for dismissal.'' Vatican officials familiar with the case said the Cardinal's frustration over the two holdouts stemmed from their refusal to accept a form of retraction that was far milder than his office had originally sought. In addition, Cardinal Hamer and other Vatican officials have been angered by the sisters' statements that they would continue to be active in movements in favor of abortion rights. An Implied Threat The Vatican statement today said that ''the Holy See is closely following the efforts of the general government of the Notre Dame sisters with the hope that the cases of their two sisters will be resolved without having to begin formal disciplinary procedures in accord with church law.'' This was seen in the Vatican as a clear threat to carry out formal disciplinary procedures if the order did not convince Sisters Barbara and Patricia to back off their stand. Sister Elizabeth Bowyer, one of the five members of the Rome-based order's governing group, declined to comment on the case today. She said last month that the order had asked the two sisters to ''clarify their pro-choice position.'' The case of the signers of the ad, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 7, 1984, has become one of the most important tests of the Vatican's campaign to sanction clerics who publicly differ with official Church teaching. Two sentences in the advertisement were regarded as particularly offensive by the Vatican and many Roman Catholic leaders in the United States: ''Statement of recent Popes and of the Catholic hierarchy have condemned the direct termination of pre-natal life as morally wrong in all instances. There is a mistaken belief in American society that this is the only legitimate Catholic position.'' The ad also said that ''a large number'' of Catholic theologians believed that abortion ''can sometimes be a moral choice.'' Vatican officials were angered because the language went beyond the legal and political arguments over abortion and appeared to call into question the Church's firmly stated teaching that abortion is murder. Cardinal Hamer has said the statement ''was a source of confusion and even scandal to many Catholics.'' The advertisement appeared in the midst of the 1984 presidential campaign. At the time, Geraldine Ferraro, a Roman Catholic who was the Democratic nominee for vice president, was being challenged by members of the National Conference of Bishops for her stand in favor of legal abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DALLAS PROSECUTOR: 36 YEARS A LAW-AND-ORDER ICON,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/22/us/dallas-prosecutor-36-years-a-law-and-order-icon.html,"''On a death penalty case you usually don't want a juror over 60 who might die tomorrow, but you never know,'' Henry Wade said, sitting back in his chair and meditating on his own private calculus of punishments. ''I had two jurors who were 85, and one of them jumped up and threatened to whip the defense lawyer,'' said Mr. Wade, the Dallas County District Attorney. ''He gave the defendant the death penalty and showed up the next day to ask if I'd killed him yet. He wanted to save his soul for the Lord. The man was some kind of off-brand church, and he was kind of nutty on religion, but he was a good juror for us.'' There are few certainties in the legal system, but for the last 36 years the one overwhelming constant here has been the dominating presence of Henry Wade, who has served as something of a law-and-order icon since he became District Attorney in 1950. Mr. Wade's career has had some conspicuous moments in the national eye. There was the prosecution in 1964 of Jack Ruby, who killed Lee Harvey Oswald. In 1970, his office was sued by a woman who sought an abortion, and thus his name is part of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision. And there was the Lenell Geter case, ending in 1984, in which a young black engineer with no criminal background was finally freed after being given a life sentence for a robbery prosecutors later said he did not commit. But as Mr. Wade prepares to step down at the end of the year, the national recognition of his office as one of the most relentless prosecutorial machines in the country pales before Mr. Wade's status locally. Few people have defined Dallas's conservative instincts as decisively as the 71-year-old Mr. Wade. It is as hard for people here to think of the District Attorney's office without Henry Wade as it is to think of the Dallas Cowboys without Tom Landry. 'Efficient and Effective' His former chief lieutenant, Doug Mulder, said, ''It was the most efficient and effective prosecuting machine in the country.'' Some critics say it was too efficient and effective, seeking Draconian sentences and concentrating more on convictions than justice. Others, especially citing the Geter case, say it has slipped in recent years. But Mr. Mulder recently summed up the prevailing mood when he told Mr. Wade at a roast in his honor, ''Thanks for being the only legend most of us will ever know.'' Mr. Wade's incessant cigar chewing, folksy drawl and fondness for dominoes and mucking about on his 140-acre farm have given him an artfully deceiving image. Melvin Belli, who unsuccessfully defended Mr. Ruby, called Mr. Wade ''a country bumpkin.'' But the folsky manner masked a keen legal mind and a fierce competitive streak. Mr. Wade's career has been marked, at times to a point bordering on caricature, by a belief in the efficacy of punishment. As a prosecutor, he asked for the death sentence 30 times and got it 29 times. In his last court appearance, in 1973, before he restricted himself to administrative duties, he won 5,005-year prison terms for two kidnappers. Even his critics say one of Mr. Wade's achievements has been to keep the office independent locally. His first crusade in the early 1950's was against drunken drivers, and victims came from all parts of town. He says one of his proudest achievements has been keeping organized crime activity to a minimum in Dallas. But tough prosecution has not had much impact on Dallas's crime rate, where property crime has been among the highest in the nation. ''It has been a model for Texas, a solid office, an honest office, but its glory days are long gone,'' said Peter Lesser, a local defense attorney who has twice run for district attorney himself, unsuccessfully, once against Mr. Wade and once to succeed him. ''Henry Wade built a great house, but if you leave the roof alone for 36 years, it's going to leak.'' If the Geter case was Mr. Wade's most recent and least pleasant foray into the national spotlight, the Ruby prosecution is still his best known. After a gap of 23 years, the passions of the case have mellowed, and when Mr. Wade reminisces on it, he does so with a vague half-smile, as if evoking a distant, bizarre spectacle. ''There must have been 300 reporters crowding around,'' he recalled of the scene the night of the assassination of President Kennedy here Nov. 22, 1963. ''And suddenly there's Ruby,'' he said, ''yelling, 'Henry, you're wanted on the telephone.' It turned out to be a disk jockey called the Weird Beard. Ruby had called him and said he could get an exclusive interview.'' The next day, Mr. Ruby shot and killed Oswald, a crime for which Mr. Wade won a conviction and death sentence. He mused for a while on the trial and its aftermath. ''No question he had some loose cells in his brain,'' he said of Mr. Ruby, but when asked if he ever felt any sympathy for him, Mr. Wade's rueful smile immediately flicked off. ''I'm not inclined to feel sorry for any defendants in a trial,'' Henry Wade said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY: The cover of a pamphlet published by the Federalist Society; Judge Scalia's Cheerleaders,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/23/us/federalist-society-cover-pamphlet-published-federalist-society-judge-scalia-s.html,"Probably no organization in Washington is happier with the nomination of Antonin Scalia as a Justice of the Supreme Court than the Federalist Society, a group of conservative lawyers and law students. ''We are very happy with his nomination,'' said Steven G. Calabresi, a special assistant to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d who is national chairman of the group. ''He is exactly the kind of person we want on the Supreme Court.'' The Federalist Society is named after the Federalist Papers, in which Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay urged adoption of the Constitution. The group was founded in 1981 by three law students - Mr. Calabresi at Yale and Lee Liberman and David McIntosh at the University of Chicago - who were unhappy with what they saw as liberal bias in most law schools, according to Mr. Calabresi. They recruited Antonin Scalia, then a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, to be an adviser to the organization. The Federalist Society now has 70 chapters at law schools throughout the nation and lawyers' divisions in Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, for a total membership of 2,000. Since setting up a national office in Washington three years ago, the group has also become a wellspring of talent for the Reagan Administration, with many of its members, including all three of its founders, holding policy-making positions at the Justice Department, and others represented at the White House and on the Federal bench. Spreading Its Message The group organizes conservative legal symposiums at law schools throughout the nation. It also tries to get across its message through publication of books and pamphlets and by sponsoring monthly luncheons in Washington that are attended by more than 100 lawyers in the capital. Mr. Calabresi says that although the group is conservative, it does not necessarily take a unified stand on current issues. He said, for example, that the members, ranging from anti-Government libertarians to Christian fundamentalists who favor Government involvement in moral issues, would probably be split in half on the constitutionality of abortion laws and the death penalty. The group's brochure says its purpose is to reorder ''priorities within the legal system to place a premium on individual liberty, traditional values and the rule of law'' and to create ''a conservative network that extends to all levels of the legal community.'' The Federalist Society has become a potent voice for conservative legal thinking in law schools and in the Government. Mr. Calabresi says more than half the 153 Reagan-appointed Justice Department employees and all 12 assistant attorneys general are members or have spoken at Federalist Society events. ''Obviously, we do not run the Justice Department,'' Mr. Calabresi said. ''But we definitely have had an influence in terms of bringing in conservatives who otherwise would not go into Government.'' The president of the Washington chapter is Stephen J. Markman, an Assistant Attorney General in charge of legal policy, who represents the Justice Department at White House meetings to select judges for the Federal bench. ''The Federalist Society provides a good opportunity for us to get to know people who share the constitutional conservative perspective of the Attorney General and the President,'' Mr. Markman said. ''To that extent, it is helpful to the Administration in attempting to develop a conservative approach.'' A current joke among members of the Society is that as soon as a law school professor is designated as an adviser to the Society, the Reagan Administration nominates him for a Federal judgeship. It happened with Mr. Scalia at the University of Chicago, who is now on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals; Ralph Winter, a former Yale professor now on the Second Circuit, and Stephen F. Williams, a former professor at the University of Colorado now on the District of Columbia Circuit. Other sympathetic legal scholars appointed to circuit courts include Robert H. Bork, District of Columbia; Richard A. Posner and Frank Easterbrook, Seventh Circuit, and John T. Noonan Jr., Ninth Circuit. ''Scalia is one of their favorites,'' said Anthony T. Podesta, president of the American Way, a liberal constitutional watchdog organization. ''Having a set of cheerleaders strategically placed in the Administration certainly helps with appointments.'' In other parts of the Government, the group is making an impact as well. Michael J. Horowitz, former counsel to the Office of Management and the Budget, now in private practice in Washington, said he had made a point of hiring members of the organization for Government jobs while he was at the White House. ''Twenty years from now we will see our Cabinet secretaries and Federal Justices coming from the Federalist Society,'' he said. A $400,000 Budget The group's budget, funded by annual membership dues of $25 for lawyers and $5 for students and by grants from conservative foundations, doubled last year, to $400,000, with new $100,000 grants from the Sarah Scaife Foundation in Pittsburgh and the Bradley Foundation from Milwaukee. The group also received a $73,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to sponsor symposiums in Chicago and Atlanta on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. Nan Aron, executive director of the Washington Alliance for Justice, an association of public interest legal groups, criticized the Government's financial support for the conservative organization and said the Society ''seeks to change the role of the Federal courts to one that would uphold the right of the Government against the individual.'' But Mr. Calabresi said the Society upholds any individual rights that are protected by the Constitution. ''We do not think the courts should override Constitutional objectives,'' he said. ''But they should not add or subtract to its original intent, as some courts have done in the past.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRIEFING; Anti-Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/24/us/briefing-anti-abortion-bill.html,"The White House is helping frame a sweeping bill to be introduced by the Presidential aspirant Jack F. Kemp and two other members of the House. Backers expect Mr. Reagan to put his prestige behind the bill. The authors, Mr. Kemp, who represents upstate New York, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois and Vin Weber of Minnesota, all Republicans, met recently with Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, and other top aides to work out the language. The emerging bill is a direct assault on the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision upholding abortion as legal. One of the bill's three major points would be a ''finding'' by Congress that life begins at the moment of conception. Although adoption of that language would not directly affect the Roe decision, it would put the Congress on record as saying that an embryo is a person from the moment of conception. The Supreme Court has in the past been reluctant to reject findings of Congress, so the matter could have some weight when the abortion question again comes before the Court, possibly after the retirement or death of one or more of the five Justices who were in the majority on the Roe decision. A decision by the Court that a ''person'' exists from the moment of conception would probably mean not only that states could prohibit abortions, but that abortions would be illegal on their face inasmuch as they would deprive a person of life without due process of law. For the moment, the proposed legislation would permanently prohibit spending any Federal funds for abortion and ban financing for any organization that provided abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; 11 Nuns Deny Statement By Vatican on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/25/us/around-the-nation-11-nuns-deny-statement-by-vatican-on-abortion.html,"Eleven nuns who signed a 1984 advertisement saying ''a diversity of opinions regarding abortion exists among committed Catholics'' today denied a Vatican statement that they now adhere to the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on abortion. Their statement was prompted by a new threat to expel two, Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey, Sisters of Notre Dame who work in Charleston, W.Va., for refusing to publicly adhere to the church's opposition to all abortion. The 11 said they objected to using settlements in their case to ''pressure and isolate'' Sisters Ferraro and Hussey. On Monday the Vatican said it had accepted ''public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion'' from 25 priests, religious brothers and nuns who signed the Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion that appeared in the advertisement in The New York Times Oct. 7, 1984. The 11 nuns said they ''categorically denied'' making ''declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It opened ''Dear Faye'' and invited her to join ''a special group of my close friends and key advisers'' at a cost, it developed on page 3, of a $1,000 annual contribution.

Most recently, Mr. Dole battled mightily to confirm Daniel A. Manion as a Federal judge. If what Mr. Dole wanted was applause from the right, it appears to have worked. In the wake of Mr. Manion's final confirmation, the chairman of the 721 Group, part of the conservative Coalitions for America, issued a statement proclaiming Mr. Dole ''the finest Republican Senate Leader since Bob Taft.''

THE TALK OF MOSCOW; CHERNOBYL FALLOUT: APOCALYPTIC TALE AND FEAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/26/world/the-talk-of-moscow-chernobyl-fallout-apocalyptic-tale-and-fear.html,"A prominent Russian writer recently produced a tattered old Bible and with a practiced hand turned to Revelations. ''Listen,'' he said, ''this is incredible: 'And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.' '' In a dictionary, he showed the Ukrainian word for wormwood, a bitter wild herb used as a tonic in rural Russia: chernobyl. The writer, an atheist, was hardly alone in pointing out the apocalyptic reference to the star called chernobyl. With the uncanny speed common to rumor in the Soviet Union, the discovery had spread across the Soviet land, contributing to the swelling body of lore that has shaped the public consciousness of the disaster at the Chernobyl atomic power plant in the Ukraine. In the three months since an explosion ripped open the fourth reactor at the plant, Chernobyl has become an indelible part of Soviet life, whether as an inevitable topic in kitchen conversation, as a daily subject in the national press, as a source of rumor, sensation and threat, or as a direct influence on daily life. The dangers of radiation, at first played down in the press, have finally become a topic of open discussion. On July 17 the official youth league newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published a long and detailed article on the various radioactive elements and their characteristics, including the threat of cancers. At public gatherings, like the congress of the Union of Writers, it has become common to hear references to ''the grief of Chernobyl that has beset our land.'' Poems and even a novel have been published on the horror of the atom gone out of control and the heroism of those who battled the inferno through the early hours of April 26. Most of the 28 who died are being buried in a special heroes' plot in a cemetery at Mitino, a village outside Moscow. Countless vacation plans have been thrown askew by the fact that priority for rooms at resorts is given to those displaced by Chernobyl, or by fears of swimming in potentially contaminated waters. Produce at farmers' markets is treated with suspicion, and vendors with Ukrainian or Byelorussian accents are avoided. Ukrainian newspapers have written about farmers who try to avoid the radiation checks mandatory at markets, and have warned against eating currants or gooseberries in a broad area around Chernobyl. Rumors persist, despite denials in the press, about the dangers of radioactive rain or the powers of vodka, and especially cabernet wine, to flush radiation from the body. The main Ukrainian newspaper expressed ''surprise'' that ''some'' women have had abortions because of Chernobyl. Among many Russians, that passage from Revelations - also known as the Apocalypse - has touched a strong penchant for superstition in the national character, giving Chernobyl the quality of an almost supernatural disaster. The scope of the disaster has been driven home by the almost daily accounts in the press of huge projects under way to undo the consequences of Chernobyl. A Politburo report published this week reported about two billion rubles in direct damage - about $2.7 billion. But the indirect cost of the enormous struggle to seal the ruptured reactor, to safeguard water supplies, to build whole towns of new housing and to decontaminate more than 1,000 square miles of farmland and villages is incalculable. Wednesday's issue of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported work on a new town called Zeleny Mys for 10,000 Chernobyl workers, indirectly acknowledging for the first time that the settlement of Pripyat, adjacent to the power plant, has in effect been abandoned. Other papers have reported work on other, smaller new settlements. In Kiev, 7,500 apartments have been turned over to evacuees, as have 500 in Chernigov. Some 112,000 people were moved out of contaminated areas, and many remain in temporary housing and in temporary jobs. Some 310,000 children from the northern Ukraine and southern Byelorussia have been sent to summer camps, and the authorities have not yet indicated when they will start to return. Newspapers have reported that brigades of workers are transported daily from Kiev, 70 miles away, while other Chernobyl workers have been settled on river cruisers moored on the Pripyat River. The loss of electricity from Chernobyl has posed serious problems for the Ukraine. The official press agency Tass has reported that factories have been ordered to take special measures to conserve power, including staggered shifts and days off, to compensate for electricity lost because of the disaster. The authorities have pledged to have the first and second reactors back in operation by Oct. 1. But the third, sharing common generating facilities with the fourth, has been shut down for an indefinite period. Papers have reported round-the-clock work to entomb the ruptured fourth reactor in concrete and to decontaminate the station. A first stage, tunneling under the reactor and laying a concrete ''cushion,'' has already been completed. But the Soviet television said on Thursday that work on the actual concrete shell must await construction of a protective concrete barrier that would enable workers to approach closer to the highly radioactive reactor. Special remote-control bulldozers and cranes have been produced to move earth and pour concrete in areas still considered too dangerous for people. The papers have also described extensive efforts to preclude the spread of contaminated ground water or rainwater to rivers. One project under way is to drill 73 wells of up to 120 feet in depth to intercept ground water before it reaches the power plant, and to pump it into the Pripyat River. Tass reported that a special detachment of weather aircraft had been assembled to sprinkle clouds over the 18-mile danger zone with compounds that prevent rainfall. ''Within a week of the first scattering of such 'meteorological bombs,' the considerable precipitation over the 30-kilometer zone practically came to a complete stop,'' Tass said. An entire alternative water supply has been prepared for Kiev in case the Dnieper River became contaminated, Tass reported. The project included building a new pumping station to tap water from the Desna River through two four-mile-long conduits. In addition, Kiev officials reported the drilling of 58 new artesian wells around the city. Efforts to decontaminate the ground have included plans to cover large stretches around the power station with concrete. In some contaminated villages, layers of soil have been removed to special dumps and replaced with trucked-in dirt, and the Government newspaper Izvestia reported that cow dung had to be buried because it showed a propensity to absorb high levels of radioactivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RULING BY A COURT KEEPS FETUS ALIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/26/us/ruling-by-a-court-keeps-fetus-alive.html,"Caught in a dispute between the husband of a brain-dead woman and the father of her 21-week-old fetus, a hospital won a court order today to keep the woman alive so the fetus would have a chance to survive. Judge William M. Fleming Jr. of Superior Court granted University Hospital's request for an order to continue life support for Donna Piazzi, a 25-year-old Augusta woman who has been hospitalized since June 27 after an apparent drug overdose. After her brain stopped functioning, her husband, Robert Piazzi, asked hospital officials July 16 to turn off her life-support systems. But David Hadden, who says he is the father of the fetus, asked them to continue use of a respirator and intravenous feeding. Ted Clarkson, an attorney for the hospital, argued at today's hearing that ''the only fundamental right'' recognized by the Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade abortion decision is a mother's right to privacy. 'The State May Intervene' ''Tragically, Mrs. Piazzi is dead,'' he said. ''She has no more right of privacy, so it stands that the state may intervene. The state has an interest in the protection of human life.'' The state, represented by an Assistant Attorney General, David Will, asked Judge Fleming to dismiss the case, saying that the courts had no jurisdiction until the fetus could survive outside the womb. Doctors testified that Mrs. Piazzi's fetus would not reach that point for four weeks or more. After Judge Fleming granted the hospital's request for an order to maintain life support, Mr. Will said the Georgia Attorney General's office and the State Division of Family and Children Services would decide later whether to appeal. He said the state knew of no custody determination if the fetus survives. Mr. Piazzi, who concedes that he is not the father, left the Richmond County Courthouse after the 45-minute hearing without commenting. Mr. Hadden, who also attended the hearing, said only, ''Just right to life -that's what I say.'' Hospital officials issued a statement saying they were pleased with the ruling but said further comment, including details of how or when Mrs. Piazzi's might give birth, would violate a patient's right to privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
District of Columbia Barred From Spending on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/26/us/district-of-columbia-barred-from-spending-on-abortions.html,"The House has approved legislation to prohibit the use of locally raised revenue in the District of Columbia to pay for abortions, except when the life of the mother is endanged.

Before approval of the bill, the House voted to cut the District's $540.9 million appropriation by $10.8 million. Even with this cut, however, the bill is slightly over the spending ceiling set in the 1987 Congressional budget. Since 1980 the law has banned the use of Federal funds for abortions. This is the second year the House has voted also to ban the use of District income or real estate taxes for abortions.

BALLOT QUESTIONS MAY TEST DUKAKIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/us/ballot-questions-may-test-dukakis.html,"Massachusetts voters will find questions on a wide range of issues in the voting booths in November, including public financing of abortions, mandatory use of seat belts, limits on state taxing authority and hazardous waste cleanup efforts. While Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is widely expected to coast to re-election, people in political circles say the ballot questions will show whether his personal popularity carries over to his policies. Republicans have indicated that they will make issues of the more controversial ballot questions in hopes of building up opposition to Mr. Dukakis. Eight questions will appear statewide on the Nov. 4 ballot, including two proposed amendments to the state's Constitution, three proposed laws, a referendum on a current law and two non-binding questions on public policy. Additional questions will appear in different regions on such issues as the use of nuclear power. Taking Sides on Abortion A question that already is drawing some national interest is a proposed constitutional amendment that would permit the State Legislature to restrict abortions as much as Federal law permits and regulate abortion financing. The National Organization for Women and the League of Women Voters have pledged their resources to defeat that initiative, while the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston is expected to play a major role for the measure. The church also is backing a constitutional amendment that would allow the state to commit public funds to private schools. Two other questions have been pushed as campaign issues by the Republican Party. One, opposed by Mr. Dukakis, would limit state tax increases to the level of growth in total wages earned by taxpayers. The same question would eliminate by 1987 a 7.5 percent state surtax on income that was imposed by Mr. Dukakis in 1975 in his first term. The Legislature resolved this issue last year, however, when it passed its own repeal, but the State Attorney General would not permit the question to be removed from the ballot. Republicans also are identified with a ballot question that seeks to repeal a mandatory seat belt law passed in 1985. The law was drafted by the administration of the Democratic Governor as one of a series of measures Mr. Dukakis has endorsed to reduce highway fatalities. May Raise Voter Turnout Public opinion experts say the ballot questions could be the major drawing card for this year's elections. ''A lot remains to be seen in what kind of money goes into communication budgets for the campaigns and whether the questions will motivate voters to go to the polls,'' said Edward J. Reilly of KRC Research in Cambridge. ''If there are low budgets and the major factor is the gubernatorial race, we won't have a high voter turnout.'' Thomas R. Kiley, a Boston pollster and political consultant, said that even though early surveys indicate Mr. Dukakis's re-election may be a foregone conclusion, the ballot questions pose some potential problems for the Governor. ''He's not at risk, but certainly some of his policies and ideas are at risk,'' Mr. Kiley said. ''In a sense the voter has an opportunity to vote twice and perhaps register disapproval on a number of issues.'' Michael Goldman, another campaign consultant, said this could work to the Governor's advantage. ''If you wanted to show you were unhappy with Dukakis in 1978, you had to vote against him,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Now you have an initiative petition to do it. This allows voters to show approval or disapproval without voting against him. That's to Michael's advantage, obviously.'' The analysts generally agreed that if there were no ballot questions, the election would have little potential for spark. They attributed this to Mr. Dukakis's popularity, his organization and the Republicans' disorganization. The Governor has a campaign fund of more than $1 million and a high favorability rating even among Republicans. In contrast, the Republicans had no challenger for Mr. Dukakis until last week, when a former Democratic cabinet secretary, George S. Kariotis, emerged as a candidate. Mr. Kariotis has since changed his party affiliation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS & TRENDS; 2 Nuns Face Vatican Discipline,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/weekinreview/ideas-trends-2-nuns-face-vatican-discipline.html,"The Vatican, having reached settlements with most of the members of religious orders who publicly dissented from Roman Catholic teachings on abortion, turned its attention last week to two nuns who work at a center for the homeless in Charleston, W. Va. The nuns had refused to renounce a statement that abortion ''can sometimes be a moral choice.'' Now, the Vatican says, they face disciplinary procedures. The announcement by the Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes was obliquely worded but appeared to threaten the expulsion of the nuns, Sisters Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey, if their superiors could not persuade them to retract their views. Their order, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, has criticized the nuns but said it would not dismiss them. The statement at issue appeared in an advertisement published in The New York Times in 1984. Of the 97 signers, 27 were members of religious orders. Claiming support in canonical history and contemporary theology, the statement said there was ''diversity of opinion'' in the church about abortion. The other 25 nuns, priests and brothers were ''cleared,'' the Congregation said, on the basis of declarations of adherence to church doctrine on abortion. That was viewed as a retreat from the Congregation's original demand for retractions, which was criticized even in the Vatican. ''You should never threaten a punishment you cannot carry out,'' said one official. Last week, as Sisters Ferraro and Hussey held fast to their position, 11 other nuns among the signers said they had never renounced their views and accused the Vatican of using them to ''isolate'' the Charleston nuns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GAS GONE, BUT BHOPAL STILL ACHES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/world/gas-gone-but-bhopal-still-aches.html,"Quresha Bee, a 35-year-old victim of the gas leak from the Union Carbide plant here in 1984, visited a hospital for the first time in June and told a psychiatrist that she had suddenly begun experiencing strange symptoms - bouts of fear combined with breathlessness and chest pain. In the second week of July she returned to the hospital, where the doctor treating her, Santosh Kumar Tandon, said cases like Mrs. Bee's were still turning up. Psychiatric problems, the doctor said, were emerging as one of the major chronic ailments among victims, widening the magnitude of the disaster one and a half years after the gas leak killed more than 2,100 people. Medical experts in this central Indian city 375 miles south of New Delhi say exposure to methyl isocyanate, the gas that leaked, has permanently injured about 86,000 people, about one-third of them severely. A total of more than 200,000 people have been treated at the city's hospitals, most of them at the time of the gas leak in December 1984. Health officials are doing a door-to-door survey of the gas-devastated neighborhoods in Bhopal, trying to identify psychiatric cases. Dr. Tandon said one medical study had surveyed 1,400 families, of which about 15 percent had psychiatric problems. Patients' Complaints Recur ''We are getting the occasional new patient, but many of them are old ones who have been treated for more than a year but keep returning with complaints of neurotic depression and anxiety,'' he said in an interview as patients waited to see him at the clinic near the neighborhood of Jayaprakash Colony, the worst-hit area. The severity of the problems has lessened among most of the people he has seen regularly, he said. But he said there could be many with problems like Mrs. Bee's who had not even visited hospitals. He reported that the symptoms of those who were injured by the gas were different from the symptoms normally observed in psychiatric cases in Bhopal. ''Ninety percent of the cases coming to us are patients of anxiety and depression, but the depressive features are different,'' the 30-year-old doctor said. ''Here the physical complaints are exaggerated, such as fatigue, restlessness, breathlessness and headaches.'' Initially, he said, patients went to doctors for what were regarded as physical ailments. Only later were they referred to the mental health clinics. Dr. Tandon did not have a figure for the number of patients found to have psychiatric problems, as identified in the survey, which is continuing. But the proportion of cases to population studied is lower than the 22 percent found in April in a hospital-based survey reported by the Indian Council for Medical Research, the country's top medical research body. The current study is larger and includes recent information, while the council's report was based on limited studies conducted in early 1985. Stillbirths and Infant Deaths Another significant finding by doctors studying victims of Bhopal is related to the children born to gas-injured mothers. Doctors reported 56 stillbirths of a total of 2,566 births. This, they said, represents a fourfold increase over the national average. Infant deaths within a week of birth were placed at 91, or about two times the national average. The finding confirms a report issued in April by the Indian Council for Medical Research. The mortality rates are higher than those reported by the council last December for these categories. Vulluri Ramalingaswami, the council's director general, said in a recent interview that the new data are based on information that became available only after the 2,566 pregnancies ended. He and others said the number of spontaneous abortions, 355, was very high, three times the national average. Studies are continuing on the long-term effects of the gas on the surviving children. Experts' Disagreements The medical effort has been complicated, officials say, by continuing clashes between key medical figures, departmental feuds and a lack of coordination between researchers at the main hospital and others in the field. ''In any other country, perhaps, you would have had one big, new center built to treat the patients for different ailments,'' one specialist said. He added that patients were visiting different government clinics and private nursing homes. ''There is no follow-up from one place,'' the doctor said, adding that ''patients are overdosed'' because there is no single line of treatment for the victims. The doctor, who is doing research for the New Delhi-based medical council, also said patients did not always cooperate with researchers. ''They do not want to spend the whole day getting tests done,'' he said, because by doing so they will lose a day's earnings. The majority of the gas patients are poor and malnourished. This, doctors say, makes their recovery chances bleaker. The most common chronic complaints among people exposed to the gas are breathing problems and coughs. The council's survey of 85,000 people, including an unaffected control group of 20,000, found about 12,350 patients, or 19 percent of the total surveyed population, had chest-related problems caused by damage to the lungs and the respiratory system. This figure is consistent with previous reports that 10,000 to 20,000 people were experiencing such problems. Patients' Conditions Unchanged Dr. N. P. Mishra, who is studying the lung functions of 1,085 patients at Hamidia Hospital, described their condition as stable - showing ''no improvement and no deterioration.'' Dr. Mishra said his patients had shown dramatic improvement between the time of the leak and about March of last year. But since then, he said, ''there has been little improvement.'' ''Those who were heavily exposed are damaged for life,'' he said. ''Little can be done about them.'' Anwar Mohammed, who sells fruit for a living, says he needs to return to the clinics for the medicine and a checkup every week. ''For the past year, I have felt no real improvement,'' he said as he waited in the noisy corridor. ''There is this cough. It feels as if something is tearing at your throat. I can't really take deep breaths or carry heavy loads.'' But Swarj Puri, the former police chief of Bhopal who was in the gas cloud on the night of the accident, says he has noticed a visible improvement in his health. ''I guess my army background also has helped,'' said Mr. Puri, who has begun playing tennis after a long break. ''But my health is not completely normal.'' Blood and Liver Damage Apart from the usual complaints, doctors here confirmed the Indian medical council's reports of continuing long-term damage to the kidneys, the liver, blood and the nervous system. But they said that the eyesight of many gas victims has improved and that there have been no cases of blindness. Scores of patients continue to report occasional irritation of the eyes, blurred vision and conjunctivitis. Health officials are reluctant to give detailed information on the medical dimensions of the accident, apparently concerned about the possible effect such information could have on future litigation involving the Indian Government and Union Carbide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OPPOSITION TO REHNQUIST NOMINATION HARDENS AS 2 NEW WITNESSES EMERGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/us/opposition-to-rehnquist-nomination-hardens-as-2-new-witnesses-emerge.html,"Liberal opposition to the nomination of Justice William H. Rehnquist to be the 16th Chief Justice of the United States is hardening amid a flurry of renewed allegations to be aired at hearings beginning Tuesday. But most opponents concede confirmation is highly probable unless damaging new information emerges. Justice Rehnquist, 61 years old, would be the most consistent conservative to head the Court in more than 50 years, most scholars agree. Democrats on the Judiciary Committee plan to question President Reagan's nominee closely about allegations that he misled the Senate before it confirmed him in 1971 as an Associate Justice. The hearing will run through Wednesday and perhaps beyond. Harassment of Blacks Questioned The allegations center on Justice Rehnquist's denials in 1971 that he had participated in the early 1960's in Republican harassment of black and Hispanic voters in Phoenix, and that he had urged as a law clerk in 1952 that the Court uphold racial segregation of schools. Two new witnesses this week contradicted Justice Rehnquist's denial that he had participated in aggressive challenges to the qualification of black and Hispanic voters at polling places in Phoenix. Civil rights leaders and other prospective witnesses also plan to argue that Justice Rehnquist's philosophy is so hostile to civil rights and civil liberties, and so far to the right of the mainstream, that he is unfit to head the Federal judiciary. They will stress his remarkably consistent record of voting, often in solitary dissent, to uphold governmental power and reject contentions by individuals that their rights have been violated. ''Over the past three decades, he has demonstrated a marked insensitivity to the victims of discrimination,'' said Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. Predicting ''substantial opposition in the civil rights community,'' Mr. Neas said the Senate must weigh ''whether this man is an extremist on civil rights and civil liberties issues.'' But Terry Eastland, the Justice Department's top spokesman, said: ''Justice Rehnquist falls squarely within the traditional mainstream of American thinking, which says that a judge should interpret the law and apply it rather than invent it. His opponents are the ones who are at the margins, not him.'' Qualifications Are Conceded Justice Rehnquist's superior intellectual qualifications for the job are conceded even by his opponents. Despite the allegations that he misled the Senate in 1971, senators and aides said his eventual confirmation seems assured unless damaging new evidence emerges. Some moderate-to-liberal Senators who strongly disagree with Justice Rehnquist's conservative views were said to be torn between concern that he would roll back decades of constitutional law if he could and reluctance to oppose a nominee with such outstanding credentials. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary has privately notified the Justice Department that it voted unanimously to rate Justice Rehnquist ''well qualified,'' the highest of three possible ratings, an Administration official said. Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Mr. Reagan's nominee to become an Associate Justice, won the same ''well qualified'' rating from the bar association. His confirmation hearing is set to begin Aug. 5. Mr. Reagan announced the two nominations June 17, together with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's retirement, to take effect when a successor was confirmed and sworn in. Both nominees seem perfectly in step with Mr. Reagan's policies. Justice Rehnquist has strongly opposed the Court's legalization of abortion, affirmative action preferences for minority group members and busing to achieve school desegration. Supports Prayer in School He has almost always voted against women, aliens and illegitimate children who have contended they were victims of discrimination, and against criminal defendants who have charged violations of their rights. He has consistently voted against the press in libel cases and has supported school prayer and state aid to religious schools. He has strongly supported Presidential power, and in a departure from his usual deference to legislative enactments, has sought to strike down acts of Congress that he says infringe on state sovereignty. Justice Rehnquist has also been a strong supporter of the death penalty, going back to 1953, when, as a law clerk to Justice Robert H. Jackson, he wrote that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, convicted of passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, were ''fitting candidiates'' for execution. ''It is too bad that drawing and quartering has been abolished,'' his memorandum Justice Jackson added. Justice Rehnquist has voted with the majority more often than not as it has drifted jerkily to the right in recent years, and has written more than his share of important majority opinions, winning a reputation as perhaps the Court's most pungent stylist. But critics say the record shows his views on racial and sexual discrimination are less sympathetic to minority group members and women than those of any other member of the Court in recent decades. Justice Rehnquist denied, before his confirmation in 1971, statements by several voters that he had participated in the challenges of black and Hispanic voters in Phoenix. He has refused to comment further until Tuesday's hearing. But two new witnesses, including a former Federal prosecutor, have recently challenged his account. Justice Rehnquist said in a Nov. 20, 1971, letter to the Judiciary Committee that while he had participated in Republican efforts to check voter qualifications from 1958 through 1964, ''in none of these years did I personally engage in challenging the qualifications of any voters.'' He said in the letter that he strongly disapproved of ''any scattergun use of literacy challenges'' and told one Republican in 1962 to stop such ''harassment and intimidation.'' But the Rev. Snelson W. McGriff of Phoenix said in an telephone interview today that in 1964 or before he had seen a man, whom he had identified from a photograph in 1971 as William Rehnquist, challenging black voters by demanding that they read from a card. Charles W. Pine, Arizona's Democratic chairman from 1972 to 1976, said today that he expected to testify Wednesday that he had seen William Rehnquist question at least two black men waiting in line outside a polling place in 1962 or 1964. ''He strode up to them and he said in a firm voice, 'Pardon me, are you a qualified voter?' '' Mr. Pine said. When a man said yes, Mr. Pine recalled, Mr. Rehnquist asked, '' 'What proof do you have,' or words to that effect.'' Mr. Pine said this implied, falsely, that ''if you dont have credentials you can't vote,'' and it caused two black men to leave the line. Unlike Mr. McGriff, Mr. Pine did not made his account public in 1971. Another new scheduled witness is James J. Brosnahan, a San Francisco lawyer who was an assistant United States attorney in Phoenix in 1962. He said in a telephone interview that Justice Rehnquist's 1971 account ''does not comport with my recollection,'' adding, ''I have thought about Bill Rehnquist and the challenging of these black folks for a long time.'' Mr. Brosnahan said that when he went to a South Phoenix polling place that November to investigate complaints from minority group voters, ''I saw Bill Rehnquist, whom I knew.'' ''My best recollection is that he was serving as a challenger,'' Mr. Brosnahan said. ''I cannot recall exactly what he did.'' But he added, ''Some of the people he was working with on that day were aggressively challenging blacks and Hispanics by demanding that they read something.'' Mr. Brosnahan said it was legal then to challenge voters if there was reason to believe they were illiterate, but ''what they were doing was challenging a great number of people with no basis for doing it,'' in a clear effort to ''slow down the line'' and ''reduce the number of votes in these precincts.'' Mr. Brosnahan said Federal prosecutors had decided prosecution for voter harassment was not warranted. He said that one problem was that ''it was sort of like a barroom brawl,'' so there would be ''disputes about what happened.'' Memorandum Is Questioned Justice Rehnquist's 1971 account of his 1952 memorandum on school segregation has since been questioned as implausible by scholars, including Dennis Hutchinson of the University of Chicago, who is writing a biography of Justice Jackson, and others who have studied Justice Jackson's papers and other historical materials. The 1952 memorandum, initialed ''whr,'' said, ''I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by 'liberal' colleagues, but I think Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed.'' Plessy v. Ferguson was the 1896 decision establishing the doctrine that the Constitution allowed ''separate but equal'' segregated facilities. The Court overruled it in 1954 when it struck down school segregation by a unanimous vote, which Justice Jackson joined. In a December 1971 letter to the Judiciary Committee, Justice Rehnquist said the 1952 memorandum ''was prepared by me as a statement of Justice Jackson's tentative views'' and was not ''an accurate statement of my own views at the time.'' He added that ''I fully support'' the 1954 desegregation ruling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/books/in-short-fiction.html,"THE WARRIOR'S GIFT. By Mack Faith. (University of Iowa, $14.95.) Mack Faith's first novel, the winner of a 1985 Associated Writing Programs Award, is narrated by Louis, an unschooled but prescient 16-year-old. He is traveling through the Middle West in 1960 with his widowed mother, Joy, an exotic dancer who performs at carnivals; Lenny, her sinister boyfriend and manager, and Dacia, a blind black fortuneteller. Unfortunately, just as the characters and plot become credible, the author loses control of both. So many improbable things start to happen that ''The Warrior's Gift'' barely has room to announce its events, much less make sense of them. Its plot soon resembles an apocalyptic soap opera with clumsily timed revelations. The chain of unlikely events starts when Joy suddenly feels compelled to take Louis to visit her father, whom she hasn't seen in 15 years. On the way, she describes the night 16 years ago when she, her brother Louis, Dacia and Dacia's brother Mark were attacked by a gang of racists who murdered Mark, forcing the others to watch. The shock of this made Dacia lose her sight. Five pages after telling this story, Joy is murdered. Louis is imprisoned, released a week later, then befriended by Kelly, a precocious 14-year-old girl. The plot rages on, involving everything from incest to the French Resistance. Mr. Faith's book has a lot of imagination and contains some vigorous, lyrical passages about nature, dreaming and adolescent longing. ''I felt, as I had felt in my dreams lots of times, that I could spread myself on the wind and just rise and rise . . . arms spread, feeling free and powerful.'' I hope his next novel will be more disciplined and better organized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 NUNS AT EYE OF DISPUTE ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/us/2-nuns-at-eye-of-dispute-on-abortion.html,"In a hot and busy old house here each day, two Roman Catholic nuns, Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey, tell people who are poor and abused that they must stand up for their rights and fight when unjustly treated. ''If we walked away from our own fight with the church over abortion,'' asked Sister Barbara, ''how could we go on telling others to be strong and keep fighting?'' On the other side, arguing with equal fervor, is the Vatican, which says the Roman Catholic Church must speak with one voice in opposition to abortion. Vatican officials have raised the question of whether people with strongly divergent views on key theological issues have the right to call themselves Catholic nuns. The confrontation between the Vatican and the two nuns from Charleston dates to the 1984 Presidential campaign, when the sisters joined 22 other nuns in signing an advertisement arguing that there was a diversity of opinion among American Catholics on the question of abortion. The situation heated up Monday when a high Vatican official, Jerome Cardinal Hamer, singled out the two women with a threat of disciplinary action. All the others who signed the advertisement, the Cardinal said, had cleared themselves by making ''public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion.'' They Resist Pressure Sister Barbara, 42 years old, and Sister Patricia, 36, have resisted repeated Vatican pressure to sign such a declaration and, in fact, have gone beyond the position taken in the original advertisement, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 7, 1984. Not only do they support the right of others to dissent, they said; they have dissented themselves, taking the position that, as Sister Barbara put it, ''abortion can be a moral choice.'' The sisters say that their activism for abortion, as well as their challenge to the church, grew out of the work that they have done since coming five years ago to Covenant House, the center for the poor that they run just a mile from West Virginia's gold-domed Capitol. Each day, dozens of people, many of them homeless, alcoholic or sexually abused, come to the center. The sisters help them find the right services at shelters, clinics, food pantries and employment centers, and provide stopgap relief. The center has an emergency fund to help pay rent, gas and electric bills - last year it gave out nearly $32,000 - and it has hot showers and machines for washing and drying clothing. In a time that West Virginia is experiencing an 8.8 percent unemployment rate and suffering from the effects of the Southeastern drought, the center has been particularly busy, helping 60 to 100 people a day. Both nuns earn $16,000 a year for their work at Covenant House, which is run by 27 churches and temples in the Charleston area. Both send $500 a month to the provincial houses of their order, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. Not Stereotypical The two women quickly dispell the old stereotype of Catholic nuns in habits who go about their business in a manner submissive to their superiors and stern with their charges. Sister Patricia favors slacks, and Sister Barbara lively patterned skirts. There is no door to the office they share, and a conversation with them is often interrupted by calls out the open bay window to passers-by. ''Hi, Rodger,'' Sister Patricia sang out, ''how's the new apartment?'' ''Coming along, coming along,'' said Rodger Wood. With the help of the nuns, Mr. Wood, a 48-year-old who had been homeless, was matched with a roommate and given an apartment to live in. He still stops by Covenant House regularly to look for part-time work, do his laundry or help out with chores. ''I'm Catholic,'' said Mr. Wood, ''and I don't like abortion either. But the church is more than abortion. The Pope and the bishops and the cardinals don't know what's going on here. If they'd spend a couple of days here, I think it might open their eyes a little.'' #11 Others Back Them The women said they drew strength from the support of many of the people they work with, as well as from a statement issued on Thursday from 11 of the other nuns who signed the 1984 advertisement. The nuns asserted that Cardinal Hamer had misrepresented their stands on abortion in an attempt to ''pressure and isolate'' the two Charleston nuns. The exact nature of the statements by the 22 other nuns is not fully known because some of the cases were closed ''internally'' by the nuns' religious orders. Six nuns from the Sisters of Loretto in Denver have said that they signed a statement that ''human life is sacred and inviolable.'' It was not meant, one of the Denver sisters said, to retract her stand in favor of the right of a woman to choose abortion. The sisters said it would be ''very painful'' to be forcibly separated from their religous order. But they said that they expected to continue to run Covenant House if that happened. The sisters were asked why they stayed in a church with which they so forcefully diagreed. ''The church for me is larger than the hierarchy,'' said Sister Patricia. ''The church is a community of faith believers that believes in justice. And this is the church that is real and good and alive.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDY VIEWS REAGAN LEGACY DIMLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/29/us/study-views-reagan-legacy-dimly.html,"A four-year nonpartisan project evaluating the domestic record of the Reagan Administration has produced a final volume suggesting that part of its legacy may be a faltering economy, growing divisions on religious issues and confusion in both political parties. The book also says that while President Reagan brought about a dramatic change in the role of government in Americans' lives, the Reagan years have actually seen growing agreement on the principles that underlay Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The assessment is contained in ''Perspectives on the Reagan Years,'' to be published in September by the Urban Institute, a private, Washington-based research organization. The book is part of the institute's Changing Domestic Priorities project, set up in 1982 to make a ''rigorous and impartial'' assessment of the changes Mr. Reagan sought in the Government. The findings, published in 25 volumes, have been one of the chief sources for political scientists, historians and journalists in judging what has and has not been accomplished. William Gorham, head of the institute, said the intent of the new and final volume was ''to place the policy debate in the larger historical context of America's evolving public purposes and to provide an interpretation of where the nation seems to be going.'' ''The concern is less with the Reagan Administration per se than with the contribution of the Reagan years to the enduring realities of American public life,'' he said. The authors, nine scholars involved in research on Reagan Administration initiatives, were asked to ''stand as far back from very recent history as the short passage of time would permit and assess the probable significance of this history for the future.'' John L. Palmer, co-director of the Changing Domestic Priorities project, said in the final chapter synthesizing and adding to the views of the others that there was agreement that, rather than turning back the advances in social programs of the past 50 years, ''the Reagan Administration has thus far served primarily to consolidate the public philosophy that emerged in the New Deal and post-New Deal years insofar as Americans have sorted out the role of the government in the formation and maintenance of our public values.'' ''We have accepted the idea that the government owes an assurance of economic stability to the middle class and, somewhat more doubtfully, we have validated the notion of a 'safety net' for the most dependent of our people,'' he wrote. ''Behind all the sound and fury about values, all that Americans have managed to agree on is just about what we agreed on in the Depression - that is, arguments about principles must bow to economic expediency.'' It was not just that Congress refused to go along with many of the President's proposed cuts in domestic programs, according to Richard P. Nathan, professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University, who headed a separate study of changes in Federal aid; Mr. Reagan's appointees used administrative means to dismantle much of the Federal domestic apparatus, he wrote. But the state and local governments then moved in, he said, increased their spending and thus maintained many of the programs in housing, health care, welfare and other areas that the Reagan Administration opposed not simply for the purpose of transferring authority to the states but also on ideological grounds. ''Ronald Reagan has been an effective leader in Washington in putting his stamp on the domestic policies of the U.S. national Government,'' Mr. Nathan concluded. ''But in a real sense his stamp appears to have been canceled - not fully but partially - by state and local policies and actions.'' Leadership and Respect The authors gave Mr. Reagan high marks on leadership and restoring public respect in the Presidency but faulted him as using his leadership ability to make people ''feel good'' rather than to acquaint them with the ''harsh realities'' they might face. Isabel V. Sawhill, co-director of the research project, said the effort to restore prosperity through tax cuts had been put into effect with no evidence that it would work. She said inflation has not been eliminated but ''only suppressed'' while productivity growth had not increased. ''In short, the problems of inflation, unemployment and a disappointing rate of productivity growth remain,'' she wrote. ''The flirtation with supply-side economics, concern about the resulting deficits, and an unusually fierce ideological debate have simply diverted people's attention from these more fundamental problems. The nation is no nearer to solutions.'' Administration officials take issue with this view, saying lasting improvements have been made, and the authors agree there has been real value in the restoration of self-confidence among Americans under the Reagan leadership. Yet they keep returning to the condition the country may find itself in after Mr. Reagan leaves office and to his place in history. 'Neglect and Hypocrisy' ''Reaganism urges Americans to dream dreams, but these are necessarily dreams of private advantage, not public accomplishment,'' wrote Hugh Heclo, professor of government at Harvard. ''Any ideology of negative government is likely to fall prey in the history books to collective tasks left undone, and an ideology that simultaneously reasserts public moralism is especially vunerable to charges of both neglect and hypocrisy. Will President Reagan, whatever might be said about his luck, escape the judgment of having presided over a period when America marked time and stored up problems for the future?'' Nathan Glazer, professor of education and sociology at Harvard, takes issue with the conclusions of some political analysts that the coalition of interests Mr. Reagan put together will fall apart when he leaves the White House, leading to a decline in the influence of the fundamentalist Christian right, with its emphasis on such social issues as support for prayer in the schools and opposition to abortion and busing for school desegregation. ''I believe the coalition will hold and the fundamentalist conservative element will continue to participate actively in it,'' he wrote. ''It brings to the Republican coalition a kind of strength it has not had for 60 years. Through the social agenda it reaches into low-income and low status occupation groups, and in particular into the South.'' Blurring Political Lines Mr. Palmer, in his summary, said he found the divisions within the Republican coalition ''deeply disturbing.'' He said that although ''the corporations and the Yuppies more often than not do support the President without any particular reference to religious convictions, the evangelical moralists stand alone with the President in asserting God's blessing over American free enterprise.'' He said it was disturbing because in the past religion has provided the cohesion for the founding and holding together of American democracy. But now the split between evangelicals and mainstream denominations is ''testament to the absolute incoherence of our public dialogue about values.'' ''The only thing that most of us seem to be able to agree about right now is that every American has a right to enrich himself as best he can, within the rules of the game - and that, toward the end of enrichment, there should be fewer rules,'' Mr. Palmer said. Looking to the future of the political parties, Mr. Palmer said the liberal Democrats were dominant for so long that ''they still cling, however discordantly, to notions of 'civic virtue' and 'collective good,' and refuse to admit the possibility that virtue and good might sometimes be incompatible with economic prosperity.'' Conservative Republicans, he said, ''cling to the notion of economic liberty and do not want to admit the possibility that liberty alone leaves Americans with no basis whatsoever for public agreement on moral values.'' ''We are back to the Founding Fathers,'' he concluded, ''but with a difference: the glue - the religious conviction that gave the confidence - is gone.''

Haveman, professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin; Jack A. Meyer, president of New Directions for Policy, a research concern, and Barbara Wolfe, associate professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin.

WILENTZ REAPPOINTMENT CLEARED BY JERSEY PANEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/30/nyregion/wilentz-reappointment-cleared-by-jersey-panel.html,"The State Senate Judiciary Committee today released the nomination of Robert N. Wilentz to continue as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court. The action was taken after two days of hearings that were dominated by a debate over whether Mr. Wilentz lived in New Jersey or New York. The nomination now goes to the full 40-member Senate, which is to vote Thursday. If Mr. Wilentz is confirmed, as expected, the 59-year-old Chief Justice would have tenure until the age of 70. Mr. Wilentz, who has an apartment in Perth Amboy and a home in Deal on the Jersey Shore, also has an apartment in Manhattan, where he has stayed virtually every night since October 1984, when his wife, Jacqueline, began undergoing chemotherapy for cancer in New York City. Mr. Wilentz said he hoped to be able to resume his former routine of staying in his Perth Amboy apartment five nights a week and visiting the Manhattan apartment only on weekends, if his wife's condition continues to improve. She has begun a new regimen using hormone pills instead of chemotherapy, he said. Children in New York Schools The couple sold their house in Perth Amboy and purchased the New York apartment in 1971 so they could be nearer to their three children, who were attending schools in New York. Mr. Wilentz said that although he had residences in both states, he was ''domiciled'' solely in New Jersey. He said that he voted and paid his taxes from his 166 Water Street address in Perth Amboy and that he considered New Jersey his home. The question of residency was the one issue that formed the basis for the decisions of the 11 committee members, all of whom praised Mr. Wilentz's integrity, competence and candor during the hearing. The vote to release the nomination was 9 to 2, with Senators John H. Dorsey, Republican of Boonton, and Raymond J. Zane, Democrat of Woodbury, casting negative votes because, they said, they believed Mr. Wilentz was a New York resident. Mr. Dorsey has also been a leading critic of the court under Mr. Wilentz's leadership because, he said, it has usurped the policy-making role that properly belongs to the Legislature. ''The great activism of the court pits the judiciary against the Legislature and the Legislature against the judiciary,'' he said. Mr. Wilentz was supported by the New Jersey Bar Association and opposed by the New Jersey Right to Life Committee for some of the court's decisions, including one allowing the financing of abortions through Medicaid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contradictions,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/31/opinion/contradictions.html,"When the Supreme Court recently upheld the right of the states to regulate private sexual conduct, it inflamed people who believe in privacy, gratified people who dislike homosexuals - and gave new force to some striking contradictions in American attitudes. These can be framed as questions: Why is it that the people most outraged when government puts its hand in your pocket for taxes are often the people quickest to applaud when government sticks its nose into your bedroom? Why is it that the people who believe most fiercely in capital punishment are often the same people who, proclaiming the right to life, most bitterly oppose abortion? Why is it that the people most opposed to giving welfare assistance to distraught young mothers are often those who fight hardest against providing sex education and contraception to poor teen-agers? The answer in each case is that these may not be contradictions at all. For what they demonstrate best is not inconsistency about life but consistency about punishment. In this view, crime absolutely must not pay. The state should kill murderers, no matter that, oh dear, it sometimes kills the wrong man. Sin must not pay. The careless teen-age girl should bear the badge and burden of her shame, no matter how little she really knows about sex and no matter how incapable she, a child, is of raising a baby. To those of this Puritan persuasion, government has a sober duty. Far from getting off people's backs, it should impose a strict moral harness. Others of us are left to believe that it is barbarous for the state, prone to error, to kill. We are left to believe - to know - that thousands of babies are conceived out of pathetic ignorance or a misguided hunger to be taken seriously. And when it comes to sexual conduct between consenting adults in their own homes - well, if that's not privacy, what is? Government often must legislate and enforce morality, but whenever it does, it tilts inescapably toward conformity and vengeance. Yet when the very definition of life, liberty and happiness is in dispute, it is government's duty to tilt instead toward diversity and compassion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW YORK IRISH GRASP NEW IMAGE AND POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/01/nyregion/new-york-irish-grasp-new-image-and-power.html,"For some time now, it has been the fashion to offer last hurrahs for New York's Irish-American community. When they emigrated from the city to the suburbs in the 1950's, when they moved out of the working class and the Democratic Party, when they lost control of City Hall and the telephone company, when the prizefighters and crooners and writers were no longer Irish, it was said that the group was heading for bland assimilation. But the hurrah may be more lasting than last. It is true, as the Irish joke goes, that it is easier to be canonized now than to find a Celt on the Board of Estimate or in a citywide office. But from the ashes of the power the Irish held in New York City when they made up a quarter of its population -now only 9 percent claim that heritage from at least one parent - Irish politicians have emerged as a statewide force. Even as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan continues the traditional Irish-Democratic Party alliance, the state's Republican slate this year has been dubbed ''the other St. Patrick's Day parade.'' After Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the lineup consists of four Irish-Catholic politicians from the city's suburbs and upstate with the names O'Rourke, Kavanagh, King and Regan. As the classic image of the New York Irish fades - the Tammany pols and priests and judges, the cops and chambermaids who have become part of American folklore - another one is taking its place. There has been assimilation, but the Irish identity continues to burn strong. There is fresh interest - a sort of designer ethnicity - developing among generations whose success has wiped out the memory of the ''No Irish Need Apply'' signs in the windows of New York businesses. And there is a fresh wave of thousands of immigrants from the old country - mostly illegal - who are escaping the 17 percent unemployment rate in Ireland and reviving the old Irish neighborhoods and bars and sporting events in the North Bronx and Queens. The brighter shade of green in the state's ethnic mosaic is apparent in several other areas: the popularity of Irish weekends at Catskills hotels, where corned beef and cabbage and ''Erin Go Bragh'' potato pancakes replace kreplach and latkes; the renewed interest in Irish crafts, music and history; the increased subscription of New York's Irish newspaper, The Echo; the success of the city's sleek new magazine, Irish America, and the current popularity of Irish names for infants. In Some Ways, 'More Irish Than Ever' ''Fifty years ago, there were priests who wouldn't baptize a baby Brigid because it was identified with an illiterate kitchen maid,'' said the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the author and research associate at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. ''Now, it's a fashionable name.'' Indeed, the New York State Health Department reports that Sean, Kevin, Ryan, Megan and Kelly all made its list of the most popular baby names this year for the first time. ''The American Irish after three or four generations may have lost their Irish traits, but in other respects they are more Irish than ever,'' said Father Greeley. ''Nobody is astonished that Jews can become very successful in America and still maintain a Jewish subculture,'' he said. ''I don't think it should come as any particular surprise that Irish and Italians manage to do the same thing.'' There has been a decline in influence in some institutions and some areas, but a rise in influence in others. The state's Irish-American legislators and lobby showed a surprising amount of clout recently when they argued passionately and successfully - despite the opposition of Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader - for a bill setting standards for investing state money in companies doing business in Northern Ireland. New York was the first state to pass such a bill, aimed at preventing discrimination against Catholics, who are in the minority in Northern Ireland, ''We have a history of kicking each other in the shins as Irish Americans,'' said Assemblyman John C. Dearie, the Bronx Democrat who wrote the bill. ''But we need to think about Ireland on the 364 days a year when there isn't a parade and bagpipes.'' The Legislature also passed an appropriation of $50,000 to establish an Irish-American museum in the state. It is telling, too, that Governor Cuomo has met twice in the last month with Irish-American groups - once addressing the national convention of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in Buffalo and again with Irish-American leaders in City Hall here. John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, by speaking out in opposition to abortion and on other issues, has certainly bolstered the influence of the church in the affairs of the city. New Roles in Society Bring a New Ethnicity If there are fewer policemen in New York who have Irish names, there are more stockbrokers who do. The police commissioner is no longer Robert J. McGuire, but the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange is John J. Phelan Jr. ''Twenty years ago, if an Irishman had a daughter who was a stenographer he thought he was doing pretty good,'' said Paul O'Dwyer, a lawyer and former City Council President. ''Now, the young Irish-Americans want to get into the yuppie class. Some of my own grandchildren, even!'' Dr. Kevin M. Cahill, the president general of the Irish Historical Society, said he thinks the stereotypes are slowly being set aside. ''People always thought of the Irish as drinking beer or playing the pipes,'' he said. ''But now they are seeing people of Irish extraction in surprising areas -from ballerinas at the American Ballet Theater to singers at the Metropolitan Opera.'' Yet, Father Greeley said, his studies show continuity rather than change among the Irish. ''They are still disproportionately Catholic,'' he said. ''They still choose careers in law and government service. They are still more interested in history than psychology. They still enjoy politics, but it is now more often the politics of the foreign service than the politics of the precinct. They still have big drinking problems and they still produce strong women.'' Father Greeley sees much of this new ethnicity as a self-conscious imitation of ancestors. ''In American society, particularly in New York,'' he said, ''everybody has to be somebody.'' Tommy Makem, the Irish troubadour who has been performing in New York for 30 years, notes that he has been getting more reaction at his East Side bar in the last three years than ever before. ''A wonderful number of people speak to me after performances about Gaelic lessons and books to read by writers from Ireland and music,'' he said. But a few tribal purists, like Sean Walsh, a Bronx lawyer who is on the board of the Irish Art Center, dismiss much of the interest as ''faddish.'' ''We've married Italian girls and moved to the suburbs,'' he said scornfully. ''This new ethnicity is horribly inauthentic, only shades removed from green hats, green bagels and green beer. Not the stuff of nationhood.'' Eoin McKiernan of the Irish Cultural Institute in St. Paul also prods the group to be more serious about protecting its heritage, saying they have fallen behind the Jews, Poles and Italians in this regard. ''What's with the Irish?'' Mr. McKiernan writes in the July issue of Irish-America. ''Where are their libraries, education center, art collections, research facilities and foundations? On what scale do Irish Americans promote or sponsor Irish cultural programming?'' William V. Shannon, a professor of history at Boston University and a former United States Ambassador to Ireland, agreed that much of the current renaissance is superficial. ''People like to give their child a very Irish name and drink Bailey's Irish Cream and buy Waterford crystal,'' Mr. Shannon said. ''But they don't act on the American scene as Irish anymore, voting for or against someone because they're Irish. And there is no greater involvement among the majority of American Irish in the problems in Northern Ireland.'' The Revival Is Carried By a New Green Wave But the Irish pool in the city may benefit from a new green wave of immigrants. The Central Statistics Office in Dublin issued a preliminary report saying that 30,000 people left the country from April 1985 to April 1986. The year before, 20,000 left. Authorities on Irish culture here estimate that between 10,000 and 15,000 of them have settled in New York. ''The Irish are flocking to New York illegally,'' said Mr. Shannon. ''If immigration officials made it possible, there would be a new Ireland rising in New York in the coming decade. But they can't rejuvenate the Irish in politics if they can't vote for themselves.'' But the new immigrants, better educated than their forbears, have revived several Irish neighborhoods and bars, as well as the Sunday football and hurling games in Gaelic Park, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Legal immigration from Ireland is limited to 500 people a year. Some politicians, including Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. in the House of Representatives, have proposed raising the limit to 4,500. But even if the crop of newcomers are legalized, they are not likely to go into politics. ''It's not necessary for the Irish to enter politics now because they're not being kicked around any more,'' Mr. O'Dwyer said. ''They can find expression in areas previously closed to them.'' The Irish arrived in New York with no mercantile tradition and with little experience in owning property or administering important affairs. Their character, Mr. Shannon said, was carved from ''centuries of military defeats, exploitation by the English during the 17th and 18th centuries, and condescension by the ruling Anglo-Irish ascendancy families in the 19th century.'' But, as they have moved into areas such as advertising, insurance, public relations, television and salesmanship, where skills in writing and talking are important, they are also developing their own business tradition. Irish names pepper the list of heads of Fortune 500 companies, and an analysis by Father Greeley at the National Opinion Research Center last year showed that Irish-Catholic families were second only to Jewish families in average income and in educational attainments. ''The days in which there was significant prejudice against the Irish in terms of country clubs, banks and the like is pretty much over,'' said George Sternlieb, director of the Rutgers Center for Policy Research. ''They're welcome to the executive suite if they can make it.'' From the Mainstream, A New Influence If the younger Irish-Americans no longer entertain feelings of inferiority to the ''WASP establishment,'' as Mr. O'Dwyer claims, they also do not seem to be producing the artists that the race is famous for - the Eugene O'Neills and Brendan Behans and George M. Cohans who once inspired the New York theatrical and literary worlds. ''Genius is turned out by a sense of hunger,'' said Mr. O'Dwyer. ''Living off the fat of the land doesn't produce much creative writing and the like.'' The Irish influence is more private now and their values are more mainstream. ''There's a certain forgetfulness of their own past and their own sufferings,'' said Mr. O'Dwyer. ''Many Irish-Americans are less sensitive to the problems of today's minorities than they should be. President Reagan, for instance, claims he's a shamrock boy but he makes cutbacks to the poor.'' Many leaders in the Irish community in New York have a benign attitude toward the way their role in the ethnic mosaic is evolving. ''We should feel happy that we've graced all the other races with our bloodlines,'' said J. Pat Burns, the first vice president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association in the city. He said he counts several friends on the force who have Irish mothers but Italian surnames as Irish. ''The Irish had their swing at running the place and now they've moved on to bigger and better things,'' said Bill Burke, the senior vice president of the Bank of Ireland. Robert F. Wagner, who counts himself as the last Irish mayor of New York City because his mother was Margaret McTague from Jersey City, said he feels little nostalgia. ''I think it hurts the city that they haven't the brains of the Irish to meet some of these problems we have here today,'' Mr. Wagner, who was Mayor from 1954 to 1965, said. ''But for people coming from a small country over there in Europe to be such an influence throughout the world, well, I think we've done pretty darn well.'' Like Mr. Wagner, many Irish say they look back fondly at the days when the political trinity of New York was so staunchly Irish, Catholic and Democratic that when a Tammany Hall ward heeler told his boss that a politician named O'Brien had turned Republican, the boss snapped: ''That's a lie. I saw him at mass last Sunday.'' The roster of Brooklyn district leaders will never again be read - as Mayor Abraham D. Beame did once in a speech at the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick dinner - as an Irish lyric: ''Bill Heffernan, Fogarty, Madden and Lacey, Sharkey and Ryan, Kelly and Casey. Whitty, Walsh, Curan and Cunningham, Sinnott, Gleason and Brown and Bannigan, Nolan, Malone, Powers and Quinn, and Lantry, Walsh and Heffernan (Jim).'' The Brooklyn leadership roster now reads: Anthony Genovesi, Minucci and Finney, Garson, Golden, Gold and Gill, Messina and Aquila, Cohn and DeLeon, Barbaro and Santo, Lupka and Aquila and Ragusa, Plotnick, Arberman, Feigenbaum and Hightower, Vann and Rosenfeld (Rabbi). And to the Irish, it has its own sort of melting pot poetry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/03/books/in-short-fiction.html,"HARNESSING PEACOCKS. By Mary Wesley. (Scribners, $16.95.) Mary Wesley's sly romantic comedy is such a good read that it is sure to attract new fans, as well as satisfy her old ones. This English author, who published her first novel at 70, once again defies stereotypes. Her writing is immediate, her people distinctly contemporary, from whatever generation, and all are frankly sexual. When beautiful, 19-year-old Hebe Rutter discovers she is pregnant, she runs away rather than submit to the abortion insisted on by her upper-class family. Twelve years later, Hebe is living solo in a small Cornwall town, on a street she deplores for its ugliness but likes for its difference from what her family would approve of. The focus of her life now is her son, Silas, whom she supports by maintaining two entirely separate part-time careers, one as a cook, the other as a prostitute. Her rates are high and Silas goes to a private school. But when Silas, confused by his mysterious origins, decides his mother must be ''a Hermaphrodite,'' and when a stranger who catches sight of Hebe seems to know who she is, the threads of Hebe's life begin to en-tangle. It turns out that every one of the original, clever people in her world is connected, by blood or through love, to at least one other. Even as all the mysteries are finally brought to light, Hebe remains an unflappable heroine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONSTITUTION TERMED A SYMBOL OF UNITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/03/nyregion/l-constitution-termed-a-symbol-of-unity-350886.html,"Adam Charnes's letter (June 15) was headed ''Scare Tactics.'' It was referring to the article ''The Constitution Is in Danger,'' and he claimed that scare tactics and not facts were used by the writer. Changing the Constitution could have ''scary'' repercussions. Almost every nation has something that symbolizes its national unity, a kind of rallying point that brings all elements of society together. The United States, with its many ethnic backgrounds living in a great democracy with a document that we cherish, our Constitution, is a fine example. Our Constitution reflects the diversity and pluralism of the American people. It represents the enduring character of our democracy. Enduring, but flexible. It can change with, though not necessarily for, the times. It can change in spirit - as a result of a new interpretation - and it can change in letter through outright amendment. Today, this country stands on the threshold of a second convention under the impetus of right-wing groups that want to make the Constitution conform to its fiscal, social and political biases. There are many American constitutional authorities who believe that this drive to make these changes in our Constitution represents a clear and present danger to the health of our 210-year-old democracy. To date, 32 states have petitioned Congress for a convention pushing for a balanced Federal budget. New Jersey and Kentucky will be targeted to join those other states. Meanwhile, Congress is being petitioned for other subjects; school prayer and the outlawing of abortion. Changes in our Constitution will agitate the public mind, and no doubt contain insidious views that are not in the best interest for the majority of people.

TV VIEW; WHY SOME OLD SHOWS NEVER FADE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/03/arts/tv-view-why-some-old-shows-never-fade.html,"Why do some television series linger on in syndication year after year, resisting a final interment? There is no single reason. Some of the old series were huge hits when first shown in prime time; others barely made it. Some were wonderfully well produced; others were downright tacky. There is not much to connect ''Star Trek,'' say, with ''Gilligan's Island,'' or ''The Honeymooners'' with ''Lost in Space.'' At some level, however, they have all become imbedded in the popular culture, even if scarcely an adult can be found who will ever admit to watching anything as vacuous as ''Gilligan's Island.'' Old series that endure and become much loved have no common denominator save one: They all wear remarkably well. At the same time, some of the great hits of yesteryear do not wear at all. ''Laugh In'' was a national phenomenon from 1968 to 1973; no one would watch it today. Its humor was topical, and nothing on television dies more quickly than a topical joke. Comedy is comedy, but a joke is only a joke, and ''The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,'' considered politically daring and sophisticated in the late 1960's, would not interest anyone now. Indeed, it is a rule in television that last season's daring is this season's yawn. Who now would bother to tune in once again to find out if Bea Arthur's Maude would really undergo an abortion? The other thing that does not wear well on television is violence. It is true that old police shows linger, but there is hardly one that can be called much loved. Their appeal is fleeting. ''Starsky and Hutch,'' ''Kojak,'' ''Baretta'' and a dozen other old police series are shown now for no other reason than logistics: They help to fill air time. Few have achieved real distinction, and fans do not memorize passages of dialogue and exchange pieces of trivia about the series. The only exception here may be ''The Untouchables,'' which was first shown on ABC in 1959 and may stay in reruns forever. The background, 1930's Chicago, is terrific; it gives us information to collect: Eliot Ness's office was in the Federal Building and the room number was 208. Otherwise, violence is not enduring; neither are the accouterments that accompany each new season's violence. ''Miami Vice'' may be artfully filmed, but it is likely that we will still be watching Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko long after we have forgotten which detective on ''Miami Vice'' was Crockett and which was Tubbs. A series that bases part of its appeal on the actors' wardrobes is not made for the ages. Fashions change. ''Miami Vice'' is part of a disposable culture. Which brings us back to the question: Why do some series linger? The answer seems to have something to do with amiability. ''Gilligan's Island,'' first seen in 1964, may indeed be the dumbest series ever to be successful in prime time; some critics have called it just that. On the other hand, it is non-taxing, and one of television's legitimate functions, although not often recognized, is to kill time as painlessly as possible. ''Gilligan's Island'' attracts no cult, but it is possibly the best program in the world to watch if you are, say, at home and alone and miserable with the flu. Consider other series that now seem to be part of the culture. Virtually every one, even if not intended as comedy, possesses the amiability factor at least to some degree. Episodes of ''Star Trek'' conclude, as often as not, with Kirk, Spock and McCoy celebrating their friendship. Indeed, most shows that endure celebrate friendship one way or another; partnerships are extolled. Even Gilligan had the Skipper. Think of Felix and Oscar in ''The Odd Couple''; Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 in ''Get Smart,'' and Hawkeye and Trapper John, or B.J., his successor, in ''M*A*S*H.'' ''M*A*S*H'' has often been called television's most imaginative call for peace. Solemn nonsense has been written about this. The real subject of ''M*A*S*H'' is camaraderie in wartime. To be sure, other factors make a series endure: superior writing, for one; imaginative casting, for another. ''Get Smart,'' with Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as Maxwell Smart and 99, had both. Some of the catch phrases - ''Sorry about that, chief'' or ''Would you believe . . .'' - became part of the public vocabulary. This is another difference between lasting comedy and ephemeral police shows: Comedy lines pass into general currency; television cops, except for Sgt. Joe Friday on ''Dragnet'' (''Just the facts, ma'am''), seldom get quoted. Ensemble acting also contributes to durability; most of the good comedies have it. Think of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ''Barney Miller'' and ''Taxi.'' No programs about lone wolves generate mass appeal over the long haul, which is a reason that westerns, no matter how popular they may be when shown first in prime time, do not seem to have real staying power. We do not love heroes who act alone. ''The Prisoner,'' with Patrick McGoohan, is just possibly the most provocative action-and-adventure series ever filmed, a bleak vision of technology and totalitarianism joined. Mr. McGoohan, however, plays one of the all-time great loners. In its first run, the series lasted but a single summer on CBS, and most recently could be seen locally only on the select confine of public television's WNYC/Channel 31. What all this means is that we give our hearts, although not necessarily our minds, to the programs that best reflect, and cater to, the national psyche. We are a gregarious people, and we would rather be amused than instructed. We also seem to place a high value on the traditional virtues. Friendship and family are prized. Violence catches our attention, but only momentarily. Then it must be replaced by a different presentation of violence or else our attention will flag. The only programs that secure a place in the permanent repertory are the ones that confirm the contours of our identity. For better or worse, they comfort rather than afflict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCALIA RETURNS SOFT ANSWERS TO SENATORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/06/us/scalia-returns-soft-answers-to-senators.html,"Judge Antonin Scalia gave glimpses of his conservative views on such issues as constitutional interpretation today in low-key testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is considering his nomination to the Supreme Court. But he declined to answer most of the questions in which the senators were most interested, those bearing on his views on such specific issues as abortion rights. Asked by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whether, if confirmed, ''you expect to overrule'' the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion in certain circumstances, Judge Scalia said, ''I don't think it would be proper for me to answer'' because, he said, he could later be accused of ''having a less than impartial view.'' He added: ''I assure you I have no agenda. I am not going onto the Supreme Court with a list of things that I want to do. My only agenda is to be a good judge.'' There was little apparent opposition to Judge Scalia, although some senators expressed disagreement with his views. Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, said after the hearing that he would not be surprised if the Scalia nomination were to be unanimously approved by the 18-member committee. Contrast to Rehnquist Hearing Today's calm, although occasionally punctuated by partisan jibes among Democratic and Republican committee members, contrasted with last week's sometimes turbulent four-day hearing on Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist. Judge Scalia is President Reagan's nominee to take Justice Rehnquist's seat on the Supreme Court if the latter is confirmed as Chief Justice of the United States. Judge Scalia has been on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since Mr. Reagan appointed him in 1982. The 50-year-old nominee, displaying occasional flashes of his widely acclaimed sense of humor, testified for six hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee as his wife, Maureen, and nine children sat behind him. As a law professor in 1978, Mr. Scalia suggested at a public debate that the Supreme Court had no business striking down anti-abortion laws. Today he said that while the committee was free to consider views he had expressed in the past, he could not elaborate on them. He declined to say whether he still agreed with an article he wrote in 1982 criticizing the 1974 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, saying that he had to avoid publicly prejudging issues that might come before him as a Justice. He added, ''I don't know of anything from my opinions or my writings that would display anything other than a high regard and desire to implement to the utmost the requirements of the First Amendment.'' Less Aggressive Questioning Some Republicans on the committee used their opening statements today to denounce Democrats for what Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming described as ''the attempted evisceration of William Rehnquist'' at last week's hearing. But the questioning of Judge Scalia was far less aggressive. Although his record places him, like Justice Rehnquist, well to the right of the Supreme Court's present ideological center, liberal Democratic senators said today that they knew of no basis for raising the kinds of questions about his veracity or character that they said were raised by the Rehnquist nomination. At one point, after Judge Scalia jokingly noted that he was trying in today's testimony ''to fight against'' his usual inclination to challenge the views of his audience, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said, ''Well, let yourself go, because it's been pretty boring so far.'' In general, Judge Scalia took the position that as a judge his function was to apply laws written by others, not to work for his own views of what the right policy should be. ''You write it, and I'll enforce it,'' he said at one point to Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona. Views on Miranda Decision Judge Scalia did express views on two issues that seemed at least superfically to contrast with those of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, one of those who participated in his selection. The first was raised by Senator Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who is the committee chairman, who asked Judge Scalia's view of the Supreme Court's requirement, in its 1966 decision in Miranda v. Arizona, that the police warn arrested suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present at any interrogation. Judge Scalia responded, ''As a policy matter I think - as far as I know everybody thinks - it's a good idea to warn a suspect what his rights are as soon as practicable.'' Mr. Meese has repeatedly attacked the Miranda decision as an ''infamous decision'' that prevents the police from obtaining information from criminals. When asked by Senator Biden whether he agreed with the view, most often identified with Mr. Meese, that judges interpreting the Constitution should stick to the original intent of those who framed the provisions, Judge Scalia seemed to suggest only partial agreement. He said he thought the original intent was a very important guide, but he said that, for example, he did not believe that lashing and other antiquated forms of punishment would be constitutional now just because they were widely used in 1789, when the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of ''cruel and unusual punishment'' was adopted. At the end of a discussion of his attitude toward affirmative action rograms mandating the elimination of discrimination in employment, he said, ''There should be no doubt about my commitment to a society without discrimination.'' Asked whether he thought Court had reached a consensus that affirmative action was appropriate, he said, ''The one thing I can say for sure about the Supreme Court decisions is they haven't answered a lot of questions.'' The hearing is to continue Wednesday. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary disclosed today that it had unanimously found Judge Scalia ''well qualified,'' the highest of three possible ratings for Supreme Court nominees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN PREDICTS IMPACT OF JUDICIAL APPOINTEES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/06/us/reagan-predicts-impact-of-judicial-appointees.html,"President Reagan said today that by the end of his second term 45 percent of all Federal judges would be his appointees whose decisions on abortion, pornography, crime and other issues would have a long-range impact. In a speech from the Oval Office that was transmitted by satellite to the 104th annual convention of the Knights of Columbus in Chicago, Mr. Reagan reaffirmed his opposition to abortion. He also expressed concern that Congress would take its summer recess next week before the Senate could act on a $100 million aid package for the counterrevolutionary forces in Nicaragua. ''We need that assistance now,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Further delay is risking the lives of the Nicaraguan patriots.'' In the text of the President's remarks, which was distributed before the speech, Mr. Reagan said, ''For Congress to go home without providing the necessary support for the contras would be to risk the permanent loss of Nicaragua to the Soviet bloc.'' Praise for 2 Cardinals Mr. Reagan's remarks to the world's largest Catholic laymen's organization, with 1.4 million members, included praise for John Cardinal O'Connor of New York and Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston. The two Cardinals have offered the resources of the Church to women who decide to bring an unwanted pregnancy to term. Although Mr. Reagan signed a liberal abortion law as Governor of California, he has opposed abortion in recent years. The President said he had been criticized for ''mixing religion and politics'' because he supported ''pro-life legislation.'' ''It is not our heritage as Americans to turn our backs on massive, legalized abortion,'' he said. ''Today we proclaim what our heritage has always maintained; that all life is sacred.'' The President said that ''family values'' rested at the heart of many of his programs. Mentions Court Nominations Citing his recent Supreme Court nominations of Justice William H. Rehnquist as Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia as Associate Justice, Mr. Reagan said he was ''especially delighted'' about Mr. Scalia because he is ''the first Italian-American to be nominated to the Supreme Court in history.'' Both nominations are under scrutiny in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Reagan's comments on Nicaragua came amid concern in the White House that Senate opponents of the proposed aid package for the Nicaraguan rebels - $70 million in military assistance and $30 million in ''humanitarian'' help - would be the thwarted by parliamentary tactics before the summer recess, which starts Aug. 14. The aid package was approved by the House on June 25.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CONSERVATIVE LAW PROFESSOR FADES AS NOMINEE FOR BENCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/07/us/conservative-law-professor-fades-as-nominee-for-bench.html,"The Justice Department has dropped plans to propose a highly conservative Texas law professor for a seat on a Federal appeals court in New Orleans, Reagan Administration officials said today. They said plans to appoint Prof. Lino A. Graglia of the University of Texas School of Law were abandoned when the department received a special report prepared by Griffin Bell, who served as Attorney General under President Carter and is now in private practice. In an unusual move, Mr. Bell was asked to review the nomination after the American Bar Association said it would oppose efforts to appoint Professor Graglia, whose views on the Constitution and whose opposition to court-ordered school busing had been criticized. Although details of the Bell report were not disclosed, one official said Mr. Bell ''did not give us a reason to go forward'' with the nomination. ''The report did not give the nomination enough solid footing,'' the official said. His Chance Is Slim at Best This official said there was a very slight chance the department might reconsider its decision. But another official said bluntly that Professor Graglia ''will not get the nomination.'' Among other things, Mr. Bell had been expected to review Professor Graglia's statements in 1979 urging residents of Austin, Tex., to find ways of frustrating a court-ordered busing plan to desegregate schools. A decision to abandon the proposed nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit would no doubt anger many conservatives, who have focused on the issue. Many have urged the Administration not to give in to pressures from liberal groups, like People for the American Way, that last month nearly defeated the nomination of another conservative judicial nominee, Daniel Manion. Mr. Manion, an Indiana lawyer, won confirmation to an Federal appeals seat in Chicago on a Senate vote of 50 to 49. Administration officials denied that the decision on Professor Graglia, who has been widely praised as intelligent and a gifted teacher, had been influenced by the Manion fight. In an interview, Professor Graglia said the Justice Department had not given him the results of Mr. Bell's investigation and knew nothing of the status of his proposed nomination. He said he had heard a ''rumor'' that the Bell report was unfavorable. 'I'm a Combative Guy' Professor Graglia said he believed that he had been penalized by the bar association and others for his willingness to speak out on controversial subjects. ''I'm a combative type of guy,'' he said. ''As a professor, I really try to provoke, to take opinions that need taking.'' Professor Graglia, 56 years old, was educated at City College in New York and received his law degree from Columbia Univerity. According to the Directory of American Scholars, he has been a professor at the University of Texas since 1966. Last year the bar association's screening panel said that Mr. Graglia was unqualified to join the appeals court, which hears appeals from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. After this, the Justice Department turned to Mr. Bell for an independent appraisal, officials said. Mr. Bell, who has been a judge but is again practicing law in Atlanta, did not return phone calls to his office today. In his report, Mr. Bell had also been expected to review Mr. Graglia's views on the Constitution. In an article in The National Review in 1984, Mr. Graglia charged the Supreme Court with ''usurpation'' of ''unlimited power'' and raised questions about the Constitution's value. ''It is doubtful that the net contribution of the Constitution to our national well-being has been positive,'' he said, ''and it is certain that the net contribution of judicial review has been negative.'' In the article, he criticized Court decisions that permitted abortion and broadened the rights of criminal defendants. ''Even without judicial review, most constitutional issues are just bad ideas,'' he said. Professor Graglia said that improper interpretation of the Constitution had at one time permitted slavery. Actions in Austin in 1979 Perhaps more controversial were Professor Graglia's actions in 1979, when Austin was facing a Federal court order to integrate its schools through busing. He acknowledged that he urged parents to consider ways of balking the busing order, including court appeals and letter-writing campaigns. But he vigorously denied that he had asked people to break the law. Professor Graglia also wrote a book on the topic, ''Disaster by Decree: The Supreme Court Decisions on Race and the Schools.'' ''I don't recommend to anybody that they disobey laws,'' he said. ''I said that they should not accept that this is right, that they should realize that the courts can be wrong. The argument that I made is that there are some court policies that ought not to be permitted to go smoothly.'' Mr. Graglia said he had not talked to Mr. Bell, which he said was surprising. ''He never called me,'' the professor said. ''I thought I'd go down and have an interview.'' ''I understand that he or, more accurately, one of his assistants talked to some people who know me,'' he said. ''I don't know what they were asked.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Foes of Abortion And Death Penalty,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/07/opinion/l-foes-of-abortion-and-death-penalty-226886.html,"To the Editor In your July 31 editorial ''Contradictions,'' you too quickly include pro-life activists, whom you describe as often in favor of capital punishment. This may be true of some prominent political figures but is probably not true of pro-life activists or perhaps the general public. There are no national survey data comparing opposition to abortion and support for capital punishment. It would be interesting to have such data. In the meantime, fairness requires that you note that pro-life organizations either take no position on capital punishment or oppose it. The Roman Catholic bishops and their Respect Life offices oppose both legal abortion and capital punishment. (In the name of consistency, they also oppose the use of any nuclear weapons and the arms race.) The most prominent pro-life organization, the National Right to Life Committee, takes no position on capital punishment, but a survey of its leadership has shown that, far more than the general public, it opposes capital punishment. At National Right to Life conventions, speakers have given addresses saying that, in consistency, right-to-lifers should oppose capital punishment, and those who are against capital punishment should oppose terminating the lives of unborn humans. An internal poll showed that the membership of ProLifers for Survival almost unanimously opposes the death penalty. Sisterhood, the publication of Feminists for Life, has published many articles promoting alternatives to abortion and opposing the death penalty. In other words, the available empirical data do not accord well with the stereotype that those who oppose abortion are more likely than others to endorse the death penalty. Perhaps your editorial will prompt reflection on the morality of the death penalty and abortion, and what consistency requires of us. JAMES R. KELLY Bronx, New York, July 31, 1986 The writer is a professor of sociology at Fordham University.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dam the Flood of Federal Dollars,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/09/opinion/dam-the-flood-of-federal-dollars.html,"Congressmen know that their votes on abortion, say, or foreign trade are sure to anger somebody back home. But they also recognize the calming effect of an extra helping from the Federal pork barrel, like a deeper harbor or a new flood-control dam. Federally financed public works bring good jobs and profits. That's why Congress has bitterly resisted efforts to limit water improvements to those that are economically justifiable. And that resistance is all the more reason to celebrate some dramatic policy reforms contained in new water bills that have been passed by the House and Senate. The need now is to persuade the House-Senate conference considering the bills to embrace the tougher anti-waste measures favored by the Senate and the Reagan Administration. Environmentalists and fiscal conservatives have occasionally succeeded in blocking exceptionally offensive water projects. But the pork barrel system remained. Billions were invested each year with little concern for the likely return. The first real challenge came from President Carter. President Reagan then derailed the system entirely, blocking all new construction until Congress accepted fundamental reforms. Now, a decade of ''no'' is about to pay off. Federal water projects have traditionally been funded from Federal revenues; little or nothing in the way of contributions was asked from local beneficiaries. That's unfair. More important, it is wasteful, encouraging individual Congressmen to push projects in their districts even if the projected returns are meager. If Washington is picking up the tab, why not order champagne? The legislative proposals this year would require substantial sharing of costs. The Senate version asks non-Federal interests to pay between 25 and 60 percent of costs, depending on the project purpose. Some of the money would come from local taxes; more would come from fuel taxes on inland waterway traffic and from new port fees. Strikingly, the prospect of reform is having an effect even before enactment: grandiose harbor improvement proposals for Baltimore, Norfolk and Mobile have been scaled down by local officials in the expectation that shippers would have to share the tab. Unfortunately, the cost-sharing provisions in the House bill are not nearly as strong as the Senate's. The House version does not include the fuel tax increase for the inland waterways. And it exempts a handful of projects from cost-sharing requirements, notably those affecting the Mississippi constituents of Jamie Whitten, House Appropriations Committee chairman. Such special treatment doesn't make economic sense. Nor, in view of the sacrifices being demanded from most project beneficiaries, does it make much political sense. It's up to the conferees to see the light at the end of the barrel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BUSINESS FORUM: BEYOND THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE;
A New War on Corporate 'Propaganda'",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/10/business/business-forum-beyond-the-fairness-doctrine-a-new-war-on-corporate.html,"SINCE 1980, when the Reagan Administration all but ceased enforcing the Fairness Doctrine, advocacy advertising on television by corporations and private organizations has exploded. By my conservative estimate, these interests spent $1.8 billion in 1985 to communicate their ideas on various public policy issues. That figure is rising by 10 to 15 percent a year. However, at the same time that it is becoming a major source of television revenue and a significant element in public debate, a substantial portion of advocacy advertising is fast degenerating into thinly disguised propaganda bordering on disinformation. And now instead of enhancing the Fairness Doctrine, the Administration is urging Congress to abolish the measure. While many advocacy ad campaigns enrich the public-policy debate, a growing number do not. To abandon public control over the airwaves now is to invite distortion of issues by those wealthy enough to afford the considerable cost. Advocacy advertising emerged as a significant phenomenon in the early 1970's, when American oil companies led by Mobil resorted to the use of paid commercials to defend themselves against charges of obscene profits and environmental pollution, to correct what they saw as the public's misunderstanding of the facts and to counteract an alleged anti-business bias in the news media. Their ads tended to be large, often full-page editorials in newspapers and magazines. Television was largely denied a share of this business by the networks' fear of the Fairness Doctrine, which requires that broadcasters - but not newspapers - provide equal time free of charge to opposing viewpoints. The climate has changed a great deal since then, opening up vast new opportunities for advocacy advertisers. For one thing, the Reagan F.C.C. has all but ceased to pursue Fairness Doctrine cases. For another, public interest advocates lack the resources to monitor effectively the multiplicity of television outlets that have sprung up in recent years. Without such monitoring, of course, there can be no demands for the opportunity to reply. Both developments have encouraged independent stations and even network affiliates to accept advocacy ads, since the chances are low that they will be forced to run an unpaid response. Corporations have gained another significant outlet in cable television, which, freed of Fairness Doctrine restrictions, has actively sought advocacy advertising. Thus, a sponsor can now reach a nationwide audience through a combination of independent, network-affiliated and cable TV stations without using network-owned-and-operated stations. Although the television networks themselves continue to restrict advocacy commercials, even they are bending the rules. For example, ''controversial'' under the Fairness Doctrine is defined broadly as any major controversy in which there are considerable differences of opinion -nuclear power safety, smoking and health or abortion. Recently, however, a network ran an advertisement in support of the Long Island Lighting Company's troubled Shoreham nuclear power plant. The ad was sponsored by a group supported largely by the utility. Formerly, the words ''nuclear power'' would mark an ad as an advocacy commercial and scare stations off. THE commercials themselves have changed as well. Rather than relatively lengthy and dispassionate appeals based on at least a version of the facts, many of the televised advocacy ads now tend to be symbolically charged emotional appeals crammed into 30, or even 15, seconds. This type of ad pops up frequently in referendum voting: ''Vote no on proposition two - keep Big Brother out of your life.'' In this changed atmosphere, both broadcasters and the advertising community have demanded a repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, which they insist stifles the expression of ideas by requiring equal, unpaid time for opposing viewpoints. Lately, though, its critics have argued that the old rationale for the measure - the scarcity of available channels - is a moot point with the addition of new UHF stations and cable television. All of these arguments fail on close scrutiny. The airwaves are public property, which should be used to promote the public interest. The Fairness Doctrine has not imposed an onerous burden on broadcasters. F.C.C. records show that opponents have rarely won petitions for equal time when the licensee has demonstrated that alternative viewpoints were covered through regular news programming. Their refusal to accept advocacy commercials demonstrates that they put their profits ahead of the public interest. The increased availability of television outlets cannot be used as an excuse to abdicate one's responsibility. If the financially powerful networks are reluctant to air advocacy commercials for fear of giving away free time, why should one expect independent stations or cable television to be more responsive to public needs? The greater diversity of television outlets will not automatically lead to greater diversity of opinion - you will still need a considerable amount of money to make your message known. In an ideal world, the Fairness Doctrine would not be necessary. But we do not live in one of those. Not only must we retain the Fairness Doctrine, but we must go beyond it in ways that strengthen the marketplace of ideas and allow the airing of all significant viewpoints on major issues of public policy, even where the sponsoring group lacks deep pockets. Specifically, broadcasters, advertising agencies and public interest groups should develop voluntary regulations along the following lines:  * Broadcast media - both television and radio - should be prohibited from refusing any paid, advocacy commercials, provided they are consistent with other standards of the station. In other words, advocacy commercials should be treated like all other commercials.  * Advocacy commercials of less than 60 seconds should not be allowed. Efforts should be made to encourage 2-minute commercials. This would avoid media clutter and force the sponsors to make substantive arguments in support of their messages.  * Sponsors of advocacy commercials should be clearly identified -not hidden behind innocuous names.  * Time for the expression of alternative viewpoints must be provided where the group seeking such time is legitimate and represents an identifiable constituency, even if the group is unable to pay for it. The cost of air time can be offset by a surcharge on the commercial time sold to other sponsors of advocacy ads.  * Where it is feasible, and where the needed funds are available through the surcharge mechanism, the stations should invite legitimate groups and even advertising agencies to develop campaigns on controversial issues that have not been adequately discussed through regular news programming, and where commercial interests have a dominance in airing a particular perspective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO SEES PERIL IN PICKING JUDGES ON IDEOLOGY BASIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/12/nyregion/cuomo-sees-peril-in-picking-judges-on-ideology-basis.html,"Declaring that Federal judges were being selected on the basis of their political ideology, not on merit, Governor Cuomo warned yesterday that the practice potentially posed ''a grave danger'' that could ultimately undermine public confidence in the courts. Speaking at Radio City Music Hall to more than 4,000 members of the American Bar Association, who gave his remarks a standing ovation, the Governor addressed his criticism to both President Reagan and the Senate. Mr. Cuomo said judicial nominees were being screened for their political philosophies and he accused the White House of ''implicitly'' trying to shape future court rulings by publicly stating how it expected the nominees to decide in cases involving such matters as abortion and pornography. 'Profoundly Important' Labeling such practices a threat to the balance of power among the three branches of government, he called instead for basing the selection of judges solely on such criteria as scholarship, experience and integrity, with no consideration of how they might rule on a specific issue. ''This is a matter of profoundly important substance,'' the Governor said in his 28-minute address at the association's national convention. ''Whether it's Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, liberals or conservatives, the President and the Senate should not be trying to fix the judicial deal. It wasn't meant to be that way and it's not good for the country in the long run.'' ''It comes down to this, it seems to me,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Under our system, cases should be decided in the courthouse. They should not be decided in the Oval Office or the Senate chamber.'' A National Debate The comments by the Governor, who has been frequently mentioned as a possible Presidential candidate in 1988, thrust him into the middle of a national debate sparked by President Reagan's nominations for Federal judgeships, including two recent Supreme Court nominations. The two are still pending before the Senate. Mr. Cuomo did not challenge the ability of the two nominees, Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, whom Mr. Reagan has proposed as Chief Justice, and Judge Antonin Scalia, whom Mr. Reagan has nominated as an Associate Justice. The Governor said questions about whether Justice Rehnquist had told the truth about past events or whether he had ever approved bigotry were ''relevant.' But he added that ''surely a clear and compelling case would have to made against him to justify an assault on the integrity of a man who has served as an Associate Justice for 15 years.'' The only judicial nominee Mr. Cuomo specifically criticized was Daniel Manion, who was recently confirmed by the Senate for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. The Governor said that ''there was good reason to believe he was nominated because of his ideology.'' In an interview, the Governor said his comments were directed ''not at individual nominees but at the system as a whole, which is politicized.'' Sets Off Controversy Mr. Cuomo's address - which he had worked on for nearly a month and which his advisers had privately hoped would be a boon to his national political prospects - immediately set off a swell of controversy. The White House counsel, Peter Wallison, who was at Radio City for the speech, said he was ''surprised that he chose that forum -nonpartisan, nonpolitical - to suggest that he disagreed with how the President was conducting his office.'' ''The Governor's statement is fatally wrong,'' Mr. Wallison said. ''The President does not ask, nor does the Justice Department ask, how a nominee will vote on particular cases or issues.'' He said Mr. Reagan's only criterion was that a nominee believe in judicial restraint, in interpreting the law, not making the law. Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, who also attended the bar association's national convention in New York, was not present for the Cuomo speech. When told of its contents, he said: ''I can only say that Ronald Reagan has prided himself on appointing the best possible judges to the state of California when he was governor and to the Federal bench as President. The quality of the judges in both cases proves that he succeeded in that objective.'' 'A Bad Rap' In Washington, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican, who was the leading defender of the Administration during the Rehnquist and Scalia confirmation hearings, said, ''I think it's a bad rap to say President Reagan is trying to stack the judiciary.'' ''The problem is,'' he added, ''we have too much political screaming by those who suffer from the proverbial case of sour grapes because their party is not in control of who gets appointed.'' Mr. Cuomo, in the interview, made clear that he was also criticizing some lines of questioning by senators during the confirmation hearings as being intended at uncovering the nominees' political ideology. Mr. Cuomo specifically cited questions by Senator Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat. Mr. DeConcini, when told of the Governor's statements, said yesterday that ''Governor Cuomo proves he has the biggest mouth on the political scene right now.'' Followers of His Ideology ''The President who is elected is going to appoint members to the bench that are followers of the ideology he believes in,'' the Senator said. ''That was one of the questions of the election. Mondale lost the election. Reagan won it.'' Mr. Cuomo's speech, delivered at 10 A.M., dominated much of the informal talk at the bar association's convention for the rest of the day. And most of the response, overheard at luncheon tables and in hallways, was favorable. William W. Falsgraf, the president of the association, who took the microphone at Radio City after the Governor's address, seemed to endorse Mr. Cuomo's comments. Referring to the standing ovation for Mr. Cuomo, he said, ''The response of this audience put it more eloquently than I could.'' Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court, who was present for the speech, said last night that ''I think it made a point that was very, very significant.'' ''It reminds me,'' he continued, ''of what Felix Frankfurter always said: that the most important attribute of a good judge is his disinterestedness. He has to shake off the politics.'' Two other Supreme Court Justices who were present for the speech -Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. - declined to comment. Lincoln and Roosevelt In the address and the interview, the Governor acknowledged that previous Presidents - he specifically cited Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, among others - had nominated judges that they hoped would carry out their ideological goals. But he added that ''the present effort, however, is a particularly emphatic one.'' ''Conceding that it's legal, conceding that it has been done before, conceding that the nation has survived the experience,'' he said, ''I respectfully submit to you that this is not the only practical way to select judges, and it certainly is not the best way.'' Anticipating a question, Mr. Cuomo added, ''Perhaps many will label this as naive.'' Scholarship and Experience But he said that as Governor of New York, he had practiced what he was preaching and had named six judges to the state's highest court on the basis of their scholarship and experience, without knowing where they stood on such issues as the death penalty. Of what he sees as the politicization of the Federal judiciary, Mr. Cuomo said: ''It's become a bad habit. It's a habit that ought to be broken.'' ''All you need is an event and you could change it in Washington,'' the Governor said. ''And that event is 1988. Some candiate can come forward and make it an issue, saying, 'I'm going to depoliticize it. I'm going to appoint the best judges.' '' And isn't that exactly what Mr. Cuomo is doing? ''Oh, no,'' said the Governor, who has repeatedly maintained that he is not running for the White House. ''I'm trying to do this as nonpresumptuously as possible. The bar association asked me to speak as Governor of New York and I'm flattered. All I can do is share with them my experiences in New York.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Harness Put on Americans by the Liberals,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/13/opinion/l-a-harness-put-on-americans-by-the-liberals-816886.html,"To the Editor: I believe that your July 31 editorial ''Contradictions'' misstates the position of those who support the Supreme Court decision on a state's right to make homosexual sodomy a crime, who largely oppose taxation for so-called social programs, who support capital punishment while opposing abortion, who oppose both welfare assistance for young mothers unwilling to turn to their parents and sex education (not as to the physiology of reproduction and the legal obligations of parenthood but as to the legitimacy of extramarital intercourse and homosexuality) and who oppose state-supplied contraceptives for teen-agers poor or rich. Although I do not pretend to speak for them, I believe you are in error when you say that these people want the state to impose a moral harness on Americans. On the contrary, they favor maximum liberty: minimum coercion of man by the state. They may or may not believe that the states should make homosexual sodomy a crime, on the ground that it is damaging to the institution of the family and hence to society. Out of respect, however, for the Federal system, they oppose the discovery by the Supreme Court, at the expense of the states, of new rights in the Constitution. They believe the state should punish as crimes invasions by one man of the privacy or integrity of another, such as assault, murder, robbery, larceny and the other offenses recognized by the common law. They believe the law should provide civil remedies for those invasions and for the others long recognized as torts. For the rest and for the most part, men should be left to themselves to order their lives as they can and choose. Again contrary to your editorial, this viewpoint is not Puritan. Certainly it does not call for conformity in either deed or thought. It calls only for abstention, through self-control reinforced by legal sanctions, from invasions of the physical, psychological or economic integrity of other persons, including future generations. It is the liberals, so-miscalled, who are imposing a harness on all Americans. Look only, I ask you, at the proliferation, which liberals applaud, of new crimes denounced by the exploding state and Federal criminal codes in the last 50 years. Look at the proliferation of new civil causes of action, many with provision for punitive or trebled damages, that have been added to the state and Federal civil codes. Look also at the proliferation of lawyers, who produce no goods, many of whom serve only to guide the rest of the population through this useless, pernicious obstacle course, and whose needs in goods must be satisfied out of the goods produced by the rest of the population. And all of this harness has failed utterly to control either the old or the new crime. As to the old crime, you noted so yourself recently in an editorial on Bernhard Goetz, wherein you conceded the failure of the criminal law in the United States. We have too much law; we have so much that we do not respect it, and we do not even try to enforce it. Indeed, the New York City Police Department openly has its priorities, enforcing some laws and ignoring a great many others. J.

A Harness Put on Americans by the Liberals; Midway Majority,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/13/opinion/l-a-harness-put-on-americans-by-the-liberals-midway-majority-683786.html,"To the Editor: You may have hit it on the bean in your editorial titled ''Contradictions.'' A meanness of spirit may be the operable link in what are seeming contradictions among some of the brethren on the right. But, of course, you open yourself, and many who believe as you do, to the opposite criticism. Why are those least offended by the tax man so outraged when an intrusive government then meanders into their private sexual and substance preferences? How can abortion so easily be dismissed, but states that execute murderers be chastened? Why is sex education important, but teaching civics antiquated? Can it mean there are no contradictions here also? Rather, could it be a consistent pattern of fashionable, if unlevel and irresponsible, but ever so sympathetic, advocacy of the downtrodden, no matter how creative their downtroddenness might be? You can't have it both ways: condemning the contradictions of the hysterical right wing while using kid gloves on the inanities of the liberals. I'd prefer to think there is a third course that can legitimately be maintained, which neither creates perceived contradictions nor requires monumental restructuring of human nature. Is it not possible for one to advocate free enterprise and civil liberties? Abortion rights and capital punishment? Compassion and responsible citizenship? The 1984 election galvanized the political awareness of millions who abide by this scenario. The question remains which major party will unshackle itself from past alliances to respond to these growing sentiments. Neither the religious fervorists nor the one-issue humaniacs can appreciate the vital, heterogenous community that we call America. One side wants to use the Bible, the other our tax dollars to create a world in its likeness. The party that best expresses the forgotten American principles of economic and personal opportunity within a context of social and individual responsibility will eventually gain the allegiance of this emerging majority. In the meantime, I will remain a dyed-in-the-wool, knee-jerk neocentrist. H. MARTIN MOORE New York, Aug. 5, 1986",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CUOMO COURT NOMINATIONS NOT IDEOLOGICAL, EXPERTS SAY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/13/nyregion/cuomo-court-nominations-not-ideological-experts-say.html,"In his judicial nominations, Governor Cuomo has, for the most part, met the standards that he has urged President Reagan to apply to Federal nominations, legal scholars, judges and lawyers say. The experts, both Democrats and Republicans, said in interviews yesterday that the Governor had appointed six of the seven judges on the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, without any apparent effort to give the court a particular ideological bent or to influence rulings on such matters as abortion or the death penalty. Three of his choices have been Republicans. But the experts also stressed that it was difficult to make comparisons. They pointed out that, unlike the President, Mr. Cuomo was not free to select anyone he wanted for a judicial seat, having to choose from a list of pre-screened candidates forwarded to him by bipartisan nominating panels. And the Governor's nominations, also unlike those of the President, have to be approved by a Senate controlled by the opposition party. Spoke of 'Grave Danger' In a speech Monday before the American Bar Association's national convention in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that Federal judges were being chosen on the basis of political ideology, not merit, and he assailed the practice as potentially ''a grave danger.'' ''Does Cuomo practice what he preaches?'' asked James F. Simon, dean of the New York Law School. ''I think he does. I think you could say that he is not determined to put people on the court who he thinks will vote a particular way on a given issue.'' The comments came on a day that debate continued to widen over the Cuomo speech, in which he called on the President and the Senate to name judges based solely on such factors as scholarship, experience and integrity, with no regard for how they might decide a particular issue, such as abortion or pornography. Issue Seen as 'Straw Man' Although the speech seemed well-received by the rank-and-file members of the bar association, who gave it a standing ovation, the association's new president, Eugene C. Thomas, said yesterday that he thought the Governor had raised ''a straw man.'' Mr. Thomas, a Republican, said he agreed with the Governor's call for the merit selection of judges, but he added that he also agreed with the Reagan Administration's assertion that it was already doing so. ''In the world of politics,'' Mr. Thomas said, referring to Mr. Cuomo, ''you are allowed to stand up the straw man and knock him down.'' But others at the convention yesterday were less sanguine about the quality of the Administration's nominations. ''I thought the speech was superb,'' said Norman Redlich, dean of the New York University Law School. ''I think the Governor articulated a framework within which a chief executive should function.'' At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Cuomo was pressed on why, if he was concerned about the integrity of the judiciary, he had not pressed more emphatically as the leader of the state party to curb the influence in this year's elections of Stanley Friedman, the Bronx Democratic leader who is under indictment in the city's corruption scandal. Party leaders wield enormous power in determining candidates for State Supreme Court judgeships. Amendment Sought Mr. Cuomo said that he had asked Mr. Friedman to quit his party post but that he had refused. The Governor then renewed a longstanding call for a constitutional amendment changing the way State Supreme Court judges are chosen. Mr. Cuomo wants them to be appointed by the Governor, a move rejected by the Legislature. Currently, the Governor nominates judges for only three of the state's courts - the Court of Appeals, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court and the Court of Claims. Judges of other courts are elected. Mr. Cuomo has made 84 nominations to the three courts, and Sol Wachtler, the state's Chief Judge, said yesterday that he knew of no instances in which the Cuomo administration had screened nominees for their political ideology or for how they might rule on specific issues. ''There are absolutely none,'' said Judge Wachtler, a Republican and himself a Cuomo nominee. Maurice Rosenberg, the Howard R. Medina Professor of Law at Columbia University Law School, agreed that he had seen no ideological screening of state judges. But he added, ''I don't think the Governor has always selected the very best nominees available to him on the lists he is given.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CATHOLIC SCHOOL EXPELS GIRL OVER ABORTION STAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/16/us/catholic-school-expels-girl-over-abortion-stand.html,"An 11-year-old girl has been told by her pastor that she cannot return to St. Agnes Roman Catholic School in Toledo, Ohio, because she had publicly supported the right to abortion. The pastor, the Rev. Richard Miller, said that the only remedy was for the girl, Sarabeth Eason, to write a letter to her principal saying she personally does not support abortion. If that was done, he said, ''I think we could move forward.'' Sarabeth, who was supposed to enter the sixth grade at St. Agnes in the fall, said she would not sign such a letter. Her mother said she intends to enroll the child elsewhere. Father Miller's letter, which was dated Sunday, was released by Sarabeth's family yesterday. National activists both for and against abortion said yesterday that this was the first case they had heard of a child being barred from a Catholic school because of taking a position on abortion. Advertisement and Interview Sarabeth signed a newspaper advertisement commemorating the 13th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal. She was also interviewed by a television reporter at a demonstration against a bill requiring that parents be notified before birth control counseling could be given to minors. She is the daughter of Conception Eason, assistant director of a Toledo abortion clinic that was firebombed in May. In a letter to the mother, Father Miller wrote: ''Because Sarabeth is carried along with your enthusiasm, made out of sympathy, feelings of mercy and rightness, as you understand it, and has been so public, namely TV appearances and the public press by ad, we reach a serious hard spot.'' Father Miller quoted ''a serious advocate of the pro-life position, President Ronald Reagan.'' He cited the President's book, ''Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation,'' in which Mr. Reagan writes that medical and scientific experts agree that ''the unborn child is alive.'' First Amendment Rights In response yesterday, Mrs. Eason called the move ''anti-American.'' ''The Catholic church,'' she said, ''has placed itself above the Constitution of the United States by giving out punishment for the simple exercise of our First Amerndment rights.'' Sarabeth, also interviewed yesterday, reiterated her position. ''I value what a woman's choice should be and they are trying to take that choice away from the women,'' the girl said. Telephone calls to Father Miller at the church and his home were not returned yesterday, the Feast of the Assumption. A spokesman for Bishop James R. Hoffman, head of the Toledo Diocese, said: ''The Bishop stands solidly behind the premise that the church is pro-life and that the spirit of pro-life extends to all of its schools and institutions.'' The spokesman, James D. Richards, said: ''The Bishop agrees that we must take a courageous position, although sometimes painful, to witness to the sacredness of human life. This is one of those instances.'' No National Policy Russell Shaw, secretary for public affairs at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, said the bishops had no national policy on children's adherence to Catholic doctrine. ''Particular cases have to be left to the responsible local authorities,'' Mr. Shaw said. Frances Kissling, executive director of Catholics For a Free Choice, called the action of the Toledo church ''a very bad civics lesson.'' ''This young woman has taken a position on public policy no different than the position taken by Mario Cuomo and Geraldine Ferraro,'' Ms. Kissling said. ''We all have a right to hold a position different than the bishops.'' In the 1984 Presidential campaign, Mrs. Ferraro and Governor Cuomo, both Catholics who said they were personally opposed to abortion but supported a woman's right to choose, repeatedly clashed with the nation's bishops, who said Catholics had to repudiate abortion rights laws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wider Use of Medicaid For Abortion Is Backed,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/16/us/wider-use-of-medicaid-for-abortion-is-backed.html,"The Senate Appropriations Committee voted today to exempt victims of rape and incest from a ban on the use of Federal Medicaid funds for abortions. The 13-to-12 vote sets up a possible fight on the issue when the Senate considers the $114 billion appropriation bill to which the provision was attached. The law prohibits the use of Federal Medicaid funds to finance abortions, except to save the life of the mother. Until 1981, victims of rape and incest were also allowed to obtain Medicaid payments for abortions. But Congress eliminated the exemption. The provision adopted today was attached to the appropriation bill to operate the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. It was sponsored by Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican of Connecticut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO'S SEARCHING FOR A ROLE THAT FITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/weekinreview/cuomo-s-searching-for-a-role-that-fits.html,"IN trying to find his place in the national political arena, Governor Cuomo at times seems unsure which role he wants to assume. Should he be an outright contender for the Presidency? Or would he rather be the conscience of the Democratic Party? Should he directly attack President Reagan, many of whose policies he abhors? Or is that political suicide, given Mr. Reagan's popularity? When is it too soon to begin running for the White House? When Ms it too late? Variations of these questions have a way of plaguing perceived Presidential candidates before circumstance forces a flat declaration of candidacy or a sweeping denial of ambition. So Mr. Cuomo's struggle is not unprecedented. But as he wrestled with those questions last week, it seemed of small comfort to the Governor that others had passed this way before. And it seemed, as well, that by trying to keep all his options open, he sometimes antagonized liberals and conservatives alike, running the risk of occasionally being perceived as disingenuous. In an address to 4,000 members of the American Bar Association at their annual convention in Manhattan, for example, Mr. Cuomo declared that Federal judges were being selected on the basis of political ideology, not merit. The speech - delivered at a national forum attended by three Supreme Court justices and the White House counsel - was interpreted by the audience as clear criticism of the Reagan Administration. But minutes later, at a sidewalk news conference during which he was surrounded by network television crews and reporters from around the country, the Governor said he was not criticizing the President. If reporters wanted to draw that conclusion, he said, that was their business. Mr. Cuomo said the speech had merely offered his thoughts on how judges ought to be selected. While that may have appeared contradictory, it was, in fact, part of an intentional political strategy. President Reagan is popular, and the Governor does not want to appear to be attacking him - his policies, yes, but not the President himself. The speech and the Governor's comments before and after sent out other contradictory messages as well - some by design, according to his aides, and some as a result of Mr. Cuomo's own uncertainty over what he wants his role to be in the Democratic Party. Here was Cuomo the Presidential candidate, taking on the White House and demonstrating that he had a reasoned approach to the naming of Supreme Court justices. And here was Cuomo the noncandidate, saying that he was not campaigning for national office and that had come to deliver a speech only about his experiences as Governor of New York. Here was Cuomo the conscience of the Democratic Party, including in his criticism Senate Democrats who had questioned Supreme Court nominees about their political ideologies and about how they might vote in specific cases involving such issues as abortion. And here was Mr. Cuomo seeming to avoid the role of party conscience - refraining, in a 28-minute address on President Reagan's Supreme Court nominees, from urging the Senate either to confirm or to reject William H. Rehnquist as Chief Justice and Antonin Scalia as an Associate Justice. The response to the speech was varied: the 4,000 members of the audience rose to their feet in applause. The White House was angry. Senate Democrats said virtually nothing. Of all the reaction, the Cuomo Administration found that silence most troublesome. But while Senate Democrats refused to speak publicly or for attribution, three of them were privately critical of the Governor for avoiding the most sensitive aspect of the issue he addressed. The question of the week, they said, was whether Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia should be confirmed, and the Governor did not address that. Avoiding Mondale's Mistake In fact, in many of his statements on national policy, Mr. Cuomo discusses broad themes, not specifics. The Governor knows full well that it is the specifics that can get a candidate into trouble. He says often, for example, that one of Walter F. Mondale's biggest mistakes in the 1984 Presidential campaign was identifying too soon the taxes he would raise. So when Mr. Cuomo talks of a need to increase Federal revenues and is pressed to say which taxes he would raise, he gives answers like this: ''Me? I'm not for raising any taxes.'' The Governor's aides argue that he is not being disingenuous. And they maintain that he has been more than willing to take on controversial issues. He opposes the death penalty, they point out, though public opinion in New York favors it. And, in a fight to retain on Federal tax returns the deductibility of state and local taxes, he has repeatedly shown a willingness to confront the President. Mr. Cuomo's strength, his advisers contend, is his ability to raise an issue above the political arena and discuss it intellectually. They point to the Bar Association speech as an example of that. What is important, the advisers maintain, is not whether the Governor supports or opposes the confirmation of Justice Rehnquist but that he explores the process. They also acknowledge that Mr. Cuomo works hard at fostering an image of intellectual introspection on the theory that it lends him a distinctive political image. In that regard, they considered the Bar Association speech a rousing success. ''It's part of the mystique,'' said a close Cuomo adviser. ''It's that high-brow intellectual quality that has promoted him as a very real candidate in '88. It makes him intriguing. It makes him different. It gets him a lot of ink.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ISSUE AND DEBATE; PROPRIETY OF WITHHOLDING FOOD FROM DYING PATIENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/18/us/issue-and-debate-propriety-of-withholding-food-from-dying-patients.html,"Many seriously ill or comatose people can survive without a respirator. But none could last long without the chemicals, vitamins and artificial foods that can be pumped or dripped into the body of someone unable or unwilling to eat. Is withholding such sustenance a form of murder to rid a family or society of a burdensome member? Or is it a humane act to halt further suffering for the patient in a prolonged fight against the inevitable? The issue, part of a more general debate over ''the right to die,'' has long troubled some medical professionals. But it is only now emerging into a debate in the broader society through pronouncements by professional and religious associations and through scattered court fights. The Supreme Court, in its first encounter with the issue, this summer struck down Reagan Administration regulations designed to require life-prolonging medical treatment, including feeding, for severely handicapped newborns. Last year the New Jersey Supreme Court, which in 1976 had approved the removal of the respirator that kept alive a comatose woman, Karen Ann Quinlan, ruled that artificial feeding was no different from artificial breathing and could be removed when it offered the patient no benefit. In March the American Medical Association's Judicial Council approved withholding ''all means of life-prolonging medical treatment'' including food and water from patients in irreversible comas, even if death does not appear imminent. Some groups fear this trend could lead to widespread euthanasia. They plan drives in numerous states for legislation that would mandate artificial feeding in virtually every case. The Background The ability to feed patients in a coma or against their wishes is a relatively new phenomenon. Humans approaching death lose their appetite much as salmon stop eating when they leave the ocean to return to their birthplace to spawn and die. Even after rubber tubing was invented in the late 1800's and doctors later were able to insert tubes in veins, artificial feeding was not perceived as something to be done. At about the time of World War II medicine began to become more interventionist. Because more could be done, more was done, with little thought for whether it should be done. One result is that the life span of the average American is now nearing the mid-70's. People are living long enough to die from chronic diseases for which there is yet no cure: cancer, emphysema, kidney disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. One study has estimated that of the 5,500 Americans who die every day, 87 percent are victims of a chronic disease. But while there is no cure for kidney disease, a victim's blood can be cleansed by machine. While there is no cure for Alzheimer's or Lou Gehrig's disease, their victims' failed lungs can be inflated by machine indefinitely in a pre-programmed rhythm that includes mechanical sighs. Malfunctioning stomachs or throats can be bypassed by permanent feeding tubes. Such devices can buy time and eventual recovery for some patients. For others they can prolong dying, raising such questions as, Should a victim of AIDS be cured of pneumonia today so he can die next year of another infection his ruined immune system cannot resist? As a Presidential commission on medical and scientific ethics noted in 1983, ''Matters once the province of fate have now became a matter of human choice.'' Most experts expect the problem to worsen as the American population ages. Today one in nine Americans is over 65 years old; by 2030 the figure is expected to be one in five. With medical costs for this new technology still rising faster than overall inflation, the financial implications are serious for government, taxpayers, the insurance industry and policy holders. Some studies indicate that 25 percent of a typical person's lifelong medical expenses come in the last few months of life. Because it ultimately affects everyone, the debate over a new form and timing of death is potentially more divisive than even the sometimes violent debate over abortion. But medicine's advances have outpaced legal reflection on these sensitive issues, leaving doctors, nurses, families and patients in a litigious society to make painful - and final - decisions without precise legal guidelines. For Feeding The argument over artificial feeding without limits has almost as many viewpoints as there are patients. In general, proponents of virtually unconditional feeding, such as Dr. John Willke of the National Right to Life Committee, see food and water as basic human rights and the removal or withholding of these substances as, in effect, causing the patient to die of starvation instead of the underlying disease or condition. There are also strong concerns in many quarters that once it is found acceptable to withhold or withdraw food and water from one category of severely ill or dying patients, this first step down ''the slippery slope'' will lead inevitably to an ever-widening array of victims. The Nazi policy of euthanasia is often cited as an example of what can happen. Dr. Mark Siegler, director of the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago, said, ''I worry about causing such deaths by starvation and dehydration and developing a policy to cause it, because that would deprive the most helpless persons in our society of the most basic kinds of human care.'' Others note that the strong symbolism of food makes it psychologically different from a respirator or a dialysis machine. They also worry whether a comatose patient suffers in such a death, and whether nurses and doctors, trained to relieve suffering, might be harmed by their involvement, either psychologically or through legal liability. ''The coming together of two laudable movements - death with dignity and cost containment - concerns me,'' Dr. Siegler added. ''You start with those in a permanent vegetative state. Then you move to the mentally retarded, the permanently senile, seriously ill defective newborns and the physically handicapped. Patients have a right to die. But do they have a duty to die?'' Against Feeding Proponents are not so much opposed to artificial feeding as they are in favor of giving the patient or his surrogate the choice to stop. This argument tends to focus on an individual's right to privacy and to control his medical treatment, rights upheld by higher courts, although patients in test cases are often officially dead before a final decision emerges. ''The right to be left alone is what it's all about,'' said Frank Reardon, a Boston attorney representing the family of Paul Brophy in what is expected to become the next precedent-setting court case in the feeding controversy. Mr. Brophy, a 49-year-old fireman, has been in a vegetative state for three years with no hope of recovery, a hopeless twilight in which an estimated 10,000 others dwell. His family wants a permanent feeding tube removed, saying his life actually ended three years ago. The hospital has refused. A probate court decision upholding the hospital is on appeal to the state's highest court. The Rev. John J. Paris, an ethics professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., argues that it is acceptable to stop artificial feeding that merely prolongs a hopeless condition. In fact, he says, it is morally wrong to prop up hopelessly ill patients with artificial food, leaving them ''in a state of suspended animation halfway between life and death.'' Dr. Joanne Lynn, who was assistant director of the Presidential commission on medical ethics, acknowledges the emotional symbolism of food. ''Many people find the slurries we pour down patient's tubes as somehow similar to Grandma's soup as an expression of tenderness and caring,'' she said. Even small amounts of food spooned into the dying, she said, can be ''nutrition for the souls of the survivors,'' if nutritionally negligible for the patient. She places part of the blame on the modern setting for the sick: the hospital jammed with technology and teams of specialists, instead of the bedroom at home with the family and its longtime doctor. ''Fifty years ago,'' she says, ''it wasn't considered starvation if a dying patient at home didn't eat for a few days before the end. Doctors would never think of requiring a family to force-feed a patient at home. But it is routine in nursing homes.'' Experts note that there are many categories of patients, each case requiring careful consideration, each treatment with a different ratio of benefit to burden for the patient. For Mr. Brophy, they believe, nothing can be done but to honor his wish not to live on machines and chemicals. The most difficult cases come when the benefits to the patient of feeding are not identifiable but the benefits to the family of stopping food are considerable. Many relatives must decide, for instance, whether they should spend a family's savings to maintain a hopelessly ill father or possibly live with a sense of guilt over stopping treatment for financial reasons. The Outlook With no social agreement yet on when life begins, there seems likely to be a continuing series of emotional court cases on when life can end, establishing legal precedents from state to state. Some state legislatures may address the issue on the political level through debates and laws. More likely is the continued gradual development of a social consensus through the combined impact of private experiences, news reports, court rulings and debates in scholarly and popular journals. Polls indicate that a substantial and growing majority of Americans support an individual's right to terminate treatment, even if that means death. Many, however, are concerned about the rapid pace of the debate, which has already reached a last major barrier, food and nutrition. Dr. Lynn is worried that it may quickly become easier and cheaper to let someone die than to get him or her into an expensive hospice or nursing home. ''Staying alive must be an honest option,'' she said, ''I'm an advocate of keeping open the possibility of removing food. But being pro-choice doesn't mean you think it should happen a lot.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADVANCES IN GENETIC FORECASTS INCREASE CONCERNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/19/science/advances-in-genetic-forecasts-increase-concerns.html,"GENETIC analysis to predict a person's health and life expectancy may soon give society unprecedented influence over people's choices in areas ranging from life insurance to careers or even mates. Ethical questions raised by this new ability have been a concern for some time, but as geneticists learn how to discover more and more about human beings, some are growing concerned over the possible uses to which society may put this new power. Scientists believe that all diseases are influenced by genes. Over the years, they have learned how to detect in fetuses or infants some well-known genetic disorders such as Down's syndrome, sickle cell anemia and Tay Sachs disease and many other rare ailments. Today, however, advances in genetics research are making it increasingly possible to identify various genetic traits that predispose people to more widespread health problems including diabetes and heart disease, the most common of all life threatening diseases among Americans. ''We are going to be predictive of life expectancy,'' Dr. Kenneth Paigen of University of California at Berkeley said at a genetics seminar held recently at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me. ''We are going to be able to say that somebody has a much greater or much less than average chance of having a heart attack before age 50 or after age 50.'' He and other scientists said the ability to predict future disease and probability of death was likely to give government and other institutions increasing power to make decisions affecting individuals. And they argued that institutions were likely to be more concerned with their own welfare than with that of the individual. The ethics of using information about a person's health prospects has never been a major problem because the predictive power of genetics has been far too limited. But that situation is changing dramatically almost month by month. Geneticists predict that they will soon be able to estimate an individual's risk of developing serious common diseases that arise from a complex mixture of environment and heredity. Predictive tests are being sought for heart disease, diabetes and major forms of mental illness. Some experts believe they will be a reality within five years. But no guidelines exist for their use. Dr. Paigen noted, for example, that most medical schools already hesitated to admit older students because the costly training takes years to complete. Medical schools want to produce physicians whose careers will last long enough to repay society for their training, he said. Airline pilots also need long and expensive training that makes economic sense only if the pilots have a long career. And no one wants an airline pilot who is likely to have a heart attack. What will happen, Dr. Paigen asked, when medical schools and airlines can screen applicants genetically and determine which were likely to have heart attacks in their fifties? The opposite would be true, he suggested, in factory jobs for which training is cheap, but pensions are costly. Would such jobs, he asked, be relegated to people likely to die young? An important complication of this sort of problem is the evidence that some organizations would probably resort to screening even before the tests were proved reliable. For example, Dr. Neil A. Holzman of Johns Hopkins University, which sponsored the genetics meeting with the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, said some insurance companies already require applicants for life insurance to submit to a blood test to detect antibodies against the AIDS virus, even though presence of the antibodies does not prove the individual will develop the deadly disease. Dr. Holzman suggested companies that required the testing might also adopt testing for genetic diseases to protect their investments. Indeed, in the 1970's, some companies began denying insurance to people who were healthy carriers of the sickle cell anemia trait. While the disease itself can be disabling and sometimes fatal, the carrier state involves no known special risks. Today, rapid advances are being made in the ability to diagnose, in a fetus, the existence of some diseases that occur because of a flaw in one or another single gene among the roughly 50,000 to 100,000 that constitute a human's entire genetic archive. These advances have been made possible by the fast pace of research involving DNA, the active substance of the human genes. Dr. Holzman said recent advances in the science would result in a ''tremendous expansion'' of genetic services such as prenatal diagnosis, detection of carriers who may pass a genetic disease trait to their children and genetic screening of population groups. Troublesome problems are already arising because the ability to detect harmful genetic traits has far outrun the ability of science to treat the resulting diseases. Indeed, for most single gene disorders there is neither effective treatment or cure. In most cases, he said, the strategy available to families was limited to prevention of pregnancy, abortion or artificial insemination. Dr. Holzman said that even five years ago, about one third of artificial inseminations in this country were already being done for genetic reasons. In a few genetic diseases, such as PKU or phenylketonuria, a metabolic defect, detection of the defect shortly after birth usually allows doctors to treat it. In PKU, for example, mental retardation can be prevented by limiting the baby to an extremely strict diet. Tests for this disease have been available for more than 20 years, but Dr. Park S. Gerald, a Boston geneticist, said their very success has recently created a new and unexpected problem. Women PKU patients, saved from mental retardation by the diet, are now having children. In some cases, the chemical imbalance in the mother's blood, characteristic of the disease, may endanger the fetus. Soon, Dr. Gerald said, there would almost certainly be a good test for detecting carriers of the trait for cystic fibrosis, a relatively common genetic disease that occurs only if a child inherits the trait from both parents. Dr. Holzman said preliminary studies he had done for Johns Hopkins and Congressional Office of Technology Assessment showed that at least 20 biotechnology companies are either developing or planning to develop tests for genetic disorders. Often, he said, the companies' interests went beyond the rare single gene defects to include such common serious disorders as diabetes and manic depressive illness. Initially, this research would probably be aimed at finding genetic markers to detect the likelihood of disease in children born to families in which the disease has already appeared. But he said there was also commercial interest in going beyond such family linkage studies and search for tests to be used for screening populations. ''These are not pipe dreams,'' he said. ''There are companies investing money in this.'' He and others at the meeting said problems were likely to arise as genetic testing expanded beyond its present limited scope. For example, genetic markers that identify risk of a genetic disorder in the DNA of a fetus often play no role in the disease itself. Such a marker is useful in detecting the disease because the marker segment of DNA is usually inherited with the disease gene in families in which the disease is common. That same marker may not be a sign of disease in a family in which the ailment has not occurred. Dr. Gerald cited other potential problems. Genetic diseases do not always strike with equal severity. Some patients are much more severely affected than others. This complicates genetic diagnosis and counseling. Since there are thousands of different genetic diseases, each caused by a defect in a different gene, increasing ability to detect them poses formidible problems of education for public and physicians. There are also agonizing conflicts between the right to privacy and public responsibility. What does one do, Dr. Gerald asked reporters at a press conference, when studies show that a couple's newborn baby has a hereditary disease, but the parents do not want to tell anyone, even family members? And how does one feel a year or so later, when a brother of one of those parents comes in with another stricken infant in his arms and says ''They tell me there is something I ought to know?'' This, Dr. Gerald said, is an old problem, but one that will need attention even more urgently in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VATICAN CURBS U.S. THEOLOGIAN OVER LIBERAL VIEWS ON SEX ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/19/us/vatican-curbs-us-theologian-over-liberal-views-on-sex-issues.html,"The Vatican yesterday revoked the authorization of a major liberal theologian to teach theology at the Catholic University of America after a protracted battle over the priest's views on sexual issues. The priest, the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a popular lecturer at the university in Washington, has generally argued that the church's opposition to divorce, birth control, homosexual acts and abortion should not be absolute. It was the first time the unusual censure action had been used against an American Roman Catholic theologian. It was last used in 1979 against the Swiss theologian Hans Kung. Letter Made Public In a letter to Father Curran made public late yesterday, the Vatican said it had acted ''in light of your repeated refusal to accept what the church teaches.'' The letter said that the Vatican was notifying Catholic University that ''you will no longer be considered suitable nor eligible to exercise the function of a Professor of Catholic Theology.'' The letter, from Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said that the action had been approved by Pope John Paul II. The action against Father Curran is consistent with the Pope's effort to reassert orthodox Catholic teaching and to discipline those who have been found to have strayed. Last year, for example, the Vatican ordered a period of silence for a Brazilian theologian, the Rev. Leonardo Boff, an exponent of liberation theology, which involves social activism in behalf of the poor. Father Curran's case had deeply divided American Catholics. Liberal Catholics said the Vatican's action against Father Curran violated any sense of intellectual freedom within the church, something that should be maintained especially in a university, they argued. Informed by Chancellor In dissenting from the church's ban on contraception and divorce, Father Curran represented the views of what polls have shown to be a substantial body of American Catholic opinion. Father Curran was informed of the decision at 4 P.M. yesterday by Archbishop James A. Hickey of Washington, Chancellor of Catholic University. Afterward, Father Curran could not be reached for comment at his home or at the University. It was not clear if he would be allowed, or would be willing, to stay on at Catholic University and teach something other than theology. The Vatican action, the letter from Cardinal Ratzinger said, was based ''exclusively on your published works and on your personal responses'' to discussion with Vatican officials. ''In effect,'' the letter said, ''your own works have been your 'accusers' and they alone.'' In his works, Father Curran has argued that the church should acknowledge nuances in regard to sexual issues. In general, he has endorsed the morality of contraception and said that divorce should sometimes be permitted. He has said that abortion, masturbation, premarital sex and homosexual acts are not always immoral. In discussing his case last March, Father Curran said: ''It should be evident that the positions taken by me are neither radical nor rebellious but are in the mainstream of contemporary Roman Catholic theology. I find myself at home in the church and it's as much my church as anyone else's.'' More traditionalist Catholics asserted that because his teachings on birth control, abortion and divorce so clearly contradicted official doctrine, he should not be allowed to teach as a Catholic theologian. Archbishop Backs Judgment This position was summarized by Archbishop Hickey yesterday in a statement released together with Cardinal Ratzinger's letter. ''I fully support this judgment of the Holy See,'' Archbishop Hickey said. ''The Holy Father and the bishops have the right and the duty to insure that what is taught in the name of the church be completely faithful to its full and authentic teaching. The faithful have a right to sound teaching and the church's officially commissioned teachers have a particular responsibility to honor that right.'' This is not the first time that Father Curran has run into trouble with Catholic University as the result of his views. In 1968, he was dismissed after making public statements that birth control was permissible. But he was reinstated after students staged a five-day strike. The Vatican's action yesterday was taken during the summer lull at the campus, which in full swing has 7,000 students. Father Curran, 52 years old, is a priest of the Rochester diocese, who has taught at the university with the permission of his Bishop. His ability to say mass or perform the other sacraments of the church were in no way affected by the Vatican action. Father Curran's case was complicated by the fact that Catholic University is a ''pontifical'' university, that is, under official papal charter, and thus seen as having a special obligation to the Pope and the Vatican. Cardinal Ratzinger's statement referred specifically to Catholic University's pontifical status, suggesting that it was at least possible that Father Curran could end up on the faculty of a Catholic university that did not have pontifical status. The decision on Father Curran constituted one of the Vatican's most important statements on sexual ethics and one of its firmest condemnations of a Catholic theologian. Writings Long Scrutinized The Vatican has been investigating Father Curran's writings since 1979. Earlier this year, the Vatican announced that he had to retract his views or face dismissal. In turn, Father Curran argued that he should be permitted to continue to teach theology because he dissented from church teachings that were ''non-infallible'' and had a right to differ with official church positions. He said that the church's position on matters of sexual ethics were less central to the church's fundamental faith than such questions as the divinity of Jesus or the belief that He rose from the dead. However, in his letter, Cardinal Ratzinger argued that the ''the church does not build its life upon its infallible magisterium alone, but on the teaching of its authentic, ordinary magisterium as well.'' The magisterium refers to the church's teaching authority, and the word ''ordinary'' refers to doctrines that have not been declared ''infallible'' by the Pope, a power the Pontiff rarely uses. In the strongly worded letter yesterday, Cardinal Ratzinger said that the Catholic faithful ''are to give the religious submission of intellect and will to the teaching which the Supreme Pontiff or the College of Bishops enunciate on faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim it with a definitive act.'' ''This,'' the Cardinal wrote to Father Curran ''you have continued to refuse to do.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FRIENDS SAY THEOLOGIAN WILL FIGHT FOR REINSTATEMENT AS PROFESSOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/us/friends-say-theologian-will-fight-for-reinstatement-as-professor.html,"The Rev. Charles E. Curran will fight to be reinstated as a professor of moral theology at Catholic University of America, according to friends of the Roman Catholic theologian who was stripped of his right to teach theology by the Vatican because of his views on sexual issues. Father Curran maintained silence about his plans today, but associates said that he would challenge the dismissal through academic channels, thereby creating a possible clash between Vatican procedures and those of an American university. Meanwhile the president of Catholic University today announced his intention to remove the priest from a tenured position on the faculty of the department of theology, where he has served for 20 years. The president, the Rev. William J. Byron, acted after the Vatican, concluding a six-year investigation, told the 52-year-old Father Curran that he was considered no longer ''suitable nor eligible'' to teach theology ''in light of your repeated refusal to accept what the church teaches.'' Special License Revoked The action, which resulted in the revocation of Father Curran's license to teach theology at that university, was taken with the approval of Pope John Paul II and was consistent with his effort to reassert orthodoxy, an effort that, some say, has had an effect around the world. In Toledo, Ohio, last week, for example, an 11-year-old girl was expelled from Catholic school after she took a public stand in favor of a woman's right to abortion. Father Curran has generally argued that the church's opposition to divorce, birth control, homosexual acts and abortion should not be absolute. His right to express these views has raised the question of the limits of academic freedom at a university chartered by the Vatican. ''I know he will fight the dismissal,'' said Daniel C. Maguire, professor of moral theology at Marquette University in Milwaukee who is a friend of Father Curran. ''He is not simply going to walk away.'' ''I know he has had offers'' to teach theology at other univerities, Dr. Maguire said. ''But he would defer any of those until he sees this through.'' ''That has always been his intention and, I believe, that is still his intention,'' said another friend, the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, chairman of the theology department of the University of Notre Dame, who spoke with Father Curran today. University Grievance Procedure The Catholic University president said that he did not know what Father Curran's next step would be, adding that a dismissed professor has two weeks in which to indicate if he plans to follow the university's grievance procedures to challenge a dismissal. An official of the American Association of University Professors, which represents 52,000 faculty members around the nation, said that Father Curran consulted with him several months ago about the standard legal process followed when a faculty member is removed. The official, Jordan E. Kurland, associate general secretary of the group, said that such procedures can take up to three years and involve tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs. Once a dismissal is announced by the president of a university, the professor can ask for the formation of a faculty committee to review the decision. The committee sits as a formal legal group before which both sides are represented by counsel and can interview and cross-examine witnesses. Although such procedures have been invoked at Catholic universities around the nation, there is no precedent for the Curran case because it represents the first time that the Vatican has reached into an American institution to remove a faculty member. In effect, the faculty committee will have to decide between a colleague and the dictates of the Vatican. Relation to the Vatican The university, which operates under a papal charter, has a special relationship with and obligation to the Vatican. Its Chancellor, Archbishop James A. Hickey of Washington, serves as a representative of the Holy See in conferring upon the faculty a license, called a licentia in Latin, to teach in three departments: canon law, theology and philosophy. In Monday's action the Archbishop revoked Father Curran's license. The Vatican does not have such direct control over other Catholic universities where no such licenses are required to teach, although it is attempting to assert more control over them in a new set of procedures it is considering. It was not clear from the Vatican statement Monday, which was issued by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, whether Father Curran would be permitted to teach at other Catholic institutions or in a department at Catholic University not under Vatican control. The last time the Vatican invoked such a power was in 1979, when it silenced the Rev. Hans Kung of Switzlerland. Father Curran is not regarded by theologians as having the same stature as the Swiss theologian, who in such works as ''The Church'' undertook a total re-evaluation of Catholicism. Father Curran's works are largely compilations of essays on a variety of topics, only one of which has been sexual issues. He is a respected thinker in the field of medical ethics and outlined his views on social justice in his 1982 book, ''American Catholic Social Ethics: 20th Century Approaches.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM MEMO BY THEOLOGIAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/us/excerpts-from-memo-by-theologian.html,"Following are excerpts from a memorandum distributed last spring by the Rev. Charles Curran, a moral theology professor at Catholic University of America, describing his positions. The Sept. 17 letter from Cardinal Ratzinger to me lists the issues on which I dissent from noninfallible church teaching. It is true that I dissent on these issues, but my positions have always been carefully nuanced and they are often in basic agreement with the noninfallible hierarchical teaching. These differences are much narrower than the Sept. 17 letter implies, and the issues are all matters of ordinary, noninfallible teaching, not matters of divine and Catholic faith. The Sept. 17 letter lists four areas of my dissent -1. contraception and sterilization; 2. abortion and euthanasia; 3. masturbation, premarital sexual acts and homosexual acts; 4. the indissolubility of marriage. 1. On the question of contraception and sterilization, I have maintained that these actions are not intrinsically evil but can be good or evil insofar as they are governed by the principles of responsible parenthood and stewardship. However, I have also pointed out the danger of abuse in connection with both contraception and sterilization. 2. On the issues of abortion and euthanasia, I have in a number of places developed in an in-depth way my position on abortion. My position can be succinctly stated: Truly individual human life begins at the time of individuation which occurs between the 14th and 21st day after conception. One can be justified in taking truly individual life only for the sake of the life of the mother or for a value commensurate with life itself. I have never done an in-depth study on euthanasia, but I have occasionally referred to euthanasia as an illustration of other points I was making. Here I tentatively proposed that when the dying process begins there seems to be no difference between the act of omission (not using extraordinary means) and the positive act of bringing about death. I point out that in practice this position would differ only slightly from the official hierarchical teaching and I also recognize possible abuses which may be sufficient reason not to adopt this position in practice. 3. On the question of sexuality, I have discussed at various times the question of masturbation. Again, my position is quite nuanced. Masturbatory acts are ordinarily not very important or significant and usually do not involve grave matter. Such actions are generally symptomatic of other realities and should be treated as such. However, masturbation falls short of the full meaning of human sexuality and should not generally be seen as entirely good or praiseworthy. I have also devoted a number of studies to homosexuality. On the basis of a theology of compromise, I propose that for an irreversible, constitutional or genuine homosexual, homosexual acts in the context of a loving relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be objectively morally acceptable. In general, sexuality should be seen in terms of the female-male relationship so that homosexual relationships fall short of the full meaning of human sexuality. I have not devoted separate studies to premarital sexuality but have considered it within the broader context of sexuality in general. I insist that the full meaning of human sexuality involves a permanent commitment of love between a woman and a man. Pastoral practice here requires prudence in dealing with people who do not accept such an understanding in practice. Only in very rare and comparatively few situations would I justify premarital sexuality on the basis of a theology of compromise. 4. I have dealt at length with the question of the indissolubility of marriage on a number of different occasions. I have argued that the Catholic Church should change its teaching on indissolubility and allow divorce in certain circumstances. The pastoral practice proposed by myself and others for dealing with divorced and remarried Catholics at the present time does not necessarily depend upon this more theoretical position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BAN ON PRIEST IS SAID TO DEFINE MORAL TEACHINGS AS INFALLIBLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/us/ban-on-priest-is-said-to-define-moral-teachings-as-infallible.html,"In censuring an influential American theologian, the Vatican significantly expanded the area of Roman Catholic teaching considered beyond debate, senior Vatican officials said today. The officials, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the ban was an effort to eliminate dissent against the church's positions on sexual morality. The theologian, the Rev. Charles E. Curran, was forbidden Monday to teach Roman Catholic theology at Catholic University of America in Washington. Father Curran's friends say he will fight to remain a tenured professor at the university. A spokesman for the Archdiocese of Washington said the decision to remove Father Curran was made ''according to statute'' by Archbishop James A. Hickey of Washington, chancellor of the university. [ Page A10. ] The action established a modern precedent, according to the Vatican officials, by using the concept of the church's infallibility to punish error in moral teachings, as opposed to doctrinal issues. The judgment can be viewed as opening the way for other efforts to define moral teachings as uncontestable, they said. 'Applies Infallibility' ''Undoubtedly, the decision included a new presentation of the church's teaching authority on moral issues in a way that novelly applies the concept of infallibility to them,'' said an official familiar with the Curran case. ''It is reasonable to expect a further clarification of the extent to which moral teaching is considered binding, because this is viewed as increasingly necessary.'' The censure of Father Curran was the first time since the Second Vatican Council ended, more than 20 years ago, that the Vatican has formally and publicly disciplined a theologian for positions on strictly moral or ethical issues. Under Pope John Paul II, church liberals have increasingly criticized the Vatican for excessive use of its authority to declare certain church teachings uncontestable, and Vatican officials said they expected the decision in Father Curran's case to fuel the debate. In censuring Father Curran, the Vatican applied one of its strongest punishments, the ban on teaching theology, and employed one of the most powerful legal issues, infallibility. The decision was taken by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a kind of judgmental body on matters of Catholic belief. An official of the congregation, who asked not to be named, said the forcefulness of the action was prompted in part by Father Curran's popularity at the university and the substantial influence of his writings generally. Right to 'Responsible' Dissent ''Father Curran presented statistics showing that rejection of church teaching on artificial birth control was widespread in America in order to prove that he was in the mainstream,'' the official said. ''But instead of helping his case, that only increased the determination to deal with him firmly.'' In a prolonged examination of his views by the congregation, Father Curran maintained that he was exercising his right to ''responsible'' dissent when he publicly contested official church teachings on divorce, abortion, premarital sex, homosexuality and other issues, because these teachings had not been solemnly defined as infallible. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, infallibility is a privilege awarded by God to the church, and specifically to the Pope, that instills certain statements with unquestionable truth. When a moral or doctrinal teaching is considered to have been put forth with infallibility, the Second Vatican Council said in 1964, all believers are required to ''maintain and be ruled by'' that position, as a fundamental matter of faith. The Pope has the power to state that he is speaking infallibly on specific, solemn occasions. This is a power almost never explicitly invoked. Teachings espoused by all the church's bishops together with the Pope are less formally considered infallible. A major element in Father Curran's defense of his writings was that none of the church's formal teachings on personal morality had ever been officially declared infallible. Such a declaration was not necessary, said Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, head of the doctrinal congregation, who issued the ruling against Father Curran with the specific approval of Pope John Paul II. Cardinal Ratzinger is widely considered one of the Pope's most important lieutenants because he functions as the Vatican's chief enforcer of orthodoxy. 'Powerful Questions' Raised An official familiar with Cardinal Ratzinger's thinking said: ''This decision shows a deep rejection of Curran's distinction between fallible and infallible teaching. Ratzinger is stating that infallibility is not a category that can be collapsed simply to solemn declarations, and this raises powerful questions about how one identifies infallible teachings in the realm of moral doctrine.'' In the key passage of the decision, which was written as a letter from Cardinal Ratzinger to Father Curran, Cardinal Ratzinger states: ''In any case, the faithful must accept not only the infallible magisterium. They are to give the religious submission of intellect and will to the teaching which the Supreme Pontiff or the College of Bishops enunciate on faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium, even if they do not proclaim it with a definitive act. This you have continued to refuse to do.'' The decision bluntly rejected Father Curran's view that he was free to dissent from a variety of teachings because they had never been declared infallible. Vatican officials said that, to the extent that the priest's dissent had provoked severe punishment, Cardinal Ratzinger had implicitly applied the cloak of infallibility to such positions as the prohibitions on homosexual acts and artificial birth control, even though that status had never been solemnly proclaimed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON TALK; On the Radio,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/21/us/washington-talk-on-the-radio.html,"President Reagan may make more news with his weekly radio address, but Dr. Otis R. Bowen, Secretary of Heath and Human Services, has hit the airwaves himself with a program of medical advice, ''Housecalls.'' Dr. Bowen, who is the first physician ever to head the department, began running his one-minute medical pieces last March, and department officials say the spots have caught on at small- and medium-size radio stations around the country. Of about 6,000 radio stations in the United States, a spokesman said, 600 to 900 carry Dr. Bowen's announcements. At no cost to them, the stations dial a special number run by the department to get a tape-recorded version of Dr. Bowen's piece, which they can record over the phone and use on their own broadcasts, either as part of their news programming or as a public service message. Because the department's production costs are low, the whole program costs only about $25,000 a year, said Richard P. Teske, a spokesman. Dr. Bowen has covered a broad range of topics so far. Some are intentionally light, like pieces on the dangers of fireworks for the Fourth of July weekend or the risks of sunburn over Labor Day. Others have broached more complicated topics. Before doing a five-part series on teen-age pregnancy, Dr. Bowen invited a number of experts in the field to brief him and his staff on some of the relevant issues. But the series did not cover abortion or contraception. The program generally and consciously avoids politically sensitive topics, Mr. Teske said. Which is not to say that the issues are irrelevant. ''Forty percent of all teen-age pregnancies end up in abortions,'' Mr. Teske said. ''We feel if we get the message across about pregnancy the abortion issue would sort of be solved.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Selling Sense About Sex,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/21/opinion/selling-sense-about-sex.html,"Advertising, popular songs and movies attest that sex at the age of, say, 15 has become as American as apple pie. The lives of teen-age mothers and their children attest that it is also as dumb as it always was. That message is still much harder to get across than the joys of intimacy, and that's why New York City has launched a creative cautionary campaign as direct and as alluring as an ad for designer jeans. Photographs of young New Yorkers looking sexy are to adorn subways, buses, public schools and community agencies. But these come-ons will be accompanied by an admonition to ''Be smart about sex,'' along with a telephone number for the city's counseling and health services. The posters will also be shown on television; and a rap artist, L. L. Cool J, has recorded ''Smart Sex Rap'' for radio. There are many reasons that children bear children, but their abortion rate is positive proof that thousands didn't intend to get pregnant. More than 35,000 young New Yorkers got pregnant in 1984; about half of them underwent abortions. An antipregnancy media blitz cannot undo the cumulative effects of the sexual sell that suffuses society. But it will be welcome if, by reducing ignorance, it reduces tragedy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CENSURED PRIEST DEFENDS DISSENT AS A THEOLOGIAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/21/us/censured-priest-defends-dissent-as-a-theologian.html,"The Rev. Charles E. Curran said today that he would continue to teach Roman Catholic moral theology, including his dissenting views on sexual issues, despite the Vatican's ruling that he could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America. ''The theologian has to play the role of the loyal opposition,'' he said in his first public comment since the Vatican action Monday. Such dissent, he said, is consistent with the development of Christianity and with accepted ''Catholic theological tradition.'' Unresolved, however, was whether the 52-year-old priest would be allowed to continue to remain on the faculty of the university, which operates under a papal charter. On Tuesday the president of the university, the Rev. William J. Byron, moved to oust him from the faculty where he has served for 20 years, but Father Curran said today that he was prepared to fight the move through legal and academic channels. ''I am a theological moderate,'' he declared. ''In my judgment and in the judgment of my peers I have been and am suitable and eligible to exercise the function of a professor of Catholic theology.'' Major Issues in the Case Father Curran thus echoed the words that Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, used to censure him. Cardinal Ratzinger, acting with the approval of Pope John Paul II, said that the priest was neither ''suitable nor eligible'' to continue teaching because of his views on sexual matters. The two major issues in the Curran case are church authority and sexual morality, both of which the Vatican feels strongly about. Church observers both in the United States and Rome said that the Vatican, in censuring the American priest, was moving to quell dissent in both areas in one blow. Father Curran said he was a target of the Vatican campaign because he was an American priest, representing a country where there is widespread Catholic opposition to the church's ban on abortion, artificial contraception, divorce and premarital sex. ''There was a definite connection,'' he said, noting that others disciplined by the Vatican in recent years have been from Brazil and the Netherlands, where Catholics have also challenged church teachings. He mentioned the Rev. Leonardo Boff of Brazil and the Rev. Edward Schillebeeckx of the Netherlands. Public opinion surveys have shown that the majority of American Catholics seem to share Father Curran's views on many social matters. Church Teaching Challenged According to a New York Times/ CBS News Poll conducted last November, 68 percent of American Catholics favored the use of contraception and 73 percent favored remarriage for divorced people. Only 15 percent of those polled agreed with the church that there should be an absolute ban on abortion, although 63 percent said that they believed, as does their church, that abortion was murder. Almost four out of five Catholics in the survey said that they felt it was possible to remain a ''good Catholic'' while disagreeing with the pope on birth control, abortion and divorce. On all these issues, Father Curran has challenged church teaching. He has endorsed the morality of contraception and said that divorce and abortion should sometimes be permitted. Father Curran, who appeared today at a crowded news conference in a lecture hall at Catholic University, challenged the Vatican to alter its teaching on sexual matters. ''I remain convinced that the hierarchical teaching office in the Roman Catholic Church must allow dissent on these issues and ultimately should change its teaching,'' he said. ''According to Catholic theological tradition, the word and work of Jesus must always be made present and meaningful in the contemporary historical and cultural circumstances.'' 'Fudged the Distinction' Father Curran said that in preparing a case against him, Cardinal Ratzinger had ''fudged the distinction between 'infallible' and 'noninfallible' '' church positions. Infallible teaching refers to issues that are fundamental to the faith, such as the question of the divinity of Jesus or the virginity of Mary. On sexual issues, Father Curran said, ''we are dealing with the noninfallible hierarchical teaching'' that are open to dissent. In his letter, Cardinal Ratzinger argued ''that the church does not build its life upon its infallible magisterium alone, but on the teaching of its authentic, ordinary magisterium as well.'' The magisterium refers to the church's teaching authority, and the word ''ordinary'' refers to doctrines that have not been declared ''infallible'' by the pope, a power he rarely uses. In response, Father Curran said: ''My positions on the particular issues involved are always carefully nuanced and often in fundamental agreement with the existing hierarchical teaching. Yes, occasionally I have dissented from the official teaching on some aspects of specific issues, but this is within a more general and prevailing context of assent.'' Several times in the news conference, which lasted more than an hour, Father Curran asserted, ''I remain a loyal and committed Roman Catholic.'' When asked if the action taken against him would encourage Catholics of like mind to leave the church, he said, ''I would strongly urge people not to get out, but to struggle and try to change the church.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HIRSCHFELD, A PERSISTENT CANDIDATE, PRESSES AHEAD",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/22/nyregion/hirschfeld-a-persistent-candidate-presses-ahead.html,"Arthur Mesches was behind the counter at Art's Cleaners on Hertel Avenue in north Buffalo the other day when Abraham Hirschfeld marched in, stuck out his freckled hand and introduced himself. ''It's not every day you meet a millionaire,'' said Mr. Mesches as he greeted Mr. Hirschfeld, a New York City developer and frequent political contestant, who has enlivened the primary season by challenging Representative Stan Lundine, Governor Cuomo's handpicked candidate for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor. ''So, shake my hand!'' Mr. Hirschfeld said, with the rising inflections and thick vowels of his native Poland. ''Maybe something will rub off!'' Not a Hotbed of Support Even in upstate New York, home of Mr. Lundine and therefore not a hotbed of support for Mr. Hirschfeld, the 66-year-old maverick candidate finds that people know a handful of things about him: * That Mr. Hirschfeld is rich, very rich, rich enough to spend more than $2 million of his own fortune - estimated at $500 million - on a race in which his chances are widely believed to be slim. * That he is Jewish, was born in Poland and is an American success story, bootstraps style, with his rise to wealth as a developer of parking garages. * That he is sometimes outrageous and unapologetic about it - speaking his mind, telling off-color jokes in public and once literally spitting in the face of a political opponent. * That he has been the target of an aggressive effort to remove him from the primary ballot, an effort led by Governor Cuomo's son and other top Cuomo advisers. On Tuesday, a state judge disqualified Mr. Hirschfeld; an appeal is to be heard next week. Despite his bitter relationship with Mr. Cuomo, whose Presidential prospects could turn the lieutenant governor into the state's chief executive, Mr. Hirschfeld argues that the two men would make a fine match. ''A marriage made in heaven,'' he said. ''He's a talker and I'm a doer. I will never match his ability to speak and he will never match my ability to implement - and implement in a way where it won't be an abomination like the 63d Street tunnel, the Woll-man Rink or the Buffalo Metro.'' Mr. Hirschfeld takes most insults in stride, his skin as thick as his wallet. If he is called an eccentric, he says all interesting people are crazy. If he is accused of using his wealth to buy an election, he says a man who needs no contributors cannot be bought. If he is teased about his command of the language, he warns that if he is elected, Albany's bigwigs will have to ''go back to college to study broken English.'' Even when criticized as having a sketchy knowledge of state issues, Mr. Hirschfeld is unbowed. So what, he said, if he doesn't know exactly how the ''save harmless'' feature works in the school aid formula. ''My greatest asset,'' he said, ''is following the saying that 'he is smart who knows what he doesn't know.' That's why I go to a doctor, a lawyer and an architect.'' But, beneath the bravado, Mr. Hirschfeld seems eager to please and wounded by the Cuomo effort to disqualify him. He might even have withdrawn from the race, he said, if only Mr. Cuomo had agreed to a face-to-face talk to explain his opposition. ''I don't need for myself anything,'' he said. ''I'm not a poltician that doesn't have where to go if I don't get the job.'' He asks those around him why Mr. Cuomo dislikes him so much, why Mr. Lundine does not talk to him. ''I only shook hands with him once,'' Mr. Hirschfeld said of his opponent. ''Always he's running away from me.'' Mr. Hirschfeld is strongest on the economic and development issues and fancies himself another Robert Moses, the official who a half-century ago transformed the region with new parks, highways and housing. Mr. Hirschfeld sounds knowledgable discussing abolition of the state sales tax or the creation of so-called enterprise zones, but flounders on other subjects. A case in point is a conversation that Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat and longtime Hirschfeld critic, said he had with him about abortion last spring. Mr. Nadler said the conversation went like this: ''I'm in favor of it,'' Mr. Hirschfeld said. ''But I'm opposed to Medicaid funding. I don't think taxpayers should subsidize Rockefeller's daughter.'' ''Abe, do you know what Medicaid is?'' Mr. Nadler replied. ''It's only for poor people.'' ''Really?'' Mr. Hirschfeld said. ''So, in that case I'm for Medicaid funding.'' 'What Could You Say?' Mr. Nadler recalled: ''I just looked at him. What could you say?'' Mr. Hirschfeld's chief spokesman, Lou Gordon, blamed language problems for such confusion. ''There are catchwords,'' he said, ''words like workfare and affirmative action, that are well understood by those enmeshed in the language of government. Abe does not pick them up quickly, but when you explain the concept, he'll say, 'Yeah, I'm for that.' '' Some of Mr. Hirschfeld's positions include strict gun control, subsidizing prescription drugs for the elderly and stiffening banking laws to discourage money laundering by drug dealers. His campaign has had a heavy staff turnover. ''He's on the third or fourth team already,'' said Jerry Skurnik, a former aide to Mayor Koch, who spent three months on the Hirschfeld staff. Present and former campaign aides said Mr. Hirschfeld often spurned advice, made intemperate remarks and acted like a bully. Several ex-employees contend that he failed to pay them. Mr. Hirschfeld offers extravagant salaries, according to the aides. One political consultant, who asked not to be identified, said he was paid $10,000 a month to attend weekly meetings and offer advice by telephone. Mr. Hirschfeld characterizes himself as gullible, particularly in regard to established politicians, whose campaigns he has supported and whose help he expected but was denied. ''My problem is I trust everybody,'' he said. ''You never go wrong with business people. With politicians, you shake hands and you better count your fingers.'' ''He's like an open book,'' Zipora Hirschfeld, his wife, said. ''Everybody he thinks is his best friend.'' Over the years, Mr. Hirschfeld has been spurned by dozens of powerful state Democrats. In an incident in 1974, Mr. Hirschfeld, seeking a United States Senate seat, insisted he had a commitment from Stanley Steingut, then the Assembly minority leader, who failed to support him at the convention. The next day, Mr. Hirschfeld retaliated by spitting in Mr. Steingut's face, an action he said he does not regret. Nor does he regret investing so much in this campaign. ''If I win, I'll be making $80,000 a year,'' he said. ''If I lose, I'll be making $80,000 a week.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW IMAGE IS SOUGHT BY VOTERS' LEAGUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/nyregion/new-image-is-sought-by-voters-league.html,"CONCERNED about declining membership, the Connecticut League of Women Voters wants to update its image. ''People think we're a bunch of old, gray-haired ladies with tennis shoes who sit back and tell people who to vote for,'' said Sheila Wartel, vice president for communications for the Hamden-based organization. ''But we do more than that and we're not just ladies. We're a mixed bag of things, and people just don't understand that.'' The league is seeking to shed its old image via aggressive marketing techniques, new brochures, more emphasis on women's issues, attracting men and younger women as members and persuading the media to cover more of its events. The League of Women Voters, which has local, state and national chapters, was established in 1920 as an outgrowth of the women's suffrage movement. Its workers are volunteers, except for executive directors and secretaries. Statewide there are 44 groups, with a total of 3,500 members, down from about 4,500 over the last few years, league officials said. The Connecticut chapter, inspired by a similar effort by the national organization, is moving quickly to amend its ways, said its president, Jane Garbacz. During her six years as a member, nothing much has changed in the organization, Ms. Garbacz acknowledged. ''I watched us do the same things over and over again,'' she said. ''No one was questioning us on why we were doing what we were doing. We had to ask ourselves, 'Are there any changes that need to be made?' '' The answer was a unanimous yes. So the league asked the Stamford office of Coopers and Lybrand, the management consulting company, to draw up an action plan. The company supplied information on issues the league would face over the next five years and ways to approach them. With advice in hand, state league leaders are now working out strategies. One way the league will try to appeal to younger people is by stressing that it does not just hold debates and tell people how to register, said Nancy Beals, the vice president for programs. Although the league is nonpartisan, it is issue-oriented and adopts positions, she said. It has lobbied for affordable day care, clean air, control of acid rain, tax reform, marital property rights and takes a pro-choice stand on abortion. Recently the league worked with Common Cause and the Connecticut Bar Association in the removal of the party lever on voting machines, permitting voters to now split their votes between candidates of different parties. It also worked with State Senator Richard B. Johnston, Republican of Wethersfield and co-chairman of the Assembly's Judiciary Committee, on merit selection of judges. Mr. Johnston said the league was helpful in providing information on how his constituency felt about the issue. Ms. Beals said that the league would also like to ''make it possible for working women and men to participate.'' ''Some may not be as satisfied with their careers as they thought they would be,'' she said. ''The league can provide fulfillment.'' But Ms. Wartel pointed out that unless the league becomes more aggressive - ''We've sat back on our laurels too long'' - it will be difficult to appeal to a wide range of people. She cited communication as its biggest weakness and her top priority. A new membership flier is one way Ms. Wartel hopes to grab the attention of those under 40. Along with a more contemporary looking cover, the pamphlet will feature testimonies from younger members, male and female, on why they joined the league. The league is also looking for ways to distribute the fliers to reach a larger population. The league is also hoping to sell several thousand copies of a board game called Campaign for Election. The game, geared to 10-year-olds and up, was donated to the league by Ronald Morgan Gregory, a Wallingford lawyer who created the game to educate people about the election process. The game comes complete with press releases, campaign money and slogans. It sells for $5, and anyone can buy one by contacting league headquarters. To increase accessiblity to the league's headquarters, Ms. Wartel wants to set up a toll-free number. But because of the cost, she said she needs to find a corporatate sponsor. ''In some ways our name works to our detriment, as we try to recruit more men,'' Ms. Garbacz said. She would also like to create public service announcements featuring the league's male members. The state and national chapters have a 5 percent male membership, she said. State Representative Raymond V. Collins, a Republican of West Haven and a league member, said the league is ''a pretty dynamic group. It's because of them that the household hazardous waste program started out.'' He said he joined the league because it is ''a nonpartisan political group and I wanted access to their issue research.'' He said he reviewsthe research the group does before he attends public hearings, and it helps him know public sentiment. State Representative Peter M. Lerner, Republican of Woodbridge, said he joined because he was impressed with some of the members. ''The league has a very strong presence in Hartford,'' he said. Ms. Beals noted that ''nobody wants to join an organization that just is; they want to be involved in one that's doing something.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IDEAS & TRENDS; CATHOLICISM, DEMOCRACY AND THE CASE OF FATHER CURRAN",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/weekinreview/ideas-trends-catholicism-democracy-and-the-case-of-father-curran.html,"THE Vatican's censure last week of the Rev. Charles E. Curran was the latest, and probably the most dramatic, offensive in a long battle by Rome to keep the American Roman Catholic Church in line with Vatican teaching on sexual issues. In a letter written with the approval of Pope John Paul II, Father Curran was told that he was neither ''suitable nor eligible'' to continue teaching theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington. The step was taken, the letter said, because Father Curran has repeatedly challenged the church's absolute ban on artificial birth control, homosexuality, abortion, premarital sex and divorce. Father Curran has maintained that there are times when these acts can be morally justified - views that, according to public opinion polls, are shared by a majority of American Catholics. The Vatican and its representatives have recently taken other steps, too, to rein in American dissidents in areas of sexual morality and church teaching on the role of women. Among these other instances: * Two nuns, Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey, have been warned by the Vatican that they will be thrown out of their order unless they recant their view that there is diversity of Catholic thought on abortion. The nuns work with the homeless in Charleston, W. Va. * An 11-year-old from Toledo, Ohio, Sarabeth Eason, was told by her pastor this month that she could not return to her Catholic school because she would not renounce public statements in favor of a right to abortion. The priest acted with the support of the Bishop of Toledo. * The appointment of a Jesuit theologian, the Rev. Michael J. Buckley of Berkeley, Calif., as a key adviser to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops is being reconsidered. The review was ordered this summer after it was revealed that Father Buckley signed a letter nine years ago supporting the ordination of women. * Last week another Jesuit, the Rev. Terrance A. Sweeney, resigned from the Jesuit order rather than obey his superior's command to destroy the results of a survey he made of United States bishops on the issues of celibacy and women in the priesthood. What was also interesting about the Sweeney survey was the results. In the replies, from 145 of the 312 bishops, nearly one-quarter said priests should be allowed to marry and 8 percent that women should be ordained. If there is budding dissent among the bishops, it has already flowered among the laity. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll of Catholics conducted last November, 63 percent favored allowing priests to marry and 52 percent favored women in the priesthood. The survey also showed wide support for the Second Vatican Council, which 20 years ago introduced sweeping reforms in Catholic life. On issues of sexual conduct, 68 percent approved the use of contraceptives and 73 percent approved remarriage for divorced people. And while 63 percent agreed with their church that abortion is murder, only 15 percent opposed it in all circumstances. Father Curran has asserted the right of theologians to dissent on sexual issues. ''According to Catholic theological tradition,'' he said last week, ''the word and work of Jesus must always be made present and meaningful in the contemporary historical and cultural circumstances.'' He pledged to fight his dismissal and continue to speak out as the church's ''loyal opposition.'' The model of the church that Father Curran envisions is a particularly American one, with scholars, bishops and the laity all participating in the forging of the Catholic faith. In the view of the Vatican, there appears to be little room for the democratic model, or even the loyal opposition; rather, authority and direction flow from the top. As Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said in a letter to Father Curran last year: ''It must be recognized that the authorities of the Church cannot allow the present situation to continue in which the inherent contradiction is prolonged that one who is to teach in the name of the Church in fact denies her teaching.'' It was Cardinal Ratzinger who, hoping to end that ''contradiction,'' sent the letter to Father Curran last week. With that move, a Vatican spokesman said later in the week, Rome was leaving the issue to the American bishops. That, however, would be no small task. First, the Americans faced the possibility of a long, divisive battle to remove Father Curran from his tenured position at Catholic University, where he has taught for 20 years. In addition, because the Vatican move has largely been interpreted on Catholic campuses as a challenge to academic freedom, American Catholic leaders may have to reassure their faculties and students that theological inquiry has possibilities as well as limits. Finally, while Rome said it was leaving the matter to the American bishops, there was little doubt that the Vatican would be looking over their shoulders, ready to intervene if necessary to keep the American church in line.

You quoted us as saying that Jerome Cardinal Hamer had misrepresented our stands on abortion in an attempt to pressure and isolate Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro, two sisters of Notre Dame who have displayed unusual courage in refusing to agree to any statement that is not their own. What we said was far stronger than that. We ''categorically denied'' the Cardinal's assertion that we had ever made ''public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion''; we ''objected to the misuse of settlements in our cases to pressure and isolate Barbara and Patricia,'' and we declared that we continue to ''stand in solidarity with them in their ongoing struggle.'' For my part, I wish to make clear that I continue to stand be-hind every word of the ''Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion,'' just as I did on the day I signed it.

WASHINGTON TALK; BRIEFING; An Anniversary,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/26/us/washington-talk-briefing-an-anniversary.html,"Today is the 66th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote, and the National Organization for Women is using the occasion to organize support for the proposed Civil Rights Restoration Act. The bill would make it unlawful for any institution receiving Federal money to discriminate against women or members of minority groups in any of the institution's programs, whether or not the Federal money was used specifically for the program at issue. NOW and other women's rights groups say the legislation is an antidote to a Supreme Court decision in 1984 that held that the anti-discrimination provisions of the Education Amendments of 1972 did not apply to programs like athletics if those programs did not themselves use Federal money, even though the institution administering the programs received Federal money for other purposes. When the Civil Rights Restoration Act was first offered, just after the Supreme Court decision, the House adopted it by a vote of 375 to 34. But it was never voted on in the Senate, where Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah introduced several hundred amendments, effectively killing it. The bill was reintroduced in the House in 1985, but has languished ever since, largely because opponents have managed to attach an anti-abortion amendment to it that makes the bill unacceptable to the very groups that backed it originally. Today, on the anniversary of women's suffrage, NOW will put workers on the streets in 81 cities accepting donations and passing out stickers with the themes ''Give Girls a Chance'' and ''Go for the Gold,'' emphasizing women in Olympic competition. Organizers concede they have little chance to revive the bill before Congress adjourns in early October, but they also note that Congressional approval of the 19th Amendment took seven decades of effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WITH EYE TO NOVEMBER, DYSON STRESSES WEALTH",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/26/nyregion/with-eye-to-november-dyson-stresses-wealth.html,"John S. Dyson has been an unusual candidate. He started out the year as a potential Democratic-Conservative candidate for State Comptroller. He is now the Liberal Party candidate for the United States Senate and is seeking the Democratic nomination in the Sept. 9 primary. What happened in between is that the Conservatives patched up their differences with State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a Republican, and Governor Cuomo decided two things, according to the Governor's aides and Mr. Dyson: that Mr. Dyson's personal wealth would make him a stronger candidate than Mark Green against Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and that the race for Comptroller would be ideal for a black or Hispanic candidate on the Cuomo ticket. The Governor is officially neutral in the Dyson-Green primary, but the state party establishment endorsed Mr. Dyson because the Governor feared, his aides acknowledge, that Senator D'Amato, with his $8 million campaign treasury, would pull far more votes than the Governor this November -hardly an auspicious start if Mr. Cuomo decides to run for President in 1988. Issue of Resources The question of Mr. Dyson's ideology has been seized by Mr. Green as a major issue in a primary in which the electorate is generally liberal. Mr. Dyson has made an asset of his money, saying that only he has the resources to beat Mr. D'Amato. His own polls show he is the front-runner in the primary and even Mr. Green agrees that Mr. Dyson is ahead. Mr. Dyson, who describes himself as ''a moderate Democrat'' in the mold of the state's Democratic Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, sees himself in tune with the swing rightward in politics, which he believes has occurred even in New York, once the bastion of liberalism. In a luncheon interview yesterday, Mr. Dyson talked of Mr. Green's ''awe-inspiring arrogance.'' He referred to his opponent as ''this elitist who sets himself up as the arbiter of who is the real Democrat - how would he know?'' Mr. Green has charged that Mr. Dyson is ''a closet Republican'' and an ''imitation of Al D'Amato'' who has switched his ideological stripes for the benefit of the Democratic primary constituency. He has also accused Mr. Dyson of trying to ''buy'' the Democratic nomination. Mr. Dyson is trying to turn to his favor the widespread perception that Mr. D'Amato is nearly invincible. He argues that he, not Mr. Green, is better equipped to defeat Mr. D'Amato because he has his own wealth to counter the D'Amato campaign treasury; the Liberal Party endorsement to provide a united anti-D'Amato front in November, and a record in public office. He is a former chairman of the State Power Authority, a former State Agriculture and State Commerce commissioner. 'Record of Service' ''There is only one Democrat with a record of service in this state, only one who has the resources and ability to raise funds and to make a real contest with a very well-funded opponent and only one with a Liberal Party that would make a united challenge in the fall,'' Mr. Dyson said at an often vituperative debate with Mr. Green last week at The New York Times. The 43-year-old Mr. Dyson said in an interview that he has set aside $6 million of his $30 million fortune for the Democratic primary and general election - about $4 million in the primary and $2 million in the general election. He said that Governor Cuomo has promised to raise $1 million for the general election campaign and that he expected another $1 million from fund-raising, including money from the Democratic Senatorial campaign committee. Mr. Dyson's wealth comes from his father, a businessman who bought and sold small companies. The candidate himself also heads a mini-conglomerate of five companies that manufacture, among other things, lollipop sticks, cable connectors, trailer hitches and bicycle pumps. He has a 100-acre vineyard at his Dutchess County estate. ''I'm an aggie,'' said Mr. Dyson, who graduated from Cornell with a degree in agricultural economics and from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. A Candid Official Money got Mr. Dyson into politics and government in the first place. When he was first appointed Agriculture Commissioner by Governor Carey in 1975, he was best known as a party contributor. He served continuously in state government until he resigned last year as the Power Authority chairman to return to private business and to prepare for the rough-and-tumble world of elective politics. He had run once before - unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives in a Hudson Valley district in 1968 -and was also a prospective candidate for governor or lieutenant governor in 1982. He dropped out as other Democratic candidates, including Mr. Cuomo, pre-empted the field. Although his money is a significant factor in his political career, Mr. Dyson is best known as a frank official, candid to the point of acerbic. He acknowledges that he does not suffer fools lightly. He said, however, that he has mellowed, ''not because I'm wiser but because I'm wearier.'' But, Mr. Dyson cannot resist combat. His campaign has been built on ignoring Mr. Green and concentrating attacks on Senator D'Amato. But, after initially brushing off Mr. Green in interviews, Mr. Dyson has given way to counterattacks, based largely on the contention that Mr. Green ''has no record.'' Two New Commercials Despite the verbal forays, Mr. Dyson is letting a $3 million television campaign do most of his talking. The commercials have been on the air for weeks and will be markedly stepped up this week while Mr. Green is still trying to raise funds for commercials in the final week of the campaign. Mr. Dyson cut two new commercials yesterday at a West Side studio. The initial four commercials were largely biographical and credited prominently Mr. Dyson for the ''I H New York'' campaign that was begun while he was Commerce Commissioner. One of the new commercials also concentrates on the Dyson record; the other criticizes Mr. D'Amato's position on abortion and hand-gun control. Mr. Green is not mentioned. The importance of the Dyson money and presence on television is evidenced in a number of ways. He is concentrating less on street campaigning than Mr. Green and has given a prominent role to two experienced professionals, Philip Friedman and Hank Morris, the advertising and political consultants whose Fifth Avenue office is the command center for the campaign. Mr. Dyson freely admits that he would face an uphill battle in supplanting Mr. D'Amato. If it were not so difficult, he said, he probably would have considerably more competition for the Democratic nomination. It is a view widely shared. On Sunday, Mr. Dyson visited the Brighton Beach Baths and was introduced to Max Sultan, a local Democratic captain who was billed as an expert in turning out Democratic voters. A few moments after the Dyson entourage had passed, Mr. Sultan, sunning himself in a beach chair near a half-dozen friends, said that whoever wins Senate primary will have a tough time defeating Mr. D'Amato. ''His name is well known to every nationality,'' Mr. Sultan said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/books/books-of-the-times-758786.html,"ROGER'S VERSION. By John Updike. 329 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95. ONE October day in 1984, a young computer hacker named Dale Kohler walks into Roger Lambert's office at the divinity school and makes a noisy announcement. God not only exists, he insists, but He won't be able to hide much longer: already scientific evidence points to His existence, and soon, very soon, someone will extract His presence from the statistics of high-energy physics - they'll succeed in pulling ''the divine rabbit from the cosmic hat.'' It's a proposition that Roger, a lapsed minister, finds esthetically and ethically repulsive - ''aesthetically because it describes a God Who lets Himself be intellectually trapped, and ethically because it eliminates faith from religion.'' Such a scenario might at first sound like alien territory for Mr. Updike, and yet, one quickly realizes, it provides him with a comfortable armature on which to drape some of his favorite preoccupations. Questions of faith and existential doubt, after all, hover along the margins of many of his novels - surfacing explicitly in ''The Poorhouse Fair,'' ''A Month of Sundays'' and most recently in ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' which featured the Devil in a starring role -and his heroes, over the years, have all suffered from ''the tension and guilt of being human.'' Torn between vestigial spiritual yearnings and the new imperatives of self-fulfillment, they hunger for salvation even as they submit to the importunate demands of the flesh. In fact, as ''Roger's Version'' unfolds, adultery - as well as the attendant emotions of jealousy, guilt and resentment - begins to push the question of religion off center stage, giving Mr. Updike plenty of room to examine, with his usual skill, the patternings and shadows of domestic life in the middle class. Dale, it seems, has not only become Roger's intellectual sparring partner, but he's also insinuated himself as a sexual rival -every afternoon, he meets Esther, Roger's bored, frustrated wife, taking her to bed in a musty attic room. Roger, however, doesn't seem particularly upset, having become distracted, himself, by Verna, an angry young woman with an illegitimate child who happens to be his niece and a friend of Dale's. Looking at the book from a distance, there seems to be something a little schematic about the geometry between these two adulterous couples. Roger and Esther's bourgeois life in a nice, shady university neighborhood stands in neat opposition to the grungy, makeshift student world inhabited by Dale and Verna, and their jaded weariness similarly counterpoints the younger people's fierceness and passion. Esther is petite and brittle, while Verna is blowzy and lush; Roger has settled into the complacency of middle-age while Dale, at the beginning at least, burns with the idealistic fervor of youth. What these people all seem to share is a faint air of desperation: they feel trapped in their lives, suffocated by circumstance and circumscribed relationships, and they seek temporary relief in the release of illicit sex. For all their talk about God and theology, they end up suffering from a sort of spiritual fatigue, a loss of innocence that brings them face to face with the fact of their own mortality, and it makes them feel nervous and unsafe. Smoking a pipe, for instance, makes Roger think of lip cancer, which makes him think of death; and the smell of wine reminds him of fermentation, which reminds him of rot, which reminds him that life is a form of decay. Indeed, Roger seems almost irretrievably sunk in the dark chiaroscuro of middle age - he comes across as a sort of academic, upper-middle-class version of Harry Angstrom in ''Rabbit Is Rich'' - and as the narrator, his sourness tends to permeate the overall book, lending it a decidedly depressive air. Both Roger and his creator seem to regard human beings as damaged, fallen creatures, capable of enjoying earthly freedom but doomed, all the same, to measure their lives by the distance they've fallen from God. ''The world is mired in sin,'' Roger tells Verna, by way of urging her to get an abortion, and ''In this mire we try to determine the lesser of available evils.'' Roger, himself, isn't a particularly likable fellow - he's described, at one point, as ''so gray and broody, so evil'' - and his pompous debating with Dale reveals him to be one of those former believers whose faith has shriveled into manipulative intellectual posturing. Dale, on his part, is somewhat less offensive, but he comes across as a nerd, a buffoonish seeker of truth who confuses numbers and scientific mumbo jumbo for the real thing. As for the women, they're both pretty disagreeable creatures: Esther emerges as a bitter housewife who vacillates between whiny complaining and tipsy flirtation, and Verna as a loud, foul-mouthed tart who takes out her frustrations on her own child. Such unpleasant characters might make for rather grim reading, but by presenting them through the scrim of his narrator, Mr. Updike diffuses some of their vitriol. Further, his command of narrative techniques -his orchestration of emotional and physical details, his modulation of voice, his quick, lyric facility with language - is so assured in this novel, so fluent, that even the most hesistant reader is soon drawn irresistibly into Roger's fictional world. Not only is Roger's domestic life mapped out in all its banality and capacity for surprise, but the larger social matrix he inhabits - the hermetic university community where he lives and teaches, as well as the sprawling city around it, a city of poverty and random despair - is also delineated with anthropological care. Portrayed in much the way that Saul Bellow portrayed Chicago in ''The Dean's December,'' this unnamed city may remind the reader specifically of Boston. And yet, at the same time, it opens out into a window on contemporary America, turning ''Roger's Version'' into another eloquent chapter in Mr. Updike's continuing effort to memorialize the way we live today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN, A FAST STARTER, MEETS CRANSTON REALITIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/us/california-republican-a-fast-starter-meets-cranston-realities.html,"This is one of those places that lay claim to seeing the future first. In the bosom of the high-technology area around San Jose, it is the home of many entrepreneurs and technicians, the heroes of Ronald Reagan's vision of America in the 1980's. As a class, these voters have been at the center of political plans as both parties look to 1988. And so, for many Republicans, it seemed unrelieved good fortune when Representative Ed Zschau, who lives here, won the party's nomination to challenge Senator Alan Cranston this November. Not only did this give the Republicans a good shot at a seat they regard as important to their efforts to hold the Senate; Mr. Zschau's victory also put on display an attractive picture of a new Republican Party. Yet Senator Cranston, a tireless campaigner and fund-raiser with a well-developed instinct for the jugular, appears to have put Mr. Zschau on the defensive. He Describes a Fastasy On paper, said Mervin Field, California's premier poll-taker, Mr. Zschau was a nearly perfect candidate. ''If you were writing a scenario for a Republican candidate,'' said Mr. Field, ''you'd say let's take a moderate young guy. We'll have our tiger not campaign too much. We don't care if he's unknown, he won't be seen as a threat very early. Just raise a lot of money and put him on television. And he'll win. ''And,'' Mr. Field said, ''that's exactly what happened.'' Against a divided primary field heavily weighted to southern California and conservatives, Mr. Zschau, the candidate from up north who supported the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and choice on abortion swept from nowhere to win the nomination with 37 percent of the vote. Mr. Zschau's handlers even turned his strange-looking name - it's pronounced like the first syllable of ''shower'' - into an asset. They have run millions of dollars in advertisements in which the name whooshes onto the screen, materializing almost as from space, while an announcer intones the syllable ''Shhhhoww.'' It Is a Catch Word ''You'll find little kids on the street looking at each other and suddenly saying, 'Shhhoww,' '' said Sandy Conlan, the campaign press secretary. Yet something has gone wrong with the candidate who could appeal to the young, and particularly the young professionals who like low taxes and social tolerance and who are, in the phrase of the Republican poll-taker Robert Teeter, ''pro-choice on everything.'' The something might be described in two words: Alan Cranston. Within 24 hours of the primary Mr. Cranston took off after Mr. Zschau with biting political commercials. He took advantage of the fact that few Californians, although they had learned how to pronounce Mr. Zschau's name, knew much about him. The Cranston campaign zeroed in on issues where Mr. Zschau had modified his stand or, in the view of the Cranston campaign, contradicted earlier positions. These included aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, South Africa sanctions, Israel, the nuclear freeze and the MX missile. He Turns the Weapon Around Seeking to turn Mr. Zschau's heavy use of television commercials against him, one Cranston ad depicted the Congressman's face on a piece of simulated film. As images of the 46-year-old legislator flicked by wildly, an announcer gave the Cranston view of his shifts and concluded, heavy with sarcasm, ''We're electing a Senator, not a commercial.'' Mr. Cranston held an ''Ed Zschau Memorial Flip-Flop Pancake Breakfast'' and charged, ''Mr. Zschau doesn't have the courage of his nonconvictions.'' Darry Sragow, Mr. Cranston's campaign manager, could hardly be more gleeful at the results, and he can hardly speak a sentence without the words ''flip-flop.'' Theft of the Advantage Seen Patrick H. Caddell, Mr. Cranston's poll-taker, a leading strategist, said that the Cranston strategy of lavishly produced commercials before the primary and the attack the day after had deprived Mr. Zschau of the advantage he might have had as the surprise winner of the nomination. ''Zschau got almost no bounce out of the primary,'' said Mr. Caddell. ''His experience was to walk out the next day and to be suddenly knocked, as it were, on his fanny.'' Mr. Field's most recent findings in the California Poll largely confirmed the Cranston assessment. The poll had Mr. Cranston ahead 51 percent to 38 percent, as against 47 to 38 in late May. The poll of 747 registered voters, conducted by telephone July 24 to Aug. 7, was interpreted by the Cranston forces as a sign that Mr. Zschau's rise had been halted and that the momentum was now with Mr. Cranston. The survey, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, also found Mr. Cranston drawing nearly a third of the vote from moderate Republicans, a group that has been the base of Mr. Zschau's political strength. Mr. Zschau denied the poll represented bad news. He argued that it showed that he had lost none of his own support under the Cranston barrage and that the incumbent Democrat had still not been able to rise above 51 percent in California Polls taken since last November. The Zschau campaign in the meantime called in Sig Rogich to produce a new batch of commercials. Mr. Zschau denied reports of further high-level changes, but Republican officials in Washington are known to be worried. So does Mr. Zschau turn out to be the future that doesn't work after all? Even Democrats say it is too early to conclude this, and the personable Mr. Zschau, his measured tone matching the tranquillity of the yard of his ranch house here, insists that the future is alive and well in Los Altos. He Dismisses the Ads He dismissed the ''flip-flop'' ads, saying they had been tested by his campaign and found to be ''completely ineffective.'' He insisted that voters understood that ''things change, laws change, bills change, facts change.'' ''I'm saving my best punches for when it counts,'' he said. Whatever the merits of this view, what is clear is that Mr. Zschau, whose primary campaign focused on new Republicans and younger voters, is a different kind of Republican. His ''moderation'' comes mainly from averaging out his positions. His liberalism on women's rights and abortion, for example, is matched by a fiercely conservative voting record on spending issues. Mr. Zschau, said David Boaz, vice president of the Libertarian-oriented Cato Institute in Washington, is offering a package that is close to the Libertarian Party's wish for as little state intervention as possible in any area of life. Mr. Zschau acknowledged that a few ardent conservatives, taking an ''actuarial'' view of politics, thought their best bet might lie in re-electing the 72-year-old Mr. Cranston. Under this theory, Mr. Cranston would not be around forever and his seat could ultimately be taken by a truer believer in the Reagan faith. But Mr. Zschau, with a doctorate in business administration and a belief that even politics can be subjected to rational management, said that most conservatives had come around to his cause. ''I'm not trying to win over another wing of the Republican Party - I'm trying to broaden the base,'' he said. This may also be one of the few races in the country where the Republicans will not heavily outspend the Democrats. Although he is seen nationally as a strong liberal, Mr. Cranston has worked closely with the California business community, including, once upon a time, Mr. Zschau himself. Mr. Zschau acknowledged that raising money for the general election had been more difficult, though he is expected to match Mr. Cranston's $10 million to $11 million campaign.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TAINTED CHEESES: HOW DANGEROUS?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/style/tainted-cheeses-how-dangerous.html,"RECENT weeks have brought dismaying news to cheese lovers - warnings from the Federal Food and Drug Administration that a French cheese, Morbier Rippoz, is contaminated with the disease-causing bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. The cheese has been recalled by its importer, Crystal Food Import of East Boston, Mass., the F.D.A. said. In a similar incident in February several brands of imported Brie were taken off the market after the F.D.A. found Listeria monocytogenes contamination. From January to August of 1985, more than 80 people in southern California died in an epidemic of listeriosis that was traced to a manufacturer of Mexican-style soft cheese. What accounts for the sudden prominence of this hitherto obscure microbe and how concerned should people be? Listeria is remarkably widespread in the natural world, yet its transmission to humans is imperfectly understood. Clearly, it is well adapted to the contamination of milk and cheese. Indeed, some scientists have suggested that it may be related to the bacteria that are intentionally used to convert milk into cheese. Listeria monocytogenes was discovered in the early 1920's when it caused an outbreak of disease in laboratory animals at Cambridge University. (Its name derives from the English physician Joseph Lister, who pioneered antiseptic surgical methods, and from a symptom of infection, an increase in the disease-fighting white blood cells called monocytes.) Listeria is now known to cause disease in many species of mammals and birds, and has also been found in trout, crustaceans, ticks, even in soil, dust, streams and decaying vegetation. The first human cases of listeriosis were described in the early 1930's; for two decades, it was thought to be a rare condition contracted by contact with infected farm animals. Since 1950, however, more than 10,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide, and it has become evident that contact with animals is not required. Studies suggest that 1 to 5 percent of the human population carry the bacterium in their intestinal tract. Because most carriers show no signs of serious illness, some scientists believe Listeria may be a normal inhabitant of the human intestine, causing disease only in susceptible people. In otherwise healthy people, exposure to it usually causes a temporary throat or intestinal tract infection, with only mild, flu-like symptoms. However, in people whose immune systems are weak, because of illness, medical treatments or pregnancy, full-fledged listeriosis can develop. The bacterium invades different tissues and organs, and may cause meningitis and encephalitis. A mild infection in a pregnant woman may result in abortion, stillbirth or life-threatening illness in the newborn. Listeriosis can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but the mortality rate is about 30 percent. Evidence linking Listeria to food appeared around 1950, when outbreaks of listeriosis in East Germany were associated with raw milk products. A 1981 outbreak in the Canadian Maritime Provinces was traced to coleslaw made from cabbage fertilized with contaminated manure. A 1983 outbreak in Massachusetts was associated with the consumption of milk from a single dairy. In 1985, more than 180 people fell ill after eating Jalisco brand queso fresco, a soft cheese. Half of the victims were pregnant women or their infants. ''The Jalisco outbreak was serendipitous for us because it was a noticeable increase in listeriosis,'' said Joseph Lovett, deputy chief of the F.D.A.'s bacterial physiology branch. ''If it hadn't been concentrated in Hispanic mother-infant pairs who used the same general hospital, it might not have triggered attention.'' Once investigators implicated the cheese and determined that it had been contaminated with Listeria in the plant, the F.D.A. increased its scrutiny of soft cheeses generally. In the summer of 1985, Listeria contamination was discovered in Liederkranz, Camembert and Brie made in an Ohio plant. ''We found Listeria in French Brie not because we were looking for it -our branch works in basic research, not inspection - but because we were developing better recovery methods,'' Dr. Lovett said. ''Bries were included in the sampling just to cover all the bases, to provide experimental controls.'' There is uncertainty about the means by which Listeria contaminates dairy products. Infected cows with no obvious signs of disease can shed large numbers of Listeria in their milk for months. A cow's teats, a farm worker's hands and farm equipment may be contaminated by contact with infected animals or their wastes, and subsequently contaminate milk. A recent survey by Dr. Lovett and colleagues found that 7 percent of dairy farms tested produced Listeria-tainted milk. Until last year, many believed that Listeria was resistant to heat and could survive proper pasteurization techniques. However, in 1985 Dr. Robert Twedt and colleagues at F.D.A. found that pasteurization effectively eliminates Listeria from tainted milk. The different findings have yet to be resolved. A more likely source of Listeria is improper handling of milk after pasteurization, said Dr. James C. Feeley, former chief of a field investigation unit at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and now consulting microbiologist with Pathogen Control Associates, a consulting group in that city. ''The dairy industry today makes a variety of different products with the same milk, which is distributed through multiple stages after pasteurizing but before packaging,'' he said. ''This kind of technology allows a greater opportunity for post-pasteurization contamination.'' It is generally agreed that for an animal pathogen, Listeria can grow at unusually low temperatures, which may help explain why soft cheeses are especially hospitable to it. Scientists routinely use ''cold enrichment'' to obtain cultures of Listeria from infected animals or foods. By refrigerating the samples for several weeks at about 40 degrees, they encourage the growth of Listeria relative to most other kinds of bacteria present. The aging of soft cheeses at similar temperatures and for a similar period may also encourage any Listeria in the cheese to multiply. The decreasing acidity of ripening cheeses also favors the bacterium's growth. Medical experts are still debating the significance of the recent findings of Listeria in dairy products. ''The incidence may actually be rising, perhaps due to changes in dairy technology,'' Dr. Feeley said. ''It is definitely not just a matter of detection or awareness.'' But Dr. Lovett said: ''We've been exposed to Listeria in cheese for centuries. Recent incidents have drawn our attention to the problem and started us looking for it.'' He noted, however, that Listeria is an opportunistic pathogen that takes advantage of weakened defenses and that the susceptible population is growing. It includes certain cancer patients or patients undergoing chemotherapy, those receiving cortisone treatment for transplants and AIDS victims. Pregnant women are also vulnerable because their immunity is naturally depressed to prevent rejection of the fetus. ''Because the disease is so dangerous for those at risk, listeriosis is a serious public health problem,'' Dr. Lovett said, adding, ''There are probably other products that would be found to carry it, if we concentrated on them.'' Hard cheeses, for example, whose low water content was thought to render them inhospitable to Listeria. ''We have assumed that aged cheeses are safe, but we don't necessarily have the scientific information,'' Dr. Lovett said. ''Listeria is pretty hardy, and survives well in the natural environment. We are now looking at hard cheeses.'' Still, compared with the frequency of other food-borne illnesses, listeriosis remains rare. ''I would be most concerned about unpasteurized products,'' Dr. Feeley said. ''Consuming raw milk sets you up for infection by a variety of organisms.'' Dr. Lovett agrees that there is no reason for healthy people to avoid properly made soft cheeses. But he expects that physicians may begin advising pregnant women to avoid soft cheeses, along with alcohol and caffeine, just to be safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BISHOPS HIRE JESUIT WHO BACKED WOMEN AS PRIESTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/28/us/bishops-hire-jesuit-who-backed-women-as-priests.html,"The National Conference of Catholic Bishops will hire a Jesuit theologian as a top doctrinal adviser despite the recent disclosure that he signed a letter nine years ago favoring ordination for Roman Catholic women, the bishops conference announced yesterday. Msgr. Daniel F. Hoye, general secretary of the conference, said the appointment of the theologian, the Rev. Michael J. Buckley, ''should go foward'' because a three-member panel of bishops ''affirmed Father Buckley's competence and his loyalty to the church.'' The panel, which studied the 1977 letter on women's ordination, concluded, ''We do not see that participation in the issuance of this statement constitutes public dissent from church teaching.'' The action was regarded as a victory for liberal forces in the American Roman Catholic Church. In recent weeks, liberals in the church have been dealt setbacks with the censure of the Rev. Charles E. Curran and with the threat of action against two nuns who publicly favor the right of women to have abortions. Signer Is Publicly Silent Both Father Curran, a theologian at the Catholic University of America who has called for flexibility in the church's ban against abortion, homosexuality and other sexual matters, and the nuns have been outspoken in their positions despite threats from the Vatican. However, Father Buckley, a 54-year-old professor at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley, Calif., has been publicly silent since the disclosure that he joined 22 others in signing the 1977 letter. The disclosure of his involvement, which was reported in the conservative National Catholic Register, came soon after Father Buckley's appointment May 30 to head the bishops committee on doctine. Monsignor Hoye said he took the unusual step of forming a committee to review the appointment after ''some bishops expressed concern about the appropriateness of this decision,'' and added, ''Reports appeared in the media which seemed to question Father Buckley's loyalty to the Holy See and whether or not his signing of an open letter in 1977 on Inter Insigniores constituted public dissent.'' Inter Insigniores is a document by the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that puts forward arguments opposing the ordination of women as priests. The review committee was headed by Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati. Panel Draws a Distinction In its review of the issue, the Pilarczyk committee made a distinction between differing with the conclusion of the Vatican document and differing with its arugments. The committee said the intent of the signers of the 1977 letter ''was to disagree with the argumentation of Inter Insigniores and with the conclusion insofar as the conclusion is based on that argumentation,'' adding, ''It was not their intent to deny or dissent from the teaching of the church on the matter.'' The committee report also dealt with the church's ''magisterium,'' or teaching authority, which the church regards as divinely inspired. ''We have no evidence that Father Buckley had ever publicly dissented from the teaching of the magisterium or was in any way disloyal to the church, the Holy Father or the Holy See,'' the committee said. ''On the contrary, his faithfulness and loyalty have been made clear on more than one occasion.'' In his statement yesterday, Monsignor Hoye said he came to his decision after receiving the report and consulting with the executive committee of the bishops conference. ''I am grateful for the affirmation given to Father Buckley's theological competence and his loyalty to the church,'' the monsignor added. ''I have concluded, therefore, that the appointment should go forward.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S. WITHHOLDS U.N. POPULATION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/28/world/us-withholds-un-population-funds.html,"The Agency for International Development has withdrawn its contribution to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities this year because of its involvement in China's population program, officials said today. The United Nations group, which provides aid to 134 countries, will lose $25 million as a result of the decision, which was disclosed today to Congressional leaders and others. The American action comes after months of intensive lobbying by anti-abortion activists, who asserted that the Chinese Government's population program involved the widespread use of compulsory abortions. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied reports that their program coerces abortions or sterilizations. A senior A.I.D. official said the money was being withheld ''because we think there is not an adequate change in the family planning program in China, and we conclude that the U.N.F.P.A. is too involved in that program.'' The A.I.D. official emphasized the Reagan Administration's continuing support of family planning assistance abroad. The $25 million which had been appropriated this year for the United Nations group will be spent on other family planning programs, he said. Statement by U.N. Group Rafael M. Salas, executive director of the United Nations group, said in a statement, ''The fund accepts this withdrawal as a sign that, for domestic reasons, the United States is no longer willing to assist developing countries in voluntary family planning programs through the United Nations system.'' The decision was hailed by the National Right to Life Committee. ''We think most Americans can think of better things to do with their tax dollars than fund a U.N.-supported program of compulsory abortion,'' Douglas Johnson, the group's legislative director, said. Advocates of population planning described the action as an American retreat from family planning assistance at a time when the need is most acute. ''It says to the world that we are willing to dismantle our family planning programs abroad to keep happy a small, but noisy, anti-family planning constituency at home,'' said Sharon L. Camp, vice president of the Population Crisis Committee. Representative Jim Moody, incoming chairman of the Congressional Coalition on Population and Development, said the decision penalized many countries dependent on aid from the United Nations group. ''Bangladesh, Haiti and other similar countries will be the ones to suffer, in order to satisfy a purely American domestic political dispute,'' the Wisconsin Democrat said. Decision Was Expected The decision had been expected for some time. Last year A.I.D. announced a partial cutoff of aid to the United Nations group because of the same issue. In that instance, the agency cited an amendment approved by Congress last year that barred all Federal aid to groups that ''support or participate in the management of'' Government programs that coerce abortion or sterilization. The decision today affected $25 million that had been appropriated to the group for the current fiscal year but never released. It represents a total withdrawal of financing, although the senior A.I.D. official said assistance could be resumed next year should the circumstances change. ''This doesn't close the door to another year,'' he said. ''We will continue to look at what happens in China's program, and what happens to U.N.F.P.A.'s involvement there.'' The United States had been a leading donor to the United Nations group since its establishment in 1969. In the last eight years, the United States has provided an average of 27 percent of the group's annual budget, according to a spokesman for A.I.D. Other major donors include Canada, West Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden, according to a spokesman for the United Nations group. Because the United States cutoff was expected, Mr. Salas said today that the group had already managed to raise $20 million from other donors to make up for the lost American funds. He said the group's programs would not be disrupted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While the World Grows,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/29/opinion/while-the-world-grows.html,"By 2016 there will be twice as many people in the world, and most of the growth will take place in the poorest countries. That darkens the future for Kenya, for instance, with the world's highest birth rate, or Bangladesh, where 10 million in a work force of 30 million are unemployed and 3.5 million babies are born every year. The enlightened thing for America to do is help such countries conduct humane family planning. What it has just done instead is petulantly stamp its foot and close its purse to the two most effective international agencies. The dismaying story begins with the acclaimed United Nations Fund for Population Activities. It counts on the United States' Agency for International Development for about a quarter of its funds. But A.I.D. has now withdrawn its support. Why? Because the U.N. agency also works with China; China reputedly coerces abortions; and some zealous Americans don't believe China when it denies that. The U.N. agency refuses to stop aiding a nation that so needs population planning. Thus the zealots have pressed the Reagan Administration to stop contributing to all the agency's work. The loss of American money threatens family planning in 129 other poor nations. Last year, when A.I.D. did the same thing to International Planned Parenthood, 18 African countries lost some family planning programs. It is true that the United States has substantially increased its investment in international family planning through smaller programs and government-to-government aid in the last six years. But that is thanks to Congress, which has invariably voted more than President Reagan had in mind. In any case, no population effort compares to the U.N. agency or International Planned Parenthood. If there are Americans who believe China coerces abortion, what better way to discourage it than by facilitating humane family planning? In leaving the organization, the United States turns its back on millions in poor countries to please a noisy short-sighted minority at home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Vatican's Ouster of Curran: a Pyrrhic Victory,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/29/opinion/the-vaticans-ouster-of-curran-a-pyrrhic-victory.html,"This time, Vatican conservatives won, but their victory will be Pyrrhic. The Vatican bureaucracy has now successfully carried out a threat it originally raised 20 years ago, when it first attempted to chop down the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a theologian at Catholic University of America, in Washington. Last week, America's estimated 50 million Catholics learned that the days of meaningful dissent were over when Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger notified Father Curran that ''in light of your repeated refusal to accept what the church teaches'' he was ''no longer considered suitable nor eligible'' to continue in ''the function of Professor of Catholic Theology.'' Father Curran was barred because his teachings on sexual morals varied from the Vatican's official position. Cardinal Ratzinger's order, outlawing the right to an individual conscience, snaps back into place the thought control outmoded by the Second Vatican Council. It buried Pope John XXIII's aggiornamento - modernization - and eviscerated the Council's principal goal: making the church more responsive to its people and their times. Cardinal Ratzinger pursued Father Curran, who has asserted theologians' right to scholarly dissent, with the implacable will-to-destroy that condemned heretics when the cardinal's Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was called the Holy Office of the Inquisition and his post was designated Grand Inquisitor. The cardinal sidestepped canonical legal processes. He made no pretense that Father Curran's writings violated specific Catholic laws. No transgression against papal pronouncements was charged. On no grounds can Father Curran be considered a radical. For example, he firmly holds to Rome's stance against free-choice abortions, although in his teachings he leaves open the possibility that abortion may not be immoral when it can save a woman's life. To the extent that he sides with Rome, he appears to lag far behind opinions held by most American Catholics: when polled, they register majority support for a woman's right to decide about abortion based on her own circumstances. The body of Father Curran's work places him firmly in conservative ranks among late 20th century Americans and Europeans. His colleagues consider him a moderate. His positions enabled 700 Catholic theologians to sign a petition protesting a seven-year Vatican ''trial'' that denied him access to his accusers. Fought to a standstill under existing rules, Cardinal Ratzinger won by stretching the doctrine of papal infallibility beyond its original intent: to endow the Pontiff, as the Vicar of Christ, with the power to make divinely inspired pronouncements. Cardinal Ratzinger has in effect declared all bishops infallible when they take a stand on faith or morals. He made his ruling retroactive - and with the Pope's blessing. Thus, John Paul II comes under further suspicion of wanting to undermine the Second Vatican Council. Conservatives have now gotten even with Father Curran, who was central to a humiliating loss 20 years ago. When that confrontation began, it is likely that his name was not even known to Alfredo Cardinal Ottaviani, the prelate who then held Cardinal Ratzinger's present post, who wanted to send a ''warning'' to American Catholics: he was concerned that they might take literally reforms promised by Vatican II. In 1966, Cardinal Ottaviani issued orders to Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, the Apostolic Delegate to Washington, who considered various candidates before selecting Father Curran for the sacrifice. Cardinal Vagnozzi told me in 1969 that he set in motion procedures for dismissing Father Curran. No difficulty was expected, for Catholic University is a pontifical institution, directly under the Vatican. For centuries, throughout the church Curia-ordered demotions and transfers occasioned few outcries; their object lessons circulated effectively. But that was before the Second Vatican Council. To save their newfound rights, faculty and students rose to Father Curran's defense. They shut down classes, and a media storm resulted - the first that pitted people and priests against bishops. The break came when Boston's prestigious Richard Cardinal Cushing abandoned his fellow bishops by affirming, ''That fellow must teach all sides; that's scholarship.'' His words saved Father Curran's job in 1967 and served to reinforce responsible scholarly inquiry as permitted by the Vatican Council. What's more, Cardinal Cushing shattered the myth of a monolithic Catholic establishment; he breathed American life into Pope John XXIII's dreams for a modern church. Cardinal Ottaviani and every other conservative prelate received a resounding defeat - one they could not accept as final. Father Curran's second ''trial'' started in 1979, the year Cardinal Ottaviani died. In preparing his ''case,'' Cardinal Ratzinger thinned liberals from the ranks of American bishops. Cardinal Cushing is long dead, and this time no knight has come to Father Curran's rescue. Lay Catholics lead their lives according to their own dictates, for the most part. The ''good and truly faithful'' are shrinking, as attested by empty seminary classrooms. Cardinal Ratzinger's message has not been lost: it has thrown a chill through faculties in every American Catholic college. At least one library worried about a possible ban on Father Curran's books. Because the dismissal came under newly invented rules, no one knows who will be next. Cardinal Ratzinger and American church conservatives appear to have won their long fight to oust Father Curran. But at what price? The cost surely will be higher than understood by anyone behind Vatican walls, which still shut out the changing world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE WORLD; U.N.

''We reiterate the point that we don't support abortion programs in China, or for that matter, anywhere else in the world,'' Jyoti Singh, a spokesman for the fund, said. The United States Agency for International Development announced Wednesday that it would withhold the contribution after months of lobbying by anti-abortion activists who say the United Nations group supports a program of coerced abortion in China. A measure passed by the United States Congress in 1985 bans all Federal aid for groups that ''support or participate in the management of'' government population programs that coerce abortion or sterilization. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied the existence of such programs, and officials at the United Nations fund have said their $10 million program in China is limited to census programs, studies of the aged, and support for maternity and child care services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHASING AFTER GOD AND SEX,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/books/chasing-after-god-and-sex.html,"ROGER'S VERSION By John Updike. 329 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95. THE language of fiction is a medley. The novelist, unlike the lyric poet or essayist, must command many styles and speak to us through a plurality of borrowed or imitated discourses as well as in what passes for his or her own voice. There are at least five distinct discursive strands interwoven in the texture of John Updike's ''Roger's Version.'' Four of them will be familiar to readers of his previous novels, but the fifth is, I believe, a new development, or acquisition, and a remarkably interesting one. To start with the familiar: there is the discourse of theology. The central character and narrator, pipe-smoking, 52-year-old Roger Lambert is a professor of divinity, a former Methodist minister who adopted an academic career after the scandalous breakup of his first marriage and his union with Esther, 14 years his junior. He teaches the history of the early Christian heresies at a large university in an unnamed Northeastern city that might be Boston. He is a somewhat dilettantish disciple of Karl Barth, the austere Swiss theologian who fiercely insisted on the utter separateness of the divine and the human, and the utter dependence of the latter on the former. Roger admits to insulating this ''hot Barthian nugget'' in ''layers of worldly cynicism and situation ethics.'' Mr. Updike is well able to evoke the ethos of an academic theology department, and to have sly fun with its professional rivalries, pretensions and jargon (this one has specialists in ''Ethics and Moral Logistics'' and ''holocaustics''). He has manifested an interest in religion and theology in previous books. If there was ever such a species as the Protestant novelist, comparable to that much discussed animal, the Catholic novelist, Mr. Updike may be its last surviving example. There is the discourse of eroticism, or pornography -the distinction is not always easy to draw, and Mr. Updike has taken a leading part in the tendency of contemporary art to blur it, incorporating previously taboo matter and diction into serious fiction. His ''Couples'' was something of a landmark in this respect. Roger Lambert never tires of reading theology, but confides, ''Lest you take me for a goody-goody, I find kindred comfort and inspiration in pornography, the much-deplored detailed depiction of impossibly long and deep, rigid and stretchable human parts interlocking, pumping, oozing.'' His own descriptions of such acts certainly have the sharp focus, the closeup detail, the glossy sheen and vivid color of pornographic photography - with the added perversity, or poignancy, that they are mostly imagined rather than reported, mental projections of his conviction that he is being cuckolded by a young graduate student, Dale Kohler. There is the discourse of domesticity - the faithful rendering of small quotidian activities such as cooking a meal, fixing a drink, changing a baby, driving a car, or the social dynamics of the nuclear family, the Thanksgiving dinner, the duty cocktail Continued on page 15 party. From his earliest New Yorker stories, Mr. Updike has shown himself to be a master of domestic realism, enhancing our awareness of the way we live. A typical insight occurs when Roger contemplates his 12-year-old son: ''Why, with a living room, a library, and his own good-size bedroom at his disposal, Richie insisted on doing his homework on the very surface where his mother was trying to arrange place mats and dinner plates, while a ten-inch Sony crackled and chattered not a foot from his face, I couldn't imagine. Or so I said, in repeated admonition. Of course I secretly understood: the primitive appeal of the hearth. Television is - its irresistible charm - a fire.'' Closely related to this discourse of domestic behavior is a discourse of physical description - of streets, houses, furniture, trees, clouds and the whole mesh of culture and nature that makes a suburb or a city: ''the irrepressible combinations of the real,'' in Roger's words. Again, Mr. Updike has always been famous for his ability to defamiliarize the commonplace with a nifty trope, sometimes jeopardizing the authenticity of his characters by attributing to them metaphors and similes that a professional poet might envy. Roger, however, is cultivated and clever enough to carry off such typically perceptive images as ''damp flattened leaves covered the sidewalk with a brocaded richness,'' or ''one of those old-fashioned wooden classroom chairs whose left arm atrophied and whose right has enlarged like a lobster's fighting claw.'' There are several extended - perhaps overextended - topographical passages in the novel that trace Roger's movement from the relatively affluent and commodious residential streets around the university to a run-down housing project where Verna, the daughter of his half sister, lives precariously on welfare with her baby, Paula, whose black father has absconded. Made aware of Verna's plight through Dale, and motivated by family loyalty, social guilt and - increasingly - lust for the sexy Verna, Roger makes several trips to the housing project, and his negotiation of its decaying environs reflects his uneasy consciousness of social and economic divisions in American society, as Ronald Reagan wins his second term of office. Not that Roger blames Mr. Reagan for these problems - unlike most of his peer group, he has a soft spot for the President. (Whether Mr. Updike has too remains, like much else in this novel, ambiguous.) THE fifth, and unfamiliar, discourse in ''Roger's Version'' is that of science - mathematics, physics, biology and, above all, computing. Dale Kohler is a graduate in computer studies and a fundamentalist Christian. At the beginning of the story he visits Roger not just to tell him about Verna but to ask his assistance in obtaining a grant from the theology department. He is convinced that the more science discovers about the mathematical equations underlying the universe, the more unavoidable becomes the conclusion that they are not the result of chance. ''God is showing through,'' he assures Roger, though the scientific establishment is desperately trying to conceal the fact. ''Everywhere you look,'' Dale says, ''there are these terrifically finely adjusted constants that have to be just what they are, or there wouldn't be a world we could recognize, and there's no intrinsic reason for those constants to be what they are except to say God made them that way.'' His amibition is to prove this assertion by calculations and model manipulations on the university's giant computer. The project is as repugnant to Roger as its tall, gawky, virile proponent. It offends his Barthian theological principles, but it also threatens his cynicism and ''situation ethics.'' ''Your God sounds like a nice safe unfindable God,'' Dale shrewdly observes. Much is at stake. The pair debate the issue in a series of set pieces that cover cosmology, evolution and the relation of body to mind. These are fascinating and important issues -topical too, given the rising tide of Christian fundamentalism in America today - and it is heartening to see a literary novelist taking them on board. A note on the copyright page gives some indication of the research that all this entailed, and one can only salute Mr. Updike's energy, boldness and sheer brainpower in undertaking it. He is not content to give us a mere impressionistic whiff of physics, math and biology. He makes Dale Kohler speak with the passion and particularity of the true enthusiast: ''Take the strong force, which binds the atomic nuclei together. Make it five percent weaker, and the deuteron couldn't form and there would be no deuterium, which means the main nuclear reaction chain used by the sun couldn't function; if it were two percent stronger, two protons could stick together and the existence of the di-protons would make hydrogen so explosive the present universe would consist entirely of helium.'' There is quite a lot of this sort of talk, and the scientifically illiterate reader (like myself) may find that much of it goes over his head, at least on first reading. The book seems initially to be shaping up as a rather static novel of ideas, but as it proceeds the different discourses within it begin to interact excitingly. There is, for instance, a remarkable chapter in which Roger's wrestling with Tertullian's arguments for the resurrection of the body elides into a startlingly explicit account of Esther and Dale making love, which in turn gives way to a debate between the two men about the body-mind problem. Each strand illuminates the others. Admittedly the plot (never Mr. Updike's strong point) ticks on rather slowly. The cracks in the Lambert marriage begin to show. Verna gets carelessly pregnant again, and Roger shoulders both the financial and the moral responsibility of arranging an abortion. Will he overcome his fear of catching some ''state-of-the-art venereal diseases'' and sleep with her? Is Esther really sleeping with Dale? Since all the discourses in the novel are uttered or mediated by Roger, as narrator, the question of his reliability becomes crucial. The title of the novel suggests that there might be other, very different versions of the story, and a number of clues seem planted in the text warning us not to trust him. Early on he begins to put himself in Dale's place, and see the world through his eyes with what he himself calls ''an odd and sinister empathy.'' His detailed narratives of Esther's infidelity appear to be based on pure suspicion, and could well be the voyeuristic fantasies, at once compensatory and self-punishing, of middle-aged impotence. As the novel moves toward its narrative climax (Verna, with Roger's collusion, narrowly escapes a charge of child abuse and gratefully invites him into her bed; Dale's faith and mental equilibrium begin to crack under the stress of his impossible project), the novel seems poised for a reversal that will reveal Roger's suspicions as delusory. But at the very end they are casually confirmed by Verna: Dale's ''been having an affair with some older woman, somebody married who I guess is a pretty hot ticket. . . . Somewhere in your neighborhood, I got the impression.'' The absence of an expected reversal is itself a reversal. This twist is effective in narrative terms, but does not entirely solve the problem of authority in the novel. Where did all the detail of Roger's erotic imaginings come from? How does he know what Dale's room looks like, down to the Korean crucifix, of ambiguous substance, that hangs above the bed? How is Roger, in a tour de force chapter, able to give a minutely circumstantial account of the Cube, the building that houses the university's computer services, where Dale works all night in a supreme effort to conjure the hand or face of God on his computer terminal, when he (Roger) states at the outset of his narrative that, ''I have never entered it, nor do I hope to''? First-person narrators are allowed, by poetic license, to borrow some of the author's eloquence, but not his omniscience. ONE is tempted to seek a clue in Roger's comment on the inconsistencies and circularities of early Christian documents: ''First-century people just didn't have the same sense of factuality that we do, or of writing either. Writing was sympathetic magic . . . writing something down was to an extent making it so.'' So, of course, is writing fiction. If Mr. Updike were a novelist given to metafictional tricks, we might suspect him of holding up a mirror to the reader's credulity, by making his character claim the same freedom to invent that we grant the novelist. But everything we know about Mr. Updike suggests that he shares the modern sense of factuality and believes that fiction should create the illusion of it. Otherwise, why take all that trouble to get the scientific discourse right? There is, then, an unresolved enigma or contradiction at the heart of ''Roger's Version,'' blurring the exact nature and degree of the narrator's ''bad faith.'' For all its richness and virtuosity, the novel makes its effect by a somewhat arbitrary suppression of the discourse of objective report. Nevertheless, one finishes it with gratitude - for it is challenging and educative -and with renewed respect for one of the most intelligent and resourceful of contemporary novelists. 'LIFE INTERRUPTS ME OCCASIONALLY' John Updike once said, ''When I write, I aim in my mind not toward New York but toward a vague spot a little to the east of Kansas.'' On the telephone a few days ago from his home in Massachusetts, he was asked if that sentiment applied to his new novel. ''I suppose, yes,'' he said. ''Both the men in the novel come from west of the Hudson. I'm still trying to write about the basic American anxieties and issues in the heartland.'' A note appears on the copyright page of ''Roger's Version,'' thanking a score of individuals, including scientists, because Mr. Updike derived the ideas in the novel, in part, from their work. Did such an acknowledgment ever appear before in his fiction? One had, he said, at even greater length, in ''The Coup,'' which was set in Africa. The note in ''Roger's Version'' credits ''Jacob Neusner for helping with the Hebrew.'' ''Jack Neusner and I were Harvard freshmen together,'' Mr. Updike said. ''He now heads a department of Judaic studies at Brown. I wanted to get the Hebrew words right.'' Three experts are thanked ''for generously sharing their knowledge of computers.'' Did he write the book on a computer? ''I've written on a word processor that's 'user friendly' for the last three years,'' he said. ''I prefer the silence of pencil on paper to being aware that electricity is awaiting me, but the advantages of a word processor are so great for making changes.'' How does he balance writing novels, poems and book reviews. ''Life interrupts me occasionally,'' he said, ''but I'm an old-fashioned text producer engaged in a one-man operation. When I'm writing a novel, I try to keep my mornings free. The book reviews help to keep me hopping and reading and in print about once a month. I write the poetry when I travel - I've probably written too many airplane poems. Ideally, I'd only write poems, but they're a luxury that must be maintained by other means.''

"THE WORLD; The U.S., the U.N. And Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/weekinreview/the-world-the-us-the-un-and-abortion.html,"The United States had been the financial mainstay of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities for 17 years, until a dispute over population control in China got in the way. Anti-abortion activists, demanding that China soften its pressure - often implemented through abortions - for one-child families, persuaded the Reagan Administration to withhold part of its support from the fund last year. Peking denied it has been forcing abortions and objected strenuously to foreign interference. Last week, aid officials said the entire American contribution, $25 million, had been canceled. That was less than one-fifth of the United Nations fund's $131 million budget for aid to 134 countries, including $10 million for China. (It was a drop in the teapot for Peking, which spends $1 billion a year on incentives and stern penalties, which have successfully slowed the growth of China's vast population of 1.2 billion.) And at any rate, said Rafael M. Salas of the United Nations fund, other donors have made up most of the lost money. The National Right to Life Committee hailed the Administration's action as a blow against ''a U.N.-supported program of compulsory abortion.''

LONG ISLAND OPINION; WELCOME TO TOMORROW: SETTLING IN THE U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/nyregion/long-island-opinion-welcome-to-tomorrow-settling-in-the-us.html,"BEING told that immigration is not easy is rather like being told death is final. No one wants to believe it, and once it has happened it is too late to ask for explanations. Trying to adjust to a New York life style demanded a lot from me. I could have done with a whole revival of values along the line of tough, alert, smart and shrewd. Mostly it requires a sense of humor. In the first few weeks after my arrival from South Africa, I had an almost constant feeling of terror. While all around me people were feasting and getting the bargains on sale, I was still trying to cross the road. Right turn on red, but only on the Island, and not behind a bus. Hold the ketchup. It's education time. Part of the relearning is vocabulary. Certain phrases have a meaning specific to New York. Take ''Have a good day.'' Take it, I do, because at least half of the people I meet say it to me in the course of one day. At first I was touched by such caring from virtual strangers. Then I noticed something. The phrase was uttered a great deal by people in public service. These same people failed to make eye contact, and their tone of voice lacked animation. The few times I replied, I soon found myself in solitary monologue while they had moved on down the line. Lesson one in New York English: ''Have a good day'' means nothing. In fact, more can be written about what it does not mean than the reverse. On the other hand, ''I don't know,'' uttered by those in service of the public, means a great deal. Depending on the level of animation in the voice and the slouch of the shoulders it can say anything from ''I don't care'' to ''To hell with you.'' The suggestion, unspoken, is that if you are smart enough to be here, you should be able to find whatever it is you want by yourself. A lot of New Yorkers appear to be very smart. I know this because they tell me it is so. From a young age. ''You are a smart kid,'' I tell a friend's son. ''I know that,'' replies he in an aren't-some-people-dumb voice. ''I hear you are good in your field,'' I mention tentatively to a new acquaintance. ''The best,'' she informs me. Such a wealth of self-confidence can cripple a conversation. I am even becoming wary of stating the obvious in a display of manners. ''It's been good having you,'' I tell a young guest visiting my home. ''That's right,'' says she, and I swear, had she been a little taller or had I been a little closer to groveling, she would have patted my head. All this affirmation and self-confidence is proof that American people believe in themselves. The right to be lovable has been added to the list of Free World privileges. Up until recently I was quite satisfied with my high degree of ambivalence and insecurity. Secretly I thought it reflected an evolved but rather depressed mind. Here, I am doomed to be last in line in the active search for certainty that goes on around me. It is a most genuine quest, and not to be scorned. The desire to be on top of the pile and to know it all has produced the great obsessions of space technology, media coverage of the greatest honesty, values all adding up to this becoming my promised land. Individually, however, and at close quarters, it can get to be a bit much. Recently I attended a dinner party in which an academic in some esoteric field monopolized the evening by talking about his weight loss, renewed interest in religion and recent divorce. A former beauty queen sat on my right and got in a few words about her work with handicapped children. The hostess had written a book on decorating cold cuts. Even the maid had the kind of glint in her eye that told me she was planning on getting published somewhere. I shake at night wondering what I can sell in the marketplace and why the Perdue chicken man believes more in his achievements than I do in mine. I conclude that I cannot produce anything that makes my family whistle as they sit down to dinner. The man who unpacks the tomatoes in my local supermarket has more philosophical certainty than I will ever have. ''You gotta believe in yourself,'' he tells the man on cucumbers. ''Take a stand, my man. Can I help you?'' The latter is addressed to me, who is trying to merge into the fresh greens. I shake my head and move on. Perhaps it is Long Island that has gotten to me. A trip to Manhattan is needed to give a taste of the cosmopolitan. I am in search of a new rhythm, a widening of horizons. I soon find myself in a Technicolor, high-speed rumba. Frozen in cold and terror, I revert to Dorothy of Kansas: There is hay in my hair as I walk, out of step, in this strange new land. People swarm in all directions, and the wind chill bites my celluite. Can anyone with a high anxiety level call this home? I am circled three times by an odd-looking man at the Museum of Modern Art. He is not really that odd, but reminds me of my cousin who hates art. I am starting to disintegrate. People walk fast, talk faster. ''Lyrical strains, but some harsh realism.'' ''Color is not the issue.'' ''My God, Maxine, an abortion.'' I am adrift in a sea of changing faces, double meanings and incomplete sentences. On the train traveling back east I start to cry. It is unexpected. One moment I am reflecting on the magnitude of this society and how much it has to offer. The next moment I am weeping. I try to console myself that what I have left behind is a closed chapter. Suddenly I recall a childhood picnic at the beach. I have sand in my shoe and my mother is helping me take it out. I sniff noisily. My recall is selective; I remember only the good and dismiss emotions of guilt and fear. Drifting on such memory, I am caught up in a whirlpool of loss. The birth of my daughter comes into focus. All the women in my ward received flowers, but my husband gave me three bananas and an orange. This prompts a fresh flood of tears. The train stops and I continue to sit, shivering. A man comes over and looks at me with concern. He asks if I am well, and I nod. ''Have a good day,'' I find myself saying to him. He smiles. I find, surprisingly, that I am able to get up and walk off the train, out of the station.

Charles Curran, saying that he would be a Catholic theologian ''no matter what happens,'' said today that he was formally appealing the Vatican's attempt to dismiss him from the faculty at Catholic University. The priest, whose views on sexual issues led to the Vatican action, said he had written to the university's chancellor requesting an appeal. Father Curran said previously that the rules of the appeals process should not apply to him since he was granted tenure at the university before they came into effect. But in a statement released today, he said he was making the formal appeal because he did not want to forfeit any academic or legal rights he might have. Deadline Imposed He said the university chancellor, Archbishop James Hickey of Washington, had ''unilaterally imposed'' a Sept. 1 deadline for such an appeal. ''As part of my theological enterprise, I will continue to work for the legitimacy of theological and practical dissent from some noninfallible church teachings and for the importance of academic freedom for Catholic institutions and for Catholic theology,'' he said. ''I consider myself suitable and eligible to exercise the function of a professor of Catholic theology,'' he continued, paraphrasing a July letter from the Vatican that said he was neither suitable nor eligible. Vatican officials say their statement, approved by Pope John Paul II, means the Rev. Curran can no longer teach as a Catholic theologian and therefore cannot retain his position as professor of moral theology at the school. That stand has been publicly supported by Archbishop Hickey and the university's president, the Rev. William Byron. Disagreements Were 'Limited' Father Curran has said the Vatican exaggerated his stand on issues such as birth control, abortion, divorce and homosexuality and that his disagreements have been limited, respectful and proper. He has also raised the possibility of going to civil court if he cannot win his case within the university, and he said he had retained a lawyer. He has made no predictions of success for his appeal within the university system. But he has said he would welcome the chance it would give him to air the issues in his case. ''No matter what happens in the future, I am committed to carrying on my theological endeavors,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26 in Philadelphia Sentenced To Jail in an Abortion Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/us/26-in-philadelphia-sentenced-to-jail-in-an-abortion-protest.html,"More than two dozen anti-abortion activists were sentenced to jail Thursday for staging a sit-in for two and a half hours at a busy clinic. Judge Michael Conroy of Municipal Court found the 26 defendants guilty of criminal trespassing, disorderly conduct and conspiracy in the May 23 demonstration at the Northeast Women's Center, a target of numerous and sometimes violent protests. They were sentenced to terms ranging from 45 days to six months, and remained free pending appeal. ''We're feeling real good about the criminal justice system today and we haven't felt that way over the past 18 months,'' Kate Strauser, a clinic spokesman, said Thursday. Assistant District Attorney Martin Durkin said the 26 had defied the police and clinic employees. The police took most of the protesters away on stretchers. Dennis J. Sadler, a spokesman for the Southeast Pro-Life Coalition for Nonviolent Direct Action, said: ''Our tactics will be best according to what we think will save children's lives. This decision will have no weight whatsoever on our future actions.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'Roger's Version',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/books/rogers-version.html,"THE language of fiction is a medley. The novelist, unlike the lyric poet or essayist, must command many styles and speak to us through a plurality of borrowed or imitated discourses as well as in what passes for his or her own voice. There are at least five distinct discursive strands interwoven in the texture of John Updike's ''Roger's Version.'' Four of them will be familiar to readers of his previous novels, but the fifth is, I believe, a new development, or acquisition, and a remarkably interesting one. To start with the familiar: there is the discourse of theology. The central character and narrator, pipe-smoking, 52-year-old Roger Lambert is a professor of divinity, a former Methodist minister who adopted an academic career after the scandalous breakup of his first marriage and his union with Esther, 14 years his junior. He teaches the history of the early Christian heresies at a large university in an unnamed Northeastern city that might be Boston. He is a somewhat dilettantish disciple of Karl Barth, the austere Swiss theologian who fiercely insisted on the utter separateness of the divine and the human, and the utter dependence of the latter on the former. Roger admits to insulating this ''hot Barthian nugget'' in ''layers of worldly cynicism and situation ethics.'' Mr. Updike is well able to evoke the ethos of an academic theology department, and to have sly fun with its professional rivalries, pretensions and jargon (this one has specialists in ''Ethics and Moral Logistics'' and ''holocaustics''). He has manifested an interest in religion and theology in previous books. If there was ever such a species as the Protestant novelist, comparable to that much discussed animal, the Catholic novelist, Mr. Updike may be its last surviving example. There is the discourse of eroticism, or pornography -the distinction is not always easy to draw, and Mr. Updike has taken a leading part in the tendency of contemporary art to blur it, incorporating previously taboo matter and diction into serious fiction. His ''Couples'' was something of a landmark in this respect. Roger Lambert never tires of reading theology, but confides, ''Lest you take me for a goody-goody, I find kindred comfort and inspiration in pornography, the much-deplored detailed depiction of impossibly long and deep, rigid and stretchable human parts interlocking, pumping, oozing.'' His own descriptions of such acts certainly have the sharp focus, the closeup detail, the glossy sheen and vivid color of pornographic photography - with the added perversity, or poignancy, that they are mostly imagined rather than reported, mental projections of his conviction that he is being cuckolded by a young graduate student, Dale Kohler. There is the discourse of domesticity - the faithful rendering of small quotidian activities such as cooking a meal, fixing a drink, changing a baby, driving a car, or the social dynamics of the nuclear family, the Thanksgiving dinner, the duty cocktail Continued on page 15 party. From his earliest New Yorker stories, Mr. Updike has shown himself to be a master of domestic realism, enhancing our awareness of the way we live. A typical insight occurs when Roger contemplates his 12-year-old son: ''Why, with a living room, a library, and his own good-size bedroom at his disposal, Richie insisted on doing his homework on the very surface where his mother was trying to arrange place mats and dinner plates, while a ten-inch Sony crackled and chattered not a foot from his face, I couldn't imagine. Or so I said, in repeated admonition. Of course I secretly understood: the primitive appeal of the hearth. Television is - its irresistible charm - a fire.'' Closely related to this discourse of domestic behavior is a discourse of physical description - of streets, houses, furniture, trees, clouds and the whole mesh of culture and nature that makes a suburb or a city: ''the irrepressible combinations of the real,'' in Roger's words. Again, Mr. Updike has always been famous for his ability to defamiliarize the commonplace with a nifty trope, sometimes jeopardizing the authenticity of his characters by attributing to them metaphors and similes that a professional poet might envy. Roger, however, is cultivated and clever enough to carry off such typically perceptive images as ''damp flattened leaves covered the sidewalk with a brocaded richness,'' or ''one of those old-fashioned wooden classroom chairs whose left arm atrophied and whose right has enlarged like a lobster's fighting claw.'' There are several extended - perhaps overextended - topographical passages in the novel that trace Roger's movement from the relatively affluent and commodious residential streets around the university to a run-down housing project where Verna, the daughter of his half sister, lives precariously on welfare with her baby, Paula, whose black father has absconded. Made aware of Verna's plight through Dale, and motivated by family loyalty, social guilt and - increasingly - lust for the sexy Verna, Roger makes several trips to the housing project, and his negotiation of its decaying environs reflects his uneasy consciousness of social and economic divisions in American society, as Ronald Reagan wins his second term of office. Not that Roger blames Mr. Reagan for these problems - unlike most of his peer group, he has a soft spot for the President. (Whether Mr. Updike has too remains, like much else in this novel, ambiguous.) THE fifth, and unfamiliar, discourse in ''Roger's Version'' is that of science - mathematics, physics, biology and, above all, computing. Dale Kohler is a graduate in computer studies and a fundamentalist Christian. At the beginning of the story he visits Roger not just to tell him about Verna but to ask his assistance in obtaining a grant from the theology department. He is convinced that the more science discovers about the mathematical equations underlying the universe, the more unavoidable becomes the conclusion that they are not the result of chance. ''God is showing through,'' he assures Roger, though the scientific establishment is desperately trying to conceal the fact. ''Everywhere you look,'' Dale says, ''there are these terrifically finely adjusted constants that have to be just what they are, or there wouldn't be a world we could recognize, and there's no intrinsic reason for those constants to be what they are except to say God made them that way.'' His amibition is to prove this assertion by calculations and model manipulations on the university's giant computer. The project is as repugnant to Roger as its tall, gawky, virile proponent. It offends his Barthian theological principles, but it also threatens his cynicism and ''situation ethics.'' ''Your God sounds like a nice safe unfindable God,'' Dale shrewdly observes. Much is at stake. The pair debate the issue in a series of set pieces that cover cosmology, evolution and the relation of body to mind. These are fascinating and important issues -topical too, given the rising tide of Christian fundamentalism in America today - and it is heartening to see a literary novelist taking them on board. A note on the copyright page gives some indication of the research that all this entailed, and one can only salute Mr. Updike's energy, boldness and sheer brainpower in undertaking it. He is not content to give us a mere impressionistic whiff of physics, math and biology. He makes Dale Kohler speak with the passion and particularity of the true enthusiast: ''Take the strong force, which binds the atomic nuclei together. Make it five percent weaker, and the deuteron couldn't form and there would be no deuterium, which means the main nuclear reaction chain used by the sun couldn't function; if it were two percent stronger, two protons could stick together and the existence of the di-protons would make hydrogen so explosive the present universe would consist entirely of helium.'' There is quite a lot of this sort of talk, and the scientifically illiterate reader (like myself) may find that much of it goes over his head, at least on first reading. The book seems initially to be shaping up as a rather static novel of ideas, but as it proceeds the different discourses within it begin to interact excitingly. There is, for instance, a remarkable chapter in which Roger's wrestling with Tertullian's arguments for the resurrection of the body elides into a startlingly explicit account of Esther and Dale making love, which in turn gives way to a debate between the two men about the body-mind problem. Each strand illuminates the others. Admittedly the plot (never Mr. Updike's strong point) ticks on rather slowly. The cracks in the Lambert marriage begin to show. Verna gets carelessly pregnant again, and Roger shoulders both the financial and the moral responsibility of arranging an abortion. Will he overcome his fear of catching some ''state-of-the-art venereal diseases'' and sleep with her? Is Esther really sleeping with Dale? Since all the discourses in the novel are uttered or mediated by Roger, as narrator, the question of his reliability becomes crucial. The title of the novel suggests that there might be other, very different versions of the story, and a number of clues seem planted in the text warning us not to trust him. Early on he begins to put himself in Dale's place, and see the world through his eyes with what he himself calls ''an odd and sinister empathy.'' His detailed narratives of Esther's infidelity appear to be based on pure suspicion, and could well be the voyeuristic fantasies, at once compensatory and self-punishing, of middle-aged impotence. As the novel moves toward its narrative climax (Verna, with Roger's collusion, narrowly escapes a charge of child abuse and gratefully invites him into her bed; Dale's faith and mental equilibrium begin to crack under the stress of his impossible project), the novel seems poised for a reversal that will reveal Roger's suspicions as delusory. But at the very end they are casually confirmed by Verna: Dale's ''been having an affair with some older woman, somebody married who I guess is a pretty hot ticket. . . . Somewhere in your neighborhood, I got the impression.'' The absence of an expected reversal is itself a reversal. This twist is effective in narrative terms, but does not entirely solve the problem of authority in the novel. Where did all the detail of Roger's erotic imaginings come from? How does he know what Dale's room looks like, down to the Korean crucifix, of ambiguous substance, that hangs above the bed? How is Roger, in a tour de force chapter, able to give a minutely circumstantial account of the Cube, the building that houses the university's computer services, where Dale works all night in a supreme effort to conjure the hand or face of God on his computer terminal, when he (Roger) states at the outset of his narrative that, ''I have never entered it, nor do I hope to''? First-person narrators are allowed, by poetic license, to borrow some of the author's eloquence, but not his omniscience. ONE is tempted to seek a clue in Roger's comment on the inconsistencies and circularities of early Christian documents: ''First-century people just didn't have the same sense of factuality that we do, or of writing either. Writing was sympathetic magic . . . writing something down was to an extent making it so.'' So, of course, is writing fiction. If Mr. Updike were a novelist given to metafictional tricks, we might suspect him of holding up a mirror to the reader's credulity, by making his character claim the same freedom to invent that we grant the novelist. But everything we know about Mr. Updike suggests that he shares the modern sense of factuality and believes that fiction should create the illusion of it. Otherwise, why take all that trouble to get the scientific discourse right? There is, then, an unresolved enigma or contradiction at the heart of ''Roger's Version,'' blurring the exact nature and degree of the narrator's ''bad faith.'' For all its richness and virtuosity, the novel makes its effect by a somewhat arbitrary suppression of the discourse of objective report. Nevertheless, one finishes it with gratitude - for it is challenging and educative -and with renewed respect for one of the most intelligent and resourceful of contemporary novelists. 'LIFE INTERRUPTS ME OCCASIONALLY' John Updike once said, ''When I write, I aim in my mind not toward New York but toward a vague spot a little to the east of Kansas.'' On the telephone a few days ago from his home in Massachusetts, he was asked if that sentiment applied to his new novel. ''I suppose, yes,'' he said. ''Both the men in the novel come from west of the Hudson. I'm still trying to write about the basic American anxieties and issues in the heartland.'' A note appears on the copyright page of ''Roger's Version,'' thanking a score of individuals, including scientists, because Mr. Updike derived the ideas in the novel, in part, from their work. Did such an acknowledgment ever appear before in his fiction? One had, he said, at even greater length, in ''The Coup,'' which was set in Africa. The note in ''Roger's Version'' credits ''Jacob Neusner for helping with the Hebrew.'' ''Jack Neusner and I were Harvard freshmen together,'' Mr. Updike said. ''He now heads a department of Judaic studies at Brown. I wanted to get the Hebrew words right.'' Three experts are thanked ''for generously sharing their knowledge of computers.'' Did he write the book on a computer? ''I've written on a word processor that's 'user friendly' for the last three years,'' he said. ''I prefer the silence of pencil on paper to being aware that electricity is awaiting me, but the advantages of a word processor are so great for making changes.'' How does he balance writing novels, poems and book reviews. ''Life interrupts me occasionally,'' he said, ''but I'm an old-fashioned text producer engaged in a one-man operation. When I'm writing a novel, I try to keep my mornings free. The book reviews help to keep me hopping and reading and in print about once a month. I write the poetry when I travel - I've probably written too many airplane poems. Ideally, I'd only write poems, but they're a luxury that must be maintained by other means.''

Coercion Sanctioned By the Conservatives,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/02/opinion/l-coercion-sanctioned-by-the-conservatives-749186.html,"To the Editor: J. Philip Anderegg writes that conservatives (although he doesn't use that label) don't want to impose the moral harness on Americans referred to in your July 31 editorial ''Contradictions,'' but rather believe in ''minimum coercion of man by the state'' (letter, Aug. 13). Mr. Anderegg says that, on the basis of federalism, conservatives ''support the Supreme Court decision on a state's right to make homosexual sodomy a crime.'' He has, however, used a sanitized description of the Court's recent decision. The Court upheld in its entirety a Georgia statute prohibiting anal or oral sex, a statute that makes no distinction between homosexual and heterosexual activity or between married and unmarried couples. What the Supreme Court actually ruled in effect is that private sexual conduct, including consensual conduct in marital bedrooms, is constitutionally subject to government regulation. Mr. Anderegg also says conservatives believe that the state should ''punish as crimes invasions . . . of the physical, psychological or economic integrity of other persons, including future generations.'' He is, of course, referring to abortion as an invasion of the rights of the embryo-person. The classification of the human embryo as a person is challenged by the majority of religious denominations, by the American Medical Association and by the National Academy of Sciences. Mr. Anderegg is really talking about the enforcement of sectarian religious rules by the American Government. These prohibitions are intrusions into our most personal decisions. They hardly represent ''minimum coercion.'' EDGAR VILLCHUR Woodstock, N.Y., Aug. 14, 1986",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liberated Woman Meets Uncommitted Man,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/opinion/l-liberated-woman-meets-uncommitted-man-468186.html,"To the Editor: In an Aug. 25 Style-page article, you repeat the question broached in a recent spate of popular books: Why are today's women so unhappy in their relationships with men? The experts you cite mostly beg the question by saying that women should not feel this way; moreover, if only women's liberation had gone far enough, they would not need to base their sense of self-worth on a man's opinion of them. To pick up where you leave off, then, why are women in 1986 more unhappy in their love lives than women were in 1956, when, presumably, the rich rewards of women's liberation were as yet unreaped? Other critics might find women's liberation itself to be a major culprit. Women are positively reeling under the weight of all the new freedoms conferred upon them: the freedom to have a demanding career as well as to raise children, to have sex after two dates with a man, to undergo multiple abortions, to be single mothers. While women flail about in the sea of their new freedoms, however, most of them manage to find an anchor: their heady desire to have children. Many men, on the other hand, emancipated from the bonds of marriage and society's mandate to form and support families, are now rudderless. Such men are emotionally immature, self-indulgent and unable to make commitments. Without the responsibilities that once shaped them into men, they are little more than boys. In the light of such dubious progress, it is small wonder that an adversarial relationship has sprung up between men and women; human nature has not yet caught up with women's lib. The woman's movement has played a key role in undermining the very qualities in men that made them attractive to women in the first place, and accordingly, women find today's men ''wimpy'' and uninteresting. The men who are getting the mixed signals do not know what they are doing wrong, and some of them are suffering for it. But their suffering is mitigated by the pursuit of their new sexual and financial freedoms. Meanwhile, the biological time clocks of 32-year-old women like myself, never married and eager for children, keep ticking.

ARCHDIOCESE TO BAR DISSIDENTS FROM SPEAKING IN ITS PARISHES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/nyregion/archdiocese-to-bar-dissidents-from-speaking-in-its-parishes.html,"Those who disagree with the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church should be barred from speaking in parishes in the Archdiocese of New York, the Vicar General of the archdiocese said in a directive to all pastors. The Vicar General, Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, is second in command to John Cardinal O'Connor. The directive was sent in a newsletter to the 410 parishes in the archdiocese. Bishop O'Keefe wrote, ''It is not only inappropriate, it is unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite the individuals to speak at such events whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear, unambiguous teaching of the church.'' The order comes at a time when the Vatican has been clamping down on dissenting views within the American church and when local dioceses have been following the example of the Vatican. Most of the cases involve social and sexual issues, particularly abortion. Last month, for example, the Rev. Charles E. Curran was told by the Vatican that he could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington because of his view that the church should modify its absolute ban on abortion, divorce, birth control and other issues. In another case, an 11-year-old girl in Toledo, Ohio, was told by her pastor that she could not return to her Catholic school unless she renounced her support for a woman's right to abortion. The New York directive states that pastors should exercise ''great care and prudence'' in extending invitations to speakers at ''parish sponsored events - for example, communion breakfasts, graduations, meeting of parish societies, etc.'' In an interview last night, Bishop O'Keefe declined to say whether the guidelines would exclude Governor Cuomo or Geraldine A. Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, from speaking in parishes in the archdiocese. At first, the Vicar General dismissed the question, saying that the national public figures would not want to address a small audience at a church-sponsored event. But when pressed, he said that the decision on their suitability to address a church audience would be left up to the the parish priest. Both the Governor and Mrs. Ferraro -Catholics who say that they are personally opposed to abortion - clashed in 1984 with Cardinal O'Connor over their support for a public policy that allowed women to have an abortion. The Cardinal said that such a position was inconsistent with church teaching and he challenged Catholics in public office to work to overturn through legislation the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. A spokesman for the Governor, Matthew G. Monahan, said last night Mr. Cuomo had not seen the newsletter and would not comment until he saw it. The spokesman added that the guidelines ''don't seem to apply to the Governor,'' who, he said, ''is totally within the confines of church teaching.'' Circulated Within Parishes Bishop O'Keefe's newsletter is sent periodically to pastors in the diocese, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven upstate counties. The newsletter, dated Aug. 18, came to light yesterday as it was being circulated among parish organizations. The item on church speakers was one of more than a dozen in the newsletter, which also included a prayer for South Africa and a plea for donations to the New York Blood Program. Bishop O'Keefe said that the policy was not meant to prohibit the free exercise of opinion. ''I'm not saying we shouldn't listen,'' he said. ''I'm not afraid to listen to anybody's opinion. But when you are bringing together a church society, it is inappropriate to invite people who divide your community.'' The Vicar General said that he drew the policy on speakers after repeated requests by ''certain chapters'' of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish-American fraternal organization, who asked for guidelines on inviting speakers. The Bishop said that the directive was not related to Mr. Cuomo's appearance before the national convention of the Hibernians in Buffalo in July. Mr. Cuomo was the keynote speaker at the convention and, according to Mr. Monahan, was received with warm enthusiasm. In drawing up the policy, the Bishop said, ''I never even thought of the Governor.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO AT ODDS WITH ARCHDIOCESE OVER POLICY ON DISSIDENT SPEAKERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/05/nyregion/cuomo-at-odds-with-archdiocese-over-policy-on-dissident-speakers.html,"Governor Cuomo, declaring that ''we lay people have a right to be heard,'' took issue with the Archdiocese of New York last night over a directive that prohibits those who disagree with the Roman Catholic Church's teachings from speaking at parish events. ''One of the classic positions against restraint of intellectual activity is to ask: 'How do you define it? How do you implement it?' '' the Governor said in an interview, adding later, ''It's very difficult to see how this would be implemented.'' ''From what I'm told, it applies to church teaching,'' he continued. ''But what is church teaching? When are you teaching infallibly and when aren't you? What people, which people will decide who agrees with church teaching? Will you have ecclesiastical courts?'' Past Differences The comments by the Governor, a Roman Catholic, once again put him in potential conflict with the leadership of the archdiocese. In the past, he has been at odds with John Cardinal O'Connor, the head of the archdiocese, over the Cardinal's contention that Catholics in government should apply the teachings of the church to public policy. The director of communications for the archdiocese, Msgr. Peter G. Finn, responded that Mr. Cuomo's comments were ''nonsense as far as I'm concerned.'' ''I hardly think our local synagogue would be about to invite the P.L.O. to their local seder any more than a church in Harlem would invite Mr. Botha to their supper,'' he continued, referring to P. W. Botha, the President of South Africa. ''So I don't understand. What's the problem?'' Pastors Given Final Say ''In response to a request from many people about what the guidelines should be for inviting people for speaking, a guideline was given. Period,'' Monsignor Finn said, emphasizing that in each case the final decision was up to the pastor of the parish. ''I think it's very clear as far as the church is concerned what it means by 'differing with the church's teachings.' '' Mr. Cuomo's statements were in response to a directive by Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, the Vicar General of the archdiocese and the second in command to the Cardinal, contained in a newsletter to 410 parishes. ''It is not only inappropriate,'' the Bishop wrote in the directive, ''it is unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite the individuals to speak at such events whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear, unambiguous teaching of the church.'' The directive states that pastors should exercise ''great care and prudence'' in extending invitations to speakers at ''parish sponsored events - for example, communion breakfasts, graduations, meetings of parish societies, etc.'' The order comes after steps by the Vatican to move against dissenting views in the church in the United States. Last month the Rev. Charles E. Curran was told he could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America because of his belief that the church should alter its stand on abortion, divorce, birth control and other issues. In an interview Wednesday, Bishop O'Keefe said he drafted the policy after repeated requests by ''certain chapters'' of the Ancient Order of Hiberians, an Irish-American fraternal organization, for guidelines on speakers. Mr. Cuomo appeared before the national convention of the Hibernians in Buffalo in July. The Bishop maintained that the directive was not related to Mr. Cuomo, and last night the Governor said he was ''thankful'' for that. ''But still,'' he added, ''it leaves a lot of questions as to whom it does apply. And when does it apply? What events are they referring to? Is an appearance at a cemetery such an event?'' ''The church has the right to make rules for itself, there's no doubt about that,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''The church has the right to make rules. It can say, 'If you want to belong, these are the rules.' '' ''But depending on what the rule was,'' he continued, ''one can say whether it was wise or whether it was unwise. The Catholic Church is not the cardinals, the bishops, the priests and the nuns. The Catholic Church by definition in canon law is the hierarchy, the religious and lay members. We are the church, all of us together. 'I Am Curious About It' ''The way in a congregation for the Jewish people the rabbi is not the congregation - the people and the rabbi together are the congregation - that's the way it is with our church. The lay people are part of the church. We have a right in some cases to be heard on the rules. ''I am curious - I am curious about it,'' the Governor said of the directive, adding that he wanted to study its language more carefully before commenting any further or deciding whether to press his argument more formally with church officials. Earlier yesterday, Mr. Cuomo vigorously defended a woman's legal right to have an abortion and the use of Medicaid funds to pay for it. Obligation to Secular Law Cited The Governor's comments, at a gathering of Democratic women in Manhattan, were among his strongest to date on the issue. They came on the same day as reports were published on the archdiocese's directive on parish speakers. Mr. Cuomo said immediately after the speech that, as a Catholic, he personally remained opposed to abortion but that, when it came to his role as Governor, he was obligated to follow secular law. ''He cannot say of me that my belief is different from the teaching of the Catholic Church,'' the Governor said of Bishop O'Keefe. ''I believe what the church believes.'' Adding that his beliefs were ''a personal thing, not public policy,'' Mr. Cuomo said: ''My position has always been the same. It's not a question of whether I believe birth control is proper or not. The question is: In this society, is it legal? And the answer is yes.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW POLITICS EMERGING OUT OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/05/us/new-politics-emerging-out-of-demographic-changes.html,"Republicans say the rapid demographic changes since Ronald Reagan was elected six years ago are working mostly in their favor. But Democrats are seeking to reshape their party in a manner that would appeal, if in different ways, to the same groups forged into a coalition by Mr. Reagan: traditional and ''new right'' Republicans, blue-collar workers and adults under the age of 45 from various economic levels. For example, Democratic officials are seeking to refashion their policy on the national level so that it will better reflect the conservative interests of Southern and Western voters while holding on to constituencies such as minorities, labor unions and traditional liberals found in large Northern cities. Principal Demographic Changes These were the principal demographic changes: * The number of voters 25 to 44 years old has increased sharply. * Racial and occupational groups are separating more widely, economically and geographically, as the population spreads away from the central cities. * The economy, once based on manufacturing jobs, is changing rapidly and is now based on service and information processing. This is leading to new commercial and residential development marked by an entrepreneurial spirit and opposition to regulation. Fastest-Growing Counties All these trends were visible when Mr. Reagan was first elected to the White House, but they have since become far more pronounced. The most recent census estimates, published by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, show that the 15 counties of over 100,000 people that grew fastest from 1980 to 1986 were all exurban places near such cities as Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Denver and Orlando, Fla., or were new metropolitan areas formed around small cities such as Ocala, Fla., or Myrtle Beach, S.C. In all regions, the greatest growth was in areas removed from the central cities and older suburbs. A national conference held in Philadelphia recently by the American Institute of Certified Public Planners was concerned mostly with problems caused by development, such as traffic congestion, but some common characteristics of the new-growth areas emerged. These areas are populated largely by white, well-educated younger adults with incomes higher than average, many with children. Even the areas that have formed around retirement and recreation communities, such as Myrtle Beach, have large populations of young people who have moved there to take advantage of job openings or to start small businesses. The growing importance of those born in the baby boom after World War II was pointed up in a recent Census Bureau report showing that from April 1980 to July 1985, the population of those 35 to 44 grew nearly a quarter, an increase of 6.1 million nationally. And the next-largest increase, almost 5 million, came in the group 25 to 34 years old. Together they number 74 million and make up more than 40 percent of the population of voting age. Many of the baby boomers were, of course, of voting age in recent elections, but demographers and political experts say the significance of their numbers now is that they are reaching the age of prime political and economic influence, with more of them voting and challenging their elders in leadership positions. There is, however, disagreement as to what their influence will mean in terms of party affiliation. Gordon S. Black of Rochester, a national consultant and pollster, said he believed the ''staggering change'' that occurred in 1984 when many voters switched allegiance from the Democratic to the Republican Party would last for some time because it occurred mostly among the young. ''In the past when the young picked a party preference they tended to stay with it,'' said Mr. Black, noting that while President Reagan had wide support among the young in the 1984 election, Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic candidate, kept the loyalty of older people who became Democrats in the 1930's and 1940's. The other point of view, as expressed by Horace W. Busby, a Washington political analyist, is that a political party is not important to young adults any more. ''They are independent,'' with ''a strong bias toward conservatism,'' he said. Thus, Democrats at all levels are seeking to move their party into a more centrist position to appeal both to the rising number of voters under 45 as well as to the historic conservatism of the South and West, where most of the population now lives. Growth of Exurban Areas Unlike the old suburbs of the past, the new exurban areas are little dependent on the cities but have economies of their own, usually office parks, small businesses, service industries, educational institutions and shopping centers. The Administration's policy favoring reduced Government regulation and domestic social programs has found receptive ground there. Richard M. Scammon, a political analyst and former head of the Census Bureau, said the continued spreading of the population away from the cities had had profound effects on politics. He said that when people moved out, they seldom changed their party affiliation but they supported more conservative issues. ''That is the whole weakness of the trade union movement,'' which has trouble organizing in suburban or exurban settings and which in the past had been a mainstay of the Democratic Party, he said. Gwinett County, Ga., near Atlanta, and the area around Princeton, N.J., in the Northeast, illustrate how demographic changes of underlying uniformity are unfolding in different regions, according to the findings of the public planners' national conference. Mayor Barbara Boggs Sigmund of Princeton said at the conference that the intense development along 10 miles of Route 1 outside Princeton, which she labeled ''centerless, soulless and anti-city,'' had not much changed her college town of 12,000 people. But she said the growth was burdening the town with traffic and squeezing out low-income people. Poorer People Leaving The 1980 Census, she said, showed that 38 percent of the town's population, not counting students, had low to moderate income. ''That is not true now,'' she said, explaining that higher-income people had been moving there in the last few years. And she said in an interview that she feared poor people in the area who belonged to minority groups might be forced into the old central cities such as Philadelphia and Trenton as development spreads. In Gwinett County there has been such a movement for several years. Although no current census figures are available, Paul B. Kelman, the county planning director, said the black population, now around 3 percent, had historically been low for a Southern community but had ''undoubtedly'' been higher in past years. While younger whites have moved in, younger blacks have moved out, mostly to Atlanta, now about 66 percent black. Census Bureau surveys confirm this tendency of the races and income levels to separate. The central cities have lost whites and gained blacks and Hispanic and other minority group members, who have usually had lower incomes. Although this continues a curve dating from 1951, the new figures show that center-city renewals and the decline or reversal of population losses in the 1970's have not stemmed the loss of white residents. Diversity of Issues in Area These trends mean candidates for state and Federal office will find conditions and issues vary, perhaps as never before, from area to area. In Georgia, candidates say they have to address the continued concentration of poor minority group members in Atlanta, the problems of growth and prosperity in Gwinett County and the depression of agriculture in the rural counties beyond. Similar contrasts exist in almost every state. Because a change in party allegiance to the Republican Party is most easily achieved in the South, where most Democrats are conservatives, Republicans have focused there, especially in the new-growth areas such as Gwinett, where many northern Republicans have been settling in recent years. In 1980, Gwinett County was under the Democratic grass-roots control that still exists in most areas of the South. All county and municipal offices were occupied by Democrats. But since then the county has experienced a 50 percent increase in population, from 166,903 to 251,025, according to the estimates. Many newcomers were highly paid professionals from other regions who favored the creation of a new Republican Party rather than the Democrats, who, while conservative, tended to reflect the old rural values of the South, according to officials of both parties. New Role for the Party In 1984 the Republicans made virtually a clean sweep, taking both local offices and legislative seats in Atlanta. John D. Gibb, a businessman and the county Republican chairman, said the party had since become a civic institution that sponsors charitable causes and provides meeting rooms for uses not connected with politics, mirroring Mr. Reagan's interest in volunteerism. The tier of counties around Atlanta has become increasingly influential, and many thousands of Republican residents have settled in the area since 1980. The counties were crucial to the election of Senator Mack Mattingly, a Republican who defeated the long-time Democratic Senator, Herman Talmadge, in 1980. Mr. Mattingly is up for re-election this year in a race crucial to control of the Senate. The Republican National Committee, in a recent strategy paper, said the party's ''long-term prospects in the South are being propelled by powerful demographic and economic forces.'' ''The G.O.P. benefits from an influx of young professionals and retirees,'' the paper said, ''and from the rapid expansion of the suburbs in the various growth centers such as Charlotte, N.C., or Austin, Tex.'' Gain of 10 Seats Projected The paper pointed out that population projections show the Southern states might gain as many as 10 seats in the House of Representatives after the 1990 Census. ''There is no reason,'' the paper said, ''to expect these newcomers to differ from their predecessors: young, well-educated, prosperous and Republican.'' Democrats are also shaping their appeal to young voters, but Democrats assert that these voters are not monolithic but spread across the spectrum of income and racial groups. Mayor Sigmund, a Democrat, said she believed that those younger families moving into the Princeton area might turn out to be ''moderate Democrats.'' The Democrats contend there is division in the 25- to 44-year-old age bracket on social issues. Many of them, especially in the South, the Democrats say, back Mr. Reagan on opposition to abortion, renewal of official prayer in the schools and state protection of religion. But this group is less enthusiastic about reducing Federal programs. Many prospering young professionals also agree with Mr. Reagan on reducing Government regulation but are opposed to his stands on abortion, school prayer and protection of religion. Since 1980 the two groups have largely voted together, but Democrats are betting that when Mr. Reagan retires, no other political figure will be able to keep the coalition together.

CUOMO AND AIDE TO O'CONNOR CLASH OVER ABORTION DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/06/nyregion/cuomo-and-aide-to-o-connor-clash-over-abortion-dissent.html,"Governor Cuomo and the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of New York traded strong words yesterday over the responsibility of a Roman Catholic to adhere to church teaching, particularly on the question of abortion. The Vicar General, Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, declared that Mr. Cuomo was ''so smart he would confuse young people,'' and said ''under no circumstances would I invite him to speak to young people at a graduation.'' ''I've known the Bishop for a long time,'' Mr. Cuomo responded. ''I respect him now, and I always will. Regrettably, I do not agree with him.'' Their exchange was prompted by a directive issued earlier from the Archdiocese to all pastors that bars those who disagree with church teaching from speaking in parishes. In an interview Thursday, the Governor warned that the policy could lead to ''restraint of intellectual activity'' and said, ''we lay people have a right to be heard.'' Speech at Notre Dame Yesterday, the Governor urged the Vicar General to read a speech he delivered in 1984 at the University of Notre Dame, in which Mr. Cuomo laid out his position as a public official in support of the nation's abortion law and his private position, as a Catholic, against abortion. The Vicar General scoffed at the speech, saying ''that's the encyclical by Mario.'' In response to a question, the Bishop said that the Governor, who is considering a race for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination, could be acting politically. ''He might be trying to distance himself from the official teaching of the church because his Catholicism will be an issue, as it has been in the past.'' The Governor responded, ''What I said in Notre Dame, I repeat: I would no more distance myself from my Catholicism than the Bishop would.'' The comments yesterday came in three telephone interviews with the Governor in Albany and four with the Vicar General in New York City. Mr. Cuomo then called Bishop O'Keefe directly. The directive barring certain speakers was issued by the Vicar General, second in command to John Cardinal O'Connor, and applied to all 410 parishes in the archdiocese, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven counties north of New York City. The Vicar General warned pastors to exercise ''great care and prudence'' in extending invitations to speakers whose ''public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the church.'' The exchange between the two men yesterday was more impassioned -and more personal - than the debate in 1984 between Mr. Cuomo and Archbishop John J. O'Connor, who became a cardinal about a year later. The O'Connor-Cuomo debate, which also focused on the responsibility of a Catholic public official to enunciate church teaching, came during the 1984 Presidential campaign. Mr. Cuomo emerged as a spokesman not only for himself but also for Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, who is also a Catholic. In his Notre Dame speech, delivered on Sept. 13, 1984, Mr. Cuomo said that Catholics should practice their religion by setting an example for other Americans, not by seeking to pass laws that impose their views on the rest of the country. Cardinal O'Connor responded that such a position was internally inconsistent, as well as inconsistent with Catholic teaching, and he challenged Catholic lawmakers to overturn through legislation the 1973 Supreme Court decision that permitted abortion. The exchange also comes at a time when the Vatican is clamping down on dissent in the American Catholic Church. Last month, the Vatican said that the Rev. Charles E. Curran could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America, in Washington. In another action against a church liberal, the Vatican recently ordered Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle to turn over authority to his auxiliary bishop in five areas, including birth control and homosexuality. The actions against the Washington priest and the Seattle archbishop, both of them liberals on social and sexual issues, were considered unusual but not unprecedented. Cardinal O'Connor declined to comment yesterday on the exchange between the Vicar General and the Governor beyond saying that he found the Governor's remarks ''surprising.'' When first questioned Wednesday about his directive on who may speak in Catholic churches, Bishop O'Keefe said he did not have Mr. Cuomo in mind. ''I never even thought of the Governor,'' he said. Yesterday, however, after he read newspaper accounts of Mr. Cuomo's attack on his policy, the Vicar General sounded angry. ''He is way out on a limb now,'' he said of the Governor. The Bishop said he objected to Mr. Cuomo's charge that the church did not make efforts to consult with the laity. Bishop O'Keefe said that through parish councils and committees the church did reach out to the laity. There are, however, certain issues about which the laity may not argue, he said. ''Nobody,'' he said, ''not myself, or the Cardinal or the Pope himself will take a position against the authentic teaching of the Catholic Church on abortion.'' At that point in the conversation, Bishop O'Keefe said that he would not allow the Governor to speak before a graduating class at the church that the bishop heads, Saint John the Evangelist, which is part of the Catholic Center at 1011 First Avenue, near 56th Street. In the separate conversations, Mr. Cuomo appeared pained by the confrontation. ''It is not pleasant,'' he said, adding, ''I believe in the long run, the honest exchange of opinion will eventually produce more enlightenment.'' The Governor noted that the Pope and the United States bishops have long taken a position against capital punishment. It is a position that the Governor shares but is opposed by many of his political opponents, who favor the death penalty. ''Does that mean that the right-to-lifers and the Republicans, including President Reagan, can't be invited to speak in a church?'' he said. It wasn't until late yesterday that the Vicar General and the Governor spoke with each other. In recounting the conversation to a reporter, they emphasized different points. The Governor said that the Bishop did not accuse him of violating church teaching. The Bishop did not deny that statement but said he told the Governor that he was guilty of ''confusing the issues by talking about capital punishment, birth control and abortion as if they are the same.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CLERIC PRAYS FOR DEATH PENALTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/06/nyregion/cleric-prays-for-death-penalty.html,"Delegates to the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association convention luncheon at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills Thursday applauded when the union endorsed Governor Cuomo for re-election, despite his opposition to the death penalty. But they cheered louder for a Police Department chaplain's invocation before the meal. After asking God's blessing on Mayor Koch, the Roman Catholic chaplain, Msgr. John Kowsky, said: ''And for our Governor, just one little thing he's gotta do, Lord: learn to turn the switch.'' The Mayor and the Governor, who both spoke at the luncheon, were late because fog delayed their helicopter's landing and missed the invocation. Mr. Cuomo learned of it only yesterday, a spokesman, Gary Fryer, said, but had no comment. Monsignor Kowsky, who is assigned to St. Joseph's Chapel at Gateway Plaza in Battery Park City, was making pastoral calls yesterday and could not be reached for comment. But a spokesman for the New York archdiocese, Msgr. Peter G. Finn, said Monsignor Kowsky's support of the death penalty did not violate church teachings. ''The position of the United States bishops, as well as the bishops of the State of New York, is in opposition to capital punishment as the way to solve the problems of crime,'' he said. ''But that is not the universal position of the church, binding against all persons,'' as is the case, for instance, with Catholic teachings on abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1986",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/06/nyregion/news-summary-saturday-september-6-1986.html,"International The hijacking of a Pan Am 747 bound for New York from Pakistan ended in gunfire and grenade explosions after Arabic-speaking gunmen suddenly began shooting and detonating grenades inside the parked plane at the Karachi international airport. At least 15 people among the nearly 400 aboard were reported killed and scores were wounded. Many passengers fled from the plane. At the same time, Pakistani commandos outside the plane apparently also fired shots, killing two of the gunmen, according to the Pakistani authorities. At least two other hijackers were reported in custody. A United States consular official said there 83 Americans on the plane. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] President Reagan condemned the hijacking as a ''cruel and sinister terrorist act,'' and denounced the hijackers who killed and injured passengers for committing ''a despicable and cowardly crime.''Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said there was no immediate evidence whether Libya, Iran or another nation was involved in the attack. [ 1:5. ] A Los Angeles physician on the 747 in Karachi said passengers and crew members screamed, wept and fell to the floor when the gunfire erupted and grenades exploded. Dr. Michael Goldstein said: ''We hit the floor. I literally threw my wife out the door and a few other people before I jumped myself.'' [ 4:1. ] The F.A.A. sent a ''general alert'' to all United States airlines for possible terrorist attacks between 10 days and two weeks ago, a Pan American Airways executive said. Martin R. Shugrue Jr., Pan Am's chief operating officer, also said that even though the security system at the Karachi airport had passed three inspections by the Federal Aviation Administration in 12 months, Pakistani officials were responsible for allowing ''the airport's perimeter'' to be penetrated by terrorists.'' [ 1:6. ] A foiled bombing in the Paris subway prompted the French Government to call for vigilance against possible new terrorist attacks. The warning followed an emergency Cabinet meeting after a bomb was discovered in a packed train in the rush hour. [ 3:4. ] Impatience with the Soviet detention of an American journalist was expressed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz in a speech at Harvard University's 350th anniversary celebration. Mr. Shultz demanded that the Soviet Union ''find the wisdom'' to quickly release the reporter, Nicholas S. Daniloff, in accord ''with the dictates of simple human decency and of civilized national behavior.'' [ 1:2. ] National A rocket launching in Florida marked a major United States success in a year plagued by catastrophe and mishap. The launching of an unmanned Delta rocket carrying a secret payload was the first major experiment in President Reagan's antimissile plan, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, to be conducted entirely in space. [ 1:1. ] John A. Walker Jr.'s failure to pass lie-detector tests has led prosecutors to believe that he might be lying about the origins of his career as a Soviet spy, law-enforcement officials and other sources said. Federal officials said they might be forced to abandon the plea bargain with Mr. Walker and his son, Michael, and place them on trial. [ 1:2. ] A vengeful editor's rewriting of parts of history articles for forthcoming editions of The Encylopedia Britannica, was confirmed by Britannica officials. The distortions, however, were caught by a computer. The editor was being laid off. [ 8:2. ] The U.S. will admit 68 Cubans imprisoned in Cuba for political reasons. The Reagan Administration announced that it had cleared them and that the Cuban Government would probably release them by the end of this month. [ 9:5. ] The unemployment rate eased one-tenth of a point in August to 6.7 percent, its third successive decline, the Labor Department reported. [ 11:1. ] A national testing board for teachers is to be planned by a panel appointed by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, which proposed ' the board last May. The board would certify the professional qualification of teachers. The proposal for certification, which would be voluntary for teachers, has been endorsed the two major teacher unions and by the National Governors' Association. [ 28:1. ] A full-rigged sailing ship sank in a sudden squall Sunday off the coast of North Carolina, but the five crew members were rescued by a fisherman after they drifted five days on a life raft without food or water. The 135-foot vessel, the Calida, had sailed in New York's Liberty Weekend in July. [ 30:4. ] Metropolitan Governor Cuomo and a bishop clashed over the abortion issue. Mr. Cuomo and the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of New York exchanged sharp remarks over the responsibility of a Roman Catholic to adhere to church teaching, particularly on the question of abortion. [ 1:1 ] An autopsy on Jennifer Dawn Levin found that the 18-year-old woman who was found dead in Central Park last week had been strangled.

"IN QUEENS, CITY SCANDAL IS MINOR ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/nyregion/in-queens-city-scandal-is-minor-issue.html,"The city's corruption scandal may have toppled the Queens Borough President and rocked the Queens Democratic organization, but it certainly was not the first thing brought up by questioners at the Macedonia A.M.E. Church in Flushing on a recent night. The occasion was a debate between Claire Shulman and Lois Marbach, the candidates in the Democratic primary for Queens Borough President on Tuesday. Mrs. Shulman was Deputy Borough President under the late Donald R. Manes. After he resigned last February amid accusations that he was involved in bribery, she was chosen by the City Council delegation from Queens to succeed him until Dec. 31, and she is now seeking to serve the remaining three years of his term. Ms. Marbach, a Reform Democratic activist who has never held public office, is trying to oust Mrs. Shulman from Borough Hall. Victory in the primary is considered tantamount to election. Korean Groups Quiz Candidates Two hundred Korean-Americans from the ethnically diverse area watched representatives of their civic groups question the candidates in a packed meeting room at the church. The session was more than half over before a query finally touched on the municipal scandal. Earlier questions had involved such issues as rising rents facing merchants and the need for improved services for the growing Korean-American community in Queens. As the borough's primary races near an end, the revelations that led to Mr. Manes's resignation as Borough President and Queens Democratic leader appear for the most part to be having little effect on the races, party officials and other political observers in the borough said. One reason, some said, is that other issues are of more immediate concern to many Queens voters. The scandal is ''one of the concerns, but not as much as commercial rent control'' or other issues, said Sook Nam Jenny Choo, a lawyer and community activist who was the moderator of the Shulman-Marbach forum. Race in Far Rockaway A similar perspective was offered by civic leaders after a debate in Far Rockaway among the four candidates for the Sixth Congressional District seat in southern Queens. At the debate, which was held at the Gustave Hartman Y.M.-Y.W.H.A., there were inquiries about the candidates' stands on matters such as abortion and the problems facing the Rockaways before a questioner finally asked how the four would ''restore the effectiveness of Democratic congressmen'' in the wake of the scandal. The candidates - Alton R. Waldon Jr., the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, Simeon Golar and Hulbert James Sr. - appeared before about 300 people, roughly divided between blacks and whites, reflecting the district's racial mix. Edward L. Sadowsky, a former City Councilman from Queens, had another explanation for what he called the ''nondiscernible'' effect of the scandal on the borough's primaries. Perception of Corruption's Limits ''I don't believe the popular perception is that the corruption was pervasive,'' he said. ''I believe people are prepared to look at it as limited to Manes.'' Mrs. Shulman has not been implicated in illegalities or misconduct, but one Councilman from Queens said the reasons she was considered the heavy favorite in the Borough Pesident race go beyond that. The Councilman, Morton Povman, cited the 60-year-old Mrs. Shulman's appearance - ''a nice, motherly figure'' - and political luck. ''I think she's fortunate that Lois Marbach doesn't have the money to mount a vociferous campaign,'' he said. The 40-year-old Ms. Marbach, a dental-office manager, acknowledged that insufficient funds had hampered her campaign, in which one of her themes is that Mrs. Shulman ''should have known'' about corruption in Queens. But Ms. Marbach said the voters she encountered agreed with her and wanted ''a clean sweep at Borough Hall.'' Mrs. Shulman, who said she did not know of any wrongdoing because she was concentrating on governmental matters while Deputy Borough President, said ''it doesn't appear at this time'' that the scandal is a significant issue. Issues Dividing Candidates The candidates also disagree on such issues as commercial rent control (Ms. Marbach favors it and Mrs. Shulman opposes it) and on the domed stadium planned for northern Queens (Ms. Marbach opposes it and Mrs. Shulman favors it if a professional football team is secured by the end of the year). The Republican candidate, Estelle Cooper, has no primary opponent. In the Sixth Congressional District, Mr. Golar sought to use the scandal issue during the Far Rockaway debate. ''Five years ago I spoke out against the ugliness of the corruption of the Manes machine,'' he said, adding that the ''Queens party machine has endorsed'' Mr. Waldon. Mr. Waldon, in an interview, said, ''To characterize me as an extension of the machine Manes ran in Queens is inaccurate.'' That machine ceased existing last winter, he said, while his endorsement in May was by ''a county organization which conducted a very democratic and wide-open process.'' Mr. Waldon will hold the congressional seat until the end of this year, having narrowly defeated Mr. Flake in a special election in June held after the death of the district's longtime representative, Joseph P. Addabbo. Mr. Waldon and Mr. Flake are widely considered the front-runners in the current race. As an exception to the general trend, some politicians cite the experience of Alan Gershuny, a longtime political associate of Mr. Manes and his executive assistant at Borough Hall. In July, Mr. Gershuny dropped his planned primary challenge to Leonard P. Stavisky, the Democratic incumbent in the 12th State Senate District in northern Queens, partly, Mr. Gershuny said, because Mr. Stavisky was stressing Mr. Gershuny's tie to Mr. Manes. Mr. Gershuny has not been implicated in the scandal and has said he was unaware of any improprieties. Mr. Stavisky, who now has no opposition, said, ''I never mentioned Manes's name.'' But, he acknowledged, ''I indicated my opponent was the political operator at Borough Hall.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUBTLE CONTRAST IN CONNECTICUT G.O.P. CANDIDATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/nyregion/subtle-contrast-in-connecticut-gop-candidates.html,"In the final days of campaigning before their primary election on Tuesday, the three Republican candidates for governor have sharpened some of their differences on issues. Except for a few clear-cut differences on issues such as abortion and the death penalty, many of the disagreements that have emerged among the three Republicans have been more subtle than substantive. The three candidates - former State Senators Richard C. Bozzuto and Gerald Labriola and State Representative Julie D. Belaga - have mostly stressed their differences with the Democratic administration of Gov. William A. O'Neill, rather than with one another. All have promised to support the primary winner in the general election on Nov. 4. While generally avoiding personal attacks on Mr. O'Neill, all three Republicans have promised stronger leadership in the state's government. As seen by them, the O'Neill administration is lackluster, is dominated by politicians rather than professional managers, and reacts to problems rather than planning for them. According to the candidates, their differences have not always been apparent because of the restrictive formats of the debates in which they have engaged. ''We do have a lot of differences, but they don't always come through when you have one minute to give your position on education or drugs,'' Mr. Bozzuto said. Different Stands, Different Issues Dr. Labriola, a Naugatuck pediatrician, has called himself more conservative than Mr. Bozzuto, who owns an insurance agency in Waterbury, or Mrs. Belaga, a 10-year veteran of the Legislature from Westport. The Labriola campaign commercials describe him as ''the only consistent conservative'' in the race. Dr. Labriola said he would support a state law making abortions illegal, if the states were allowed to regulate abortions. Mr. Bozzuto and Mrs. Belaga said they support a woman's right to abortion. On capital punishment, Dr. Labriola said he would expand the state's current death penalty law to include murder committed during a rape or arson. Mrs. Belaga said she supports the death penalty for multiple murders and the murder of a police officer. Mr. Bozzuto said he opposed the death penalty and favored alternatives, such as life imprisonment without parole. Most of the candidates' recent debates have been dominated by discussions of state taxes and transportation issues. All Oppose Income Tax All three Republicans oppose enactment of a state personal income tax, as does Mr. O'Neill. With the state's current economic prosperity, Dr. Labriola has called for $175 million in tax cuts, including a reduction in the state sales tax, to 7 percent from 7.5 percent. Mrs. Belaga said she would repeal the state's current succession, or inheritance, tax, which she called a hardship on the elderly, and would seek to reduce the state tax on interest and dividend income. Mr. Bozzuto said his priority would be to cut the state's current tax of 4 percent on residential utility bills, but he cautioned that tax cuts might not be possible with the state's recent commitments to increased spending for programs such as state aid to local school districts. With Connecticut embarked on a 10-year rebuilding of its roads and bridges, Mr. Bozzuto has called for a suspension of new construction work not directly related to safety needs and a reassessment to better plan the rebuilding program without disrupting traffic. Mrs. Belaga and Dr. Labriola said they disagreed with Mr. Bozzuto's proposed moratorium. Mrs. Belaga said she would increase the fines for overweight trucks. Dr. Labriola proposed mandatory random drug testing of truck drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PRIEST AIDS HISPANIC COMMUNITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/nyregion/priest-aids-hispanic-community.html,"THE Rev. Francis McQuade traveled to the Dominican Republic several years ago, when he was in the seminary, to improve his Spanish at the request of his bishop. ''Once I was down there, I not only learned Spanish, I grew to admire and love the Latin culture,'' he said. ''I was sent to live with a very poor family. What I saw made me commit myself to working with the Latin community.'' Today, Father McQuade, known to his largely Hispanic parishioners at St. Hugh of Lincoln Roman Catholic Church in Huntington Station as ''Father Francisco,'' finds himself a middle-man between the problems of the Hispanic community of Long Island and the affluent suburban culture in which it is immersed. He and others on Long Island struggle particularly to assist the troubled, and often troubling, ''undocumented'' population of aliens who have entered the United States without permission and have not sought permanent-residence status. Of the approximately 120,000 Hispanic people living on Long Island about a third are illegals, according to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties. But despite the problems, the Hispanic population is rapidly becoming a substantial political and economic force on Long Island, Father McQude and others agree. ''The developing Latin community is exciting to see,'' he said. ''It is growing by leaps and bounds and will impact voting patterns, marketing, social services and educational needs. We have to encourage the towns and counties to prepare for the increasing numbers and to defuse the prejudices. When the Latins first came here there was a lot of prejudice, and it's still about the same.'' Hispanic people first came to the Island from Puerto Rico, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Many worked in construction during the development of the Route 110 industrial corridor, or worked as domestics in wealthy North Shore homes. Others went to Riverhead as seasonal laborers on East End farms. They came to Port Jefferson Station to fill out maintenance and cleaning crews at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. They came to communities such as Brentwood and Holbrook to do piece work in clothing or electronics factories. They came to Glen Cove and Rockville Centre to work in hotels and restaurants. Today, many come from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Chile, countries torn by revolution, sometimes to avoid political persecution. Earlier this summer, a number of of illegal aliens were arrested at several factories in Suffolk County and transported to a Federal detention center in Louisiana to await hearings on whether they should be deported or permitted to return to Long Island. A number of Father McQuade's parishioners do not speak English and are unfamiliar with the workings of American society. The families, with a structure based on the unquestioned authority of the male head of the household, are constantly challenged by the new values and institutions around them, creating family tensions. Probably his toughest job, Father McQuade said, is to help the Hispanic people retain the parts of their culture that he believes are special, while helping them discard those values that have no place here. His sermons, delivered in Spanish in the Spanish chapel, actually the cafeteria of St. Hugh's, exhort those listening to go out in the local community and challenge drug dealers, oppose abortion and maintain a strong family. Father McQuade also lobbies public agencies and legislative groups, including the Suffolk County Legislature, to win aid for Long Island's Hispanic population. added that the Spanish mass at St. Hugh's is a ''very, very important'' part of her life. Many of the Hispanic people in Huntington Station are the second generation to live in that area. While their parents were often laborers, many of the children have become professionals. ''They worked in construction. And with the proximity to the estates in the area, there was quick work for landscapers and domestics,'' Father McQuade said. ''Now they're engineers and accountants and they are going to college.'' But large numbers of Hispanic people, and many of the 500 Hispanic families in St. Hugh's 4,000-family parish, have failed to make the transition to the middle class. Father McQuade spent three and a half years after he was ordained working in Brentwood, with Long Island's largest Hispanic community. He came to St. Hugh's two years ago on a five-year assignment. ''I will be working with Spanish parishes probably my whole career,'' he said. ''I'm needed and I like it.'' His style seems to suit the Hispanic community in the parish. Attendance at the Sunday Spanish mass has grown, from 60 to 75 people a week to about 250, including a choir that sings hymns in Spanish accompanied by guitar, maracas, bongos and the clapping of hands. But all is not as positive in Huntington Station and other communities where Hispanic people have settled, where those who have trouble finding jobs or getting paid enough to survive struggle to support their families and to keep from being deported. They compete for housing with other minority groups. They struggle against those Hispanic people who have turned to drugs to make money. Father McQuade and members of the Hispanic community have worked with the police in the area to put pressure on drug dealers. Last spring, he and members of Long Island's Hispanic population took to the streets. While he carried a six-foot cross, the group stopped at 14 stations, including the local Long Island Rail Road station, where Father McQuade made a speech welcoming the illegals. The group also stopped outside a local bar that he called a popular hangout for drug dealers, where they prayed for the dealers. Father McQuade also mobilized parish members to go to Criminal Court every day during the trials of 24 Puerto Ricans arrested in Huntington Station on charges of dealing drugs. The Hispanic community pressed for stiff sentences for the accused, who received terms of up to three to six years. ''The Puerto Rican community sent letters saying that they were ashamed of these people,'' Father McQuade said. ''We have also indicated that we do not want to see easy paroles granted for them.'' The group also sent letters to those convicted after they started serving their terms, offering to pray for them and to help with their rehabilitation. Father McQuade said he has received no response to the letters. Last year, acting with other Long Island Hispanic leaders, Father McQuade testified at a public hearing before the Suffolk Legislature in support of a bill to prevent local agencies from asking whether people seeking county services are illegal aliens or not. The bill was passed and signed into law. The only exception is for illegals, who must tell the police of their status when they seek help. Father McQuade said he has also struggled with the male and female roles in Latin families, and parents frustrated by children who want to live their lives American-style without rigid rules. ''My No. 1 agenda item is to shatter the stereotypes that North Americans have of Hispanics and Hispanics have of themselves,'' he said. Aldo Bravo, a member of St. Hugh's parish council and a leader in the Hispanic community, said that ''Father McQuade has been instrumental in developing a sense of pride and belonging for the Hispanics in the parish.'' Mr. Bravo added that the strong involvement of the Hispanic community is valuable to the church. ''We are used to the church having a greater degree of influence on the lives and politics of our countries,'' he said. ''We live the church, rather than just attending church on weekends.'' For Efraina Gonzalez, who leads the Latin choir, the Spanish mass ''is more than spiritual direction - we hear an announcement for jobs, for voter registration or whatever else is happening,'' she said. But to Msgr. Alfred Suoave, the pastor of St. Hugh's, the issue of a separate Hispanic community is a delicate one. ''We are trying to bring all of our parishoners together to become an integrated, unified part of the community,'' he said. Father McQuade said that his role at St. Hugh's has been a major learning experience in his life. But, he added, ''I wouldn't mind if the time comes when there is no need for a Spanish ministry.'' Until that time, according to Mr. Bravo, Hispanic people need to play a more direct role in the direction of the parish and of Long Island society. ''The next step is to run our own destiny,'' he said. ''As members of the parish we need to contribute not only time and money, but ideas. That's the next step.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; Miami Archbishop Offers Absolution for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/us/around-the-nation-miami-archbishop-offers-absolution-for-abortions.html,"Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy of Miami has issued a pastoral letter offering absolution to people who have had abortions or assisted in performing them. The proposal to give priests the power to absolve, or forgive, those who have participated in an abortion is part of a wide-ranging jubilee plan to coincide with a 1987 visit by Pope John Paul II to southern Florida. The Archbishop was unavailable for comment on the letter, which he issued Friday, but his Auxiliary Bishop, Augustin A. Roman, told The Miami Herald that the move was ''unusual and quite important.'' The Archdiocese of Miami includes Dade, Broward and Monroe counties, an area with 1.1 million Roman Catholics. The letter said the Archbishop hoped the move would prompt inactive Catholics to return to the church.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE REGION; Cuomo Clashes With Archdiocese,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/weekinreview/the-region-cuomo-clashes-with-archdiocese.html,"The Vicar General of the Archdiocese of New York named no names recently when he directed parish priests to bar speakers who disagreed with official Roman Catholic teachings. But Governor Cuomo, a Roman Catholic who has been at odds with leaders of the archdiocese, apparently felt compelled last week to try on the shoe. If it fit, it pinched. In a rapidly escalating exchange of increasingly personal comments on the directive and its implications, the Governor referred to the order as a ''restraint of intellectual activity'' and declared, ''we lay people have a right to be heard.'' The Vicar General, Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, said the directive was issued in response to a lay group's request for guidelines. Bishop O'Keefe, who is second in command to John Cardinal O'Connor, said that, in writing the guidelines, he ''never even thought of the Governor,'' whose support of legal abortion has led to public disagreements with Cardinal O'Connor. But within days, another archdiocesan spokesman, Msgr. Peter G. Finn, said Mr. Cuomo's comments were ''nonsense.'' Then Bishop O'Keefe ridiculed the Governor's stand on abortion as ''the encyclical by Mario,'' saying Mr. Cuomo ''might be trying to distance himself from the official teaching of the church because his Catholicism will be an issue'' if he decides to run for President. The Governor responded, ''I would no more distance myself from Catholicism than the Bishop would.'' The directive that started it all, sent Aug. 18 to the pastors the 410 parishes in the archdiocese, came amid a wider Vatican clamp-down on dissenting views in the American church. In the directive, Bishop O'Keefe wrote that it was ''inappropriate, unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite the individuals to speak whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear, unambiguous teaching of the church.'' Cardinal O'Connor did not comment on the exchange except to say that he found the Governor's comments ''surprising.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For Congress From New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/opinion/for-congress-from-new-york.html,"It's rare for New York Republican races to be decided in the primary, and then it happens only upstate - as in Utica's 25th Congressional District this year. The incumbent, Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate with a fine conservation record who deserves re-election, is threatened by the far-right zeal of Robert Barstow. But in New York City, dispositive primaries come only on the Democratic side. This year, three races for Congress will be settled in Tuesday's Democratic primary. MANHATTAN After 10 years as the liberal personification of the liberal Upper West Side, Representative Ted Weiss has come up against a challenge in the 17th District, which stretches from the Battery to Riverdale. Julian Schroeder, a former investment banker, is spending heavily to oppose him from the right, in the Henry Jackson pattern. Off stage, Mr. Schroeder makes a thoughtful impression, differing mainly in foreign affairs. He has published a book of his thoughts on the Nicaraguan contras; his view parallels the Reagan view. There could not be a sharper contrast. Mr. Weiss has led the opposition to contra aid in the House. As a candidate, Mr. Schroeder makes a much less favorable impression. In a debate between the two, his harsh red-baiting (''He visited Cuba!'') made him, and not the often-strident Mr. Weiss, seem shrill. Shrill is a word that comes to mind when we think of Mr. Weiss, who strenuously opposed Westway and other constructive undertakings. In 1983, after American troops were sent into Grenada, he signed a resolution to impeach the President. Such positions help explain why, after 10 years, he does not carry more weight with his colleagues. Nevertheless, even if a gadfly, Mr. Weiss gives voice to views not heard so often in Washington now. Congress should hear such voices. BROOKLYN People in Congress talk of showhorses and workhorses. Major Owens, the incumbent in the 12th District, is a workhorse, a sound, effective Congressman who has warmly earned re-election to a third term. His opponent is Roy Innis, a dramatic and mercurial candidate who presents an array of ideas, sometimes compelling, sometimes conservative, not always clear. Mr. Owens is a librarian, the first ever elected to Congress, and a shrewd, practical politician. When it was easy for blacks to denounce Gramm-Rudman-Hollings cuts in social spending, he recognized the futility of dead-end resistance. Instead, he pressed the black caucus to take practical positions that helped win exemptions for programs like Medicaid and food stamps. QUEENS The most hotly contested race is in the Sixth District of Queens, long represented by the late Joseph Addabbo. This changing district has churned up four unusually able black candidates. Each has strong qualifications to serve. One, the Rev. Floyd Flake, has the potential also to lead. Hulbert James is a consultant and authority on social welfare. Simeon Golar is a lawyer and former public official, voluble, wise and experienced. Sound, steady Alton Waldon narrowly won the recent special election to fill the Addabbo seat, with biracial support. He has built an impressive record in law, law enforcement and lawmaking. If returned to Congress for a full term, he would serve the district with ability. Floyd Flake might serve the district with distinction. In the tradition of many black officeholders, he is a clergyman. Previously, he was a Xerox marketing analyst and Boston University's dean of students. We disagree with his opposition to Medicaid funding for abortions and his support of tuition tax credits. But we share his opposition to the death penalty and aid to the contras in Nicaragua. What is impressive above all is his position on social welfare issues. More than position: achievement. He tells of the $11 million senior-citizens complex, 527 residents, that his church has built on an old dump. There's a $3.8 million school, a home ownership program. In Congress, this calm, confident man could find a lens to magnify such effort elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
O'CONNER BACKS A CURB ON DISSENTING SPEAKERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/08/nyregion/o-conner-backs-a-curb-on-dissenting-speakers.html,"John Cardinal O'Connor defended yesterday a directive by his Vicar General that parish speakers be screened according to their beliefs, saying it was ''common sense'' not to invite people who would ''attack the church'' to appear before Roman Catholic audiences. The Cardinal, in his first comments on the directive, joined a discussion with Governor Cuomo that began when the Vicar General, Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, instructed parish priests that people who disagree with the ''clear, unambiguous teaching of the church'' not be invited to speak at parish events. ''People get confused,'' Cardinal O'Connor said, ''when someone who's well known for disagreeing with the church in a substantive matter, not in an insignificant matter, is given a platform.'' Later yesterday, Governor Cuomo, who had sent an aide to record the Cardinal's news conference, which followed a 10 A.M. mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, said the directive would be ''confusing'' to put into effect because of the ''murky'' question of what constitutes church teaching. Cuomo Cites Death Penalty Views In remarks after his appearance on the WCBS-TV program ''Newsmakers'' and in a subsequent telephone interview from the Governor's Mansion in Albany, Mr. Cuomo argued that the directive could be applied to those who favored the death penalty, as well as those who support the availability of abortions or the use of birth control. With the Pope and the American bishops opposed to the death penalty, the Governor argued, unwelcome speakers at parish events could include President Reagan, Mayor Koch and Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate for governor. ''They will say abortion is more grave,'' the Governor said, referring to church leaders, particularly Bishop O'Keefe, ''But all three are church teachings.'' No Reference to Cuomo The directive did not refer specifically to Mr. Cuomo, a Roman Catholic who personally opposes abortion and birth control but who insists that it is his task as governor to enforce existing laws. Governor Cuomo also opposes capital punishment and has consistently vetoed legislation that would restore the death penalty in New York State. Mr. O'Rourke has made a campaign issue of the Governor's opposition. The directive does not spell out what elements of church teaching must be supported by parish speakers. Cardinal O'Connor pointed to the directive's latitude, but also to its implied focus on abortion. The Cardinal said: ''It would be a matter of judgment whether an individual in a given set of circumstances expressed views which were so contradictory to the church on abortion or any other matter that it would create scandal.'' ''The church's support, or seeming support, perceived support of a speaker who was explicitly supporting abortion - that would be a scandal, I think. It wouldn't matter who it would be - a political figure or anyone else.'' Gravity of Issues Last week, Bishop O'Keefe said the Governor was ''confusing the issues by talking about capital punishment, birth control and abortion as if they were the same.'' Mr. Cuomo yesterday agreed that in the eyes of the church the three were ''not exactly the same in terms of gravity.'' Nevertheless, the Governor said, he had consulted over the weekend with theologians, including the Rev. Richard McBrien at the University of Notre Dame, and been assured that all involved church teaching. Bishop O'Keefe's directive comes at a time when the Vatican is clamping down on dissent in the American Catholic Church. Last month, the Vatican said that the Rev. Charles E. Curran could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington because of his stands on birth control, abortion and other issues. Similarly, the Vatican has limited the authority of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle. Yesterday, the Governor and the Cardinal were asked if the directive, and other recent actions by the church, improperly curtailed freedom of speech. Both said it did not. Distinction Acknowledged Mr. Cuomo made a clear distinction between a democratic society, where free speech is a ''cherished right,'' and the Catholic Church, where there is no presumption of ''shared authority.'' ''The Catholic Church is not a democracy the way society is,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ''and I have no objection to that.'' The Cardinal made an analogy to a television reporter who criticized the management of his station during a broadcast. The reporter would probably lose his job, the Cardinal said, ''but nobody would consider it a violation of free speech; it would be considered a violation of common sense.'' Mr. Cuomo described his latest contretemps with the archdiocese as ''kind of overblown'' but nevertheless seemed to encourage its continuation. Noting that he receives ''hundreds'' of letters every time he speaks out on religious issues, the Governor said: ''The whole society is sensitive to this. People are afraid of church-state involvement and people are right. It's a dangerous business.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A PARISH BANS ASSEMBLYMAN FROM SPEAKING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/09/nyregion/a-parish-bans-assemblyman-from-speaking.html,"Since his birth 46 years ago, Assemblyman John C. Dearie has been a member of St. Raymond's Roman Catholic parish in the Bronx, attending its school before going off to the University of Notre Dame and eventually watching his two children baptized in the parish. But this summer, the Assemblyman said in an interview yesterday, he was taken aside by the pastor and told that, on orders from John Cardinal O'Connor, he would not be permitted to speak at parish-sponsored events because, although he opposes abortions, he had voted this year and in previous years to allow Medicaid funds to be used for them. Mr. Dearie said that the ban had been in effect since June but that he was talking about it now because of comments by Governor Cuomo in recent days critical of church policy that prohibits those who oppose church teaching from speaking at parish-sponsored events. Describing himself as ''a seriously practicing Catholic,'' the Assemblyman said he was upset that his parish - ''I used to play basketball there as a kid'' - no longer considered him eligible to do all he would like to do there. The archdiocese, he added, was acting ''in anticipation of the elections,'' to try to defeat candidates who do not vote the way the church would like. Cardinal O'Connor said through a spokesman yesterday that he had not ordered the parish to bar Mr. Dearie from speaking and that he was ''sorry'' if ''an overzealous aide'' had done so. But the Cardinal fell short of saying that the Assemblyman should be allowed to speak at the parish. The spokesman, Msgr. Peter G. Finn, said it was for individual parish pastors to make that decision by drawing on the archdiocese's guidelines, adding that ''the guidelines speak for themselves.'' The guidelines say it is ''unacceptable'' for those who disagree with the church's teachings to speak at parish-sponsored events. They were not formally promulgated until last month, but since earlier in the year the Vatican has been clamping down on dissent in the American church. The ban on Mr. Dearie came in June, when he was invited to speak before a communion breakfast. ''I was told,'' the pastor of St. Raymond's, Msgr. Henry J. Vier, said yesterday, ''that the Cardinal thought it was out of order for us to have invited him to our communion breakfast.'' Mr. Dearie was eventually allowed to speak at the breakfast. But Monsignor Vier said he had been instructed by an aide to the Cardinal, the Rev. Christopher Maloney, to make a statement afterward and to make clear that the Assemblyman would not be allowed to speak again. Monsignor Finn yesterday declined to make Father Maloney available for comment. 'It Was Required of Me' ''I got up at the end of the breakfast,'' said Monsignor Vier, who baptized the Dearie children, ''and told the audience that I had instructions from the Cardinal's house to say that the Cardinal did not want any public official to speak before a Catholic gathering, if that official favored public funding of abortions.'' ''I accepted the decision and agreed with it,'' he said. ''It wasn't a pleasant duty. I didn't like the idea of having to do it. But it was required of me.'' ''This is a difficult issue for me,'' the Assemblyman said of abortion and allowing Medicaid funds to be used for it. ''I have two young children, a 3 1/2- and a 2-year-old. I went to Catholic school, Catholic high school, Notre Dame. The positions of the church are very, very important to me. ''But if I don't keep an open mind and evaluate my own positions,'' he continued, ''I wouldn't be a very good legislator.'' Mr. Dearie said he had received notes and phone calls from parishioners, including those who oppose abortion. ''In varying degrees,'' he added, ''they said they were offended by the message that if you disagree with the church on this particular issue, they slam the door in your face.'' 'Doing His Job' Monsignor Vier said he, too, had received reaction from parishioners. ''I think they were surprised,'' he said. ''But I don't think anybody said the Cardinal was wrong.'' Assemblyman Dearie, who spoke softly and sounded deflated, said he bore no grudge toward the Monsignor. He said, in fact he felt ''simpatico'' with him. ''He was doing his job.'' ''I have no problem with the Cardinal, the Bishops,'' he continued. ''I have no problem with them strongly reinforcing at every opportunity their position on this issue. That's their job. But there are so many other issues - the homeless, housing, senior citizens - that to simply close the door as a result of one vote -- ''To lock the door - in effect, cut off the communication and the honest evaluation of a legislator trying to make a decision on this very difficult issue, it seems to me in the long and short run is not good policy.'' Mr. Dearie, an Assemblyman since 1973, said if he had been a member of the Legislature when it legalized abortion in the state - an action taken before the United States Supreme Court made it legal nationwide - he might have voted against it. And he said that in general, he voted conservatively on abortion matters. For example, he voted this year in favor of requiring parents to be notified when a minor had an abortion. As for his vote in favor of using Medicaid funds for abortions, Mr. Dearie said that because abortions were legal, the poor were entitled to money to pay for them. ''In the final analysis, it's my feeling that it ain't my decision to make,'' he said. ''If there are females who feel that it is what, under their overall circumstances, they want to do and should do and the law permits them to do, well. . . .''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
O'ROURKE FAULTS CUOMO FOR ATTACKS ON CHURCH BAN AGAINST DISSENTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/09/nyregion/o-rourke-faults-cuomo-for-attacks-on-church-ban-against-dissenters.html,"Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, yesterday criticized Governor Cuomo for taking issue with the policy of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York on dissident speakers, saying, ''If he doesn't want to be a Catholic, he shouldn't be one.'' Mr. O'Rourke - who, as with Mr. Cuomo, is Roman Catholic - accused the Governor of ''picking fights with the church because his polls tell him to do so, to distance himself from the church.'' Mr. O'Rourke made his comments amid a series of interviews with officials who are Roman Catholic and who were asked for their thoughts on the policy. Mr. Cuomo is taking issue with an archdiocese directive that prohibits those who disagree with the church's teachings, particularly on abortion, from speaking at parish-sponsored events. Raising a question of ''restraint of intellectual activity,'' Mr. Cuomo - who says that he is personally against abortion but that, as Governor, he has to adhere to its legality - doubted the directive could be enforced. ''What you have,'' Mr. O'Rourke said, referring to Mr. Cuomo's position on abortion, ''is another attempt by Cuomo to weasel around all the time. He's wearing sackcloth and ashes to Sunday church, then goes off and declares he's pro choice.'' In fact, Mr. O'Rourke's position on abortion is the same as Mr. Cuomo's in that he says he personally opposes it, but that as Governor he would uphold its legality. Asked how he could make such an attack on Mr. Cuomo, Mr. O'Rourke said he was specifically referring to the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, which he opposes and the Governor supports. Asked whether as Governor he would apply the teachings of the church to government policy, Mr. O'Rourke said, ''You don't consult the church on issues.'' In response, a spokesman for the Cuomo campaign, Gary Fryer, said only that ''Mr. O'Rourke's remarks are typically tasteless and typically unworthy of response.'' Among the other officials commenting yesterday was Representative Guy V. Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, who said he had ''no problem'' with the church's policy, a view echoed by State Senator John J. Marchi, another Staten Island Republican. 'A Clever Move' ''My initial reaction,'' Mr. Molinari said, ''was why would the Governor want to get into yet another confrontation with the Catholic church and its hierarchy. But after giving it some thought, I see it as a clever move to distance himself from the Catholic church and set himself up for national office. Distancing himself from the church might help him in other parts of the nation.'' The Representative said that in travels around the country, he had encountered similar policies to the one by the New York Archdiocese. The president of the Board of Education, Robert F. Wagner Jr., said he ''certainly'' thought the ''Cardinal and the Vicar General have the right to set church policy.'' ''But in my view,'' he added, ''the new policy is a mistake. There should be more open dialogue in the church.'' A host of key Catholic officeholders declined to talk on the record about the policy, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, all Democrats. Mr. Moynihan told the story of a parish priest who, with the slip of a pen, once called him a ''practical'' rather than a ''practicing'' Catholic. ''As a practical Catholic,'' the Senator said with a sly grin, ''I have made it my business not to know so much about Catholic doctrine that I know when I am in error.'' A host of current and former officeholders who are Catholics did not return messages yesterday seeking their comments on the issue. They included Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican; former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, a Democrat; Geraldine A. Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic candidate for Vice President, and Representative Mario Biaggi, Democrat of the Bronx. In Brooklyn, a spokesman for the diocese, Frank DeRosa, said no thought had been given to withdrawing an invitation to Governor Cuomo to deliver a major lecture at St. James Cathedral, the seat of the Brooklyn Diocese, on Oct. 2. The diocese is not part of the Archdiocese of New York. Mr. Cuomo will inaugurate the Peter Turner Forum, a lecture series by ''distinguished Catholic laymen'' at the church in the Fort Greene section. His topic is ''Those Who Love the World: Catholics and the Commonweal.'' Neither the Brooklyn Diocese nor the Rockville Centre Diocese on Long Island, which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties, have written policies similar to the one that sparked the debate between Mr. Cuomo and the archdiocese.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CAREY SUPPORTS BAN BY CHURCH AGAINST DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/nyregion/carey-supports-ban-by-church-against-dissent.html,"Saying ''this is not a time to separate from the church,'' former Gov. Hugh L. Carey yesterday expressed support for a directive by the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New York that prohibits those who disagree with church teaching from speaking at parish-supported events. He added, ''There's a clear responsibility of Catholics in public office to find alternatives to abortion.'' The comments came in an interview in which Mr. Carey was asked his reaction to the directive, which Governor Cuomo has criticized. Mr. Carey, along with several other Catholic officeholders and former officeholders, had been telephoned for comment Monday but he did not return the call until yesterday. ''You've got to realize that you're talking about speeches on church premises,'' said Mr. Carey, who picked Mr. Cuomo as his secretary of state and later as lieutenant governor. ''It seems to me it's appropriate for the church to say that speakers should be in accord with our teaching.'' He said the church's efforts were clearly aimed at speakers who do not follow its teachings against abortion, adding, ''The church is becoming more stringent for church people on the issue of abortion and I'm entirely in accord with the church.'' Questions on Death Penalty The archdiocese has argued that Catholic officials should apply the teachings of the church to public policy. But Governor Cuomo, a Roman Catholic, has spoken out against that. He has said that he opposes abortion but that, as Governor, he must uphold the law, which allows it. Mr. Cuomo argues that, if the church is going to ban speakers who do not follow its abortion teachings, it should also ban those who support the death penalty, which is also contrary to the church position. Mr. Carey, without mentioning the Governor, said yesterday that ''to try to draw a comparison between the teaching of the Catholic Church on capital punishment and abortion is out of proportion.'' He said fewer than a thousand executions were carried out each year ''while we're talking about millions of abortions.'' Mr. Carey said he thought the latest Supreme Court ruling on abortion, which upheld a woman's right to have one, was confusing. He noted that Chief Justice Warren E. Burger said the court was going too far in liberalizing abortion laws. ''If I see confusion in the court,'' Mr. Carey said, ''I am right to turn to the church and say, 'Mother Church, what do you say? How do you guide me today?' '' As Governor, Mr. Carey did not oppose the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, and he did not seek a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortions. Asked about that, he said, ''I now find a very different legal tangle.'' Once again, he cited the comments by Chief Justice Burger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIFE IN THE 30'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,"MY favorite news story so far this year was the one saying that in England scientists are working on a way to allow men to have babies. I'd buy tickets to that. I'd be happy to stand next to any man I know in one of those labor rooms the size of a Volkswagen trunk and whisper ''No, dear, you don't really need the Demerol; just relax and do your second-stage breathing.'' It puts me in mind of an old angry feminist slogan: ''If men got pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.'' I think this is specious. If men got pregnant, there would be safe, reliable methods of birth control. They'd be inexpensive, too. I can almost hear some of you out there thinking that I do not like men. This isn't true. I have been married for some years to a man and I hope that someday our two sons will grow up to be men. All three of my brothers are men, as is my father. Some of my best friends are men. It is simply that I think women are superior to men. There, I've said it. This is my dirty little secret. We're not supposed to say it because in the old days, men used to say that women were superior. What they meant was that we were too wonderful to enter courtrooms, enjoy sex or worry our minds about money. Obviously, this is not what I mean at all. The other day a very wise friend of mine asked: ''Have you ever noticed that what passes as a terrific man would only be an adequate woman?'' A Roman candle went off in my head; she was absolutely right. What I expect from my male friends is that they are polite and clean. What I expect from my female friends is unconditional love, the ability to finish my sentences for me when I am sobbing, a complete and total willingness to pour their hearts out to me as well as the ability to tell me why the meat thermometer isn't supposed to touch the bone. The inherent superiority of women came to mind just the other day when I was reading about sanitation workers. New York City has finally hired women to pick up the garbage, which makes sense to me, since, as I've discovered, a good bit of being a woman consists of picking up garbage. There was a story about the hiring of these female sanitation workers, and I was struck by the fact that I could have written that story without ever leaving my living room - a reflection not upon the quality of the reporting but the predictability of the male sanitation workers' responses. The story started by describing the event, and then the two women, who were just your average working women trying to make a buck and get by. There was something about all the maneuvering that had to take place before they could be hired, and then there were the obligatory quotes from male sanitation workers about how women were incapable of doing the job. They were similiar to quotes I have read over the years suggesting that women are not fit to be rabbis, combat soldiers, astronauts, firefighters, judges, ironworkers and President of the United States. Chief among them was a comment from one sanitation worker who said that it just wasn't our kind of job, that women were cut out to do dishes and men were cut out to do yard work. As a woman who has done dishes, yard work and tossed a fair number of Hefty bags, I was peeved -more so because I would fight for the right of any laid-off sanitation man to work, for example, at the gift-wrap counter at Macy's, even though any woman knows that men are hormonally incapable of wrapping packages or tying bows. I simply can't think of any jobs any more that women can't do. Come to think of it, I can't think of any job women don't do. I know lots of men who are full-time lawyers, doctors, editors and the like. And I know lots of women who are full-time lawyers and part-time interior decorators, pastry chefs, algebra teachers and garbage slingers. Women are the glue that holds our day-to-day world together. Maybe the sanitation workers who talk about the sex division of duties are talking about girls just like the girls that married dear old dad. Their day is done. Now lots of women know that if they don't carry the garbage bag to the curb, it's not going to get carried out either because they're single, or their husband is working a second job, or he's staying at the office until midnight, or he just left them. I keep hearing that there's a new breed of men out there who don't talk about helping a woman as though they're doing you a favor and who do seriously consider leaving the office if a child comes down with a fever at school, rather than assuming that you will leave yours. But from what I've seen there aren't enough of these men to qualify as a breed, only as a subgroup. This all sounds angry; it is. After a lifetime spent with winds of sexual change buffeting me this way and that, it still makes me angry to read the same dumb quotes with the same dumb stereotypes that I was reading when I was 18. It makes me angry to realize that after so much change, very little is different. It makes me angry to think that these two female sanitation workers will spend their days doing a job most of their co-workers think they can't handle, and then they will go home and do another job most of their co-workers don't want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SENATE VOTES AIDS DRUG FUND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/us/senate-votes-aids-drug-fund.html,"The Senate agreed today to give the National Cancer Institute an extra $40 million to $50 million to provide the experimental drug AZT to 10,000 people dying of AIDS. The funds will be shifted from a $1.9 billion program that helps the poor pay heating bills. Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., Republican of Connecticut, won approval of the amendment to a bill providing $113 billion for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education for fiscal 1987. The Senate then voted 83 to 2 to approve the measure. The House has approved similar legislation, and the two versions now will go to a conference committee. Senator Weicker said the drug was not a cure, but it could provide an extra six months of life for those afflicted with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A fight over the abortion issue that could have delayed action on the measure was averted. The Senate dropped an amendment that would have allowed Medicaid to finance abortions for victims of rape and incest. Senator Weicker said the cancer institute currently has only enough money to provide AZT to 1,000 of the 10,000 people in the terminal stage of the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MAN IN THE NEWS: MARK JOSEPH GREEN; COMBATIVE UNDERDOG AND ORATOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/nyregion/man-in-the-news-mark-joseph-green-combative-underdog-and-orator.html,"On the morning after the Democratic primary election for United States Senator, Mark Green stood at an IRT subway stop on East 86th Street yesterday, shaking hands and just plain basking in the victory of what he calls his underfinanced ''march of dimes'' campaign. But already he was looking toward November, when voters will choose among him; Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican incumbent, and John S. Dyson, the Liberal Party candidate. And his performance yesterday was typical Green - on the one hand, the underdog, seeking voter sympathy by belittling his finances in comparison to those of his opponents; on the other hand, the combatant, pulling no verbal punches. ''I'm not worried about a general election this fall, where I'll be outspent two to one,'' he declared. ''I don't need $5 million or $10 million. I need enough to expose D'Amato's record of votes against New York.'' The race will offer voters a clear ideological choice: Senator D'Amato on the right, Mr. Green on the left. And by the end, the sparks are sure to be flying. In fact, they are already flying. ''You know how he claims to fill the potholes?'' Mr. Green said of Senator D'Amato's budget votes. ''What he doesn't tell you is that he's the bomber who that morning created them by supporting cuts in Federal funds.'' 'Issue of the Week' That style that has not always served him well. Mr. Green is not particularly favored by some prominent Democratic political leaders -Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch supported his opponent, Mr. Dyson, in the primary - in part because of his combativeness, in part because they feel he tends to lecture them. Mr. Green said yesterday that his ''issue of the week'' was William Rehnquist, and he called on Senator D'Amato to vote against his confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States, citing what he said was the justice's ''insensitivity to racial and religious bigotry.'' Among other issues, the candidate supports a ban on nuclear testing, favors a woman's right to abortion, calls for stronger handgun laws. In fact, he said, he worries at times about being pigeonholed as an old-fashioned liberal. But he added that he was ''trying hard to blend my positions with fresh, new solutions,'' approaches that are both ''tough-minded and kind-hearted.'' Mark Joseph Green was born in Brooklyn on March 15, 1945, eventually becoming a lawyer, the same profession as his father. He attended Cornell University, graduating in 1967, then went on to Harvard Law School, where he was editor in chief of the Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, an alternative publication to the more Establishment-oriented Harvard Law Review. Immediately after graduation in 1970, Mr. Green became active in the field with which his name is most associated - consumer rights. He went to Washington to become an aide to Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, and served for 10 years as director of Nader's consumer-lobbying group, Congress Watch, which helps to shape legislation. Emerging as a leader in the efforts to deregulate the airline industry and to create a Federal superfund to clean up toxic wastes, he also took time out to write 10 books, including ''Who Runs Congress?'' By 1980, Mr. Green wanted to move from the sidelines of politics into elective office. He ran for Congress in the East Side's ''silk stocking'' district, but he lost to Bill Green. In 1984, he returned to politics once again, serving as chief speech writer to Senator Gary Hart in his race for the Presidency. With Mr. Hart's defeat, he took up duties as president of the Democracy Project, a small liberal public-policy institute based in New York. Of medium build, his boyish face framed by gray-brown hair, Mr. Green lives on East 90th Street with his wife, Deni Frand, and their two children, Jonah and Jenya. According to his athletic opponents, his tennis game is as competitive as his campaign style, which is to say very competitive. ''There are still some doubters and pundits who will say, 'You can't win, Green. D'Amato has too much money,' '' he said yesterday. ''Where have we heard that before?'' Mr. Green's opponent in the Democratic primary - Mr. Dyson, a multimillionaire - spent $6 million in the primary, compared with Mr. Green's $800,000. And yesterday, basking in victory, Mr. Green was quick to find the lesson in all that: ''Message beat money.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO AND THE CHURCH: SOME VEXING QUESTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/nyregion/cuomo-and-the-church-some-vexing-questions.html,"It is accepted political wisdom that there is little advantage for a public official to get into a fight with the church, particularly the Archdiocese of New York. It is not surprising then that Governor Cuomo has found preciously few allies among fellow Roman Catholic politicians in his confrontation with the archdiocese over a new church policy on parish speakers. The vexing question is why the Governor engaged the archdiocese in the debate. The church's policy on speakers was initially not directed at him, so why did he challenge it? And why did the archdiocese respond to his criticism in such an angry manner? It is probably easier to understand the position of the archdiocese than what is behind the Governor's thinking. Under the leadership of Pope John Paul II, the church - from the Vatican to the local parish -has made putting an end to abortion its No. 1 priority. As Auxiliary Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe of the New York Archdiocese sees it, Mr. Cuomo's nuanced view on abortion would tend to confuse the faithful rather than help clarify the issue for them. Governor Cuomo is against abortion. Personally, as a Catholic, he regards it, as does his church, as murder. But, he argues that in a pluralistic society, it is wrong to try to impose Catholic teaching on others. As a result, the Governor supports the 1973 Supreme Court decision that granted women the right to abortion. He also supports the New York State legislation that provides Medicaid funds for abortion on the ground that the right must be available equitably to both the rich and the poor. Those who know Mr. Cuomo as a Catholic say his position is not one of political convenience but a well-thought-out theological stand arrived at after much soul-searching. ''The Governor is as serious about his Catholic faith as any Catholic politician I know,'' said the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, head of the theology department at the University of Notre Dame. It is for this reason, he suggested, that the Governor criticized the archdiocese on the issue of outside speakers. ''He finds it hard to pass over because he has a real stake in his church,'' he said. The directive that is at the center of the controversy was sent last month by Bishop O'Keefe to all 410 parishes in the archdiocese. It warned pastors not to invite as speakers those ''whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear, unambiguous teaching of the church.'' 'A Right to Be Heard' Governor Cuomo immediately criticized the policy, saying that it could lead to ''restraint of intellectual activity.'' He declared, ''We lay people have a right to be heard.'' A different explanation for the Governor's position came from Bishop O'Keefe, who is second in command to John Cardinal O'Connor. Mr. Cuomo, who has been frequently mentioned as a contender for the White House, ''might be distancing himself from the official teaching of the church'' out of fear that ''his Catholicism will be an issue,'' the bishop said in an interview. But Peter Steinfels, editor of Commonweal, an independent journal published by Catholic laity, asserted that there was little political advantage for anyone in the dispute. ''Everybody is going to be a loser,'' he said. ''The church is going to lose because there is a growing antagonism between it and educated Catholics. And from Cuomo's point of view, while there might be some gains in the short run, in the long run it gives him an aura of being at odds with one's own church, which is not politically reassuring.'' What is interesting about the debate is that the substance of Mr. Cuomo's position is not at all unusual. Virtually every Catholic politician has the same position - they are opposed to abortion, but they uphold the law. But many of them - including former Gov. Hugh L. Carey and Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate for governor -have distanced themselves from Governor Cuomo. Others, including New York's two Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato, have been silent on the issue. A Theological Framework What is unusual about Mr. Cuomo's position - and what irks church officials - is that he has articulated it in a theological framework. ''What the archdiocese is really saying is, 'Cuomo, we don't want you to talk about the church with any authority,' '' said Eugene Kennedy, a writer who follows Catholic affairs, ''What Cuomo is saying is, 'I am an adult Catholic and I have the right to reflect on theology. I was taught to do that.' '' Mr. Cuomo learned those lessons, Mr. Kennedy added, from a Catholic education that included a parochial high school and St. John's University, as well as from later being a student of the Second Vatican Council. The council, which 20 years ago greatly liberalized the Catholic Church, expanded the idea of the church from a heirarchy of bishops to a community of bishops, priests and lay people. It is this perception of the church that Mr. Cuomo emphasizes in thinking through his position on abortion. ''We are the church, all of us together,'' he said in a recent interview. It is unfair, he continued, to make abortion the one and only test of Catholic orthodoxy. He noted, for example, that the Pope and the United States bishops have spoken out time and again against capital punishment. Yet, those who favor the death penalty are not treated like pariahs. Not Comparable Issues It on this point that Bishop O'Keefe, in a separate interview, expressed anger, accusing the Governor of confusing the issues of capital punishment and abortion. They are not comparable, he maintained. Opposition to abortion has a special place in Catholic teaching. Abortion is one of the few sins for which a Roman Catholic is automatically excommunicated; even murder does not carry this penalty. If the problem then is with Mr. Cuomo's theological integrity, the attack on him follows logically on the heels of recent Vatican actions taken against church officials who, in the opinion of the Vatican, have strayed. Among these have been the Rev. Charles E. Curran, who was told by the Vatican that he could no longer teach theology at Catholic University in Washington, and Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle, whose powers as archbishop were significantly curtailed by the Vatican. Both are liberals whose views on sexual matters, particularly abortion, came under fire. Father McBrien of Notre Dame added another factor to explain why the New York Archdiocese responded sharply to Mr. Cuomo, although Father McBrien's reasoning was quickly attacked by the spokesman for the archdiocese, Msgr. Peter G. Finn, who labeled it ''nonsense.'' ''People have a right to ask why it is Cuomo and not someone with an Irish name,'' said Father McBrien, who says that because his father is Irish and his mother is Italian, he is an impartial observer of the long-time ethnic tensions between the two groups. ''Why,'' he said, ''are the searchlights on Governor Cuomo, who happens to be Italian, and were never put on Governor Carey, who not only had the same agenda but married outside the church?''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LETTERS ON BAN BY PARISH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/nyregion/letters-on-ban-by-parish.html,"Assemblyman John C. Dearie, a Bronx Democrat, said yesterday that he had received 610 letters and telephone calls in response to his being banned by his Roman Catholic parish, St. Raymond's, from speaking at parish functions because he voted to allow Medicaid funds to be used for abortions. Here is a sampling from some of the letters: 1986 or 1686? Have politician hunts replaced witch hunts? What's next at the stake? - From a woman in Westchester. If the church is looking to increase its support, why has it adopted such a polarizing and alienating policy? - From a man on Staten Island. Is Cardinal O'Connor wrong because he wishes to keep his parishes free from the Dearies of the world? The Bronx Assemblyman should be forbidden at any religious function until he reconsiders his views on Medicaid funding for abortion. If a child of mine was to seek an abortion, the first thing I would give her is a one-way bus ticket to Sodom. - From a woman in Manhattan. Cardinal O'Connor vs. Assemblyman Dearie: My spiritual leader will always get my vote. God bless you, Cardinal O'Connor. I'll pray for you, John. - From a man in Westchester. If we allow the church to lobby the government on a slew of different social issues and yet disallow those same government representatives with mildly dissenting views to address a church-related function on those same social issues, then we have reached a very dangerous state censorhip and persecution by the church. Under such circumstances, how far is the church from trying Dearie under canon law? - From a man in the Bronx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CARDINAL ASSAILS CRITICS ON LIMITS FOR SPEAKERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/nyregion/cardinal-assails-critics-on-limits-for-speakers.html,"John Cardinal O'Connor, asking ''how much further are the nonsensical allegations going to go on,'' yesterday condemned critics of an archiocesan policy that probibits those who disagree with church teachings from speaking at parish-sponsored events. Criticizing ''those who are making an indoor sport out of attacks on the Pope and the church,'' the Cardinal, in a statement, added that ''a great number'' of opponents of the guidelines ''know very little about the church and have never lifted a finger to support the church.'' The Cardinal has also written to Assemblyman John C. Dearie, Democrat of the Bronx, calling ''deeply insulting'' his comments that the church was trying to influence the outcome of this year's election by barring speakers. ''I really don't have the stomach to take on here and now what I see as a gross exploitation of the church's acting within her province,'' the Cardinal said in his broader statement, his first extensive and written comments on the matter. Column in Church Newspaper He did not cite any critic by name. But his comments, published yesterday in his weekly column in the archdiocesan newspaper, Catholic New York, came after a week in which several Catholic officeholders - in particular, Governor Cuomo - took issue with the guidelines. They were promulgated last month by the Vicar General of the archdiocese, Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe. Asked for comment, the Governor issued a brief statement last night: ''The Cardinal has allowed me to speak at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He has not sought to stifle me and has made clear Bishop O'Keefe's guideline is not intended to either. I am grateful.'' The guidelines leave it to individual parish pastors to decide who should be invited to speak at an event. But they make clear that it is ''unacceptable'' to invite someone who differs with church teaching, and archdiocese officials said they were especially aimed at opponents of the church's positions on abortion. In an unusually long and strongly worded column, the Cardinal wrote: ''What is all the furor about? What is the nonsense I read about squelching 'free speech?' Where is the deep, dark sinister political motivation that some choose to see? When did common sense, or a sense of appropriateness, become unconstitutional or un-American? ''Where are those who demand 'free speech' in our Catholic schools when it comes to paying for those schools? In my experience, some of the strongest proponents of what they consider to be free speech are the strongest opponents of any kind of tax breaks or governmental support for parents who choose their own version of 'free speech' when they pay to send their children to Catholic schools.'' At another point, the Cardinal wrote: ''Would the self-appointed champions of free speech care to sue those TV networks that refused to run paid commercials for our archdiocesan 'Come Home at Christmas' and 'Come Home at Easter' campaigns?'' In defending the guidelines on speakers, he asked: ''Are we to have a church in which everyone's judgment is equal to everyone else's? That's not a church; it's chaos.'' Saying that it would send a confusing signal to Catholics to allow dissident speakers at parish events, the Cardinal added, ''Common sense dictates that you keep the fox out of the chicken coop.'' He asserted that the policy of the archdiocese did not prevent Catholics from being exposed to dissenting views because such views were routinely made available through television and other media. Letter to Dearie In another development yesterday, it was learned that the Cardinal had written to Assemblyman Dearie, who has been banned from speaking at his Bronx parish, St. Raymond's, because he voted to allow Medicaid funds to be used for abortions. Mr. Dearie said earlier this week that he had been banned at the direction of the Cardinal, and he accused the archdiocese of cracking down on speakers in an effort to influence the outcome of this year's elections. In a terse three-paragraph letter dated Sept. 9, a copy of which was obtained yesterday by The New York Times, the Cardinal wrote to Mr. Dearie that his statement ''is grossly untrue, deeply insulting and morally libelous.'' Msgr. Henry J. Vier, the pastor of St. Raymond's, said earlier this week that he had been asked by the Rev. Christopher Maloney, an aide to the Cardinal, to issue the ban on Mr. Dearie. At the time, the Cardinal responded through a spokesman that he was ''sorry'' if ''an overzealous aide'' had ordered Mr. Dearie banned from speaking at parish events. But the letter contained no similar indication of contrition. The Cardinal said only that it was ''categorically untrue'' that he personally had ordered the ban. The 46-year-old Mr. Dearie, who has been an active member of St. Raymond's parish virtually all his life, said that in the past week his office received 610 letters and phone calls, 85 percent of them favorable to him, expressing ''outrage and shock'' at the ban. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo said: ''I feel sorry about John Dearie - it's a touching, touching story.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tax Bill Doesn't Get an A From Universities; Charitable Deductions,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/opinion/l-tax-bill-doesn-t-get-an-a-from-universities-charitable-deductions-558886.html,"To the Editor: Your Aug. 24 editorial on the tax-reform bill refers to a ''round of agonized second thoughts'' based on the serious ''headaches'' the law would create for colleges, cultural institutions and other charities, local gov-ernments seeking to build moderate-income housing and attract industry, and the construction and capital goods industries. Yet you defend these results as a tradeoff for lower tax rates and as a repudiation of the ''tax expenditure'' or ''tax break'' or ''indirect subsidy'' avenue to governmental assistance. ''Tax expenditures,'' you state, are ''inefficient,'' allow ''individuals command over public resources'' and ''erode the idea of open government.'' Whatever the merits of this as a general proposition, it cannot apply, and you should not have applied it, to the charitable contributions deduction for the following reasons. First, you uncritically adopt the premise that the charitable deduction is a ''tax expenditure'' or subsidy - a premise far from universally accepted. Two leading income tax scholars and theorists (William D. Andrews of Harvard and Boris I. Bittker of Yale) have explained the charitable deduction not as a subsidy but as an inherent feature of any income-tax system that seeks an accurate definition of taxable income, a feature analogous to the business expense deduction. Second, the ''inefficiency'' charge does not apply to the charitable deduction. A number of independent econometric studies, conducted by Martin Feldstein and others, have produced highly consistent results, demonstrating that the deduction is efficient: for each dollar of Government revenue loss, charities gain $1.10 to $1.40 in additional gifts. Third, your criticism of ''individual command over public resources'' not only assumes that charitable deductibility is a subsidy - hence an expenditure of ''public resources'' -but also misses a crucial policy point: The special genius of private philanthropy, and the charitable deduction system that fuels it in the United States, is indeed ''individual command'' - the decentralization of decision-making into millions of private hands. This process promotes heterodoxy, personal autonomy and initiative, and other pluralist values that you usually honor. Finally, your insistence that universities (and, presumably, other charities) receive ''open and direct'' government support through appropriations has a nice ring to it, but is hardly the way to preserve an independent voluntary sector. Do we really want Congress to replace individual donors in deciding what colleges or museums to support - which abortion groups (pro-life or pro-choice), which environmental groups (pro-wilderness or pro-development)? The charitable deduction system protects idiosyncratic and controversial associations - minorities in the broad sense of the word - from majoritarian coercion. It is therefore a sophisticated instrument of democratic freedom that ought not to be a casualty of the crusade against ''tax expenditures.'' JOHN G.

Who May Speak to Catholics,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/13/opinion/who-may-speak-to-catholics.html,"Once again, New York's Governor Cuomo and John Cardinal O'Connor are locked in dubious battle. Ostensibly it concerns a directive that the parishes of the New York Archdiocese not invite speakers who disagree with church teachings. Actually, it is a renewal of their argument about how fervently Catholics in public office must oppose abortion. The directive, issued last month by Vicar General Bishop Joseph O'Keefe, advises pastors that it is ''unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy'' to give a church forum to someone ''whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear, unambiguous teaching of the Church.'' Bishop O'Keefe says he wasn't thinking of Mr. Cuomo, who accepts the church's teaching on abortion for himself but feels bound as Governor to defend the legal right of women to choose abortion. Mr. Cuomo felt himself a target nonetheless. Many Catholic politicians have similarly distinguished their ''personal'' acceptance of church teaching on abortion from their ''public'' obligation to respect and defend the rights of Americans to decide on abortion for themselves. The Cardinal may believe that this distinction trivializes religious belief, turning into a merely advisory opinion what should be a strongly felt imperative to guide action. Mr. Cuomo has been particularly vocal in addressing this dilemma of Catholic politicians. How can they swear to uphold the law and the rights of others when, as with abortion, those rights contradict Catholic teaching? In his jousts with the Cardinal he asks, in effect: Does the Cardinal know a better way to bridge this dilemma than by distinguishing between personal conviction and official duty? The archdiocese has every right to invite the speakers it wants. Mr. Cuomo's protest that lay Catholics have a ''right to be heard'' in church forums is a question for canon, not civil, law. The Cardinal also has every democratic right to try to influence politicians politically. But that invites a democratic, and negative, effect. Voters may well reject Catholic candidates rather than risk electing someone who puts religious conviction ahead of political tolerance. And some Catholic politicians may rebel in resentment. The first to be sanctioned under the directive seems to be John Dearie, a Democratic Assemblyman from the Bronx. He says he was told by the pastor of the parish he has belonged to all his life that he could no longer speak at parish events. The reason: he has voted to permit the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions. ''I'm a very close vote on this,'' Mr. Dearie says. He personally opposes abortion and finds it difficult to disagree with church leaders he respects. ''And then for them to slam the door, put up the wall . . . it's so counterproductive, totally counterproductive.'' Whether it is counterproductive for the church is for the church to decide. Whether it is wise politics the voters will decide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RABBIS INVITE BISHOP TO ADDRESS CONGREGATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/13/nyregion/rabbis-invite-bishop-to-address-congregation.html,"Three Orthodox rabbis, praising Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe for his criticism of Governor Cuomo's stand on abortion, invited the bishop yesterday to speak before an Orthodox congregation on the subject of ''family values,'' including abortion. The unusual invitation - and the Bishop's acceptance - came at a news conference at the Catholic Center, at 1011 First Avenue at 55th Street, after the rabbis met privately with John Cardinal O'Connor. The delegation was led by Rabbi Yehuda Levin, who ran for mayor last year on the Right to Life ticket. An official of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, which represents 1,200 synagogues across the country, said that the three rabbis ''do not speak for the Orthodox community'' but for a small Brooklyn congregation ''that is quite activist on this question.'' Sympathy for Cuomo's Stand The official, Rabbi Pinchas Stolper, said that most Orthodox Jews were closer to Governor Cuomo's position than to that of the Archdiocese. The Governor has drawn a distinction between his personal belief as a Catholic against abortion and his responsibility as Governor to equitably enforce the law that permits abortion. ''We are not necessarily committed to imposing our views on American society,'' Rabbi Stolper said. ''We do not feel obligated to impose our view on abortion on others, any more than we demand non-Jews to observe the Sabbath.'' Rabbi Stolper said he did not oppose inviting a Roman Catholic leader to speak in a synagogue, although such an invitation is unusual. As a rule, the Orthodox do not engage in theological dialogue with Christians, although they do meet on political and social issues. Moreover, it is rare for any Christian clergyman to be invited to address an Orthodox congregation. Governor Criticized The three rabbis at the news conference used the opportunity to attack Mr. Cuomo for his support for Medicaid funding of abortions. Last week, Bishop O'Keefe, who as Vicar General of the Archdiocese is second in command to the Cardinal, criticized the Governor for ''confusing people on abortion.'' The Bishop also said that he would not allow the Governor to speak to a group of young people at his parish, St. John the Evangelist, which is part of the Catholic Center. The Bishop expanded his ban yesterday, saying the Governor would not be allowed to speak to anyone in his church because the Governor was operating outside church teaching. The rabbis who joined Rabbi Levin were Rabbi William Handler, who said he was from a Brooklyn-based organization called Jews for Morality, and Rabbi Yoseph Friedman, who said he represented Congregation Bais Yisroel in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. All three responded ''no'' when asked if Governor Cuomo would be welcome to address their congregation. The rabbis said they hoped Bishop O'Keefe would speak at Congregation Bais Yisroel - a synagogue in the ground floor of a private home at 1821 Ocean Parkway - between now and Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year, which this year is on Oct. 4 and 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS & TRENDS; O'Connor Defends Order on Speakers,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-o-connor-defends-order-on-speakers.html,"The debate between Governor Cuomo and the Archdiocese of New York continued last week as John Cardinal O'Connor supported an order barring from parish events speakers who disagree with Catholic teachings. Shielding parishioners from those who verbally ''attack the church'' is ''common sense,'' Cardinal O'Connor said. ''People get confused when someone who's well known for disagreeing with the church. . . is given a platform.'' Earlier this summer, Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe directed parish priests to ban speakers who oppose the ''clear, unambiguous teaching of the church.'' Mr. Cuomo, a Catholic, referred to the order as a ''restraint of intellectual activity.'' While the Governor personally supports Catholic opposition to abortion, he believes he must uphold laws on such matters. The Archdiocesan order came at a time when the church is brooking little dissent. Recently the Vatican told the Rev. Charles E. Curran to stop teaching theology at Catholic University in Washington and curtailed the powers of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle. Both men hold liberal views on abortion. In New York, Assemblyman John C. Dearie, whose position on abortion is similar to Mr. Cuomo's, said last week that his priest had told him he would no longer be allowed to address his own parish in the Bronx. Meanwhile, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, accused the Governor of ''picking fights with the church because his polls tell him to do so.'' Bishop O'Keefe has accused Mr. Cuomo of distancing himself from the church in case he decides to run for President. But the Governor argues that in a pluralistic society, it is wrong to try to impose Catholic teaching on others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NEW JERSEY OPINION;
CLEAR DRUG-TESTING POLICY IS NEEDED",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-clear-drugtesting-policy-is-needed.html,"UNDER what conditions, if any, should your employer be permitted to test you for drug abuse? Sooner or later, most of us in New Jersey will directly confront this question. In the last two years, the sale of drug-testing equipment and technical support has increased dramatically in our state. Some of our largest private and public employers have already begun drug-testing programs for their employees and experts say the number of employers will continue to increase in the next few years. This proliferation is occurring without any uniform statewide policy and without any real protections for employers or employees. Our state courts have reached inconsistent conclusions about the constitutionality of certain types of employee drug testing; our statutes provide no guidance to employers about their rights or obligations when they test employees; our departmental regulations offer no standards of accuracy or fairness for employee drug tests. Not surprisingly, there is a great deal of confusion about who can test and how tests can be conducted. Mayors, department heads, store owners and plant managers want to know if they can require drug tests of their workers and on what basis. We need a policy to end this uncertainty and provide equal treatment for all workers. The realities of the drug-testing issue were vividly illustrated last month by two distant but related events. In southern New Jersey, local law enforcement officials broke a drug-trafficking ring that allegedly involved workers and contractors at a chemical plant. The bust resulted partly from information provided by the employer, who was concerned about the possibility of drug use at the plant. At the same time, a Federal district judge ordered the city of Plainfield to reinstate public employees who had been released following a surprise drug test last May. The judge declared that ''no matter how important the war against crime and drugs, constitutional rights must not be sacrificed to win those battles.'' These two incidents illustrate the paradox of drug testing. On the one hand, employee drug tests could significantly reduce drug problems in our workforce. Through testing, we could curb the flow of illegal drugs in our state, limit the damage of drug abuse to our economy, protect the safety of the public and begin rehabilitating people who need help. On the other hand, employee drug tests could violate our basic notions of individual rights and fairness. On any basis, they will not mesh easily with our deeply held convictions about personal privacy and community trust. Testing that treats people unfairly will also create more problems than it solves. In drug testing, then, we face both an opportunity and a threat. How, then, can we strike the right balance between the need to stop drug abuse and the need to protect individual rights? The first step is recognition of the problems we face. One problem posed by the drug test itself is the possibility of ''false positives,'' when innocent individuals are falsely accused of illegal drug abuse because of shortcomings in the test procedure. False positives are more than an inconvenience; they jeopardize the careers and reputations of workers and lead to lawsuits against employers. Both management and labor will lose if tests and labs continue to develop an unacceptable number of erroneous test results. Thus, standards should be set to prevent inaccurate tests from being used. Another problem is that drug testing can disrupt employer-employee relations. Testing, particularly when done with unreliable methods or in an unfair way, creates tensions between labor and management. Many employers are determined to impose random and routine testing on employees, while many workers are willing to bring production or service to a halt over testing on that basis. All of us will be hurt if such confrontations occur too frequently. A basis for fair testing, therefore, should be defined as soon as possible. Finally, there is the problem of drug abuse in the workplace. Drug abuse by employees can no longer be ignored. It reduces efficiency and productivity, lessens the quality of goods and services and increases risks to the public posed by unsafe operating procedures and poor workmanship. ''Crack'' and other especially dangerous drugs are ruining individual lives and the lives of families. Fortunately, the public recognizes the complexity of these problems and the need for action. Most of us perceive that drug abuse in the workplace endangers our businesses, our neighborhoods, our schools and our roadways. Most of us do not want a universal ban on testing. Yet many of us also recognize the need to protect individuals from the misuse of tests. We do not want to see drug tests used as weapons against workers. We are not prepared to give employers, public or private, an unrestricted license to test. There appears to be a consensus that will support a policy that allows accurate, fair, and effective testing when testing is genuinely needed. This month, the Legislature began considering legislation that attempts to meet these criteria. Asssembly Bill 2850, which we sponsor jointly, would authorize statewide drug testing standards and define the conditions under which tests may be conducted. Under this legislation, the Department of Labor could regulate tests within the public and private sectors by setting standards for the acquisition of samples, the handling of samples, the methodology of the test, the margins of error associated with the test and the type of personnel conducting the tests. It would also permit random or routine tests on job applicants but would limit tests for employees to cases where the employer had reasonable suspicion of drug use. Finally, it would allow the collective bargaining process to set higher standards for testing or to prohibit testing altogether for employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. This legislation would give New Jersey the basic outline of a policy that could be further developed by experts in the executive branch, in business and in labor. And by bringing the key questions of the issue before the Legislature now, the courts will be given legislative guidance about drug-testing in New Jersey's workplace. Without a uniform statewide policy, employers and employees will continue to be confused about their rights and responsibilities. Without a legislative statement, the courts will continue to reach inconsistent, if not contradictory, decisions about the use of employee drug tests. Enactment of A-2850 would not, of course, resolve every dispute about drug testing. Once the executive branch and the courts began imposing a uniform policy in the workplace, the losers in the early battles would bring their appeals to higher courts and the Legislature, just as they have on such other issues as abortion, busing, school prayer and housing. Nevertheless, it is no longer too early for the Legislature to address this issue. In conjunction with officials in the executive and judicial branches and representatives of business and labor, our elected officials can make a choice about what kind of policy is needed to make New Jersey a better place in which to work and live.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MURDER ON LONG ISLAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/magazine/murder-on-long-island.html,"THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE Cheryl Pierson and those who do not; those who contend she is a helpless victim and those who say she belongs in jail. Less than a year ago, Cheryl was a popular cheerleader at Newfield High School in Selden, L.I. She was studying to become a beautician. Today, at 17, a demure brunette, she is out on bail awaiting trial for murder - charged with having hired someone to kill her father, James Pierson, because, she says, he sexually abused her. Though reported instances of the abuse of children by their parents have risen in this decade, for many in our society incest remains the unspeakable, often inarticulable taboo. The Pierson case juxtaposes Cheryl's word against the silence of her father, and Cheryl's allegation has polarized the townspeople of Selden, as well as what remains of her small family. ''Of course I believe her,'' says James Pierson Jr., Cheryl's 20-year-old brother. ''How could she make something like that up?'' ''Nobody can tell me that my son did this to his daughter,'' says Virginia Pierson, Cheryl's grandmother. ''Nobody. If Mother Mary came and told me he did this, I'd say, 'Mother Mary, I can't believe you.' '' When Cheryl's case goes to court tomorrow in Riverhead, it is expected to provide an important test of what constitutes grounds for justifiable homicide. Paul Gianelli, Cheryl's attorney, will argue that because Cheryl was a victim of incest and rape, her plot to have her father killed was an act of self-defense. The success of his argument will hinge on the jury's accepting that Cheryl's emotional stress prevented her from seeing any other way out, an approach to the legal theory of self-defense that feminists have lobbied for successfully in recent years, but that in July was called into question by a decision in New York's highest court. ''People ask me why I didn't ask for help,'' says Cheryl. ''I didn't because no one would have believed me. And even if they had, what could they have done?'' ''My brother does not belong in the ground,'' says Marilyn Adams, Cheryl's aunt, who would like to see her niece in jail. ''She could have told someone. Who does she think she is . . . God?'' THE MORNING OF LAST FEB. 5 WAS ICY IN Selden, a middle-class town in central Long Island, 50 miles from New York. Shortly after 6 A.M., James Pierson, a burly, 42-year-old electrician, put on his jeans and red-and-black hunting jacket and walked down the hall of his wood-shingled home. His daughter, Cheryl, had been late to school the day before, so he checked to make sure she was awake. His other daughter, JoAnn, 8, was still asleep. He opened the door off the kitchen, the way he always did before work. Apparently, no one heard the shots, but seconds later on this quiet stretch of modest, single-family homes with frost-covered swing sets and above-ground pools, Mr. Pierson lay dead. A week later, Sean Pica, who sat next to Cheryl in their high school homeroom because their last names both begin with P, was arrested for murder. Police say Sean, now 17, the son of a former New York City policeman, agreed to kill Cheryl's father for a fee, after the teen-agers became intrigued with a newspaper article about a woman who had hired someone to kill her husband. According to police, Sean hid behind a tree and shot James Pierson five times with a .22-caliber rifle he had bought in Queens. Cheryl never told Sean why she wanted him to kill her father. Police say she had never told them, her family, her friends, her neighbors or anyone else who might have helped. The only person in whom she had confided was her boyfriend, Robert Cuccio, an 18-year-old college freshman. He, too, is the son of a former New York City policeman. At Cheryl's request, police say, Rob paid Sean $400. Last month, in a three-hour interview conducted around the kitchen table in the home of a neighbor with whom she currently lives, Cheryl spoke about her relationship with her father and the events leading to the murder. Dressed in a white cotton jumpsuit, she alternately wept, looked down at the table and laughed nervously as she spoke. Sean, who along with Cheryl, faces a second-degree murder charge, was interviewed as well; however, at his lawyer's request, he did not answer questions about his alleged involvement in the crime. Previously published reports of Sean's confession to detectives parallel the account given by Cheryl, but Martin I. Efman, Sean's attorney, will seek to have the confession suppressed on the grounds that it was coerced. At trial, Mr. Efman says, he will contend that Sean is innocent and that there is no direct evidence linking Sean to the killing. The murder weapon has never been found. Rob's parents, Tina and Robert Cuccio, did not permit their son to be questioned. While Rob has not been officially indicted, he has retained an attorney, George Hughes, and a charge of conspiracy to commit murder is pending against him. Cheryl's sister, JoAnn, now 9, who currently lives with her aunt and grandmother, also was not permitted to be interviewed. JAMES PIERSON HAD lived in Selden since he was a teen-ager. He graduated from Newfield High School in 1962 and three years later married Cathleen Adams, a petite brunette from the neighboring town of Northport. He was a union electrician and had a side business installing cable television boxes in private homes. He had a knack for making money, according to many of those who knew him, and providing for his family seemed the focus of his entire life. James and Cathleen Pierson lived in a well-kept, comfortable home, and eventually had three children, James Jr., who is three years older than Cheryl, who is eight years older than JoAnn. Mr. Pierson was a strict disciplinarian. His children were trained at an early age to be silent when adults walked into the room, to help with housework and always to say ''thank you.'' He never beat his children, according to those interviewed, but if he disliked the way they spoke, or worse, what they said, he would threaten to smack them across the face. When they obeyed him, he rewarded them with gifts. That he was a gruff, foul-mouthed man with an aggressive, macho style no one would dispute; nor that he was also generous and loyal. ''He was the kind of man whose bark was worse than his bite,'' says Arthur Giove, who owns the funeral home in Selden and knew Mr. Pierson well. ''He would raise his voice and the next minute he had his arm around you.'' To the outside world, there was little to distinguish the Piersons from many other blue-collar families. Mr. Pierson coached the local Little League, where his son played. He and his wife went bowling Thursday nights at the lanes in Centereach. His children rode dirt bikes around the neighborhood. They ate dinners at home and argued about whether to watch sports or soap operas on television. Then, in 1979, Cathleen Pierson was diagnosed as having a rare and terminal kidney disease, and abruptly the rhythm of family life changed. Suddenly, there were biweekly trips to the hospital for dialysis, repeated visits to doctors and agonizing waits for two kidney transplants. Increasingly, Cheryl - who was 10 when her mother fell ill - was called upon to help with household chores and care for her infant sister. She also increasingly spent more time with her father, Cheryl says the sexual abuse began when she was about 11. Initially, during the lonely period when her mother was in the hospital, she welcomed her father's attentions as a sign of affection. ''When my mother got sick I felt no one was paying attention to me,'' Cheryl says. ''My father started paying attention to me. At first I was really happy because until then I didn't think he knew I existed.'' The two of them would fall asleep together in his bedroom watching television under the covers. There was a point - she does not remember exactly when -when she realized her father's advances were wrong but she permitted him to continue, in part because she was afraid, in part because she did not want to burden her mother with additional pain, in part because her father had told her no one would believe her. Cheryl says that for the last two years of his life, her father had forced her to engage in sexual intercourse with him. When she finally threatened to tell someone, she says, her father told her she would regret it. ''I thought I'd just live through it, I guess,'' Cheryl says. ''If I'd say no and start to cry, he'd get very nasty toward the whole house. So a lot of times I did it to make everyone else happy. To keep peace in the house.'' Cheryl says she loved her father and could not understand how he could be at once so generous to her and yet so cruel. ''He'd come back from visiting my mother,'' she says. ''He used to be so upset sitting there at the hospital. Then he'd come home and do that to me. I didn't understand, if he loved my mother so much, how he was just . . . I don't know . . . what.'' Cathleen Pierson died on Feb. 13, 1985. It was a sad and difficult time. Mr. Pierson confided in friends that however much he loved his wife, in his grief he also felt anger at her for having abandoned him with the children. Their son, who by this time had graduated from high school and moved out of the house, was distraught. The little girl was confused, and Cheryl, who says there had long been tension between herself and her mother, was perpetually wracked with guilt. ''I loved my mother more than I think she knew,'' she says. Cheryl's 16th birthday came three months after Mrs. Pierson's death. As he had long planned with his wife, Mr. Pierson threw his daughter a lavish party at a nearby catering hall. She wore a white, off-the-shoulder jumpsuit, and there was a big, pink-and-white cake, which the two of them cut together. The disk jockey put on the 50's classic, ''Sixteen Candles,'' and silence fell over the dance floor as Cheryl and her father circled the room. When they were done, there was a round of applause. But at the end of the evening, when the band played the song again, Cheryl danced with Robert Cuccio, then a senior at Newfield (Continued on Page 62) High School, whom Cheryl had met some months before at a square dance in gym class. Robert was Cheryl's first serious boyfriend. She says he helped her come to terms with the death of her mother. They talked all the time on the telephone. They gave each other presents at their lockers in school. Initially, Mr. Pierson had not allowed the two of them to go out alone. He had wanted to get to know the boy first. Rob was permitted only to stop by the house after school. Occasionally, he accompanied the family bowling. But eventually Mr. Pierson gave in and let Cheryl go out on weekend dates with Rob, provided she was home by 11 P.M. ''I thought he went overboard,'' says Robert Cuccio,the young man's father, who was a police officer and detective for 12 years in the 43d Precinct in the Bronx. ''But my impression was the guy had just lost his wife and he was protecting his two little girls.'' According to Cheryl, the more time she spent with Rob, the more she was concerned about what might be happening to her younger sister at home. She would come home and find JoAnn watching television under the covers with her father or wrestling with him on the couch. ''I worried about it all the time,'' Cheryl says. ''I remembered how it started like that with me.'' In the weeks prior to the murder, Cheryl considered telling someone about her father. Every day in school, she would pass the ''Time Out Room,'' a lounge set aside at Newfield High for students to confer with faculty advisers about problems that cannot be discussed at home. Sometimes, Cheryl would look inside and see a teacher there she did not like. Looking in at other times, she says, she would simply feel hopeless. She was both embarrassed to come forward and convinced no one would believe her. But what she feared most was that the school would contact her father. She would think back to movies she had seen on television about incest and how every one ended the same way - with the father leaving home for a period of time, but always coming back. She would remember what her father had said: If she told anyone, she would regret it. In early November, Cheryl arrived at school to find a number of students, Sean Pica among them, talking about a murder that had been reported in the newspapers. A woman in nearby Mastic had paid $4,000 to have her husband killed, because, she said, he had physically abused her. In her confession, Cheryl said: ''I asked Sean, 'Who would be crazy enough to do that?' He said he could kill someone if the money was right. I asked him how much money, and he said $1,000. I told him I knew someone who might be interested. A couple of days later I told him it was me.'' Until then, Cheryl says, the thought of hiring someone to kill her father hadn't occurred to her. Why Sean, who was an aspiring Eagle Scout, who had a steady girlfriend, who was planning to represent his high school at a carpentry competition upstate, would have become entangled in an alleged murder plot remains a mystery. His parents were divorced in 1979. Sebastian Pica, Sean's father, says that he is totally at a loss. Sean's mother, Joanne DelVecchio, with whom he was living at the time of his arrest, declined to be questioned. Sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Cheryl recalls, Sean called to tell her that he had thrown a brick through the window of the house that Mr. Pierson owned across the street from the Pierson house. He had hoped to set off a burglar alarm, he said, and attack Mr. Pierson when he came out to investigate. He told Cheryl the alarm had not gone off, but that he wanted to try again. ''I told him just to forget about it,'' Cheryl says. ''He kept saying he was going to do it. But like, he didn't do it right, and I didn't want to be bothered.'' She told him her brother was going to help her. On Christmas Eve, Cheryl, her father and her sister were invited to the Cuccios' home for dinner. It was the first time Mr. Pierson and the Cuccios had met, and according to Mr. and Mrs. Cuccio, it was a festive occasion. Mrs. Cuccio says she was surprised by Mr. Pierson's gruff language, but Mr. Cuccio says he respected the man's ''take me as I am'' style. Except for the fact that Cheryl was quieter than usual - which Mr. and Mrs. Cuccio attributed to nerves - they detected nothing wrong. The next day - Christmas - Mr. Pierson, his daughters and son were invited to the home of Marilyn Adams, Mr. Pierson's sister. It was the first Christmas since Mr. Pierson's wife had died and the first since Mrs. Adams had been divorced from her husband, John, who was Cathleen Pierson's brother. Emotions ran high and, according to Mrs. Adams, Mr. Pierson got into an argument with her and threatened to leave. At one point, Cheryl says, while her father and her aunt reconciled in the kitchen, she found herself alone in the living room with her brother. '' 'What's the matter? You don't look right,' '' Cheryl recalls his having said. She complained then about her father's interference in her relationship with Rob, but she said nothing about her father's alleged sexual advances. ''I, like, wanted to tell him, but I just didn't,'' she says. She did, however, tell her brother about Sean, and asked him to help. Jim Pierson says that he did not take his sister seriously and thought her anger would pass. ''Everyone feels like killing their parents sometimes,'' says Jim, an aspiring rock musician. ''I thought she was mad because he wouldn't let her out on New Year's Eve. When he finally let her out, I said, 'See, it all worked out.' '' He dismissed what his sister told him about Sean. So, according to Cheryl, did Rob Cuccio. '' 'Like, someone who you don't even know in your high school is going to do it?' '' Cheryl says, paraphrasing Rob's reaction to the news that she had hired someone to kill her father. Previously, Cheryl says, she had told Rob of her molestation; and the police have charged that Rob, too, approached Cheryl's brother for help in hiring a killer. January 4 was James Pierson's 42d birthday, and Cheryl gave her father a bottle of cologne, some razor blades and a razor. She baked a cake, and that morning called WBLI to have the disk jockey wish Mr. Pierson a happy birthday on the air as he drove to work. She was ''the lucky caller'' and Mr. Pierson won two free dinners to El Torito's, a Mexican restaurant nearby. He never used them. The days preceding Mr. Pierson's murder blur in Cheryl's mind. What is sure, she says, is that she did not get her period on schedule and that her father was concerned. ''It's all your fault,'' she says she told him. She says that her father panicked at the thought of her pregnancy and began frantically looking into where she could get an abortion. Cheryl does not know whom he called or whether he ever scheduled an appointment. At this point, Cheryl says, she had told no one else about the possibility of her pregnancy. The night of Feb. 4, Newfield High School competed in basketball at another school. As a cheerleader, Cheryl was supposed to attend the game, but, according to her confession, she spoke to Sean beforehand, and he told her he was going to kill her father the next day. She says she did not believe him. Nervous, however, she called Rob. '' 'You know he says it all the time,' '' Cheryl quotes Rob as having said. '' 'You haven't talked about it with him in over a month. Just blow it off. Just go and cheer.' '' That is what she did. After the game, her father came to pick her up and drove her home. Mrs. Adams says she was waiting for the two of them that night because she had stopped by to deliver two stuffed animals that Mr. Pierson was planning to surprise his daughters with on Valentine's Day. Cheryl was attentive to her father, Mrs. Adams says, the way she always was. When they walked in the door, she recalls, Cheryl went to the icebox and got her father a soda. A PROFESSIONAL HIT was how police at first viewed the crime. Their initial investigation turned up no obvious suspects. James Pierson's funeral was held on Feb. 8, a cold and snowy Saturday. About 150 people attended. A priest read a eulogy that Cheryl had prepared with her brother. ''Our dad . . . was strong-willed, but soft-hearted,'' it said in part. ''He treated some people like a brother or sister, and some people like a daughter or son. . . . He was our best friend.'' Witnesses say Cheryl kissed her father's coffin and was inconsolable at his grave. The next day, according to Cheryl, Sean called and asked her to meet him at Genovese's pizza place in town. She and Rob drove over. She says Sean told them he was not happy with the $400 she had removed from her father's safe and given to him the day after the murder through Rob. Sean asked for more money, a motorcycle and permission to live in the house at which he had thrown the brick. Cheryl says she told him she could not give him those things. A few days later, the police say they received a call from an unidentified student who told them that Cheryl had been looking for a ''hit man'' to kill her father. She was brought to police headquarters in Yaphank, where she confessed. Medical tests while she was in custody revealed she was pregnant. It was then, for the first time, that young Jim Pierson, who had also been called in for questioning, heard about his father's alleged abuse of his sister. It enraged him. He has since taken an active role in his sister's defense. Of the murder, he says, ''I'm only sorry I didn't do it myself.'' I MISS THE PART OF him that was a father,'' says Cheryl. ''The part of him that took me on his motorcycle. Who did things with me that a father is supposed to do with a daughter. That was the part of him I loved.'' Whether Cheryl was or was not sexually abused by her father is a question that is expected to be a major issue at her trial. There are those who say they suspected it all along but either were not certain or did not think it any of their business to pry. Alberta Kosser, the neighbor with whom Cheryl now lives, remembers the day Cheryl's sister rushed over and announced: ''Cheryl slept with Daddy last night.'' John Adams, Cheryl's uncle, recalls the day at the 7-Eleven when Mr. Pierson put his arm around his daughter and grabbed her breast. Diana Erbentraut, a classmate, says she was so convinced something was wrong at Cheryl's home she told a guidance counselor at school but was told that Cheryl would have to come in herself. But Mr. Pierson's mother, his sister and many of his friends see things from a totally different perspective. They believe Cheryl is lying and have other theories about why she might have wanted her father killed. Money is one. His estate is valued at $500,000. His strict discipline at a time when she wanted to see more of her boyfriend is another. A third is the pregnancy. Five weeks after her arrest, Cheryl had a miscarriage and laboratory tests revealed that the child was not her father's. ''It's impossible,'' says Kenny Zimlinghaus, Mr. Pierson's partner, of the alleged abuse. ''All I see is one girl's allegation and no proof,'' says William Praetorius Jr., an insurance broker, who also knew Mr. Pierson well. In a trial that is expected to attract national attention from women's groups, the legal profession and others, Edward C. Jablonski, chief of the Major Offense Bureau of the Suffolk County district attorney's office, who will be prosecuting the case, is expected to argue that there is no direct evidence that Cheryl was sexually abused by her father, and that even if such evidence existed, the real issue is that she should be punished for taking her father's life. Whether she was or wasn't abused ''has nothing to do with the fact that all she had to do was go to the police,'' says Mr. Jablonski. ''That's what they're there for.'' Cheryl's attorney, Mr. Gianelli, is expected to contend that Cheryl suffered the kind of trauma experienced by battered wives and others who undergo violence on a sustained basis. Because of this, she was in ''an extreme emotional state'' and could not see reasonable alternatives. In New York, defendants who claim to have killed in self-defense must demonstrate that they believed the dangers they faced were lethal and imminent and that a ''reasonable man'' would have acted similarly. Feminists have long argued that what a man may not perceive as lethal might in fact be seen that way by a woman, and that the existing legal standard is geared more to a barroom brawl than the more sustained kind of violence to which women are more frequently subjected. They argue that the test a jury should be asked to use is not what a ''reasonable man'' would do in a given situation, but rather what would be reasonable from the unique perspective of the accused. This position has been successfully argued in a number of cases in recent years involving battered women, abused children, victims of rape and other individuals. The premise, however, was recently challenged in the celebrated case of Bernhard H. Goetz, who, on a New York subway train in December 1984, shot four youths -paralyzing one of them from the waist down- because, he said, he feared he was about to be mugged. On July 8, the New York State Court of Appeals, in reinstating charges against Mr. Goetz of attempted murder and assault, declared that the standard for self-defense remains that of what a ''reasonable man'' would do and not, as had been argued by Mr. Goetz's defense, what had been reasonable specifically for Mr. Goetz. ''To completely exonerate such an individual,'' the state's Chief Judge Sol Wachtler wrote in the unanimous decision, ''would allow citizens to set their own standards for the permissible use of force. It would also allow a legally competent defendant suffering from delusions to kill or perform acts of violence with impunity, contrary to fundamental principles of justice and criminal law.'' The court, however, acknowledged that though the ''reasonable man'' rule should be the primary standard, subjective considerations could not be wholly ruled out, thus leaving room for Cheryl's attorney's defense. If Cheryl is convicted of second-degree murder, she faces a maximum prison term of 25 years to life. Should the jury rule, however, that her act was precipitated by her beleaguered emotional state, the charge could be reduced to manslaughter; and in that case, even if the verdict is guilty, because Cheryl is under 18, Judge Harvey W. Sherman would have the option to let her off with probation. Youth credibility will also be at issue during Cheryl's trial. Social workers, lawyers and psychologists often claim that society habitually presumes that children who claim they are abused are lying. This presumption, they argue, often inhibits young people who need help from seeking it. ''The problem is the system is unable to deal with abused adolescents,'' says Dr. Vincent J. Fontana, chairman of the Suffolk County and New York City commissions on child abuse. ''When we deal with an adolescent who asks for help, we always question whether it is a disciplinary matter or one of legitimate abuse.'' ''Our history is not believing children,'' says Meg O'Regan, executive director of the Center for Women's Rights in Mineola, L.I. ''A lot of kids don't think the system will help them, and they're right. Battered children are supposed to call the police, but they know they will either not be believed or their lives will be completely disrupted.'' T HESE ARE TROU-bling times for many in Selden. Some are wracked with guilt that they did not speak up sooner about their suspicions. Some are so grief-stricken they can only speak of revenge. Still others do not speak at all. The subject is too ugly, too painful, too raw. ''I asked Cheryl why, if her father was doing these horrible things to her, she didn't kill him herself,'' says Mrs. Adams. ''And do you know what she said? She said: 'How could I do that, Aunt Marilyn? I loved him.' '' ''What's so frightening is that we are all so normal,'' said Karenanne Pica, Sean's stepmother. ''There must be a reason this is happening to us. But I don't know yet what it is.'' ''I look at my own kids,'' says Leonard Rosen, a friend of Mr. Pierson's for many years. ''If you can't trust them, who can you trust? And if it was going on . . . It's not for me to decide if it's justified or not. It's just very sad. For everyone. This is a tragedy. It defies logic.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE QUESTION OF MARIO CUOMO,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/magazine/the-question-of-mario-cuomo.html,"IN A SECOND-FLOOR CORRIDOR of the pompous old gray granite statehouse in Albany hang the portraits of New York's Governors. There are many men up there on the walls, of course, whose fingers wrote only faintly on the pages of history, but what strikes the visitor who lingers for a moment is how many of the names remain familiar to this day. Charles S. Whitman, Charles Poletti, Nathan L. Miller and even Herbert H. Lehman may have been forgotten by most, but they are the exceptions. Because in the last century alone, Grover Cleveland and Theodore Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin all moved from Albany to the White House, and at least five others -Charles Evans Hughes and Alfred E. Smith and Thomas E. Dewey and Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller - waged serious campaigns for the Presidency. So it is not surprising that Mario Matthew Cuomo, the man who sits where they sat, and where De Witt Clinton and Martin Van Buren sat, too, spends a lot of time answering questions about his Presidential aspirations - answering them, much of the time, with scarcely concealed impatience, because he isn't sure, he says, whether he has any. Last May, when Mr. Cuomo announced that he would seek another term this year, he tried to head off the political chatter linking him with the White House by stating baldly: ''I have decided to run for Governor. I have no plans to run for the Presidency.'' But when reporters pressed him, as they have done ever since his emotional call to arms at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Cuomo wouldn't be goaded into saying categorically that he wouldn't run. Into his voice there crept a charac-teristic note of exasperated impatience, verging on arrogant dismissal: ''I don't want to lock the door against eventualities that I don't even understand or imagine. I'm not God. If you have a crystal ball, if you can tell me what's going to happen, fine. But I can't do it.'' Coming from most politicians, those comments, and the hundreds of similar ones he has made before and since, would have been taken as candidate's code, easily translated. Something like this: ''Of course I'm interested in the Presidency, but first I have to get re-elected. I can't get people to vote for me for Governor if they think I'm going to spend all my time out of the state, running for President. Besides, the best strategy may be to hang back for a while, let the other candidates cut each other up, then make my move a bit later.'' Some politicians and pundits have, in fact, put exactly that construction on the Governor's words. They like to say that he is ''running for President by not running.'' But that is not the view of those closest to him, it is not the picture that emerges from the actions of his political backers and it is not the impression that I took away from 10 hours of intense conversation with him - he brooks no other kind - in Albany late this summer. Mr. Cuomo said in another context that ''no one knows what I'm really thinking,'' so perhaps he has fooled the members of his own entourage. But they believe, as one of them said, that ''he hasn't really made his peace with the idea of running yet.'' Mario Cuomo is, after all, a tortoise, not a hare. He tends to delay decisions, weighing all the consequences, as long as he can. Now 54 years old, he shied away from politics until he was 40 and never held public office until he was 43. And he is a man of conflicts and contradictions, forever wrestling with himself, attempting to reconcile the impulses of heart and mind, always conscious of a sense of guilt that he describes as the ''legacy of my Catholic education.'' Watch him leading a parade down the streets of North Tonawanda, N.Y., and you would conclude that he is a man of action through and through, born for politics. He bounds athletically along, a stocky figure in a blue suit that somehow emphasizes rather than conceals a powerful build. The eyes, deep set, sparkle as he spots a friend; a gap-toothed grin splits his broad, fleshy, Italianate face. He waves a stubby hand, a hand made for physical labor, a hand on which his St. John's University ring seems out of place. He looks like a cop on the beat, or maybe a parish priest from Queens or Brooklyn, the kind who enjoys his red wine and tells jokes with the best of them. A few hours later, relaxing in his office, his coat off but his tie still anchored in place, his shoes highly polished, his trousers still sharply creased at the end of the day, Mr. Cuomo is a different man. The ideas flow out of him in perfectly parsed sentences; you wonder who was the last American politician you talked to who used words like ''eschatology'' and discussed the perils of Social Darwinism and quoted William Carlos Williams and Teilhard de Chardin. Eugene McCarthy? Adlai Stevenson? Now he seems not a man of action but a man of reflection and speculation. A priest, perhaps, but one whose natural habitat is the classroom and the library, hearty enough but deeply serious, maybe a little too serious for his own good, with his penchant for self-examination and his preoccupation with worthiness. Asked why he dislikes campaigning so much, when he is obviously very good at it, the Governor replies: ''You know that you should be reading or working in the office instead of out selling yourself to people by means that are superficial or trite or self-demeaning.'' It is easy to believe that this man has taken two vacations, of five and a half days each, since his marriage in 1954. One was his honeymoon. It is easy to believe that for 15 years this man has arisen every day at 5 A.M. to pour his thoughts, his hopes and especially his doubts into a diary. The diaries provide some of the best evidence we have of Cuomo the man, for he has never made friends easily outside his family. His son Andrew, 28, who is managing his re-election campaign, may be his closest male friend, and his slim, animated wife, Matilda, is without question his closest friend of all. He writes about people, about books he is reading, about political battles, but most of all he writes about himself, restlessly seeking to define his goals and his motivation. ''What does God want of me?'' he wrote one day. Reacting to the seeming contradiction between his aggressiveness and his love of contemplation, he put down this self-analysis of his response to criticism: ''The first phase is the defensive one. For a short time there is regret, distaste, a desire to return to solitude, separation, the back of the store with the partitioned quiet. But only briefly. Time to fight back. Then the desire for separation turns into an eagerness, even a combativeness. I become almost comfortable with the idea I am under siege.'' On another day, the guilt and the doubt showed even more clearly: ''Always, the nagging truth is that I should be something else - a person who gives only to give, who works only to provide, who speaks only to soothe or persuade for the good, who strives only for others. And always there is the depressing reality that I fail utterly at that truth, that my emotions are at war with it - or at least are too strong to surrender to it.'' It may be, as Stanley Fink, the retiring Speaker of the State Assembly, once suggested, that Mr. Cuomo keeps the diaries in loose-leaf notebooks so he can do plenty of judicious editing and rewriting. But he leaves in far more, to judge from the two volumes that have been published by Random House, than most politicians would consider prudent. PRUDENT OR NOT, MR. CUOMO looks like a shoo-in this fall. His Republican opponent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, is little-known. The Governor has put together a $10-million campaign fund, and he has apparently insured that he will have the running mate he wants, an able if rather bland member of Congress named Stanley Lundine from upstate Jamestown. Abraham Hirschfeld, the perennial candidate who had hoped to challenge Mr. Lundine (and hence Mr. Cuomo), was ruled off the ballot by a State Supreme Court judge because of irregularities in his nominating petitions turned up by Cuomo staff members. Stung by the Governor's hardball tactics, Mr. Hirschfeld suggested that the Cuomo-Lundine campaign was ''trying to annex New York State to Russia.'' He should not have been surprised. Almost 34 years ago, a baseball scout wrote of Mario Cuomo, then a 20-year-old center fielder for the Class D Brunswick (Ga.) Pirates: ''He is aggressive and plays hard . . . will run over you if you get in his way.'' A friend who has played pool and basketball with him says that ''he doesn't exactly cheat, but sometimes he adjusts the score a bit.'' What makes the man so formidable a candidate, a proven winner in a swing state in the age of Ronald Reagan? Probably his greatest asset is his ability to defy ideological classification. He hates labels like ''conservative'' and ''liberal'' so much that he will hold up a conversation to give a professorial discourse on their imprecision. But he must know, too, that they are bad news for him politically. He wants the votes of the liberals in Manhattan, but he also wants the votes of the Democratic traditionalists in his native Queens and in Buffalo. To the liberals, he offers support on such issues as gay rights, a nuclear freeze, aid to the destitute; he opposes the death penalty and, while he personally supports the Roman Catholic position on abortion, he refuses to try to write it into law. To the man in the tavern in Brooklyn, to the woman in the typing pool in Rochester, who might find such positions too trendy or too soft, he offers the un-selfconscious patriotism of the immigrant's son, a rhetorical emphasis on compromise and on fiscal caution and, above all, constant references to God and the family as the twin anchors of life. ''His ideas are not that radically different from Fritz Mondale's,'' says one Democratic campaign strategist, ''but his personality makes them sound different. Italians are very different from Norwegians.'' Adds another: ''The thing I like about him is that the intellect is softened by the personality. He's not an optimist like Reagan, but they both come across, especially on television, as regular guys. Unlike Stevenson, Cuomo can walk into a bar and seem right at home.'' The family is the Governor's metaphor of choice at the moment. He uses it to describe a city, as he did in a talk at a ceremony marking the 300th anniversary of Albany; he uses it to describe his state, his country, the world. The message is that all of society is interdependent, as he told a black medical society meeting recently: ''We're not well as a nation unless we're all well.'' And he is even willing to apply it, in a gingerly way, to Presidential politics. Flying back to Albany from Buffalo one night in July - he tries to sleep in Albany every night, even if it means a postmidnight flight in bad weather -he asked one of his aides to play a tape on the plane's cassette deck. It was the Simon and Garfunkel standard of 1968, ''Mrs. Robinson,'' and this is the part he wanted me to listen to: Sitting on a sofa On a Sunday afternoon, Going to the candidates' debate, Laugh about it, Shout about it, When you've got to choose, Every way you look at it you lose. Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (Ooo, ooo, ooo). What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson? ''Joltin' Joe'' has left and gone away (Hey hey hey, hey hey hey). - COPYRIGHT BY PAUL SIMON ''They said it all,'' Mr. Cuomo declared, suddenly intense again. ''That's the best description I've ever heard of what the country longs for: grace, character, style, an inspirational quality if you like. Reagan doesn't have exactly that, but he has filled the void with patriotism, warmth and especially a lack of negativism. That's why I think building a sense of community will be so important in 1988. I don't know whether family is a good enough notion, but somehow you have to get across the notion of synergy, of working together. I'd like to write a Declaration of Interdependence, about the relationships between all the parts of a disparate world. John Donne was right. Look at Chernobyl: a reactor blows up and people thousands of miles away can't drink the milk. Now, how do you say that? You can't say 'synergy' and hope to score with people, but everyone understands family.'' Much has been written about Mr. Cuomo's heroes: Thomas More, Lincoln, F.D.R. But even on that subject, he can be contradictory. He told me that he didn't really have idols: ''You have to beware of heroes, because no one knows it all, or ever knew it all; much better to take from each flower as you can.'' But he also said he hadn't liked a Lincoln biography that he had read because the author ''showed me the warts, and who wants a hero with warts? Lincoln isn't a man with ingrown toenails, he's an idea. I don't want to know the sordid details about someone I admire.'' Martin J. Steadman, the Governor's press secretary, who shares with him a passion for baseball, says that his real idol is the man in the song: Joe DiMaggio. Mr. Cuomo keeps an autographed DiMaggio photo in his office in Manhattan, and a bronze cast of Lincoln's hands in his study at the Governor's Mansion in Albany. But he has two portraits of More, whom he reveres because he is the patron saint of lawyers and because, the Governor says, he was a combination of ''noble hopes and goals and personal weakness.'' All, in their ways, were loners, private men who lived public lives. So is Mario Cuomo, perhaps because more than most men, he has made his own way in life. He was the fourth child of parents who came to the United States from the province of Salerno, south of Naples. Neither Immaculata nor Andrea Cuomo had any money, any English, any friends or family waiting here, or any education to speak of. They settled, after an interlude in Jersey City, in a poor, polyglot section of South Jamaica, Queens, and Andrea started a small grocery store that he kept open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Somehow, young Mario climbed out of his native neighborhood of struggling Italians, Poles, Irish and blacks to St. John's University and its law school. But he never lost the feeling common to many in the outer boroughs that surround Manhattan - a certain discomfort in the presence of, if not downright resentment of, the rich and powerful, especially the patricians who came to their positions of eminence by inheritance. He used to tell a self-revealing joke about meeting with a group of wealthy, influential people assembled by David Rockefeller. ''I told them,'' he would say, ''that I had something in common with many of them. I told them that my grandfather had died in the Great Crash of 1929 - a stockbroker jumped out of a window and crushed him and his pushcart down below.'' CELEBRITY HAS HAD LITTLE IMPACT upon him. He doesn't hang out at Elaine's or the ''21'' Club. He doesn't wear flashy clothes. And he still likes to eat down-home Italian-American dishes like sauteed escarole. Some of those who work for and who formerly worked for Governor Cuomo say his early poverty in Queens, and especially his failure after law school to win a place in a Wall Street firm despite finishing joint first in his class, gave him the mentality of an outsider, ever suspicious of elites. Even in his present position of eminence, one former associate said, ''Mario Cuomo trusts no one completely who isn't a member of his own family.'' The Governor himself dismisses this line of thought, describing it as ''predictable analysis, but not true.'' He said that he has never had a chip on his shoulder, never felt that he had to show ''them'' that he was as good as they. He added: ''I feel no resentment toward the establishment. But my early life taught me that for every person in the castle at the top of the hill there are a lot of people down in the gutter where the glitter doesn't show.'' All the same, he admits that he prefers people who have made their own money, and there was a hint of insecurity, perhaps even envy, in the way that he mocked one cabinet colleague at a recent senior staff meeting for attending Caroline Kennedy's wedding and needled another for having studied at Harvard, the quintessential insiders' university. Whatever the explanation, he is a wary man, often thin-skinned, who has had trouble getting along with the press. After initially promising to cooperate in the preparation of this article, he suddenly balked and said he would not be interviewed. He was reluctant, he explained, to involve himself in any project that had Presidential politics as even a subsidiary topic. But staff members and friends suggested that the real reason for his sudden change of heart was a New York Times editorial expressing less than total satisfaction with his accomplishments during the recent legislative session. After 10 days, he relented, granted not one but a series of interviews and answered in detail and with good humor every question, including those about Presidential politics. Mr. Cuomo is deeply preoccupied - his critics might say obsessed - with what is written about him and his administration, and tends to complain that journalists don't do their homework. (He once commented to a startled Albany reporter: ''It's amazing how bad a press Lincoln got for the Gettysburg Address.'') Early in his term, he used to call editors and reporters himself to complain when he was displeased; he no longer does that, but he orders staff members to do it and report back. One old Albany hand, no friend of the Governor, calls him ''a prima donna'' who would find it difficult to take the heat of a Presidential campaign. Another, who likes Mr. Cuomo well enough that he says he would go to work for him if asked, says that he has ''a disconcerting tendency to make enemies in the press corps.'' He is contentious, challenging, demanding, impatient with his staff, and not one iota less so with the press. Probably no incident did more short-term damage to Governor Cuomo's reputation than his clash last year with a group of reporters who were questioning him about the Mafia. ''You're telling me that the Mafia is an organization,'' he said hotly, ''and I'm telling you that's a lot of baloney.'' That translated easily into headlines suggesting that the Governor had denied the existence of the Mafia. He now regrets reacting in quite that way, but he remains sensitive to any slur on Italian-Americans: ''I'm very alert to the implication that organized crime is the exclusive province of Italian-Americans. People start by thinking that all crime is Italian-American and slide into the reciprocal -that all Italian-Americans are in crime. Sometimes they tell me that my father must have had to pay protection money to the Mafia to keep his grocery store open. Well, he did not pay it.'' In the same way, he bridled when a newspaper article suggested that a candidate with a name like Mario couldn't win in the South. Not surprisingly, Mr. Cuomo resents whispers that because he is a Democratic politician from Queens, where much of the current New York City corruption scandal has been focused, he must also be somehow tainted. No one has made such a suggestion publicly, but a few people do so privately, and the Governor knows it. Although he has no background in the clubhouse political milieu that has been known to breed the payoff and the fix, his ties to the borough might dog him if he decides to run for President. If the Governor's identification as an Italian-American and his pride in his ethnicity have sometimes caused him trouble, his Catholicism has been central to his success. It led him, in fact, into a political career - first into the defense of a group of blue-collar Italian-American families, in Corona, Queens, who were trying to keep the city from tearing down their houses for a school; and then, at the behest of Mayor John V. Lindsay, into mediating a dispute in Forest Hills, Queens, where middle-class Jewish families were trying to block the construction of public housing for low-income black families. He plunged into these activities, Mr. Cuomo said, because of the change in church teaching represented by the Second Vatican Council, which encouraged Catholics to involve themselves, as he says, in ''the concerns of this world, rather than feeling that you had failed because you had not gone into a monastery to weave baskets to fill the uncomfortable interval between birth and eternity.'' There followed unsuccessful campaigns for Lieutenant Governor (1974) and Mayor of New York City (1977). Finally, in 1978, he was elected Lieutenant Governor, running with Hugh Carey. Four years later, he defeated Mayor Koch for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and then nosed out Republican Lewis Lehrman in the general election, even though he was heavily outspent. Mr. Cuomo works hard to avoid seeming holier than thou. He tries to avoid being photographed going to mass every Sunday morning at 7; he says that ''religion is for sinners, not for saints.'' But when he describes the new toxic waste cleanup measure as being ''about as close to a purely good, moral act as this society gets,'' a faint cloud of sanctimony clings to the words, even though the Governor, as is his wont, praises Republican legislators for their part in passing it. That is probably inevitable for a man so steeped in More's ''Utopia,'' with its vision of an island where ethical norms are jointly upheld by politics and religion and where everyone acts for the commonweal. The fullest statement of his view of the way in which a Catholic politician should conduct himself in a pluralistic society came in his celebrated speech at Notre Dame University in September 1984. Almost a quarter-century after John F. Kennedy's speech to the Baptist clergy in Houston, the Governor argued, as had his fellow Catholic, that a Catholic public official should not attempt, through legislation, to force his personal views on those he governs. The test case, of course, was abortion. In a closely reasoned, eloquently phrased address, Mr. Cuomo declared: ''To assure our freedom, we must allow others the same freedom, even if it occasionally produces conduct by them which we would hold to be sinful.'' That said, he challenged Catholics to obey what they considered God's law rather than trying to turn it into Caesar's: ''The hard truth is that abortion isn't a failure of government. No agency or department of government forces women to have abortions, but abortion goes on. Are we asking government to make criminal what we believe to be sinful because we ourselves can't stop committing the sin?'' The speech was widely acclaimed in the secular press, and polls showed Mr. Cuomo picking up strength among Protestants and Jews. But it widened the rift between the Governor and the Catholic hierarchy, notably John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York. G OVERNOR CUOMO'S tenure in Albany has, in fact, been punctuated with major speeches, on which he has worked for weeks and in which he has tried to set out what seem to him major ideas about governing. He considers them, he says, the most important work he does. After his energy, his eloquence - the sonorous voice, the logic, humor, the gift for apposite allusion - is his greatest political asset. Most recently, he risked being described as naive when he criticized not only President Reagan but such past Presidents as Jackson, Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt - for attempting to stack the Federal courts with ideologically sympathetic judges. Speaking to more than 4,000 members of the American Bar Association, the Governor insisted that the proper criteria for selection were scholarship, experience and integrity, not partisanship or ideology. Nor were those the correct criteria for senators challenging Presidential appointments, he said. Some people hated the speech. Senator Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, said it proved that Mr. Cuomo ''has the biggest mouth on the political scene right now.'' But some loved it. Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr., who is generally considered a member of the Supreme Court's liberal bloc, said ''it made a point that was very, very significant.'' In any event, it demonstrated yet again Mario Cuomo's willingness to take the hard road. Defining a statesman as ''a retired politician who urges his successor to do all the noble things he never had the courage to do,'' the columnist Charles Krauthammer sees the Governor as ''a premature statesman'' who ''urges difficult things before he gets in office and then, once in, sticks by them.'' The death penalty, which Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly vetoed despite its demonstrated popularity, is an obvious instance. In the case of the bar association, he chose to address a serious subject when an anodyne welcoming address would have sufficed. The speech was typical as well in its reverence for the law, and in its bipartisan tone, which is a Cuomo trademark. His own choice for Chief Judge of New York State, Sol Wachtler, is a Republican, and the Governor has demonstrated considerable skill in his relations with the majority Republicans in the State Senate, often using them to block what he considered overly radical measures proposed by the Democratic leadership in the State Assembly. Even in his attacks on the President, which can be as tough as any brass-collar Democrat could ask for, he often praises Mr. Reagan for his courage and for the strength of his convictions. He says he dislikes ''playing the demon avenger in politics,'' and this approach, so surprising in a man as willing as he to play tough on occasion, is one explanation of the broad electoral appeal that he has managed to develop in just four years. But don't cross him. Democrats of the prominence of Robert S. Strauss, the former national chairman, and Stephen Solarz, the Brooklyn Congressman, have found themselves frozen out because of some real or imagined slight. People around the Governor talk disparagingly of politicians whose only sin seems to have been that they supported Mr. Koch and not Mr. Cuomo in the Democratic primary four years ago. Like all successful politicians, the Governor has been lucky; talent without luck in politics is as useless as inside (Continued on Page 87) information without capital in the stock market. The Reagan boom enabled him to eliminate a projected deficit and to enact (with Republican help) the largest tax reduction in the state's history, while building more prison cells and reforming Medicaid. Critics on the right, like his onetime finance chairman, William Stern, complain that Mr. Cuomo remains ''a big spender who wants to involve government in everything.'' They note that the state's general-fund spending has risen by 40 percent over the last four years, twice the rate of inflation, partly because of rising labor costs but also because of big jumps in aid to schools and local government. New York still collects more taxes and borrows more than any other large industrial state. Critics on the left complain, in the words of Walter Hang of the New York Public Interest Research Group, that ''he talks about programs but he doesn't fight for them.'' Indeed, some of the Governor's own advisers concede that his soaring political rhetoric - his passionate declarations of his hopes and dreams -raises expectations that are incapable of realization in the more pragmatic arena of day-to-day politics in the age of Ronald Reagan. Which leads back to the question: Will he seek to end that era by asking the country to elect him President, by asking it to choose his rather austere vision of moral virtue over a continuation of the hearty, self-congratulatory patriotism of Mr. Reagan? Sitting in his smallish office, off the grand ceremonial room where bills are signed, in front of an enormous window swathed in gold cloth, this is what the Governor says: ''I have for so long resisted focusing on it that I've developed a kind of habit of abstention. You get an instinct that this isn't something you should be rushing toward. It's something to be very circumspect about, because this is the most powerful position in the most powerful country in the only world we know. ''It's not easy for me to believe that there isn't a better qualified person than me with a reasonable chance of winning. I have no plans, and no plans to plan. But why should I rule it out, even if I'm struck by lightning like Saul? Do I think things will change? No. But of course they might.'' A former aide, now in private life but still close to Mr. Cuomo, says there is astonishingly little talk about the Presidency, even in the inner circle: ''It's like a no-hitter. You don't talk about that until the last man is out. We don't talk about Washington until the future in Albany is secure.'' Unless you count a few travels around the country - very few, by the standards of men thinking about running for President - or a few briefings by foreign-policy experts, there are no detectable signs of a candidacy in waiting. No committees, no subtle sounding out of fellow governors, no Washington operation, no media specialists studying possible strategies, no trips abroad. It is not too late, but it is quickly becoming too late: the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are less than 18 months away. And not since Hubert H. Humphrey won the Democratic nomination in 1968 has either major party turned to a candidate who did not plunge wholeheartedly into the nominating process, with all of its attendant frenzy. Suppose the Governor is fooling us with his air of reluctance, or suppose that something happens to change his mind. If he ran, what would his chances be? In most polls, he runs second to Gary Hart among the Democrats; one taken in July gave Mr. Hart 30 percent and Mr. Cuomo 14 percent. That suggests, as one would expect, a lot of indecision in the public mind. A big victory in November - say 60 percent to 40 - would certainly add to the Governor's appeal. Many Democratic professionals think he combines better than any potential Presidential candidate traditional Democratic compassion and the fiscal responsibility they think they need to win. But others have doubts; one New York fund-raiser says she will back Mr. Cuomo to the hilt this November but prays he will wait until 1992 to try for the White House because he needs the intervening years to learn more, especially about foreign policy. He has never visited Israel, northern Europe or Japan; he has turned down opportunities to meet such foreign leaders as President Francois Mitterrand of France when they have been in New York City, and he told one friend not long ago that he knew Buffalo, but not Beirut, and worried about that. Perhaps he will wait until 1992, or perhaps, as Bill Stern, his former finance chairman, suggests, he will go for Vice President in 1988. If it comes, a national campaign would test the Governor's skills as an organizer; he has been criticized in the past as a poor delegator, but gets better marks these days from those who know Albany. It would test his ability to hold his tongue, lest a few outbursts like the Mafia incident do to him what tears shed publicly in the snows of New Hampshire did to Edmund S. Muskie in 1972. It would test whether the appeal of this passionate immigrant's son would work as well in the Sunbelt and the Great Plains as it does in the older, more heterogeneous Northeast. And ultimately, it would test the Governor's ability to convince the electorate that he really is a new kind of Democrat, that he has a fresh, coherent vision, that he is not just a New Dealer dressed up in a sharp new rhetorical suit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Theology He Teaches Is No Longer Catholic,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/opinion/l-the-theology-he-teaches-is-no-longer-catholic-072586.html,"To the Editor: To me, as a second-year seminarian at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, Roy Meachum's analysis of the decision by the Vatican to revoke the Rev. Charles E. Curran's license to teach theology at the Catholic University of America (Op-Ed, Aug. 29) seems as misinformed on points of fact as it is confused on matters of interpretation. Specifically, the assertion that Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger ''sidestepped canonical legal processes'' in the investigation of Father Curran and ''denied him access to his accusers'' is patently false. As your newspaper and others have reported, Father Curran and Cardinal Ratzinger have been involved in a seven-year exchange of ideas, a dialogue during which they have met to discuss the theological points made by Father Curran. Then, Mr. Meachum's conception of the doctrine of papal infallibility as endowing the Pope ''with the power to make divinely inspired pronouncements'' is likewise inadequate. Rather, papal infallibility means that the Holy Father, under the charism of the Holy Spirit and solely on matters of faith and morals, is able to define without possibility of error truths held by the Roman Catholic Church. To suggest, as Mr. Meachum does, that the decision to revoke Father Curran's status as a Catholic theologian in good standing extends this notion and somehow ''declares all bishops infallible when they take a stand on faith or morals'' is simply nonsensical. The issue in the case of Father Curran is far simpler than Mr. Meachum has argued. It is this: Father Curran can no longer consider himself a teacher of Catholic theology because the theology he teaches is no longer Catholic. In no way does this decision run counter to either the spirit or the letter of the Second Vatican Council, a council that condemned abortion, as well as ''unlawful contraceptive practices,'' and that required from every Catholic a loyal submission of will and intellect to the official teaching of the church (Gaudium et Spes, 47, 51, and see Lumen Gentium, 25). Finally, Mr. Meachum's opinion that Cardinal Ratzinger is ''outlawing the right to an individual conscience'' is mistaken. In the spirit of Vatican II, the Cardinal is concerned that Catholics receive guidance from those appointed to teach and investigate Christian doctrine, guidance necessary for the formation of the individual conscience. For almost 20 years, Father Curran has neglected to do this and so has failed those whom he was meant to serve. It is necessary and it is also truly unfortunate that he has lost his status as a teacher of Catholic theology. CHARLES J.

CRIME,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/books/crime-982686.html,"Can a Chicago sewer inspector make an attractive hero? He can in THE JUNKYARD DOG by Robert Campbell (Signet/New American Library, Paper, $2.95). James Flannery is his name. Not only is he on the municipal payroll, he also is a Democratic precinct chairman in a city run by the Democratic Party. He is something of a plodder, but he is honest and takes care of his people. He likes them, and they like him. So when an abortion clinic is firebombed, Flannery is outraged. Such things should not happen in his district. And something personal is involved. One of the victims was a friend - a Jewish woman, a neighbor in his building, who donated her time to the clinic. Flannery looks for the perpetrators. He has a good idea who was behind the attack - a demagogic religious fanatic who acts like a junior Hitler. As Flannery proceeds, his investigation gets to the upper political echelons, and he is warned off. Abortion is a touchy issue, and some important people may be tangentially or even actively involved. The more he is told to hold back, the more strenuous his activities become. He is not a man who can be pushed around. He has some resources. He has been a precinct captain for a long time, and his friends in politics and on the police force owe him a favor or two. In Chicago politics, apparently, favors are like gambling debts and have to be repaid. Here and there Mr. Campbell indulges in a bit of humor, but for the most part the book is grimly realistic. The writing style is equally realistic. The story is told in the first person singular, present tense. Mr. Campbell has tried to re-create the speech patterns of some not-so-well-educated members of the working class: ''My father and me have dinner together every Wednesday night.'' '' 'Who gives out permits on demonstrations?' I asks.'' A dialogue at the end gives a good idea of the author's skillful technique. Flannery has been successful in getting a posthumous award for a fireman named Warnowski, who killed himself while drunk. There is a city presentation attended by the mayor: ''After Corrigan leaves, the mayor passes in front of me. His aide whispers in his ear. The mayor stops and looks me over. 'So you're Flannery, are you? I've got to hand it to you.' '' 'Sir?' '' 'Mooshie Warnowski.' '' 'A good man. A hero.' '' 'Flannery,' the mayor says, 'you really can shovel it high.' '' A traditionally plotted British mystery in a modern setting (no country-house weekend with lords and ladies) is DEAD RINGER by Roger Ormerod (Scribners, $13.95). It is about Jerry Boyes, a former stunt man who stood in for an actor. In the course of a chase scene, there was an accident, his face was disfigured, and he lost a leg -not to mention all his confidence. Now, years later, the actor comes back into his life. He wants Boyes to be the hand-over man for a ransom payment. An industrialist has been kidnapped, and the actor is supervising the rescue operation. Of course, things are not as easy as they sound. Boyes becomes the central figure in a con game, and the plotting becomes extremely complicated. At the end there is a long, detailed explanation that might well try the reader's patience. On the other hand, the writing is expert, the characterizations are well realized, and Boyes himself is an interesting man with some deep inner problems to overcome. In a way, ''Dead Ringer'' is a book about a man's rediscovery of himself. Here's another book about self-discovery: HOME AGAIN by David Wiltse (Macmillan, $16.95). An F.B.I. hero quits after killing a female terrorist in a stakeout gun battle, and he returns with wife and teen-age son to his hometown in Nebraska. There he expects to practice law with his brother. He even runs for office. But there are slimy politics in the town, and his brother is part of the slime. A woman is murdered, and the police chief asks the former F.B.I. man for help. More dirt is uncovered before the murderer is nailed. The question implicit in this well-written book is an ethical one. Can a man these days really pursue an idealistic path through life? Or must he adapt to certain realities? In addition, the man has an adolescent son who cannot understand him, and it takes a long time and a crisis before they can approach each other. A good part of the book is told by the son. ''Home Again'' is a sensitive and interesting piece of work with, incidentally, a good deal of action in it. Bob Langley's AUTUMN TIGER (Walker, $15.95) and Stuart White's OPERATION RAVEN (Beaufort/Kampmann, $16.95) have in common a World War II setting. And both deal with spies who infiltrate enemy country. In ''Autumn Tiger'' it is an American O.S.S. man who is yanked out of Berlin and ordered to impersonate a German soldier in an American prisoner-of-war camp. He has to pry out of a German P.O.W. a secret that could affect the course of the war. In ''Operation Raven'' a German spy impersonates a British soldier during the Dunkirk evacuation and enters England. His mission is to get in touch with a certain peer who has Nazi sympathies. ''Autumn Tiger'' does not work very well, thanks mostly to the author's plodding and cliche-ridden style. Mr. Langley also likes to make his characters hiss, including such unhissable expressions as ''My God!'' And when they are not hissing ''My God!'' they are whispering ''My God.'' Nor is ''Operation Raven'' much better written. The central character is a stock, evil Nazi, completely amoral, convinced of his racial superiority and trained to kill as an automatic reflex. That is fine with him; he enjoys killing. Opposed to him is another stock figure, the ''good'' Nazi, sent to England by Hitler to stop the evil one. It's too complex to explain what this man is doing in England during the war, and you wouldn't believe it anyway. The third in Shelley Singer's Jake Samson series is FULL HOUSE (St. Martin's, $13.95). Samson is the private eye from San Francisco who does not even have a license. He merely does favors for friends. There are some cute things in ''Full House.'' Members of a religious group are busy building arks. Their leader, appropriately named Noah, has announced that the world is going to be destroyed by a flood. He suddenly disappears, and Samson is hired to find him. The police say that he has absconded with a hefty amount of money and a woman. His coreligionists, of course, refuse to believe that. They fear he has been murdered. Everything moves along well. Even sections that suggest padding eventually turn out to have a bearing on the plot. And Samson, a nice man, is introduced by his family to a nice, attractive, interesting woman. Perhaps the next in the series will tell us how things turn out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMOCRATS PIN MUCH HOPE FOR SENATE CONTROL ON UPHILL RACE IN IDAHO,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/us/democrats-pin-much-hope-for-senate-control-on-uphill-race-in-idaho.html,"''Ah, Idaho,'' said Peter D. Hart, a leading Washington pollster who works mostly for Democratic candidates. ''There isn't a state anywhere where it's any harder for the likes of us to win.'' His point is well taken; The Republicans have carried Idaho in the last five Presidential elections, and in 1984 Ronald Reagan won more easily here than anywhere except the indefatigably Republican state of Utah. Yet this is one of the handful of states on which the Democrats are counting this fall to return them to power in the Senate. They need a net gain of four seats, and, given the lay of the political land elsewhere, it is not easy to see how they can do it if they do not win in Idaho, which they have considered a prime target for the last six years. Why, one might ask, would they even dream of triumph in this bastion of conservatism? Flip back through history, and it is hard to come up with more than two great radical names here: William E. Borah, the Republican iconoclast of the 20's, comes to mind, as does Frank Church, the Democrat who all through the 60's helped lead the fight against the war in Vietnam. But even Senator Church failed to hold his seat in 1980, going down to defeat amid a storm of charges that he was too liberal and, worse, too cosmopolitan for the people of Idaho. Democrats' 2 Main Hopes The main reasons the Democrats entertain hopes of winning here are two: first, the style of the man who beat Senator Church six years ago, Sen. Steven D. Symms, and second, the perilous condition of almost every economic activity in the state, from farming and ranching to mining and construction. Mr. Symms is a 48-year-old apple-grower and wine-producer whose Ste. Chapelle chardonnays are much esteemed by connoisseurs. His politics is conservative, but his style is flamboyant. Not for him is the strait-laced probity of some of his ideological brethren, including his Idaho colleague, Senator James A. McClure; Mr. Symms boldly allied himself with the Hunt family of Texas when the Hunts were trying to corner the silver market; he set out (vainly) to soften the Clean Air Act, in a state whose clean air is one of its prime resources, and, in a typically unconventional comment, he suggested after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl that it was a pity that it had not ''happened much closer to the Kremlin.'' Mr. Symms's opponent is Gov. John V. Evans, heir to a curious Democratic subtradition in this state. Beginning with the victory of Cecil D. Andrus in 1970, the Democrats have controlled the governorship for 16 years. Issue of the Economy Governor Evans, a somber, 61-year-old former rancher who has won 14 consecutive elections, thinks he can win again by blaming Mr. Symms for the state's economic troubles. He notes that in Shoshone County, a silver-mining region in the Panhandle, not far from the Canadian border, 43 percent of the work force is unemployed, and he argues that Mr. Symms ''has to share in the blame, because he either voted for the policies and programs that brought this about or failed to find solutions.'' Many business executives in Boise - a city, despite its rustic reputation, where such major enterprises as Boise Cascade (lumber and paper), Morrison-Knudsen (heavy construction) and Albertson's (supermarkets) have headquarters - disagree with the Governor's diagnosis. One of them said the other day that unlike most of the country, Idaho ''never really recovered from the Carter recession, so there's no point blaming President Reagan for this mess.'' In that sense, the Senate race here is typical of many in states where the general prosperity of recent years has not penetrated. Some Republican incumbents, like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, have so skillfully distanced themsleves from the Reagan Administration and its policies that they seem invulnerable; some, like Senator James Abdnor of South Dakota, seem likely to lose their seats because of local economic unrest, and others, like Mr. Symms, find themselves staring into the chasm of uncertainty when they would otherwise be assured of re-election. Mr. Evans is a man of unthreatening style, all rimless glasses and dark suits and pro-business utterances, so totally different, as he said in an interview this week, from ''the kind of behavior you people in the East associate with Democratic governors.'' The polls show Mr. Evans narrowly ahead; still, the professional politicians here, not surprisingly, considering recent political events, expect Mr. Symms to eke out a victory. Public Seems Indifferent Here, as in other states that constitute the focus of so much tactical endeavor in Washington this fall, there is a sense of vast public indifference. The weather, the fortunes of the local football teams, the decision of a Hollywood producer not to film part of his next movie in Craters of the Moon National Monument - all of those things attracted more television time and more headlines this week than the local Senate race that could have big national consequences. Maybe that is because almost everyone has made up his or her mind in this little state where most voters know the candidates personally, or at least know someone who knows them personally. All the polls and canvasses show only a tiny fraction of the electorate undecided. So few people remain on the fence, one local political worker said, that ''we ought to forget about media campaigns and take all four of the undecideds out to dinner every night.'' He was joshing, of course; Mr. Evans intends to spend about $2 million, Mr. Symms about $3 million. Those are boggling sums in a state where only about 400,000 people vote in a Presidential election and where fewer than that can be expected to vote this year, despite hotly contested races for Senator, for Governor and for United States Representative in the Second District, to say nothing of a bitterly fought referendum on labor laws. Little Political Upheaval Curiously, there seems to be no real stirring of the political waters, even though everyone is trying. The Democrats talked a lot, early this summer, about an allegation in a book by an aide to former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, to the effect that Mr. Symms had been drunk during a debate on a farm labor bill in 1983. The Republicans have been whispering that Mr. Evans, a Mormon, is insufficiently rigorous in his opposition to drinking, smoking and abortion. The governor has raised money from out-of-state Jewish groups - there are only 1,000 Jews in Idaho - by suggesting that Mr. Symms supports Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya; Blake Hall, the Republican state chairman, characterizes Mr. Evans as ''a Calvin Coolidge look-alike, a man who forever says nothing and does nothing.'' It all seems a very long way from Washington, from the debates on taxes and the Nicaraguan guerrillas and sanctions against South Africa. They talk little about such questions here in Idaho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RELATIVES OF A PRIEST FIGHT PROVIDENCE DIOCESE OVER PLAN TO MOVE REMAINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/us/relatives-of-a-priest-fight-providence-diocese-over-plan-to-move-remains.html,"Near the top of a broad, gently sloping lawn overlooking the sparkle of Narragansett Bay here is the lonely grave of a Roman Catholic priest. It is surrounded by a freshly seeded area from which the bodies of 38 fellow priests and a bishop have in recent weeks been exhumed. The grave of the remaining priest, the Rev. Thomas P. Gilfillan, who died in 1972 after 50 years in several parishes in the Providence area, is now the center of a sharp argument between the Diocese of Providence, which wants to consolidate its cemeteries by moving his grave, and Father Gilfillan's nieces and nephews, who have gone to court to keep the grave where it is. The dispute arises from the shrinking clergy and changing attitudes of Catholic lay people toward the church. In large part, it focuses on how to interpret the wishes of the dead in changing times. Depending on who is to be believed, it also involves money and sex. Father Gilfillan's grave is the last in the Regina Cleri Cemetery, established at Our Lady of Providence Seminary as a way to help unite diocesan priests, who belong to no order. According to his relatives, Father Gilfillan used to joke that he could not count on his family to remember him, and so he had arranged to be buried at the seminary, where students regularly prayed the rosary for those buried on the grounds. The Stone Was Engraved Father Gilfillan paid $200 for the right, representing several months' salary, according to his family. The stone, a granite cross, was one of 100 that were placed in advance, with name, date of birth and date of ordination inscribed. ''He had the funeral arranged five years in advance,'' said James F. Martin, a nephew. But with a shrinking number of recruits for the seminary, the building proved too big. A mostly open 70-acre waterfront parcel near the center of a metropolitan area of a million people, the site has been renamed Our Lady of Providence Center. The facilities are now used for conferences and youth activities. The center is advertised for rent for executive conferences. According to the nieces and nephews, the diocese wants the cemetery closed because it would increase the marketability of the land. ''This is a contradiction to what we've been taught,'' Mr. Martin. ''We can't let this happen for a capital gain.'' 'I Can't See Why They Did This' A niece, Helen Grimshaw, said, ''I can't see why they did this to this man, after he gave 50 years to the church.'' The diocese says there are no plans to sell the parcel, which it received as a donation in 1939, although it acknowledges the land is listed in its records as an ''investment property.'' Local real estate experts call estimates difficult, citing the view down the bay all the way to the Newport Bridge and the imposing stone mansion with mansard roof. The land alone could be worth $6 million to $7 million, according to the head of a real estate office here. In the last few weeks church officials have given several reasons for moving the cemetery. The co-chancellor of the diocese, Msgr. Salvatore R. Matano, said the main reason was that the seminary was gone. ''We want these priests to be interred in a place where it is most conducive for their family and friends to visit them,'' he said. 'No Plans to Sell,' He Says The term ''investment property,'' he said, means ''it is a valuable piece of property.'' ''There are absolutely no plans to sell this piece of property,'' he said. The diocese said in court papers that vandalism was a problem. In addition, another official of the diocese, Msgr. Galliano J. Cavallaro, director of cemeteries, was quoted in The Providence Journal as saying that vandals were also involved in ''sexual behavior'' there. The Warwick Police Chief, John J. Mulhearn, said that ''over the years, there may have been a couple of calls'' about vandalism at the cemetery. The family is also objecting to the way the dead were moved. They were assured in a meeting with Bishop Louis E. Gelineau of Providence that the transfer would be done with ''dignity and prayer,'' according to Mrs. Grimshaw. She said she watched from a distance as a two workers and a supervisor used a backhoe with a chain to lift the other coffins unto a flatbed truck. Monsignor Matano said that a prayer ceremony was planned at one of the eight cemeteries to which the dead were moved, with the consent of heirs or under a court order for those priests whose heirs could not be found. Diocese Having Difficulties The diocese has been having a difficult time lately. In recent months two priests have been found guilty of sexual misconduct with children, while a third was acquitted of sexually assaulting a retarded teen-ager. Bishop Gelineau earlier this year publicly denied rumors that he had been arrested on such charges. In January a priest disclosed on television that the director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island was deemed to have excommunicated herself by acting as an ''accomplice'' in abortions and this draw criticism from some quarters. Father Gilfillan's survivors are proud of the family background and unhappy at developments. A dozen Catholics in their 50's and 60's, all graduates of Catholic schools, they find it strange to be challenging the diocese. Mr. Martin, for example, proudly shows a photo of Father Gilfillan standing on the steps of a church school with 72 relatives, from siblings to grand-nephews and grand-nieces. ''That's so you'll know where we're coming from,'' he said. Years ago, said Mrs. Grimshaw, she and others would have gone along with the wishes of the church. ''But the church was accommodating the people,'' she said. ''It's not accommodating the people today.'' ''The church has given up its leadership to the laity,'' said Mr. Martin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"REVERENCE, IGNORANCE AND BLAZING APATHY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/books/reverence-ignorance-and-blazing-apathy.html,"A MACHINE THAT WOULD GO OF ITSELF The Constitution in American Culture. By Michael Kammen. Illustrated. 532 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $29.95. WHEN Chief Justice Warren E. Burger recently announced that he would step down from the Supreme Court to head the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution beginning next year, irreverent critics assumed that his new position amounted to little more than a sinecure and that his resignation from the Court was deftly timed to enable President Reagan to appoint additional Justices. But sympathy will flow out to Mr. Burger from readers of Michael Kammen's book, ''A Machine That Would Go of Itself.'' They will understand that Mr. Burger's assignment to play schoolmaster to the American people about the significance of their Constitution is a task that will make his oft-complained-of workload crisis on the Court seem trivial. Mr. Kammen, who teaches history at Cornell University and who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, ''People of Paradox: An Inquiry Concerning the Origin of American Civilization'' in 1973, has found in the Constitution his natural subject. It is our most fundamental political document, reverenced by all, the supposed cement of our society, yet it is read by few and understood by fewer still. Whether despite or because of unfamiliarity with its actual provisions, it has also been endlessly, passionately disputed. It has been invoked by states'-right advocates and federalists, by slaveowners and abolitionists, by laissez-faire capitalists and economic regulationists, by segregationists and integrationists. Scarcely 6,000 words long, it has caused the outpouring of barrels of blood in the Civil War (which from one perspective was simply the submission of incompatible interpretations of the Constitution to the arbitrament of arms) and oceans of ink in judicial opinions and learned commentaries. Yet epic constitutional conflict and erudite legal discourse are not Mr. Kammen's principal concerns here. He focuses, rather, on ''popular constitutionalism,'' by which he means ''the perceptions and misperceptions, uses and abuses, knowledge and ignorance of ordinary Americans.'' Along the way he offers capsule histories of the formal commemorations of the Constitution in 1837, 1887 and 1937 - reading that will depress Chief Justice Burger - and authoritatively explores the long tradition of literature comparing the United States Constitution with Britain's unwritten one. From all this a central thesis emerges: that there has been an enormous disjunction between Americans' sacral regard for their Constitution and their bottomless ignorance of it. ''Americans have taken too much pride and proportionately too little interest in their frame of government,'' Mr. Kammen writes. This disparity between reverence and knowledge goes back a long way. Even Thomas Jefferson, who proclaimed in his first inaugural address in 1801 that the Constitution should be ''the text of civil instruction,'' conspicuously failed to include the Constitution in a proposed syllabus he devised in 1824 for the law faculty at the University of Virginia. Mr. Kammen attributes Americans' persistent ignorance of the founding document to several causes. Among them are the Constitution's inherent ambiguities (concerning forms of taxation, for example) and deliberate evasions (most notably about slavery), which inevitably repelled or confounded interested inquirers. The framers' agreement not to publicize the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention for 50 years - a silence broken only in 1840 with the appearance of James Madison's journals - guaranteed that the crucial earliest discussions of their handiwork would be handicapped by the inaccessibility of the context and intention of the Philadelphia debates. The Supreme Court, which might have been expected to play the role of constitutional educator, deliberated for a century or more in darkest obscurity. It discouraged press coverage of its proceedings and public attendance at its sessions. For generations the Court was housed in a remote basement room in the north wing of the Capitol, moving to the old Senate chamber in 1860 when the Capitol was remodeled. Only in 1935 did the third great branch of the Government acquire a separate home of its own atop Capitol Hill. This remoteness sometimes had baleful consequences. The Dred Scott case, in which the Court ruled, among other things, that slaves and their descendants were not entitled to the rights of Federal citizens, was central to the constitutional history of the antebellum period, but the case moved virtually unnoticed for a decade through the court system before it exploded over an unprepared Republic in 1857. The Constitution itself was hidden from public view - the historian John Franklin Jameson found it ''folded up in a little tin box in the lower part of a closet'' in the State Department in 1882 - until President Warren G. Harding at last ordered it displayed, like a eucharistic monstrance meant to command popular adoration, in 1921. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the constitutional jubilee of 1837, the centennial of 1887 and the sesquicentennial of 1937 uniformly sparked blazes of apathy in the American public. Reinforcing this indifference, Mr. Kammen insists, was the deeply imbedded cultural belief, as James Russell Lowell put it in 1888, that the Constitution has been ''a machine that would go of itself,'' a perpetual-motion device so perfectly crafted that it needed no further attention - despite the fact that it has been amended 26 times and that thousands of other amendments have been proposed over the years in Congress. To be sure, toward the end of the 19th century a counter-tradition developed that regarded the nation - as represented by its Constitution - as a ''living thing and not a machine,'' as Woodrow Wilson expressed it; but the view that Lowell described has had an awesome durability, as Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's recent pronouncements on original intent remind us. For whatever reasons, ignorance of the Constitution has been vast. The surreal answers to questions about constitutional knowledge that Mr. Kammen has unearthed in naturalization records would be funny if the condition they bespoke were not so grave: ''Q. In case the President dies during his term of office, who becomes President? ''A. George Washington.'' Native-born citizens have done scarcely better. From 1789 to 1860, no state save California required that the Constitution be taught in schools. In the midst of World War II, nearly 60 percent of respondents to an opinion poll either had never heard of the Bill of Rights or could not identify it correctly. In recent years, Mr. Kammen suggests, popular attention to the Constitution has grown somewhat as questions of constitutional interpretation have touched on sensitive issues like school prayer, busing, abortion and sexual behavior. Constitutional debate has, in fact, evolved through three great phases in the course of American history. It focused on Federal-state relations for the first three-quarters of a century of national existence, until that question was essentially settled by the Civil War. In the ensuing three-quarters of a century, controversy centered on the relation of the Government to the economy, until the 1930's, when the notorious ''switch in time that saved nine,'' ending Franklin D. Roosevelt's Court-packing plan but legitimizing the New Deal, effectively established the Government's right to regulate economic activity. Since World War II, the issues that have preoccupied constitutional discussion have largely involved individual rights. BUT readers curious about the underlying political, economic and social reasons for these shifts will find little explanation here, nor will they find much instruction about the historical background of the current debate over original intent. ''A Machine That Would Go of Itself'' is purposely committed to a survey of sentiments at the grass roots, which may be basic but are not sunk deep. The book, therefore, unavoidably lacks texture and bite. It is more comprehensive than profound, more anecdotal than analytic. Mr. Kammen's characteristically prodigious research seems often to overwhelm him and threatens to stifle the reader, who must track a meandering rivulet of commentary through acres of quotations. Yet as the constitutional bicentennial approaches, ''A Machine That Would Go of Itself'' provides a timely review of past such exercises, and a cogently argued reminder that, as Theodore Roosevelt put it, popular knowledge of the Constitution is the best safeguard against the advances of ''any theory that would make of the Constitution a means of thwarting instead of securing the absolute right of the people to rule themselves and to provide for their own social and industrial well-being.'' GETTING IT WRONG The Constitution is too often neglected or poorly taught. . . . Textbooks have tended to be unclear, superficial, inconsistent, and inaccurate. Take as an example ''The Child's History of the United States From the Earliest Time to the Present Day,'' by one Charles Morris (Philadelphia, 1900). The author devoted a little over four pages (out of 254) to the Constitutional Convention and system of government that it created. Looking only at sins of commission . . . we find John Adams and Thomas Jefferson active at the Convention when, in fact, they were serving in 1787 as our ministers to Great Britain and France, respectively. We also learn that the famous rising sun, utilized by Benjamin Franklin on the Convention's final day as a symbol of the new nation, was painted on a wall rather than (in fact) above the splat on George Washington's Chippendale chair. And strangest of all, we get a picture of Carpenters' Hall, where, we are told, the Convention met. Most people have at least heard of Independence Hall, but not Mr. Morris. His editor and publisher didn't blink an eye, apparently. One wonders whether they read the text? One hopes that few American schoolchildren did.

POLL IN BOSTON PUTS KENNEDY AHEAD OF RIVALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/16/us/poll-in-boston-puts-kennedy-ahead-of-rivals.html,"With support from the elderly, women and blue-collar voters, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d appears to hold a narrow lead over his closest opponent in Tuesday's primary for the Democratic nomination for the House of Representatives. The latest poll, published last week by The Boston Globe, showed the 33-year-old Mr. Kennedy with 39 percent of the vote to 34 percent for his closest rival, George Bachrach, a State Senator. The poll of 605 adults likely to vote in the primary, which was conducted Sept. 2-6, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Closely Watched Contest The battle for the seat being vacated by Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the retiring Speaker of the House, has become the most closely watched in Massachusetts this fall, and since the poll was conducted Mr. Kennedy is widely believed to have built a more solid lead because he was endorsed by Mr. O'Neill, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, and The Globe. Nine other Democrats are vying for the seat, including James Roosevelt, a grandson of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Five other Democrats quit the race for the Eighth Congressional District seat earlier. It was once held by John F. Kennedy, who was Mr. Kennedy's uncle, and before that by James Michael Curley. The race has also emerged as one of national importance, as a clash between the Democratic Party's longtime base among the working class and its liberal component. In another Massachusetts contest, one that aroused more confusion than interest, the primary for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, the two names on the ballot belong to candidates who quit after questions were raised about their integrity but missed the deadline for getting off the ballot had passed. The name of the Republican candidate who is, in fact, running for the nomination, George S. Kariotis, a wealthy executive in the high technology industry, is not on the ballot. If Mr. Kariotis's low-key write-in campaign is unsuccessful, he must wait for the winner of the Republican primary to formally withdraw before he can be selected by the Republican State Committee. Both of the other candidates, Gregory S. Hyatt, and State Representative Royall Switzler, have said they would withdraw if victorious. Mr. Kariotis, who has raised only $55,000, according to his campaign manager, must then face Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the two-term Democratic incumbent. With unemployment in Massachusetts under 4 percent and the state's economy booming, Mr. Dukakis has drawn favorability ratings of 70 percent in some polls. The race for Mr. O'Neill's district has already become the most expensive for any office in Massachusetts' history, with the candidates spending a total of more than $3.2 million, and one of the most costly ever in the country for a House seat. Mr. Kennedy, the son of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, has spent over $1 million, more than twice as much as Mr. Bachrach. Democratic Split in Boston The Eighth Congressional District is one of the most heavily Democratic in the country, with 62 percent of its 522,000 registered voters enrolled as Democrats. But, reflecting the split in the Democratic Party nationally, they include both voters in working-class neighborhoods such as East Boston and Somerville, and affluent liberal professionals in Cambridge and Boston's Back Bay. Mr. Kennedy has relied heavily on his family name, while stressing that with his connections in Washington, he could do a better job for constituents than Mr. Bachrach, 34, a maverick liberal who has clashed often with leaders of the State Senate. ''I've always been a Kennedy voter - I like the way the family help each other,'' said Gladys Yont, 75. of Waltham. Mrs. Yont, who was attending a Kennedy rally for the Waltham Golden Age Club in the basement of St. Joseph's Church, said she was particularly moved by a letter from Ethel Kennedy, the candidate's mother. ''It was in her own handwriting and she was telling that all the stories about Joe being irresponsible were untrue,'' Mrs. Yont related. ''She said that after Bobby was shot, Joe looked after his brothers and sisters.'' Mr. Kennedy, president of Citizens Energy, which provides low-cost heating oil, had academic troubles when he was younger. In 1973, he was convicted of reckless driving and fined $100 after a vehicular accident on Nantucket left a girl near death and permanently paralyzed below the waist. In campaign appearances, perhaps in a concession to his working-class supporters, Mr. Kennedy has said he favors the death penalty, because of the assassination of his father, and ''reluctantly'' favors a woman's right to choose abortion. Mr. Bachrach has criticized Mr. Kennedy as talking too much about ''bringing home the bacon'' and not enough about the morality of such issues as arms control and aid for the rebels in Nicaragua. Last week Mr. Bachrach charged that Mr. Kennedy's oil company has done business with Libyan banks, Mr. Kennedy said he would never do business with Libya. ''Libya offered asylum to Sirhan Sirhan after he killed my father.'' Mr. Kennedy recalled. 2 FAVORED IN WASHINGTON STATE By The Associated Press In Washington state, Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican, and Brock Adams, a former Transportation Secretary, a Democrat, are favored to win their Senate primaries Tuesday.

OUR TOWNS; CATHOLIC CONNECTICUT YANKEE WHO HEADS THE KLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/16/nyregion/our-towns-catholic-connecticut-yankee-who-heads-the-klan.html,"In the two weeks since he was elected the top Ku Klux Klansman in the nation, James Farrands, a tool-and-die machinist, has been bustling about, recruiting prospective members, ordering his new imperial wizard's robe, handling mail requests for Klan T-shirts, and granting interviews to reporters from all over the world. From the new national Klan headquarters in his garage, the imperial wizard must carry on the Klan's white-supremacist philosophy as well as sell Klan knickknacks to raise money. ''Say a member wants a pair of Klan earrings,'' Mr. Farrands explained. ''Who do you think has to put in the order with the manufacturer? The imperial wizard.'' For the first time in its 120-year history, the leader of the Klan is a Northerner. The new imperial wizard lives in a well-maintained brick-and-shingle house along a quiet, attractive middle-class street in this northeastern Fairfield County suburb. He conducts Klan business out of a room about the size of a walk-in closet. ''Wherever the imperial wizard lives, that's the national headquarters,'' Mr. Farrands said. Visitors to the imperial wizard are frisked. During interviews, an assistant holding a shotgun sits behind a reporter. ''It's a royal pain sometimes,'' the imperial wizard said. ''I'm the one who has to do the cross lightings and everything. I have to edit the newspaper. There's a lot to it.'' ''You know, imperial wizard is an unpaid job,'' he said. ''But if there's anything legal, I have to show up in court. Granted, the Civil Liberties Union helps us, but I have to be there.'' And the paperwork? ''I hate getting these handwritten letters from Klansmen,'' Mr. Farrands said. ''I can't read their writing. I'm an advocate of Klansmen typing everything.'' On top of this, his new blue imperial wizard's robe has yet to arrive. ''I sent a signed blank check to the robe manufacturer,'' he said. ''I wrote, 'I don't know what the imperial wizard's robe costs, you fill it in.' '' In the meantime, Mr. Farrands has been wearing dress whites. ''Is this straight?'' he asked, putting on his white cone hat. His assistant, who would not give his name, felt the cone looked droopy, so Mr. Farrands adjusted the muslin lining that holds the point up. ''As wizard, I'm going to change the lining; this muslin is uncomfortable on your head,'' he said, putting the cone hat on again. ''Much better,'' his assistant said. Mr. Farrands is the first Roman Catholic imperial wizard. He said that since John F. Kennedy's Presidency, Catholics have been admitted to the Klan. ''If a Catholic could be President, then he could join the Klan,'' Mr. Farrands said. He was asked if this meant that if a Jew became President, Jews could join. ''A ticklish question,'' Mr. Farrands said. ''A very ticklish question. We don't take Jews. They're not Christians.'' And if a black Christian became President? ''Come on,'' the imperial wizard said, rolling his eyes. ''There'll never be a black President.'' To people who say the Klan spreads hate, the new imperial wizard had this answer: ''Hate? We're trying to spread love. Love for Christians. Love for white people. Love for the Holy Bible. Oh heck, I love the colored people. I love the ones in the South more than the North. Why? Because they're farther away. Ha-ha!'' Mr. Farrands was elected imperial wizard at a recent national convention described in a Klan newsletter as ''one of the most glorious and entertaining in the history of the Invisible Empire.'' The Connecticut state police say 40 Klansmen attended; Mr. Farrands says it was more like 75. The police estimate there are 5,000 in the Klan nationally, and 15 in Connecticut. ''Most of the Klan in Connecticut are members of Jim Farrands's family,'' said a state police spokesman, Edward Dailey. The imperial wizard refused to discuss membership figures. ''How many?'' he said. ''I have no idea.'' The state police say they have not had trouble from Klan members here. Neighbors say Mr. Farrands has lived quietly among them, attracting little notice except once, a few years back, when he was dismissed as leader of Shelton Boy Scout Troop 88 because of his Klan membership. Mr. Farrands said his wife and five children have always been supportive. His children sell hot dogs at Klan rallies and his wife is pleased about his election, despite all the demands on an imperial wizard's time. ''This sort of elevates her to imperial status, too,'' he said. Mr. Farrands said that as imperial wizard he would improve the screening of new members, and this afternoon, he spent considerable time on the phone talking to a man from Minnesota interested in joining. The imperial wizard explained a little about the Klan - ''We want the white man to run this country,'' he said - and promised to put the caller in touch with a nearby Klansman. ''Are you at all near Indiana?'' he asked. ''Illinois? O.K. Let's see, we have a good grand dragon in Kentucky.'' He questioned the caller about his beliefs. ''We'll give you temporary status,'' Mr. Farrands said finally. ''Would you help us organize that area? You understand, that's not exactly Klan territory.'' After hanging up, Mr. Farrands seemed pleased. ''He was against drugs, abortion and queers,'' the imperial wizard said. ''He seemed to be quite normal.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 WOMEN IN A CLOSE NEBRASKA RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/16/us/2-women-in-a-close-nebraska-race.html,"Midway through a speech to rally the troops, Kay Orr, the Republican candidate for Governor, paused to acknowledge her spouse. ''And now I'd like to introduce a very important partner in all of this - Mr. Kay Orr,'' she said. William Orr, an insurance executive, took his place with the smiling forbearance perfected by generations of political wives. Nebraskans have grown accustomed to such good-natured role reversals in recent weeks, as the nation's first gubernatorial contest between two women has gathered steam. The race pits Mrs. Orr, the State Treasurer, against Helen Boosalis, a Democrat who is the former Mayor of Lincoln. It is considered one of the closest gubernatorial races in the country. For some analysts and activists, the Nebraska election has become a symbol of women's political progress in a year when women who are candidates could make significant gains in races for governor, United States Senator and other major offices. The change came quietly here in the heartland; indeed, many Nebraskans seem somewhat bemused by the sudden national attention. Political leaders say voters made history by happenstance in the May 13th primary, which was wide open in both parties after Gov. Robert Kerrey, a Democrat, chose not to seek re-election. 'Strong, Capable Women' ''It just so happened that both parties had strong, capable women,'' said Brian Coyne, executive director of the Nebraska Democratic Party. ''They did not come out of a feminist tradition. They both could be considered party regulars who worked their way up the ladder.'' Indeed, while the race may be making feminist history, it has not become a feminist crusade. The National Organization for Women, the National Women's Political Caucus and the Women's Campaign Fund are staying out of the race, because both candidates oppose abortion. Most of the debate here concerns problems endemic in the Middle West, chiefly the troubled farming sector and the need for jobs and economic development. What are often considered ''women's issues,'' such as abortion, have stayed largely in the background. Both candidates are well-known players on the state's political scene who first entered politics as volunteers. Mrs. Boosalis, a diminutive, high-energy woman who can politick a parade route at lightning speed, was active in the League of Women Voters when she decided to run for the Lincoln City Council in the late 1950's. She thus launched a political career, serving 16 years on the council, then two terms as Mayor of Lincoln, a position she held from 1975 to 1983. In that period, she became president of the United States Conference of Mayors. Most recently, she was director of the Nebraska Department of Aging. Critic of Federal Farm Policy Mrs. Boosalis, who is 67 years old, is a harsh critic of Federal farm policy. ''If Washington had planned to destroy agriculture, it couldn't have been doing a better job here in the Midwest,'' she says. She argues that her long experience in government has left her well equipped to tackle such challenges. ''I don't just talk economic development, I've done it,'' she says. Mrs. Orr, 47, was a longtime Republican activist who became chief of staff under former Gov. Charles Thone, and was elected State Treasurer in 1982. She has long supported President Reagan, leading his campaign effort in Nebraska in 1976. Unlike other farm state Republicans running for office this year, she has not attempted to distance herself from the President. Later this month, in fact, the President will come to Nebraska to campaign on her behalf. ''People in this state have some real concerns about the '85 farm bill,'' Mrs. Orr said. ''But they want to find answers. They're not looking for someone to blame.'' In recent weeks, Mrs. Orr has portrayed Mrs. Boosalis as a Democrat committed to increased taxing and spending, charges that Mrs. Boosalis has angrily denied. An Omaha World-Herald poll this weekend indicated that Mrs. Orr was moving ahead in the race, which was dead-even in earlier polls. The Republicans have the edge in voter registration in Nebraska, and President Reagan carried the state by 71 percent in 1984, but the Democrats currently hold the governorship and both Senate seats. Mrs. Orr gives credit to the feminist movement for awakening her and other women to new roles and possibilities. She does not, however, support an equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution, a top goal of feminist groups, and she is opposed to legalized abortion in all instances. Stand on Abortion Mrs. Boosalis supported the amendment, but said she was personally opposed to abortion except in the case of rape, incest or to save a mother's life. She said she had hoped to get the support of some of the women's groups, ''simply because I have been such a strong advocate on women's issues.'' But she said she recognized that abortion had become a ''litmus test'' for some of those organizations. Irene Natividad, head of the National Women's Political Caucus, said, ''Much as we take pride in the race, we are not endorsing either one of them.'' In Nebraska, meanwhile, the political evolution evidenced by the race between the two women seems as natural as the change of season. Mrs. Boosalis marched Sunday night in the Cass County corn carnival parade, held in the town of Plattsmouth. With its Victorian facades and its red-brick courthouse, Plattsmouth seemed the epitome of the enduring small town of the Middle West. Evelyn Morris, a retired librarian, watched Mrs. Boosalis campaign her way up the street. And Mrs. Morris said she thought that a gubernatorial contest between two women was grand. ''As a woman, I think it's just wonderful,'' said Mrs. Morris, who is 70 years old. ''I'm a women's libber from way back.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Senate Rejects a House Plan To Limit Abortions in Capital,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/17/us/senate-rejects-a-house-plan-to-limit-abortions-in-capital.html,"The Senate today rejected sharp restrictions on government payment for abortions in the District of Columbia, despite charges that the city has become ''the abortion capital of the world.'' The Senate voted 48 to 42 against language in a bill passed by the House that would have allowed such payments only for women whose lives would be endangered by their pregnancies. The House language would have prevented the district from using its own money or Federal funds to pay for abortions for any other reason. Left standing in the Senate bill was the current law, which permits the District to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest, as well as in pregnancies endangering the life of the mother. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, led the fight for the restrictive anti-abortion language.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MADONNA'S NEW BEAT IS A HIT, BUT SONG'S MESSAGE RANKLES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/18/nyregion/madonna-s-new-beat-is-a-hit-but-song-s-message-rankles.html,"Madonna's new song ''Papa Don't Preach'' hit the top of the pop charts a few weeks ago and all around the city her voice is heard, singing of adolescent pregnancy. It drifted through Kathie Peters's headphones on a recent afternoon as she made her way to a pizza parlor in Queens, and the 18-year-old broke into a sidewalk boogie: ''Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby.. . .'' Later that day, she took part in a ''sexuality rap session'' at an adolescent services center in Manhattan, The Door, at 618 Avenue of the Americas at 18th Street. When a social worker leading the group mentioned ''Papa Don't Preach,'' Kathie Peters shook her head and said: ''Too many kids are getting pregnant. They don't know what they're getting into. I don't like the message.'' ''But,'' she added with a sheepish smile, ''I do like the beat.'' Many young people like the beat. The song is the second single from Madonna's third album, ''True Blue,'' currently one of the best-selling records in the United States. In the popular video, the rock star portrays a pregnant teen-ager who begs her father to bless her decision to keep the baby. Song Gets Criticism and Support As its popularity has increased, so has the criticism and support the song has received from groups concerned with pregnancy and abortion. ''The message,'' said the executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City, Alfred Moran, ''is that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don't listen to your parents, the school, anybody who tells you otherwise -don't preach to me, Papa. The reality is that what Madonna is suggesting to teen-agers is a path to permanent poverty.'' However, groups opposed to abortion see ''Papa Don't Preach'' as a positive, ''pro-life'' song. ''Abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women,'' said the president of the California chapter of Feminists for Life in America, Susan Carpenter-McMillan. ''Now what Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative.'' Lace Gloves and Rosaries Mr. Moran remembers how his agency's clinics were filled last year with girls wearing fingerless lace gloves and rosaries around their necks, in imitation of Madonna's fashion style. ''Everybody I've talked to believes she has more impact on young teen-agers than any other single entertainer since the Beatles,'' Mr. Moran said. ''That's what makes this particular song so destructive.'' Mr. Moran and others in the family planning field fear that the song will undermine their efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it will encourage teen-age pregnancy. More than a million American teen-agers become pregnant each year, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based national research organization. A campaign to discourage teen-age pregnancy began earlier this week, from the Mayor's Office of Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting Services. Subway posters, television and radio spots will carry the slogan ''Be Smart About Sex,'' and L.L. Cool J., a rap artist, has recorded a ''Smart Sex Rap'' for radio. ''We're using the same medium to put across a very different message about being smart and avoiding teen-aged pregnancy,'' said Alice Radosh, the office's coordinator. ''The timing of the Madonna song concerns us.'' Mr. Moran said his Planned Parenthood chapter is sending a ''critical memo'' to radio and television stations in the metropolitan area urging them to ''think carefully about playing this song to young audiences.'' He added that his chapter is asking Warner Brothers Records, the parent company of Madonna's label, to donate at least 25 percent of earnings from the song to programs that promote responsible sexual behavior. Teen-Agers React Positively Teen-agers do react positively to the song, said Ms. Carpenter-McMillan, who recently took a television crew to a Los Angeles maternity home where she played the music video for an audience of teen-agers. ''These were young girls, 14, 15, 16, living through tough times, going against parents and boyfriends,'' she said. ''Knowing someone like Madonna is in their corner, saying, 'All right! Go for it!' was so uplifting.'' For the most part, Madonna has avoided the debate. The singer will not comment on the song's use as an anti-abortion statement, according to a spokesman, Liz Rosenberg. ''She's singing a song, not taking a stand,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''Her philosophy is people can think what they want to think.'' Shortly before the record's release, however, in an interview with a New York Times music critic, Stephen Holden, Madonna described it as ''a message song that everyone is going to take the wrong way'' and predicted she would be accused of ''advising every young girl to go out and get pregnant.'' The song, written by Brian Elliot, with minor lyrical revisions by the singer, tells of ''a girl who is making a major decision in her life,'' Madonna said in the interview. ''To me, it's a celebration of life.'' In Washington, Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center - a group that a year ago spurred Congressional hearings on the issue of sex and violence in rock music lyrics and has criticized Madonna's songs in the past - has spoken out in favor of ''Papa Don't Preach.'' ''To me,'' Mrs. Gore said, ''the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in familiies about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud.'' Papa Don't Preach Papa I know you're going to be upset 'Cause I was always your little girl But you should know by now I'm not a baby You always taught me right from wrong I need your help, daddy please be strong I may be young at heart But I know what I'm saying The one you warned me all about The one you said I could do without We're in an awful mess And I don't mean maybe -- please Chorus: Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm... He says that he's going to marry me We can raise a little family Maybe we'll be all right It's a sacrifice But my friends keep telling me to give it up Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up What I need right now is some good advice, please Chorus Daddy, daddy if you could only see Just how good he's been treating me You'd give us your blessing right now 'Cause we are in love We are in love, so please Chorus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"STEVENSON, WORN BY HIS TROUBLED CAMPAIGN, PREDICTS A SURPRISE: VICTORY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/19/us/stevenson-worn-by-his-troubled-campaign-predicts-a-surprise-victory.html,"Adlai E. Stevenson 3d says that he is going to make it, that he is going to surprise ''the big metro newspapers'' he accuses of ''pounding'' him, that his ''campaign for political rehabilitation'' will pay off and he will be elected Governor in November. He looks wan and sounds a bit spiritless as he makes his predictions, seated in his little law office in the Loop, one leg propped on his desk, a large portrait of the young Lincoln on the wall behind him, and a smaller picture of his father, the two-time Democratic Presidential nominee, at his elbow. It has been a long, cruel summer, and it has clearly taken a toll. ''We were really soaring, going into that primary,'' he said, recalling his mood before the voting last March. ''We were going to have a dream ticket, set records for victory margins. Then we got bushwhacked. Oh, did we ever!'' A wry, introspective man, never given to glad-handing, Mr. Stevenson ignored the candidates challenging his hand-picked choices for Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State. The voters did not, and, in a thin turnout, two followers of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. were selected as his running mates. Mr. Stevenson would not have it, would not run on a ticket with people who consider the Queen of England a drug pusher and talk about the colonization of Mars. Which is how a politician, whose great-grandfather was a Democratic Vice President of the United States, whose father stirred the nation with his eloquence even as it twice rejected him and chose Dwight D. Eisenhower -how such a man comes to be running for Governor of Illinois not as a Democrat but as the candidate of the Solidarity Party, which he was forced to invent on the spur of the moment. Senate Career Not for Him What, one might ask, is Adlai Stevenson doing running for Governor anyway? He spent 10 years in the Senate, and he probably could have added a dozen more without much trouble; when he quit in 1980, a little-known state official, Alan J. Dixon, held the seat for the Democrats with ease. The answer is that Mr. Stevenson never much wanted to be a Senator. He ran because he could not get the state Democratic Party, then controlled by Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago, to nominate him for Governor in 1968. He did not like Washington much, although he said he ''might have stayed had I seen any opportunity to work with a President with whom I was comfortable.'' But he didn't. He decided that he still wanted, as he says, ''the reins in my hands,'' so he ran for Governor in 1982, losing, by 5,000 votes out of more than 3.5 million cast, to James R. Thompson, a Republican who has now served 10 years in Springfield. It was the closest contest for the Illinois governorship in a century and a half. Mr. Thompson, whose victory last time owed much to his picturing of Mr. Stevenson as a ''wimp'' - the word was used constantly - is again the Republican nominee. The polls and the conventional wisdom among Chicago's hyperactive politicians say the same thing: he is vulnerable after so many years in office, and he just might be beaten. But a poll taken for The Chicago Sun-Times early this month showed the Governor 26 points ahead, and another taken for several Democratic candidates late last month showed him 15 points ahead. It is not easy to generate much enthusiasm or raise much money with deficits like that staring out at you from newspaper headlines day after day. Mr. Stevenson is enraged by the polls, not least because they make it even harder to raise money. Rummaging furiously through piles of paper on his desk, he denounced polls, and especially that of The Sun-Times, as ''a plague,'' and after a minute or two held up in triumph Exhibit A in his case against opinion surveys. It was the final Sun-Times poll of 1982, published less than a week before Election Day, showing Mr. Thompson 15 points ahead. Mr. Stevenson thinks it may have cost him victory. But the former Senator has not made things easy for himself. He fell off a horse while campaigning, breaking some bones in his foot and taking himself out of circulation for a time. In a state whose manufacturing base has been hit hard by imports, he left himself open to criticism by driving a Japanese truck on his farm, then defended himself by saying he bought it to save money but would not have done so had he known he would run for Governor. 'Colorful, but Not Sexist' And then, this week, he said in an interview with a Chicago business magazine that Governor Thompson was so incapable of saying no that ''if he were a female, he'd be pregnant constantly.'' Women in politics, including feminists and others, howled in protest. Given the chance, Mr. Stevenson refused to apologize, asserting in a television interview, ''The statement is colorful, but it's not sexist.'' He said he was proud of his record on abortion and other ''women's issues.'' Mr. Stevenson has been hammering away at the Governor for huge excess costs on the State of Illinois Center in Chicago, accusing him of failing to arrest the state's economic decline and of ''wheeling and dealing.'' He said the other day, ''Jim Thompson is everything that has gone wrong in this state.'' Leaner than he was in the Senate, almost hawklike in profile now, Mr. Stevenson, who will be 67 years old on Sept. 27, knows this is his last chance in politics. He has worked hard to unite behind his effort a fractious Democratic party that has no candidate for Governor of its own, and he now has the support, at least theoretically, of both Mayor Harold Washington and his archrival, Edward Vrdolyak, the Cook County party leader, as well as both Senators and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Dan Rostenkowski. Problem at the Voting Booths Mr. Stevenson is widely believed, at least by the professionals, to have bested the Governor in the first of several debates. His television commercials are snappier than in 1982. One shows the legs of a tap-dancer in front of a door labeled ''Office of the Governor,'' with an announcer saying, ''When it comes to song and dance, nobody's better than Jim Thompson.'' But the commercials are off the air for the moment, and it is not certain when they will come back on. Mr. Stevenson has raised and spent only $900,000, not enough in a state of this size; he needs at least that much again to do well. ''I pay a high price for my virtue,'' he said with only a trace of irony. Even if he does raise the money, he may find it difficult to mobilize all his potential support. In a political culture where straight-ticket voting is a way of life, he must persuade hundreds of thousands of people to vote Democratic for most offices, then punch their ballots again to chose the Solidarity candidate for Governor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TRAVAILS OF THE LONG ISLAND MAID,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/nyregion/travails-of-the-long-island-maid.html,"INEZ, who is from Ecuador, Yvonne, from Jamaica, and Martes, from Barbados, wait for the same 4 o'clock train on Friday afternoons at the Syosset railroad station. They are three of the thousands of live-in housekeepers who are dropped off at stations throughout Long Island every week to spend the weekend with their families in New York City. Although Inez, who is 34 years old, misses her four children in Ecuador, she says she is grateful for the $150 she earns each week. A housekeeper in Ecuador earns $50 a month. Inez already has a green card, which means she has permanent-residence status in the United States. She likes the people she works for and says they treat her like a sister. Yvonne, 26, and Martes, 29, on the other hand, are not so happy about their work. They are undocumented illegal aliens who came on six-month visitor's visas and simply stayed when the visas ran out. Although each of them has been here for more than three years, neither has become a permanent resident. The process takes about two and a half years, during which time the sponsor may withdraw from the process for any reason. Without sponsors, they are subject to arrest and deportation. ''I'm sorry I came here, and if I don't get it I don't care,'' Yvonne said of the green card. ''I refuse to iron a man's underwear, and I'm not allowed to eat with the rest of the family. When they have company I'm not allowed to walk through the house. Is that any way to live?'' Martes (none of the women's names are real) talks about the $170 check a former employer in Old Westbury gave her that bounced, and tells the story of a friend who became pregnant with a fifth child when she was almost two years into her sponsorship with the people she was working for. ''They told her to get an abortion,'' Martes said, ''otherwise she couldn't work for them anymore.'' Her friend refused, had the baby and is looking for another sponsor to work for. Robert and Luba Schuster, owners of the Windsor Employment Agency in Great Neck for 30 years, estimate that more than half of the live-in housekeepers working on Long Island are illegal aliens, like Yvonne and Martes. Most of them are women from Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados - who are in demand because they speak English - and El Salvadorans, Nicaraguans and Ecuadorans, who are increasing in numbers because of the turmoil in their countries. The Schusters estimate that there are about 2,000 live-in housekeepers working in Great Neck, and as many as 25,000 or more on Long Island -mostly in the affluent North Shore communities between Great Neck and Woodbury, and on the South Shore in Hewlett, Woodmere, Cedarhurst, Lawrence and Hewlett Harbor. The Windsor agency receives about 300 requests for live-in help a week, but it is able to fill only about 60 of them because of the shortage of housekeepers. One out of three that the Schusters find jobs for either quit or are dismissed within the first two weeks of employment. The employers are generally middle- to high-income couples where the husband is the sole source of income, or where the husband and wife are both working professionals, or one-parent households with children. While the first group still constitutes a majority of those employing live-in help, the other two have become more prevalent in recent years. ''The demand for live-in help is much greater than the supply,'' said Robert Schuster, ''especially with so many couples both working. Americans find these jobs distasteful, which makes it hard to fill the demand for more live-in help.'' Since there is no law prohibiting an American from hiring an illegal alien, the Schusters and other agents say, many illegal aliens find work as housekeepers. The usual hiring scenario goes like this: A woman whose visitor visa has expired gets hired through an agency by a family willing to sponsor her. Although the housekeeper continues to work for the employer during the entire process, she must obtain a labor-certification certificate from the United States Department of Labor before she can apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for permanent residence. The Labor Department asks for proof that the employer has advertised in a newspaper for the position at least three times in six months prior to the date of the application. If no American citizen wants the job, the certificate is issued. Housekeepers constitute the single largest group of applicants for certification, according to Bette Roy, the director of the Labor Department certification division in Manhattan, which covers New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Immigration attorneys usually handle the application process, for about $2,000. Some employers offer to pay the legal fees for their housekeepers in exchange for future services, while others pay part of it or none at all. According to Charles A. Grutman, a Long Island lawyer who has handled hundreds of these applications and is chairman of the Nassau County Bar Association's committee on immigration law, the labor certification is then filed when the Immigration Service along with a petition for permanent residence, called an I-140 form. The petitioner - the employer -''has to show that they can afford to hire an alien and that they have a business necessity for having the live-in requirement,'' Mr. Grutman said, ''so it's not enough that Mrs. Jones in the suburbs wants to have a live-in housekeeper. ''Because, let's say what she does all day is sit around the pool, and she has two minor children,'' he went on. ''I.N.S. will say that's very nice, Mrs. Jones. That's a good reason for having a housekeeper during the day, but not a good reason for having a live-in housekeeper at night.'' ''The usual reason, and there are many,'' Mr. Grutman added, ''is that both husband and wife work, and their hours are such that they cannot know when they will be home on a regular basis. And there must be someone home to take care of the children. Otherwise the wife or husband would not be able to work.'' Once the employer's ability to pay and the need for live-in help is established, the Immigration Service issues written approval to the employer to hire the housekeeper, who now, according to the Immigration Act of 1978, must return to her country of origin to pick up her green card. Although the return trip home to get the card goes swiftly for most, Mr. Grutman said that the process is sometimes complicated by rivalry between American counsels - who work for the State Department and who must approve the application in the applicant's country of origin - and the Immigration Service - part of the Department of Justice - which issues the green card when the applicant returns to the United States. ''The State Department has their own requirements for permanent residence,'' Mr. Grutman said, ''and until they are convinced of the bona fides of the job, the applicant may be held there for days, weeks, months and in some cases even years.'' As the system now operates, it has become impossible for employment agencies and attorneys to supply enough housekeepers to meet the needs of Long Island's affluent households. The Government seems unconvinced that speeding up the naturalization process and permitting more foreigners to enter would solve the problem. ''If you let in more,'' said Bette Roy, ''what are they going to do once they get here? Once they get their permanent residence, are they going to stay as domestics? And if not, what have you solved?'' Owners of employment agencies, like the Schusters and other members of the Household Agencies and Nurses Registries Association, an organization of agencies based in New York, have been asking why temporary working visas for housekeepers should not be issued by the Government to ease the shortage. But while the Government seems to approve, the lawyers for the housekeepers are vehemently against such a proposal because, they say, it would create a slave caste system. ''What would you do with a person who lived and worked here for five years and had a child here?'' Mr. Grutman said. ''Would you say: Sorry, you have to go home. There's no place in America for you.'' Ms. Roy sees no solution in the near future. ''We need the domestics,'' she said, ''but I don't know that it's a long-run solution bringing in aliens for the job.'' Caught in the crossfire, the housekeepers have opinions of the system that vary according to the way the families they work for treat them. Those who are treated fairly usually move on to permanent residence and better jobs. Those who are not jump from job to job, enter a different field or return home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A DISCUSSION: THE CONSTITUTION AND THE NEW CHIEF JUSTICE; THE REHNQUIST COURT STILL SEEMS AN APPOINTMENT AWAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/weekinreview/discussion-constitution-new-chief-justice-rehnquist-court-still-seems.html,"THE Constitution turned 199 Wednesday, the same day the Rehnquist Court became a certainty. How the latter will treat the former has been, of course, a matter of intense speculation. Last weekend, just before the Senate confirmed Justice William H. Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States and Antonin Scalia as an Associate Justice, three leading constitutional scholars discussed the Supreme Court's last term under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, then turned to forecasting. Dean Jesse Choper of the University of California at Berkeley Law School, Prof. Yale Kamisar of the University of Michigan Law School and Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School spoke at a conference sponsored by the Bureau of National Affairs, which publishes legal and business periodicals. Their discussion was moderated by Fred Graham, law correspondent for CBS News. Excerpts follow. Question. This, after all, is going to be the Rehnquist Court. So I ask Professor Choper, why have you said that it doesn't really make any difference? Dean Choper. Well, what you have is really a Scalia-for-Burger substitution. Let's forget about Justice Rehnquist because he has one vote, whether or not he is Chief Justice. If one wanted to make a scientific inquiry, one would take every 5-to-4 decision of any significance since, let's say, Justice O'Connor came on, and say, where would a vote to the right of Chief Justice Burger's - and I think that is, if there's going to be any difference, where Judge Scalia is going to be - where would such a vote make a difference? And I just don't think that there are any significant constitutional decisions in which you'd get a different result. Professor Tribe. Jesse Choper puts it in terms of how a scientist would look at it. Maybe that's how a botanist would look at it - you count the branches of the tree. But I think the whole is very much more than, and different from, the sum of its parts. These are not robots who are being sent into a room pre-programmed with clear answers. By and large, especially in the difficult areas of federalism and individual rights, the Justices don't know entirely what they think. They are open to reason and to persuasion, both from the podium in front of the Court and, even more important, within the conference room, and the chemistry of the Court makes a far greater difference than a nose count alone would indicate. Now, without meaning to be disrespectful to the former Chief Justice, it seems very unlikely that he would have persuaded many people in recent years within the conference. I do not think the same could be said of Judge Scalia. He is a persuasive, thoughtful, intriguing, interesting advocate. In many of the areas where the Court appears not to be closely divided, it would not seem unlikely that Judge Scalia, especially once he has found his footing, will make a bigger difference than Jesse Choper suggests. I think the intellectually dynamic Rehnquist-Scalia duo will make differences dramatically beyond those that some have predicted. Those differences will begin to be felt this year, but they will be dramatically felt the moment there is another opening on the Court. Professor Kamisar. I guess if you're being paid enormous fees to argue cases in the Supreme Court, you'd like to think the Justices are open to reason. I couldn't resist that. I agree with Larry that the impact of Rehnquist and Scalia will be much greater on the next Justice. I have a hard time thinking Scalia can tell Justice Blackmun much about abortion or Justice White much about anything. On the other hand, there's something about fresh troops coming on. Just as John Paul Stevens made Brennan and Marshall feel a little younger, a little less isolated, perhaps O'Connor did the same for Rehnquist. One More Conservative Q. I think it's your view that if President Reagan gets one more appointment the abortion decision will swing around. If so, to what extent, and what other cases might swing around? Professor Kamisar. I think if he had one more solid Rehnquist-type vote, the exclusionary rule - the rule barring evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment - would be in deep trouble, and so would Miranda. Keep in mind that the so-called Warren Court didn't really take off until Justice Goldberg went on the Court in '62 - he was replaced by Fortas in '65. Until then, for years and years Warren, Black, Douglas and Brennan were one vote short. They were dissenting most of the time and suddenly they got that fifth vote and took off. I think now we may be about one vote away. Dean Choper. I think if you do get another very conservative appointment, it is going to make a big difference wholly apart from the power of persuasion that Justice Scalia would have. But I think it is not clear that the abortion decision - Roe v. Wade - would be overturned with a substitution for Powell, Brennan, Blackmun, Stevens or Marshall. Justice O'Connor continues to say, or at least suggests very strongly, that she would stand behind the core of Roe v. Wade. Professor Tribe. She's been enigmatic about that. I think it's wrong to count her as a clear vote to overrule Roe, but I also think she never clearly put herself behind Roe. Those who think it would be easy to overrule Roe v. Wade haven't thought very hard about how deeply that decision is woven into the fabric of related areas of law - family privacy, contraception and the like. Q. One of the points that has been made is that, whether or not the Court really changes, there will be, as Senator Bill Bradley said, a ''cloud on the Court'' because a perception will be created among the public that it no longer stands for the protection of individual rights. To what extent do you think that will be true? Professor Tribe. Justice Rehnquist is a pleasant enough fellow that most of his fellow Justices wouldn't think of his movement to the center seat as casting a shadow on the Court, even when they disagree with him. I think that whether his movement to the center seat operates to alienate and threaten oppressed, dispossessed, disadvantaged and dissenting groups depends very much on whether he is large enough to fill the shoes that he's being required to fill. I do think there is the possibility that Justice Rehnquist will recognize that on some areas - where, as Senator Biden has put it so eloquently, though Justice Rehnquist has made elegant arguments, they have been deeply insensitive to the rights of individuals and minorities - in some areas growing up a little and broadening his vision a little will enable him to leave a more enduring mark. Professor Kamisar. The Washington Post said in an editorial that ''a vote to confirm Rehnquist in a higher office seems to us to be a vote of confidence in his approach to the law and the Constitution.'' I think that's completely wrong. I think the vote was in many cases despite the fact people don't like his approach to the law, and simply because they think the President has that much leeway. But I agree that he will probably become or seem more moderate. You know, his clerks called him the Lone Ranger, and for years he really was quite isolated, and he took positions that were incredible. I just think that he no longer will do that, and that the responsibility of being Chief Justice will make him seem, at least, a good deal more reasonable than he has in the past. Professor Tribe. We may even have gotten a glimpse of that last term. It was not long prior to his nomination that he authored the Court's opinion in the Meritor Bank case - a landmark sex harassment case in which Judge Scalia in the D.C. Circuit had gone the other way. I don't know for sure that three years ago Justice Rehnquist would have authored a long dissent in a case like that, but I think it's likely. Dean Choper. I would be very doubtful that he is going to change his basic point of view. Rather, I think that it is possible that we will see fewer lone dissents. Beyond that, there is a certain irony in charging that Rehnquist does not represent the views of the country when it was essentially those views that Ronald Reagan campaigned on. I don't want to take a second seat to anyone when it comes to the question of the independence of the judiciary, but I do think that to the extent that politics and philosophy have a role to play so far as the judiciary is concerned, the role it has to play is in the appointments process. I was somewhat disappointed in the senatorial confirmation process for both Chief Justice-designate Rehnquist and Judge Scalia. There was an awful lot of embroidery around the edges of what the central issue really was, and that was Justice Rehnquist's philosophy. President Reagan plainly nominated him on the basis of his philosophy, and I think there's a much greater opening for straightforward, honestly stated philosophical views on the part of the Senate. The Next President Q. What is the potential for change in the Supreme Court after the election of the next President, what can that do to the future of our constitutional law, and what new directions might be just over the horizon? Professor Tribe. I do need, before answering that very narrow, technical question, to ask one question: Who's the next President going to be? I could imagine two very different futures being written. One will be: The Warren Court authored a major revolution, the Burger Court engaged in no counterrevolution but consolidated, the Rehnquist Court paused briefly, and then began to reassert some of the initiatives of the Warren years. The other, very different, scenario is revolution, consolidation and then counterrevolution. It depends very much on the direction of political change, something on which I don't regard myself as an expert. Dean Choper. What's clear to me is that Justices Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun - Stevens is a relatively young man - are not going to step down while Reagan is President. But if he gets one of those appointments there's a good chance of a clear shift. So far as after 1988, it depends not exclusively on whether a Democrat or a Republican is in the White House, but how determined that President is about shaping the Court. You could get a Republican such as Gerald Ford, who didn't pay much attention to it at all, or a Democrat like John Kennedy, who didn't pay much attention to it at all, in terms of ideology. The thing about Judge Scalia is that at least in my professional lifetime there's never been a nominee one could count on with greater assurance as to where he's going to be. It's not a guarantee, but here's a guy with a record and an expression of views. The last point I want to make is that there is this doctrine of stare decisis, which a truly conservative justice might be greatly influenced by, while disagreeing with the exclusionary rule or Roe v. Wade. I do not believe that a properly constituted conservative court wants simply to be able to overturn results that have now become deeply ingrained in the constitutional and political fabric of the country simply because one Justice is gone and another is appointed. Professor Kamisar. I think you're a little too optimistic. The old days are gone forever - the days when Presidents didn't take Supreme Court appointments very seriously, when they viewed them like somebody becoming postmaster general. Look at FDR. He picked guys because he owed them, he liked them, they worked for him. Truman picked the guys he played poker with. With Reagan we've got a President who systematically bears down on ideology, who takes the Supreme Court much more seriously than other presidents have. I think the conventional wisdom that nominees have surprised Presidents before is not worth very much. However, there are new issues which no one can perceive. We know how Scalia will be only on certain issues. He may surprise a lot of people on issues we haven't even contemplated yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SEEKING KEY ROLE FOR PARTY, RIGHT TO LIFE CANDIDATE TRIES TO MAKE ABORTION AN ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/nyregion/seeking-key-role-for-party-right-life-candidate-tries-make-abortion-issue.html,"Virtually unnoticed so far, District Attorney Denis E. Dillon of Nassau County, the Right to Life candidate for governor of New York, is trying to make abortion an issue in the campaign and, at the same time, win enough votes to assure a line for the party on future ballots. Mr. Dillon, who was re-elected prosecutor last year with a rare five-party endorsement, is running against Governor Cuomo, a fellow Democrat; and Andrew O'Rourke, the Republican candidate and a onetime Fordham College and Law School classmate. All three are products of Catholic educations but disagree on the role of the abortion issue in campaigns and government. The 52-year-old Mr. Dillon, a career law-enforcement official, is critical of the Governor for his positions on abortion. He is also unhappy with Mr. O'Rourke, who has similar views as Mr. Dillon on abortion for failing to emphasize the issue in the campaign. Indeed, Mr. Dillon said, the O'Rourke position was the prime reason he decided to heed the requests of Right to Life Party leaders - most of them Nassau residents - that he run despite the objections of Nassau Democratic leaders. Mr. Dillon said he disagrees with Mr. Cuomo over the Governor's support of Medicaid funding of abortions, which must be authorized by the state, and his failure to support a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. 'He Is Not the Candidate' In speeches to Catholic, Orthodox Jewish and Pentecostal groups, Mr. Dillon also charges that Mr. Cuomo's encouragement of homosexual ''lobbyists'' indicates that ''he is not the candidate who represents traditional family values.'' Mr. Dillon said that he and Mr. O'Rourke basically agree on the abortion issue, including support of a constitutional amendment banning it. Mr. O'Rourke was approached by Right to Life Party leaders who endorsed two of his running mates, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Nassau Comptroller Peter T. King, who are the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life candidates for the senate and for attorney general, respectively. But Mr. O'Rourke said he had taken the position throughout his elective career that the Right to Life line would cost him more votes than it would gain. That theory will be put to the test on Election Day. When he is not talking about the Governor in his stock speeches, Mr. Dillon argues that Mr. O'Rourke is ''going down the tubes in a Cuomo landslide'' and, thus, a vote for the Republican is a wasted vote. He argues that a Dillon vote at least ''sends a message'' on abortion. Last week, Mayor Koch, presumably being facetious, said that Mr. Dillon might poll more votes than Mr. O'Rourke but other politicians say that more realistically, Mr. Dillon will siphon more votes from Mr. O'Rourke than from Mr. Cuomo. Governor's Row Publicizes Issue Mr. Dillon added that the Governor's public argument with John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, over an archdiocesan directive urging pastors not to invite pro-abortion speakers to parish meetings, had helped publicize the issue. ''It injects the issue into the campaign,'' he said. In addition, Mr. Dillon hopes to recapture fourth place for the Right to Life Party - behind the Democratic, Republican and Conservative Parties - over the strife-ridden Liberal Party, which has nominated the Governor. The party position on the voting machine and its official status is determined for the next four years by the gubernatorial vote. A party's gubernatorial candidate must poll at least 50,000 votes to maintain its line on the ballot in future elections. Otherwise, it would be required to obtain independent nominating petitions each year. Mr. Dillon, who was born and raised in the Bronx, was first elected Nassau County's district attorney in 1974. Before that, he was head of the Organized Crime Strike Force and an assistant United States attorney in the Eastern District, which includes Long Island. He was briefly a New York City policeman, before and while attending law school.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMOCRATS FASHION CENTRIST IMAGE IN NEW STATEMENT OF PARTY POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/us/democrats-fashion-centrist-image-in-new-statement-of-party-policy.html,"The Democratic Policy Commission, seeking to create a new image of the party, has produced a statement of principles that includes strikingly tough criticism of the Soviet Union and strongly asserts the importance Democrats accord family life. ''Democrats harbor no illusions about the Soviet Union,'' the document declares. ''Theirs is a totalitarian society that remains an empire in the classical sense.'' The 71-page statement, which was prepared under the auspices of the Democratic National Committee and is to be issued officially next week, criticizes aspects of President Reagan's military buildup as ''a wild spending spree with no strategic rationale and no overall defense plan.'' Stronger Defense Needed But it effectively endorses the principles behind the buildup and says a desire for a stronger military is widespread among the American people. ''After the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iranian hostage crisis and the signs of unrest in Central America, they knew America's defenses had to be repaired,'' the statement says. The document lists ''a commitment to stronger families'' as a top Democratic goal. While reaffirming a governmental role in promoting educational opportunities, job training and economic growth, its statements on domestic policy are generally moderate and lay heavy stress on private investment and ''entrepreneurship.'' Panel Set Up After '84 Vote Entitled ''New Choices in a Changing America,'' the document is designed in part to fashion a more centrist image for the party and to make it more acceptable to voters, especially in the South and West, who have strayed to the Republicans in recent elections. It is certain to run into criticism from some Democratic liberals. Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who set up the Policy Commission after the landslide loss in the 1984 Presidential race, said in an interview that the statement was not ''a platform,'' and it is in no way binding on Democratic officials. Rather, Mr. Kirk said, it is meant to help forge a consensus acceptable to broad segments of the party and to assist candidates running in this year's elections. The document avoids such divisive social issues as abortion and homosexual rights, and one Democratic Party official, who asked not to be named, said it should be seen as an effort by the party ''to get out from under the false image that Democrats are weak on defense, have weird life styles and are big taxers and spenders.'' Mr. Kirk noted that the panel, led by former Gov. Scott M. Matheson of Utah, was made up of politicians who had won elections instead of representatives of ''think tanks'' and ''interest groups,'' and he said its report had therefore avoided ''narrow agendas.'' Broad Themes With Few Specifics Party leaders noted that the document clearly bore Mr. Matheson's centrist stamp and to some degree reflected the distance between the party's liberal wing and its elected officials in the South and West. The document contains few specific proposals and is revealing mainly in its selection of themes, many of which have already become keynotes of Democratic campaigns and have been cited by polltakers as appealing. For example, the commission's ''pro-family'' policy lays heavy stress on the growth in the number of families in which both parents work. ''Where will the initiatives come to relieve some of the pressure on the two wage-earner family?'' the report asks, and it proposes flexible working hours and better day care as part of the answer. The paper warns that changes in the economy have led to a ''shrinking middle class,'' with young families finding it more and more difficult to buy homes and send children to college. It uses the term ''Swiss cheese'' to describe an American economy in which some sectors and regions enjoy prosperity while others suffer from recession, and it sharply attacks ''the trade surrender policies of the Republican Administration.'' Mr. Kirk said the themes were chosen in part to appeal to younger voters, particularly a group that he and others have referred to as ''new collar'' workers: 25-to-45-year-olds with jobs in the service field who earn less than either professionals and managers or workers in heavy industry. Effectively acknowledging that the statement included few bold policy proposals, Mr. Kirk said, ''It is not designed as a legislative item checklist.'' Effort to Alter Image He said the document was seeking to dismantle a ''scarecrow image'' of the Democratic Party that Republicans had put forward. It repeatedly seeks to cast Republicans as ideologues tied to the past and Democrats as pragmatists who look to the future. ''Democrats have always been at their best,'' the report declares in a typical passage, ''when moving forward, dealing with conditions as they find them, not force-fitting circumstances to outmoded theories.'' Mr. Kirk said he hoped the document would help make the national party ''more an asset than a burden'' to local Democrats. The document, earlier drafts of which were criticized by liberals, hews close to policy lines associated with what has come to be known as the party's ''neo-liberal'' wing, represented by such figures as Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. One Democratic Party official said it resembled in many ways the statements that have been issued by the moderate-to-conservative Democratic Leadership Council, a group led by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Charles S. Robb, a former Governor of Virginia. Criticism From the Left Michael Harrington, a leader of Democratic Alternatives, a coalition of liberal and labor groups, said his group would offer a critique of the report. Mr. Harrington was especially critical of the paper's economic proposals, which he called ''either vague or vacuous'' and which, he said, avoided proposals for full employment. ''It doesn't even support the Great Society programs that actually worked,'' he said. Responding in advance to expected liberal criticism, Mr. Kirk denied that the statement took stands to the right of the party's mainstream. He said the paper was true to ''traditional Democratic beliefs'' and was seeking to serve as a ''bridge'' between those principles and the new issues the party confronts. Mr. Kirk said a debate over foreign policy, essentially a continuation of a battle that has racked the party since the Vietnam War over military spending levels and American intervention abroad, delayed the document for months. An early proposal by Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat, sought to bridge the gap by strongly condemning the Soviet system and supporting a strong military while also sharply criticizing Administration policy in Nicaragua and other areas. No Criticism on Nicaragua But more conservative Democrats criticized that draft as still insufficiently outspoken in supporting the use of American power, and the final document's chapter on foreign policy -closely reflecting the thinking of Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee - contains no criticism of the Administration's Nicaragua policy. The document does strongly endorse arms control and criticizes the Reagan Administration for saying that the United States intends to abandon the limits on weapons set in the never-ratified second strategic arms limitation treaty. But it also declares, ''Democrats harbor no illusions about arms control.'' It criticizes Mr. Reagan's arms buildup as appearing ''more and more like a bureaucratic spend-up'' and supports alternatives to weapons systems the Adminstration backs. On domestic policy, the statement defends spending on education, job training, health care and scientific research and argues that the government need not be just a coercive force, but also an instrument for expanding opportunity. ''The essence of freedom is not just freedom to choose,'' it says at one point, ''but to widen the circle of choices.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Repression Is Undoing Work of Vatican II,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/22/opinion/l-repression-is-undoing-work-of-vatican-ii-972586.html,"To the Editor: As a Roman Catholic woman theologian, I dissent in anger and sorrow from three recent actions of the Catholic hierarchy: * The firing of the Rev. Charles E. Curran as theology professor at Catholic University for his more thoughtful stance on contraception, divorce and homosexuality. * The proclaimed policy of the New York Roman Catholic Archdiocese barring all who publicly disagree with ''church teaching'' from speaking in parishes of the archdiocese. * The almost unheard-of curb by the Vatican on the authority of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle, who was directed to give over control to his auxiliary bishop in five major areas. Moral theology is specifically mentioned, which includes birth control, divorce and other sex-related matters. These actions are at bottom connected and can be linked to such earlier actions as the harassment of the 24 sister signers of a statement in The New York Times on pluralism and abortion (Oct. 7, 1984); the demand that Sister Agnes Mansour choose between a job that entailed giving Medicaid funds to poor women in need of an abortion and her order; the forbidding of tubal ligation surgery in all hospitals of the Sisters of Mercy, even when women wish this surgery after several pregnancies. The issues connected with procreation affect women especially. Women are the ones who bear, nurse and in great measure socialize children. They are most immediately affected by all pronouncements on sexuality, yet they have nothing to say about decisions in this immense field, have no sacramental jurisdiction and no contribution to doctrinal development. I dissent from the actions by members of the Catholic hierarchy because I see arrogance and tyranny in their approach. They claim an almost infallible approach to church teaching for themselves as if lay people were not also part of the church. Should such repressive actions continue, the new spirit of openness and freedom that marked the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) will be reversed. This would be, I believe, a tragedy for the church and harm society as a whole. MARY I. BUCKLEY Associate Professor of Theology St. John's University Jamaica, N.Y., Sept. 9, 1986",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Administration to Drop Rule Requiring Advice on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/22/us/administration-to-drop-rule-requiring-advice-on-abortion.html,"The Reagan Administration is dropping a requirement that federally financed family planning clinics list abortion among the options for dealing with an unintended pregnancy. Current guidelines state that ''those requesting information on options for the management of an unintended pregnancy are to be given nondirective counseling'' on prenatal care and delivery, infant care, foster care, adoption and ''pregnancy termination.'' ''In that paragraph we are changing the words 'are to,' which is basically a mandatory requirement, to the word 'may,' which is permissive,'' said Jo Ann Gaspar, a deputy assistant secretary of health.

SCHOOL CHIEF TO ASK MANDATORY SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/24/nyregion/school-chief-to-ask-mandatory-sex-education.html,"Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones said yesterday that he would ask the Board of Education to mandate a sex-education curriculum in all elementary and junior high schools. But Mr. Quinones said in a statement that ''the decision is of course the board's to make.'' The new chairman of the board, Robert F. Wagner Jr., said it was his ''instinct'' to vote in favor of compulsory sex-education courses in the early grades and junior high schools. About a third of the school districts do not offer the courses, while all high schools, which are controlled by the central Board of Education, already offer them. But Mr. Wagner said he was ''newer to the issue than a lot of people'' and he wanted to examine the curriculum and an impending report from the division of curriculum and instruction on putting it into place before considering Mr. Quinones's recommendation. A More Aggressive Stand Another board member, Edward L. Sadowsky, said he was also inclined to vote for the proposal but predicted the matter would get ''bogged down in the specifics - what do you say about contraception, abortion, abstinence, rhythm?'' Mr. Quinones said he believed a number of the 32 community school districts that control the city's elementary and junior high schools had ignored a curriculum devised by the board two years ago. It was time, he said, to deal with the issue ''more aggressively.'' A curriculum called ''Family Living and Sex Education'' issued by the central board for distribution to the districts two years ago came under fire at the time from the Archdiocese of New York and a coalition of churches for being ''devoid of values.'' A spokesman for the Archdiocese, Msgr. Peter G. Finn, said that if the seven-member board approved Mr. Quinones's recommendation, it would be a ''betrayal of commitments'' made two years ago. He said that an Oct. 24, 1984, memorandum circulated to the 32 boards under the signature of Mr. Quinones made it clear that the curriculum was to be introduced at the discretion of the boards. He added that there was also an agreement that advisory councils would be established in each district, composed of parents, church officials and community people, to advise on the introduction of the curriculum. Several school district officials said yesterday that church members had served on advisory committees in their districts and, despite the stated opposition of the archdiocese, the advisory committees had approved the course. Marylen Daly, the chairman of Community School Board 26 in Queens, said a rabbi and a Roman Catholic priest had served on the local board's advisory committee. She said that the priest, the Rev. Michael McCormack of Our Lady of the Snows, had sent a letter to a public hearing saying he understood the need for the curriculum. In Community School District 31 on Staten Island, Josephine Ceiling, the special assistant to the superintendant, said the board there had voted to introduce the course in 1984 after it had been approved by an advisory council that included a rabbi and a Roman Catholic priest. She said that parents had been advised they could have their children removed from the classroom when the course was given but ''very, very few'' had done so. Charlotte Frank, the head of the division of curriculum and instruction, who is to deliver the report on putting the program into effect in two weeks, said that neither birth control nor abortion was discussed in the curriculum for elementary schools. For the junior high schools, she said, the curriculum recommended that the schools ask a physician or health counselor to explain the various methods of birth control. She said that in a discussion of human reproduction in the junior high school curriculum, abortion was one of ''many topics to be discussed in the case of an unwanted pregnancy.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON TALK: SUPREME COURT; The Morning Line on the Bench, as Revised",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/25/us/washington-talk-supreme-court-the-morning-line-on-the-bench-as-revised.html,"The Supreme Court's internal chemistry will doubtless be affected by the changes in membership that the Senate has approved, scholars agree, but its ideological balance is unlikely to shift dramatically unless another aging member steps down. While public attention has focused on the elevation of Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist to become the 16th Chief Justice, the more important new ingredient in the Court's chemistry, many experts agree, is the appointment of Judge Antonin Scalia as Associate Justice. ''I'm told, and I don't know this from experience, that he is most dangerous when he is most ingratiating, and that he has a great ability to persuade one to his point of view,'' Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun said of Judge Scalia in an informal talk in July to a group of Federal judges. ''Well, we'll see.'' By all accounts, Judge Scalia will bring to the Court both an uncommonly potent intellect and a winning personality, making him a formidable ally for Justice Rehnquist. Both men, who will be sworn in Friday, are fervent conservatives who share the Reagan Administration's views of almost all politically charged issues, from affirmative action and abortion to prayer in schools. 'Creation Science' an Issue Among the issues that the reconstituted Court will face in the term beginning Oct. 6 are state-mandated teaching of ''creation science'' as a counterweight to the teaching of evolution, racial disparities in death sentencing and, once again, affirmative action in the workplace. The reason no immediate shift in the Court's direction is expected is that, except for Justice Rehnquist, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who is retiring, has long been the Court's most consistent conservative. ''In the vast bulk of the ideologically charged cases, Judge Scalia's vote will be a functional substitute for Chief Justice Burger's vote, so the outcomes of cases should not be affected,'' said Prof. Burt Neuborne of New York University Law School. ''But there's more to the Supreme Court than short-term voting patterns,'' added Professor Neuborne, who recently stepped down as the American Civil Liberties Union's legal director. ''When you add a judge of Scalia's intellect and vigor to the Court, you add a powerful voice for his convictions, and I suspect that over time he may influence the votes of the middle of the Court.'' The Justices in the Court's middle, especially Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Sandra Day O'Connor, have held the balance of power on many issues, sometimes siding with Justice Rehnquist and sometimes with the Court's liberal wing. Pragmatism Seen in Decisions In recent years these shifting coalitions have produced decisions notable less for theoretical consistency than for pragmatism, moderation and continuity. Conservatives hope this will change now with the new injection of intellectual vigor and youth from Judge Scalia, 50 years old, and the elevation of Justice Rehnquist, 61, who is widely considered a more consistent, persuasive and determined advocate of conservative views than the 79-year-old Chief Justice Burger. Justice Rehnquist's new powers will include the right to preside at the Court's conferences, to assign opinions when he is in the majority and, in subtle ways, to reward his allies and punish his adversaries among the eight Associate Justices. But he will still have only one vote, and his fiercely independent colleagues are unlikely to abandon the positions they have staked out on major issues. 'They Are Prima Donnas' ''They are prima donnas, there's no question about that,'' Justice Harry A. Blackmun said of the Court's members in a speech in July to a group of Federal appellate judges, according to a report in the National Law Journal. ''You remember Holmes described them as nine scorpions in a bottle. That's a pretty good description.'' Justice Blackmun added: ''I think the center held generally this year. But it bled a lot. And it needs more troops. Where it's going to get them, I don't know.'' The Court's direction could shift dramatically to the right if President Reagan got a chance to replace with another conservative any of the Court's four oldest members. Justice Blackmun is 77, Justice Powell 79, and Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, who hold down the Court's liberal wing, are 80 and 78 respectively. Together with Justice John Paul Stevens, 66, they have been the five supporters of broad abortion rights, for example. If any was replaced by an opponent of legal abortion, it might open the way for the Court to restrict or even possibly to abandon its protection of abortion. Illinois Case Is Pending The Court has not yet agreed to review any abortion cases in the coming term. But it has before it an appeal of a lower Federal court decision that struck down an Illinois law that required minors seeking abortions to wait 24 hours after informing their parents. The whole question of separation of church and state is one area in which Judge Scalia may have a chance to nudge the Court's current members in a new direction, according to Mr. Neuborne and other experts. Many scholars agree that the Court's decisions interpreting the prohibition of ''establishment of religion'' have been so confusing and difficult to reconcile that its whole approach, built upon a ''three-part test'' enunciated in 1971 by Chief Justice Burger, may be ripe for re-evaluation. Some members of the Court have suggested the same. ''This is an area where we have not done well,'' Justice Blackmun said in his speech in July. Justice Rehnquist has argued forcefully that the Constitution does not require a ''wall of separation'' between church and state or governmental neutrality toward religion, as the majority has sometimes held. More Leeway Is a Possibility Judge Scalia's writings as a law professor, before President Reagan named him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, suggest he will join with Justice Rehnquist in seeking more leeway for governments to assist parochial schools and other religious organizations. That is not necessarily to say that either of them would go so far as to uphold, for example, Louisiana's pending appeal of a lower Federal court ruling that struck down a law requiring that ''creation science'' be taught in any public school that teaches the theory of evolution. The lower court ruled the law an unconstitutional effort to promote a religious belief in the Biblical account of creation, misleadingly disguised by its drafters and the state as a scientific theory. However the case comes out, it will be closely watched for any signs of a move away from the strict neutrality toward religion that a narrow majority of the Court has previously enforced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A BOUNTIFUL FALL SEASON FOR NEW YORK FILMGOERS; 'TWIST AND SHOUT,' FROM DENMARK",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/26/movies/a-bountiful-fall-season-for-new-york-filmgoers-twist-and-shout-from-denmark.html,"THE extremely likable Danish film ''Twist and Shout,'' directed by Bille August, is a sequel to ''Zappa,'' another film of Mr. August's that was a high point of the New Directors/New Films series in 1984. Both films center on a schoolboy named Bjorn, and both are lightly comic in tone. But they draw their strength from the portrait of an arid, conventional Danish society that Mr. August uses as these stories' implicit backdrop. ''Twist and Shout,'' which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, reunites the handsome young Bjorn (Adam Tonsberg) with a pretty, stolid blonde named Kirsten (Ulrikke Juul Bondo), who continues to pursue him in the most strait-laced, humorless way. Kirsten is marriage-minded, as is her family. Her father even tells Bjorn about a place that offers a 20 percent discount on engagement rings. But the film is also about Bjorn's head-over-heels love affair with Anna (Camilla Soeberg), a much more voluptuous girl. When Bjorn first brings Anna to a party at Kirsten's house and nuzzles her shamelessly during the dancing, it's enough to prompt Kirsten to clap her hands and cry out, ''Time for the snacks!'' (This is by far the most heartfelt emotion she expresses during the story.) But it's too late: Bjorn and Anna are so madly in love that even a three-day separation, when Anna must take a train trip to another city, strikes them as an agony. There is real pain to come, once Anna becomes pregnant. At that point, the film's sunny innocence is destroyed by this crisis, along with Bjorn's. Anna undergoes an abortion, which is recorded in harrowing detail; what makes it seem all the more agonizing is the relative indifference of Anna's mother, who gives her daughter the name of an abortionist, makes sure the event is kept secret and never bothers to ask about Anna's health once it is over. The abortion episode becomes a turning point for Bjorn, forcing him back to the values of his middle-class family, values with which he is acutely uncomfortable. Mr. Tonsberg, an actor with an extraordinary glow of rosy good health, is very good at quietly reflecting the spontaneity and conformity at war inside Bjorn's character. Much of the film also concerns Bjorn's friend Erik (Lars Simonsen), a stern and withdrawn young man whose family situation places him under a tremendous strain. His mother (Aase Hansen) is mad, and very difficult to restrain, but his father (Bent Mejding) refuses to face that. Instead, he keeps her locked at home, and he forces Erik into complicity in holding her prisoner. Erik loves his mother, and does what he can for her; one day, he even overcomes his embarrassment sufficiently to invite Bjorn to tea. He also invites Kirsten over, at a different time. The difference between their reactions to the mother's plight says everything about what hope there is for a successful match between them. Mr. August's potshots at Danish primness can come a little too easily sometimes; it isn't really necessary to place Kirsten's family in a nightclub, doing the cha-cha to ''The Banana Boat Song,'' to show how wooden they are. The film doesn't need that moment to establish its early-60's period, either. The era is captured more than evocatively by the title song, which Bjorn and some friends and Bjorn's kid brother do their best to play. Bjorn buys some Liverpool-style pointy boots and a suit with a little velvet collar, and the rest of the band dresses accordingly, as do half of the other would-be Beatles that they know. They don't have much in common with the Fab Four, despite such prodigious efforts. But they share musical tastes, just as they share adolescent problems, with teen-agers the world over. A MELANCHOLY DANE - TWIST AND SHOUT, directed by Bille August; screenplay (Danish with English subtitles) by Mr. August and Bjarne Reuter; cinematography by Jan Weincke; edited by Janus Billeskov Jansen; music by Bo Holten; produced by Per Holst Filmproduktion and Palle Fogtdal in collaboration with the Danish Film Institute, the Children's Film Council and the Co-productions Fund of Danmarks Radio; a Miramax Films release.

REHNQUIST AND SCALIA TAKE THEIR PLACES ON COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/27/us/rehnquist-and-scalia-take-their-places-on-court.html,"Turning a page of history, William Hubbs Rehnquist took his oath today as the 16th Chief Justice of the United States, and Antonin Scalia took his as the newest Associate Justice. President Reagan praised both men at a White House ceremony this morning as ''brilliant'' jurists who understood that ''government by the people'' requires ''judicial restraint.'' He said, ''I nominated William Rehnquist because I believe he will be a Chief Justice of historic stature.'' Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia formally assumed their new offices at another ceremony at the Supreme Court this afternoon, which the President did not attend. Commitment Underscored The inspirational speeches at today's two ceremonies made no reference to the bitter debate recently concluded in the Senate over Chief Justice Rehnquist's character and his conservative judicial philosophy. But Mr. Reagan's remarks underscored the President's commitment to change the direction of the Federal courts by appointing judges who share his views of the Constitution. Warren E. Burger, whose retirement as Chief Justice took effect today, gave one oath to his successor at the White House and a second at the Court. The Court's other members, top Administration officials, family, friends and a large crowd of others attended both ceremonies. At the Court, Mr. Burger, minutes before relinquishing his office, told the 400 people jamming the courtroom that while Justices would always disagree about the meaning of the Constitution, changes in the Court's membership did not affect its commitment to ''continuity'' and to the Constitution as ''a living document.'' Oath Administered to Scalia In the ''judicial oath,'' administered at the Court this afternoon, both Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia swore, among other things, ''that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.'' Chief Justice Rehnquist gave the oath to Justice Scalia. In the ''constitutional oath,'' administered by Chief Justice Burger at the White House this morning, both men swore to ''support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' The constitutional oath is authorized by Article 6 of the Constitution and is required of all Federal employees. The judicial oath is required by an Act of Congress and administered to all Federal judges. They can be administered together or, as today, at separate ceremonies. The Court's public information office said in a news release that all new members of the Court and new Chief Justices took both the constitutional oath and the judicial oath. The public information office said that at least one Chief Justice and three other Associate Justices had previously taken both oaths at the White House, and that in 1940 Associate Justice Frank Murphy took one oath at the White House and the other at the Court, as was done today. At the ceremony this afternoon, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d delivered to the Supreme Court's clerk, Joseph Spaniol, the formal commissions of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, signed by the President. This morning Mr. Reagan proclaimed, ''Today we mark one of those moments of passage and renewal that has kept our republic alive and strong.'' He stressed what he said was the agreement among the framers of the Constitution that judges should interpret laws, not make them. 'Principle of Judicial Restraint' ''For them the question involved in judicial restraint was not - as it is not -will we have liberal or conservative courts?'' he said. ''They knew that the courts, like the Constitution itself, must not be liberal or conservative. The question was and is, will we have government by the people? And this is why the principle of judicial restraint has had an honored place in our tradition.'' Mr. Reagan avoided direct criticism of the Supreme Court's past decisions on issues such as abortion and school prayer, some of which he has previously denounced as departures from judicial restraint. But his remarks came at a time when the Attorney General and other officials have been assailing some of the Court's decisions more forcefully than any Administration in more than 40 years. Two weeks ago Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds denounced directly what he called the ''radical egalitarianism'' of Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr., who he said ''has allowed his liberal orthodoxy to shape his jurisprudence.'' At the ceremony today, Mr. Reagan stuck to praising those he considers adherents of judicial restraint, including Mr. Burger, whose 17 years in office he called ''a monument of integrity and of dedication to principle, and especially to the judiciary itself.'' The President noted that Mr. Burger's service ''isn't ending today'' and that he would continue as chairman of a Presidential commission to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution, which will coincide with his 80th birthday on Sept. 17, 1987. A Prayer for Patience Chief Justice Rehnquist said in brief remarks at the White House this morning: ''Mr. President, I'm grateful beyond measure to you for affording me the opportunity to serve the court and to serve my country as Chief Justice of the United States. And I pray that God will grant me the patience, the wisdom and the fortitude to worthily follow in the footsteps of my illustrious predecessors in discharging the responsibilities of this high office.'' Justice Scalia thanked Mr. Reagan for appointing him, saying, ''I am very grateful and will do my best to live up to his confidence.'' ''I have to thank my wife, Maureen, who's an extraordinary woman, and without whom I wouldn't be here; or if I were here, it wouldn't have been as much fun along the way,'' he added, amid laughter. ''And I have to thank a lot of other people, going way back to teachers in public school 13 in Queens.'' He said that he had ''enormous personal regard'' for all the current Justices and that ''I look forward to working with them in our common enterprise for many years to come.'' Both ceremonies today were attended by the families of the outgoing and incoming Chief Justices and of Justice Scalia, whose wife and nine children occupied almost the entire front row on one side of the courtroom this afternoon as he sat in front of them before taking the oath. Justice Scalia, who is 50 years old, is a former law professor. He has been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1982. Like Chief Justice Rehnquist, 61, he is considered one of the nation's leading conservative legal scholars, and his record indicates agreement with Mr. Reagan and Chief Justice Rehnquist on almost all politically charged issues. Because Chief Justice Burger, 79, sided with Justice Rehnquist in the vast majority of controversial cases, the changes in the Court's membership are not expected to have any major immediate effect on the deeply divided Court's voting patterns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't Punish Aliens With Death by Illness,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/27/opinion/l-don-t-punish-aliens-with-death-by-illness-488386.html,"To the Editor: It's ironic to debate Medicaid coverage for illegal aliens while silence blankets the fate of Medicaid coverage for pregnant teen-agers in New York State. The efforts of the Commissioner of Social Services to revise New York's Medicaid policy to bar some 4,000 pregnant teen-agers from getting prenatal care - or, in a handful of cases, abortions - have commanded little media attention and no editorial comment from you. In New York State this year 59,000 teens will get pregnant. Of those, 26,000 will have children; 33,000 will have abortions. Many will manage without help, and others are already members of families receiving Medicaid. But several thousand pregnant teen-agers who cannot turn to their families and have no resources are about to be abandoned by the state when they urgently need essential medical services. While I concur with the court's decision to make illegal aliens eligible for Medicaid, I have to say - first things first. ALFRED F.

A FAMILIAR ISSUE: ADULTS IN TRANSITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/nyregion/a-familiar-issue-adults-in-transition.html,"THE new director of the Sarah Lawrence Center for Continuing Education, Alice K. Olson, understands a lot about the center's major constituency - adults in transition. In her own background, she has been - in addition to wife and mother - at various times teacher, lawyer, political candidate, feminist activist, community worker, student and business manager. She also understands first-hand the kind of unconventional college education that many adults pursue these days. Married after a year of college, she continued her studies after her two children were born, and both she and her husband took a long time to complete their undergraduate education. ''I took seven years,'' Ms. Olson said. ''We were both employed and we were in class part time one semester, full time another and not at all the next.'' The Sarah Lawrence Center, which started in 1962, began as a degree program targeted to adult women returning to school. It was the first such program in the country. Over the years its student body has changed. The center now includes male students, has more post-bachelor of arts students who are making career transitions or want to enter the work force for the first time, and also enrolls some students who have no undergraduate education. Ms. Olson, now 40 years old, has experienced career changes that reflect a progression largely based on her own need for new and different challenges. After graduating from college, she attended North Dakota State University and did a year of graduate work in English. She left graduate school when she realized she wasn't a scholar and took a job teaching fifth- and sixth-grade language arts. During that time she became involved in North Dakota politics, originally with the antiwar movement. She also became involved in the feminist movement. In politics, her activities included organizing a successful effort to elect a convention delegate for Shirley Chisholm's early bid for national office; leading a successful challenge to 17 delegations to the North Dakota state convention, based on inadequate representation of women; and helping to win ratification of an equal rights amendment in the North Dakota State Legislature. North Dakota Democrats regarded her with raised eyebrows, she recalled. She had been arrested in 1968 at the Democratic Convention in a peaceful demonstration for the Eugene McCarthy campaign. She had also helped organize a major political demonstration at the construction site for an antiballistic missile system in northeastern North Dakota. All of these factors led her to think about law school, she said. ''I had this arrest record and I had the credentials challenge, about women being represented. I realized if I was really going to be effective in Nortk Dakota politics, I needed credibility,'' Ms. Olson said. Law school seemed the path to that end. ''I paid attention to who got the last word in at the political caucuses and conventions and it was always the lawyers. I decided I didn't know what it was they had - whether it was a mystique or something more -but whatever it was I wanted it,'' Ms. Olson said. She attended law school at the University of North Dakota, graduated in 1976 and joined a well-respected firm in Fargo. ''It worked,'' she said. ''There was a significant difference in the way I was received and heard and listened to.'' Her law practice led to several state appointments - one by the Governor to the State Social Service Board, a body with responsibility for policy making and administration of the state social-service system; another by the North Dakota Chief Justice to serve on a committee that advises the court on the use of its ruling-making power. In 1980, Ms. Olson ran as the Democratic candidate for Attorney General in North Dakota, which she narrowly lost with 48 percent of the vote. In her law practice, she developed a reputation as an advocate for women. ''Over the six years I practiced I attracted a lot of domestic work, which is basically where women come into contact with the law. My practice became more and more heavily concentrated in divorce, child-custody and child-support cases - not always in representation of women but always involved in trying to help resolve the problems that arise when marriages fail.'' Ms. Olson felt that while the work was rewarding it was also frustrating and difficult. ''I really got tired of feeling that I was always either in combat or trying to work with rules and tools that were not designed for resolving these problems. The American adversarial system of justice seems to be the wrong way to approach domestic dissolution,'' Ms. Olson said. She also found ''almost daily the sexism that's inherent in our system of justice,'' she said, adding: ''It became just too painful to constantly be confronted with injustice against women.'' At about this time she also began to write off a political future in North Dakota. In 1982, because of her strong public position in support of abortion rights, she was denied the Democratic Party's endorsement for State Labor Commissioner. She and her husband began to discuss leaving the state for the East. While formulating their plans, she took what she regarded as a temporary position as associate director of the Fargo-Moorhead Heart Health Program, a research project of the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health, which focused on heart-disease prevention. After two years in the program, she was awarded a Leadership Fellowship from the Busch Foundation in Minnesota to attend the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. There she took part in a midcareer master's-degree program in public administration. ''It was a great experience to be there,'' she said, noting that the presence in the program of a large international community, particularly from underdeveloped countries, opened up new areas of interest to her. The program also gave her the opportunity to ''study leadership and analyze what it means to be a leader,'' she said, adding: ''I got a whole new way of thinking about and seeing what had happened to me in the past and what lessons there were to learn from my experiences.'' While she attended school in Cambridge, Mass., her husband, a tax accountant, remained in Fargo. Shortly after completion of the Kennedy school program the two decided to come East. Her husband's company fortuitously offered him a transfer to Manhattan. Before coming to Sarah Lawrence, Ms. Olson did a short stint in a management position with a New York City printing company. While she expresses pride in the work she did there, she realized it was not appropriate for her interests and began again on a job search, which resulted in her current position. ''I think basically what recommended me to the college was my own experience both as a returning student and as someone who had made major transitions in adult life - which is really what a lot of our students are going through,'' Ms. Olson said. She said she was particularly enthusiastic about the motivation and diversity of the 50 students at the center, who range in age from 25 to 70. ''They are people with a variety of different backgrounds who want to test themselves before they make a commitment to a graduate or other program,'' Ms. Olson said. In her new role as director, she said she thinks most of her time and energy will be spent with adults returning to complete undergraduate education that was interrupted. ''But I know we're going to be looking at what other constituencies there are out there who have educational interests that are appropriate to Sarah Lawrence College. There are senior citizens, for example, whose lives we could really enrich,'' she said. She added that the center was also exploring the development of some special summer programs, which might include a management-training institute for artists, writers and performers. In her role as the center's director, Ms. Olson emphasized the need for a different approach to careers and to those who wish to change them. ''We're living a lot longer,'' she said. ''Life expectancy for a woman born in 1900 was 42 years, just enough time to raise children and see them gone. Our life expectancy is 72 - we've got about 30 more years to work with. We have a culture and job market that's changing, too. Now we really can't educate our sons and daughters with the sense that they're going to be holding the same job all their lives.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"'REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS' IS FOCUS OF DAYLONG, OCT. 24 WORKSHOP",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/nyregion/reproductive-rights-is-focus-of-daylong-oct-24-workshop.html,"ON Oct. 24, Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers will conduct a daylong workshop to update men and women on threats to ''reproductive rights'' and strategies for action. The Reproductive Freedoms Workshop will examine women's birth-control rights, abortion services, medical technologies and recent legal and legislative developments. Joanne Woodward, the actress, is honorary chairman of the workshop and the session is being co-sponsored by the college's graduate programs in health advocacy, human genetics and women's history. Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the keynote speaker, said she would focus her remarks ''on the continuing challenges to reproductive rights.'' ''I'll try to put these challenges in perspective in terms of public policy, both from a Congressional point of view and what is likely to happen to family-planning policy, overall, with the changes in the courts,'' she said. The program, presented in association with the American Civil Liberties Union, will include morning and afternoon addresses by lawyers, activists and youth and health-care representatives. The topics are to include ''Sexual Privacy and the Constitution: An Analysis and Critique of Abortion Case Law,'' ''Restrictions on Reproductive Freedom as Discrimination,'' ''Teen Pregnancy and the Minor's Right to Choose,'' ''Abortion Services and Clinic Violence'' and ''Congressional Approaches to Maintaining or Eroding Reproductive Freedoms.'' The executive director of the National Women's Health Organization, Susan Hill, said her talk on violence at abortion clinics would ''speak to the fact that abortion providers are becoming less and less likely to make abortions available to women.'' ''Where there was an expansion of abortion services five years ago into nonmetropolitan areas,'' Ms. Hill said, ''this trend has stopped because of the violence against facilities offering abortions, the picketing of administrators' homes and the increasing harassment of doctors in small towns. This is a tremendous disservice to women that is not being spoken about enough.'' Dr. Allan Rosenfield of Hartsdale, dean of the School of Public Health at Columbia University, said he would discuss the withdrawal of Federal funds for family-planning activities abroad. Dr. Rosenfield, a member of the workshop planning committee, said, ''The Government has interrupted the work of some good programs, and that will probably result in the opposite of what it would like, namely an increase in illegal abortions among people whose access to services are going to be curtailed.'' Joan Marks, who founded and directs the health advocacy and human genetics programs at the college and is coordinating the workshop, said the gathering would be an opportunity ''to have the facts presented so we can better understand what the issues are on a national and international level.'' ''We feel strongly,'' she said, ''that programs and technologies for reproductive education and counseling must remain available to everyone if individual rights are to be preserved and the ability to make decisions about family planning protected.'' Fees for the workshop are $25 for the public and $10 for students, the elderly and the unemployed. A box lunch is $5 extra. Checks for the workshop and lunch can be made to the college and sent to the Sarah Lawrence College Health Advocacy Program, Bronxville, N.Y. 10708.

WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; 'Biblical Scoreboard',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/us/washington-talk-briefing-biblical-scoreboard.html,"Concerned that ''most of our government offices'' are ''in the hands of amoral or immoral leaders,'' two church-related groups, Chrisian Voice and the Biblical News Service, have published a ''Biblical Scoreboard'' to help voters select candidates for Congress and some state offices in November. The scoreboard rates 3,000 candidates from 0 to 100, incumbents on the basis of a dozen votes in the last four years, challengers on the basis of answers to questions. Challengers who declined to answer were rated 0. The 40-page pamphlet lists as ''pro-Biblical'' support for the project to place weapons in space, a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a constitutional amendment banning abortion, aid to ''anti-Communist freedom fighters in Angola'' and the death penalty. The ''pro-Biblical'' position also involves opposition to financing for family planning, paying female employees on the basis of ''comparable worth,'' the proposed equal rights amendment and ''giving homosexuals the same minority status as blacks and other minorities.'' Dr. Robert G. Grant, president of Christian Voice, estimated that five million to eight million copies of the pamphlet would be distributed before Election Day. The publication suggests that pastors buy ''this important voter eduction magazine'' with funds from the church budget or donations from congregations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/books/in-short-fiction.html,"THE PUSHCART PRIZE XI: Best of the Small Presses. Edited by Bill Henderson. Poetry edited by Philip Levine and David Wojahn. (Pushcart Press, $26.) ''Think you know what's happening in literature today? Maybe you've been missing something,'' wrote Bill Henderson to his first ''Pushcart Prize'' readers more than a decade ago. Many discoveries later, the anthology continues to scour the literary countryside for talent. What it has come up with this year, however, is something of a puzzle. Many of the writers included have firmly established reputations in the mainstream of commercial publishing, and those newer recipients seem to be mostly aspiring versions of the former. That's not to say there isn't some fine writing here. Paul Auster's ''In the Country of Last Things'' is a haunting postapocalypse fantasy. Mona Simpson's ''Lawns'' movingly recounts a young girl's incestuous involvement with her father. ''Communist,'' a story by Richard Ford, is as well crafted as his novels. And Li-Young Lee's poem ''Eating Together'' captures the sense of loss that comes with the death of a parent. Nonfiction includes Wendell Berry's powerful critique of American nuclear defense policy, ''Property, Patriotism and National Defense,'' and Donald Barthelme's ''Not-Knowing,'' a clever, often hilarious essay on the apparent randomness of the creative process. But in general the collection seems less adventurous than it might have been, less indicative of what, under the best of circumstances, distinguishes the smaller press from the large: it provides a haven in which writers can - and often do - take risks. It used to be that reading ''The Pushcart Prize'' was like going on a trip to the zoo; one could find a multitude of rare species cohabiting in savage splendor. But if this volume is any indication, the small presses are not all so small anymore, nor their woods so wild.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS; RIGHT TO LIFE SLATE: ALL L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/nyregion/politics-right-to-life-slate-all-li.html,"THE State Right to Life Party has often been criticized as a one-issue party, concentrating only on abortion. But now it also has a narrow geographic base - Long Island - in a year when the party is fighting for its survival. In fact, all of the party's state candidates this year are from Nassau County. Nassau District Attorney Denis E. Dillon of Rockville Centre, a Democrat, is the party's candidate for governor, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of Island Park, a Republican seeking re-election, is also on the ticket. Thomas A. Droleskey of Hempstead, who is running for lieutenant governor, is a political science professor. The party is also backing Nassau County Comptroller Peter T. King of Seaford, a Republican and a candidate for attorney general, and Mary Jane Tobin of Merrick, a co-founder of the party and a candidate for state comptroller. Senator D'Amato and Comptroller King are the nominees of the Republican and Conservative Parties. Four years ago, the Right to Life candidate for governor, Robert Bohner, polled 52,356 votes, just above the 50,000-vote minimum needed in a gubernatorial election to continue its official-party status for four years. Otherwise, the party would have had to circulate independent nominating petitions for its state candidates every year rather than nominating them by convention. The gubernatorial vote also determines the position on the ballot for the next four years. The Right to Life Party dropped to fifth place in 1982 after briefly running ahead of the Liberal Party for four years. It was against this backdrop that Mr. Dillon, after twice rejecting offers of the gubernatorial nomination, changed his mind and accepted, despite the advice of his closest political associates that he risked alienating his own Democratic Party by opposing a Democratic Governor. Right to Life Party leaders had come to him because he had been active in the anti-abortion cause, including picketing abortion clinics, and because he has been a formidable vote-getter, at least in Nassau County. He had unprecedented five-party endorsement the last two elections as District Attorney. His running mate, Mr. Droleskey, is a 34-year-old former seminarian and political-science professor at Illinois State University during the week and an adjunct professor at St. John's University on Saturdays. He said that he had alternated in the past between Republican and Right to Life Party membership. He is a graduate of Oyster Bay High School and St. John's College and has advance degrees from the University of Notre Dame and a doctorate from the State University of New York at Albany. He said he had made a 50-page rebuttal speech at Hofstra University to Governor Cuomo's speech on abortion at the University of Notre Dame. ''Brevity is not my long suit,'' he said. The party endorsed Senator D'Amato, as it did six years ago, because of his anti-abortion position and his support for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court decision permitting virtually unrestricted abortion. Mr. King has been active in the anti-abortion movement and with Mr. Dillon has been very active in behalf of civil rights for Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland. He has appeared with Mr. Dillon at several meetings. Senator D'Amato, though, keeps his distance from his Right to Life running mates. Mrs. Tobin, the candidate for comptroller, is a nurse when she is not working in politics. She was state chairman of the Right to Life Party until last week, when after four years she was replaced by Lena Harknett of Greenlawn, the first state chairman of the party not from Nassasu County. She has been party secretary for the last two years. Ellen McCormack was the Right to Life Party's first state chairman and co-founder. She ran for President on the Right to Life Party line in New York in 1980. Mrs. Harknett said Mrs. McCormack was withdrawing from the party leadership. The Long Island cast of the party is also reflected in the enrollment figures. Of 21,606 enrollees statewide, 2,452 are from Suffolk and 2,048 from Nassau - the two counties with the most Rightto Life members in the state. Between them, the counties account for just under 21 percent of the total statewide membership. The party has slowly increased its enrollees despite its slip at the polls in 1982. In that year, there were 15,739 members. Four years before that there were 90 - 29 of them in Nassau and none in Suffolk - when the party first started. Other counties with relatively large enrollments are Erie, 1,936; Kings (Brooklyn), 1,694; Queens, 1,389, and Westchester, 1,357. Mr. Dillon said he had done some traveling upstate, although raising money to support such campaigning is a major problem. The District Attorney, whose wife, Anne, staffs the campaign headquarters in Oceanside, said that about $33,000 had been raised toward a goal of $100,000. Mr. Dillon said that such a sum would allow a statewide radio advertising campaign just before the election. The thrust of the campaign is that there are 150,000 abortions a year in the state, with about 45,000 of them paid for by public funds through Medicaid. Acknowledging that he might be vulnerable in a future Democratic primary for district attorney, the 52-year-old Mr. Dillon, a career law-enforcement official, said he was considering switching to the Republican Party. But most political abservers say they believe he is more likely to hurt the Republicans than the Democrats in November by siphoning votes from the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate for Governor and a Fordham College and law school classmate of Mr. Dillon. Mr. O'Rourke takes the same position on abortion as Mr. Dillon, but is not emphasizing it in his campaign. It was that decision by Mr. O'Rourke that spurred Mr. Dillon to run in order to keep abortion before the voters. Mr. Dillon describes himself as a ''progressive Democrat'' who agrees with Governor Cuomo on almost every issue except abortion and what he says is Mr. Cuomo's ''going along'' with homosexual activists who want the law to specifically include them as potential victims of discrimination. ''They have the same constitutional rights as we all have,'' Mr. Dillon said, arguing that there should be no special treatment for homosexuals. On another emotional issue, the death penalty, Mr. Dillon said that he basically agrees with Governor Cuomo's position in favor of life sentences without parole for premeditated murder. He said that from his ''practical experience'' as a prosecutor rather than as a moral conviction, he has opposed the death penalty because of the possibility of error and the difficulty of obtaining convictions when life is at stake. He said, though, that if the Legislature passed the death-penalty bill if he were Governor, he would sign it because the life-without-parole position has failed to pass the Legislature. He said that with the Governor and the Legislature at loggerheads on both the death penalty and life without parole, ''we wind up with a weak law.'' He said that ''we have to have a more severe penalty than 15 years for murder.'' Mr. Dillon said he considered Mr. Cuomo ''the outstanding guy in public life until I saw how he handled the abortion issue.'' Mr. Cuomo, while noting that he is personally opposed to abortion, has said that it is the law of the land because of the Supreme Court decision. He also supports Medicaid financing of abortion on the ground that the poor should be entitled to abortions as long as they are legal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AMERICA'S PROFILE SHIFTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/magazine/america-s-profile-shifts.html,"AT THE TIME of the 1980 census, the center of population in the United States was in a forest a mile west of the small town of De Soto, Mo., and 40 miles southwest of the Gateway Arch in downtown St. Louis. The center has been moving westward since the first census, in 1790, when it was 23 miles east of Baltimore. During most of this century it proceeded slowly through rural areas in southern Indiana and Illinois. But between 1970 and 1980 it took a leap westward and a plunge southward across the Mississippi River, signifying that the typical American was no longer a Northerner. The Northeast and the Middle West together had 108 million people; the South and West, 118 million. The trend has continued into the 1980's, with the center of population moving toward Oklahoma. But the 1980 center is a fitting place to stop and observe how people and commerce in every region have broken through the suburbs of large cities and are establishing new settlements of low density independent of the urban centers that once held outlying areas within their orbits. The new growth is occurring so far out from the cities - 60 miles in all directions from New York, for example - and is accompanied by so much economic development that traditional ties to cities and suburban rings are no longer so evident. The once-mighty cities have come apart, and, in effect, pieces of them are marching out across the countryside without a center or direction. There is no indication that the march will stop soon, if at all. This scattering of population - which is also occurring around small towns, in retirement communities and along seashores and lake shores - is having an important impact on the way Americans view their nation and the world beyond, on the kind of governments Americans elect, on the use of resources, on the development of transportation systems, on the way time and money are spent. The new low-density development, neither suburban nor rural, but a mixture of the two, is in essence a new form of American community. Mohave County, Ariz., a stretch of desert divided from California by the Colorado River, is one case in point. In 1960, the county had a population of 7,736. By 1986, it had an estimated total of 76,700, 21,000 of them having arrived since the 1980 census. The county's growth started as a retirement and recreation community, with people from the East settling in Lake Havasu City. The young survived at first on services provided for retirees, but many of them soon developed light industries, such as Hydro-Dynamics, which manufactures fitted sheets for water beds. In politics, Mohave County seems to outdo the rest of the state in pursuit of conservatism. When Ronald Reagan won Arizona in 1984 with two-thirds of the vote, Mohave County gave him 71 percent. But party affiliation does not mean much, with Republicans and Democrats voting pretty much alike. Jefferson County, south of St. Louis, is even more of a paradigm for the trend. The county was the center of that April 1980 census, and is in the path of a population march from a once-great urban center. St. Louis has in recent years had an unusual attraction for people interested in cities and where people choose to live, perhaps because it provides a vivid example of what is happening across the nation. As its arch celebrates, St. Louis was for many years a gateway from East to West, the jumping-off place for settlers of the western wilds. It was also a place between regions, never quite becoming eastern, northern, southern or western. As an industrial city, it was like the North, with belching factories, strong labor unions and high density. As a cultural center it was like the East, with families of great wealth, well-endowed private universities and a strong emphasis on the arts. As a city conservative in both life style and political outlook - and surrounded by the rural farm belt - it was like the South. In its need for space, to break the binds of an Old World city, it was like the West. With all of these characteristics, it was vulnerable to social and economic currents. In the 1960's it became a laboratory for urbanologists trying to discover why the United States could not make its cities work. In 1950, its population had reached a peak of 857,000, but the decline had already begun. Displaced blacks and whites from southern farms and plantations, poorly educated and unaccustomed to city life, found housing in the old central city already on the way to decay. Middle-class whites, aided by government-subsidized mortgages for new housing in the suburbs, moved out in great numbers. Layer after layer of small suburban municipalities spread out into St. Louis County and beyond, choking the old city in its 19th-century boundaries. St. Louis became a case study in failed social programs and the inability of cities to absorb the concentrated pathology imposed on them of chronic crime and poverty. The black middle class joined whites in the suburbs, within the confined corridors that would accept them. By 1980, the population of St. Louis had declined to 453,000, almost exactly what it had been in 1890, and has dropped even further since then. St. Louis, like many other cities, has settled into an uneasy but quiet stalemate, accepting a subordinate role within the metropolitan area. Like other cities, there has been restoration of old neighborhoods by white professionals, and new construction downtown and along the riverfront to serve as the financial, legal, entertainment and tourist center for the metropolitan area. But the great majority of those who use these facilities live outside the city boundaries. Fifteen miles northwest of St. Louis, in St. Charles County, a different kind of development is taking place, so rich in industry and commerce that it is largely independent of the city and its suburbs. The county's growth has occurred chiefly around the little city of St. Charles, population 41,000, which for years was known as a quaint town beyond the St. Louis municipal airport. But after the 1980 census, St. Charles persuaded the Federal Government to classify it as another central city within the metropolitan area, which, aside from making it eligible for certain Federal aid, served as recognition that it was no longer a satellite but the cen-ter of an area with its own economic and population base. The Federal Government has created a number of these so-called consolidated metropolitan areas, which encompass more than one central city. And in the case of St. Charles, at least, the reclassification seemed in line with reality. Economic development has followed an interstate highway corridor that runs westward through farms, towns and villages. Homes are in small municipalities, townships and subdivisions scattered for miles on either side of the corridor. In the 1970's, half of all newcomers to the area settled outside municipalities. The pattern is similar in such metropolitan areas as Atlanta and Phoenix, where development has reached so far out from the center that employers frequently have trouble finding people to fill part-time service jobs that the unemployed in the central cities would gladly fill if they could. Public transportation is seldom available in these areas, where the trademark is the freeway, cutting through scenic areas and land more profitable for development than agriculture. The Nashville metropolitan area, with a population of less than a million, is spread over eight counties and 4,000 square miles. Even the Grand Ole Opry has moved out of the central city. It seems fitting that the nation's country-music center should reach out into the nooks and hollows. But more important than the culture, according to city officials, are the three interstate highways that intersect in the city, sending out spokes in six directions, and the terrain - the meandering Cumberland River, lakes, state parks, wildlife areas and wooded hills. W HEN DAWN breaks over Nash County, on the North Carolina coastal plain, the rustic landscape at first seems remote and hushed. On a winter's day, the gray sky blends with the wet, slate-colored soil and the umber woods and meadows. Old tobacco barns made of logs and clay dot the fields and gently rolling hills. By sunup, however, the net-work of new blacktop roads that lace the county's 552 square miles are alive with vehicles. They come from the hills and hollows, from the towns and villages, from old farmhouses, from rural subdivisions and mobile-home parks. They have destinations that are as scattered as the dwellings they leave each morning - textile mills, small factories that make furniture, hospital equipment, safety locks or automobile parts, retail stores, fast-food outlets and offices in the towns, in shopping malls and along the highways. This scene is duplicated from Cape Hatteras to the Smoky Mountains, 500 miles away. More than any other state, North Carolina pioneered scattered growth away from cities and suburbs, and no other state has retained as much of its older landscape in the process of industrialization and economic growth. By the time low-density growth outside the urban areas began to be noticeable elsewhere, it was an established way l life inororth Carolina and is still growing and spreading. With a population of six million, North Carolina is now the 10th-largest state in the nation. A larger percentage of its work force, about 35 percent, is engaged in manufacturing than any other state, yet it has no cities of the size found in other industrial states. Charlotte, at 350,000, is the largest, but no other is above 200,000. There are, of course, many square miles of suburbs that have, as elsewhere in the nation, obliterated everything in their path. Yet these, too, are less massive than in other states, and a traveler notices that they soon give way to scattered development that has left many farms, forests, villages and old buildings intact. This is the essence of North Carolina, and some authorities, such as John D. Kasarda, an urban sociologist at the University of North Carolina, believe that much of the nation will look like this by the 21st century. There is much evidence to support his views. A dozen years ago, a group of reporters probing the burgeoning suburbs of America found that a suburban dweller in, say, Orange County, Calif., was in effect a resident of a vast suburban complex rather than a particular municipality. One would have a home in Garden Grove, go to school in Irvine, work in Santa Ana, belong to a coun-try club in Fullerton and go to Laguna Beach on weekends, all without ever identifying with one community over the other. Identity was with the larger complex, the seemingly unending expanse of subdivisions, shopping centers and freeways. This, of course, was in sharp contrast to life in the old cities, where people identified with particular neighborhoods, even if much of their time was spent elsewhere. In North Carolina, something of that mentality has always been in evidence, though there is more diversity and more space there than in the endless suburbs. A North Carolinian is likely to call himself a resident of the Piedmont, that stretch of plateau that extends for more than 100 miles from Raleigh to Charlotte. I T HAPPENED FIRST IN North Carolina both by accident and design. In the 19th century, when agriculture was predominant in the economy, North Carolina, more than most states, was made up of small, individually owned farms and small towns. To take advantage of a scattered labor force, manufacturers of furniture, apparel and textiles strung out their plants along the railroad lines that traversed the Piedmont crescent, and people took jobs in these factories without giving up their farms. Later, under state policy, industrialization followed the same pattern. Under a succession of progressive governors, including Terry Sanford and James B. Hunt Jr., the state worked to keep the new growth scattered, building hardtop roads into the most remote communities, decentralizing the state university system over 16 campuses and offering vocational education geared to the needs of local industries. The purpose was to avoid displacement of people to large cities and the problems associated with massive urban complexes. State policy consciously sought to keep the state a place where, as one commentator put it, every resident ''could always find a quiet corner.'' When I visited Nash County in 1980 to investigate the new growth taking place beyond the suburbs, Robert L. Bridwell, then the young planning director for the county, showed me a map with red pins designating new subdivisions. His map looked as if it had measles. Bridwell took me on a tour of the county, and it was a good thing he was along. I would never have found some of the subdivisions on my own. There was very little new housing in the towns, which maintained their 19th- century appearance, with little downtowns struggling to stay alive. For low-income families, there were small houses on small lots, a hundred or so bunched together in typical suburban density, but surrounded by forests and farms, and miles from the closest shopping center. For those with higher incomes, there were larger houses on lots of five to 10 acres, equally remote from commercial development. Mobile homes and houses of all sizes stood along the roads or tucked away in wooded pockets. Although Interstate 95, the main highway between New York and Florida, cuts through Nash County, travelers never see these new developments, hidden as they are behind the dark forests on either side of the highway. In the late afternoon, we arrived at an intersection to watch the homeward-bound traffic. Observing the lines of cars and pickups disappear into the byways, Bridwell said: ''It's the land. It gives them a sense of security.'' A well-to-do woman of the Piedmont told me: ''Nobody lives in town anymore. They all live in the country.'' By that, she meant the bankers, lawyers, merchants and many other middle-class people. At the same time, many poor people, especially blacks, have left the land to live in town. The switch has not been that simple or complete, of course. Stately old homes in town still appeal to many with higher incomes and many of the poor remain on the land. Yet in North Carolina, as elsewhere, those moving into newly developing areas of low density tend to be more affluent and better-educated than the native population, whether they are retirees from cities and suburbs or young adults seeking new opportunities and life styles. In the process, they are changing the politics, making those areas more conservative in the sense of spurning government regulation and subsidies. President Reagan's call for a return to volunteerism and less government finds friendly audiences there. In recent years, North Carolina has been growing increasingly conservative politically. Much of this, of course, can be attributed to economic and social factors that are larger than one state's boundaries. The conservatism that has blossomed in North Carolina is akin to that found in virtually all of the new-growth areas of low density, whether in New England, the Middle West, the South or the West. In North Carolina, this conservatism is more pervasive only because it is not offset by the large urban centers found in most other states, which tend to foster a more liberal political stance. The ideology of the new outlying areas is, first, that of indifference to urban problems, whether they be in Charlotte, Los Angeles or New Jersey's old suburbs. This is the result in part of the fact that such problems as the concentration of poor minorities in old, decayed neighborhoods seem very remote to those who live and work in these outlying places. It is also due to an individual independence that accompanies the scattered new growth. A factory worker with five acres of soybeans and a vegetable garden growing behind his home feels less need for government assistance, whether for himself or others, nor is he easily recruited into a labor union that tells him his wages are too low. No matter that people like himself once joined with the big-city political machines in support of Federal programs for low-income people. That kind of rural-urban coalition, born of desperation for a better life, no longer exists in this country. The new ideology in an era of general prosperity, especially for those who are young and able, is a form of self-reliance - a self-reliance that nevertheless accepts price supports for tobacco as acceptable and different from welfare handouts. In the new American heartland, the underground economy flourishes, with the barter of goods and services among neighbors enriching the economy without ever being reported to the Government or entering economic statistics. The social issues of the new right - opposition to abortion, homosexuality, and the proposed equal-rights amendment for women, and advocacy of prayer in public schools - also have taken root in most of the areas of scattered growth. Those areas, particularly in the South, have many fundamentalist churches that support ''traditional'' family values, and they make up a particularly fertile field for the array of television evangelists who address themselves to the same causes and can be seen on the screen at all hours in the most remote places. The new heartland was tailor-made for President Reagan's vision of America, of a return to an earlier day of private initiative, reduced government services, patriotism, optimism, close-knit families, volunteerism and elevation of religion in public affairs. A few weeks before the 1984 Presidential election, Geraldine A. Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate from Queens, spoke on the tree-lined downtown mall at Raleigh. She electrified an audience of several thousand with a slashing attack on Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina as an extremist and with a call for renewed assistance to the poor, strong enforcement of civil rights for minority groups and women, a renewal of pluralism and separation of church and state. In the audience were blacks, labor unionists, feminists, social activists for causes ranging from a nuclear freeze to job programs for the central cities - the interests that have made up traditional liberal coalitions for the last two decades. But the excitement she created did not travel far beyond the downtown streets. Across the state, her message was anathema to many. Supporters of Senator Helms found that the worst epithet they could hurl at the popular Governor Hunt was that he was a supporter of the causes advanced by the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. It was a kind of conservatism not envisioned by leaders who wanted to keep North Carolina as a place where everyone could find a quiet corner. Under different circumstances it could have taken another form, perhaps the kind of conservatism embraced by the late Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr., a proponent of civil liberties for citizens against government intrusion, whether that intrusion took the form of questionable restraints on business or imposing the teachings of one religion on all, as with abortion and school prayer. But there could be no mistaking that the kind of low-density growth pioneered by North Carolina encouraged a movement away from the kind of liberal Democratic politics that had been on the rise for half a century. S O STRONG ARE THE forces that have brought about the dispersal of people and commerce throughout the country in recent years that there is little reason to believe Americans any time soon will go back to the more traditional settlement patterns. The advance of technology, the change from a manufacturing to a service and information-based economy and the accumulation of private wealth have made it possible for people and commerce to settle pretty much where they please. Continuing dispersal has both negative and positive implications, aside from the political and economic effects. On the negative side, it raises questions as to whether the nation, already faced with deteriorated public facilities, can afford to build and repair enough pipes, roads and buildings to serve an increasingly dispersed population, to say nothing of the encroachment on the natural environment. On the other hand, to stop the development would frustrate one of the deepest yearnings of the American soul - to strike out in search of a new life in new places, to own a piece of land and have easy access to nature. Probably the major challenge that the new growth presents is to find ways to avoid the mistakes of the past, which resulted in seemingly unending urban ugliness over much of our landscape, from Maine to California. Whether that challenge can be met is an open question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FAMILY AND ETHICS ARE BYWORDS IN '86 RACES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/us/family-and-ethics-are-bywords-in-86-races.html,"Candidates around the country and national strategists of both parties, appealing to the personal concerns of voters this fall, are putting a greater stress on moral issues and family values. In 1980 ''family, work and neighborhood'' were the bywords of Ronald Reagan's plea for a return to ''traditional values.'' Today many Democrats as well as Republicans are following a similar path as they discuss issues that are, in many ways, new to American politics. As the two parties try to refine their approach to these questions, the debate focuses on exactly what the government role ought to be in encouraging citizens to live by certain norms and what, if anything, government can do to strengthen families. For Republicans, the ''pro-family'' approach for more than a decade has been central to their effort to build support among former Democrats and voters who are less well off. Here in Oklahoma, the support of conservative religious activists with strong concerns about such issues was a key factor in the surprise victory of Don Nickles in his 1980 race for the Senate. He is making similar appeals as he seeks re-election this year against Representative Jim Jones, a Tulsa Democrat. Democrats Follow Suit Now Democrats are also paying more attention to such issues, aiming in part at improving their image in states like this, where many voters have come to see the party as ignoring the everyday concerns of basically conservative middle-class families. This month, for example, a new policy paper drawn up by the Democratic Policy Commission, under the auspices of the party's national committee, puts ''strengthening the family'' at the top of its list of priorities. At the same time, Democratic candidates and the panel's policy statement challenge the Republicans to support concrete programs to assist families and children. They also argue that the Republicans are not willing to adopt policies to cope with the fact that women are not likely to leave the work force. While many political candidates are wary of ''the politics of values,'' since it could alienate significant minorities in the electorate, the signs of its existence are many, and include these: * The rise of drugs as an issue has led to calls for a crackdown not only on sellers but on users. The joint address on drugs by the President and Nancy Reagan this month, which called for creating a climate of ''intolerance'' toward drug use, was a sign of a sharp change from past approaches, which generally laid heavy stress on compassion toward users and was wary of moral condemnation as a way of combating addiction. * Liberals have shown an increased interest in policies to strengthen family life and some, like Governor Cuomo of New York, have endorsed teaching ''values'' in public schools. For at least a decade, liberals have feared that such approaches might encroach on individual rights; now such fears coexist with a desire to appear more mainstream on family questions. * Some conservative thinkers have shown interest in what they call a conservative welfare state, which would use public funds to strengthen families and promote traditional values. Some proposals, like a major increase in the tax exemption for children, would significantly help the less well-off. * The growth of fundamentalist Protestant involvement in politics has bred a complex discussion over what role religion should play in public life. Some Fear a Move Away From Tolerance Talk of a return to traditional values is often associated with the religious right. And some civil libertarians and defenders of minority rights worry that the new mood may help undo what they regard as genuine progress in recent decades toward greater tolerance. David Kusnet, vice president of People for the American Way, a group that battles the religious right, says he and his allies are sympathetic with the search for ''ways to inject values in the public debate without being intolerant of the ideas of others.'' ''The key question,'' he said, ''is whether it's possible for schools to inculcate students with values that all Americans share, regardless of religion, without indoctrinating children with ideas that some groups share and others do not.'' Some of the proposals being made in the name of strengthening families are consistent with the longstanding goals of feminists and other advocates of equal rights, says Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado. The Democratic Congresswoman is co-sponsoring a bill that would require employers to give parents 18 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of a newborn baby, a newly adopted baby, or a seriously ill child or parent. She calls the proposal the kind of ''pro-family worker protection we need'' and says the legislation is a challenge to Republicans. ''For all their talk, the rhetoric of this Administration has not yet brought about a turnaround in the divorce rate,''' she said. ''You haven't seen any of the things that you were supposed to see if you talked about traditional values.'' Ms. Schroeder said her proposals reflected the enormous growth in the number of women in the work force and that government must consider the needs of women who are working because their their families cannot make ends meet without two incomes. Shifts in Population Underlie New Emphasis There is little question that demographic changes account for a good part of the new interest in child care and family issues. Besides the increasing proportion of women who work, there is also the sheer growth in the number of new parents in the ''baby boom'' generation - the very group that fueled so much of the revolt against traditional norms. Martin T. O'Connell, the chief of the fertility statistics branch at the Census Bureau, said that according to 1985 statistics, 78.2 percent of women now 30 to 39 years old had at least one child. In 1976 only 58.3 percent of the same women - they were then 21 to 30 years old - had children. ''There has been a 40 percent increase in the number of parents in that cohort in a nine-year period,'' Mr. O'Connell said. Ethel Klein, a professor of political science at Columbia University and the author of ''Gender Politics,'' argues that the demographic shift has led many feminists to a greater interest in child care and family issues. ''Women are looking for day care and other benefits because they will not accept the idea that they have to cease being women and mothers in order to pursue careers,'' Ms. Klein said. Alan Carlson, the president of the Rockford Institute, a think tank oriented to social conservatism, said that this demographic shift was also changing the social climate. As members of the baby boom have children of their own, he argued, their values on such issues as drug use and sexuality were likely to become more conservative. ''The definition of a social conservative,'' he said, ''is a liberal with a daughter in high school.'' The Right and Left Take Different Tacks Many conservatives welcome the new interest shown by liberals in the issues of family and values. Paul Weyrich, the president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation and a figure at the forefront of the New Right, is actively seeking the cooperation of Democrats in his new project on ''social conservatism.'' ''We're seeking a paradigm shift, a fundamental change in people's attitudes,'' he said. ''For that to happen, it has to be bipartisan.'' But conservatives for whom social values are central differ from both traditional Republicans and Democrats. Unlike some Republicans, Mr. Weyrich said, his allies are not afraid to use government social and welfare policy to promote families and traditional values. ''We say that there are government policies which affect the individual, the family, the society,'' he said. ''It is recognizing that government may have a role in this - providing that role does not get out of hand.'' But unlike many liberals, the strong social conservatives fundamentally oppose most of the changes in family life that took place in the 1960's and 1970's. They oppose the new tolerance shown toward homosexuality and abortion, for example, and think ''permissiveness'' and a lack of personal discipline are root causes of what they see as the current crisis of values. Mr. Carlson worries that liberals who are increasingly aware of the importance of family issues may outflank conservatives. ''We really have to get our act together, our analyses together,'' he said, adding that liberals, by linking pro-family concerns with feminist concerns, may achieve some goals that are precisely opposed to the conservative agenda. At the same time, the rush to embrace such issues is worrisome to Ann F. Lewis, the executive director of the liberal Americans for Democratic Action. She says she fears that the Democratic Party might water down its commitment to equal rights for women, choice on abortion and concern for single mothers and homosexuals. But she added that the party did have to deal with the perception that ''we were straying too far from the common experiences of most people.'' ''We're consciously using the language of values,'' she said. ''We are re-establishing a connection with the electorate that we allowed to get frayed.'' A shared concern is the issue of urban poverty. Among liberals and conservatives alike, discussions of poverty now focus much more heavily on the structure of the family than they did a decade ago. Issues Could Pose Risk To Reagan Coalition Politically, the debate over values may pose a threat to the new Republican coalition built by President Reagan, politicians and analysts say. Mr. Reagan's coalition brings together socially liberal and often secular young professionals, who liked the President's economic policies, and less well off and often deeply religious social conservatives, who admired his defense of traditional values. William Schneider, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argues that in its potential for instability, the Reagan coalition is akin to the New Deal coalition in the 1930's and 1940's, which brought together blacks in the North and segregationists in the South. ''The word you could not mention in the New Deal coalition was 'race,' '' Mr. Schneider said. ''The word you cannot mention in the Reagan coalition is 'religion.' '' Many Republicans fear that the more attention that is focused on values and religious issues, the harder it will be to keep the Reagan alliance intact. ''You have to be a social conservative, but a tolerant social conservative,'' said an influential Republican Congressional aide. ''It's a hard thing to pull off.'' From the Democrats' perspective, said Edward H. Crane, president of the libertarian-oriented Cato Institute, the worst mistake the Democrats could make would be to abandon social tolerance and embrace values politics too closely. Mr. Crane argues that for younger, baby-boom voters, social liberalism is the most appealing part of the Democrats' agenda. But politicians like Mr. Cuomo, who has been a leader in the invocation of traditional values in the defense of the welfare state, see the politics of values as the wave of the future, partly because so many Americans believe the country is staring into a moral ''vacuum.'' ''You begin sounding religious, moralistic, unctious and that's why people stay away from discussing this,'' the Governor said. ''But we've got to give it a try.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON TALK; POLITICS; GETTING THE YOUNG WHERE THEY LIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/29/us/washington-talk-politics-getting-the-young-where-they-live.html,"Later this fall, rock music radio stations in about a dozen states will start running some unusual commercials. Instead of promoting a certain brand of beer or blue jeans, these commercials will be pushing a particular brand of politician, Republican, to be exact. These spots, plus others planned for television, will form the centerpiece of a major Republican effort this year to appeal to voters still in their 20's. Many of these young voters cast their first ballots in 1984 for Ronald Reagan, and the Republicans think these voters can help swing some of the closer races that will determine control of the Senate this year. The problem is that younger people usually vote in notoriously low numbers. So the main purpose of the Republican campaign will be motivating them to get involved in the political process. ''We believe that this voting group - if they vote - will vote for us,'' said Terry Wade, spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Benefits 'in Years to Come' Moreover, Republican strategists see possible dividends in the future. As Haley Barbour, director of political affairs in the White House, said: ''People who get attached to your party in their 20's are much more likely to to vote for your party in years to come.'' Through the 1960's and early 1970's, when liberal ideas were more popular with the young, the Democrats made similar efforts to energize the youth vote. Today they are dispatching speakers to colleges, but the Republicans are applying more resources to the appeal for young voters. ''The fact that this is being done by Republicans, and not Democrats, is the big news,'' said Joseph Gaylord, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Democrats acknowledge that a ''disturbing number of young people like the President,'' as Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, put it. But he insists that this personal popularity cannot be transferred to other Republican candidates, particularly when President Reagan is not on the ballot himself. Mr. Mitchell, who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, adds that on many social or personal issues, such as abortion, young voters ''tend to disagree'' with Mr. Reagan and the conservative Republican agenda. An Unmistakable Drift Nevertheless, the drift of young people into Republican ranks is unmistakable. Sixty-one percent of all first-time voters backed Mr. Reagan in 1984, according to the New York Times/CBS News Poll of voters, and a survey by the Republican Party last winter showed that 51 percent of voters 18 to 24 years old intended to support Republican candidates for Congress, while only 38 percent preferred Democrats. A Times/CBS News Poll last month found that when young voters were pushed to express a party preference, they favored the Republicans over the Democrats by a margin of 49 percent to 37 percent. One reason for this trend is what Mr. Gaylord calls ''the optimism and opportunity thing,'' the belief among the young that Republicans are more likely to produce prosperity, while reducing taxes. For instance, Stephanie Johnigan, a psychology student in Chicago who has two children, describes herself as a Democrat, but said, in a follow-up interview to the Times/CBS News Poll, ''There's more movement, there's more money around when the Republicans are in office.'' 'My Pocketbook Is Only So Big' Deeann Hale, a nurse in Minnetonka, Minn., said: ''While I believe in a lot of what the Democrats stand for, I think it's really the Republicans that are looking out for our future financially. My pocketbook is only so big, and I come first.'' The second major factor in the Republicans' success, says Mr. Gaylord, is ''the pride factor,'' the feeling that America ''is not getting kicked around anymore.'' Accordingly, one theme of the radio and television commercials will be to stress the contrast between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, the only other President most young voters are familiar with. ''The message is, remember what things were like,'' said Barbara Pardue, communications director of the Republican Congressional Committee. The spots will also stress that voting is a ''patriotic, responsible thing to do,'' said Mr. Wade, the Republican National Committee spokesman. Young people will be told that ''voting is important to you personally, and important to your country,'' he said. The commercials will probably run in about a dozen states, mainly in the South, the Southwest and the West, where there are close Senate races. ''The survey data we have,'' Mr. Wade said, ''is that the Republican message is strong in these areas.'' The advertisements, which could cost several million dollars, are only one example of how the huge financial advantage enjoyed by Republicans could sway key Senate contests this fall. But the campaign for young voters has other elements as well. Leaflets and 'Hoopla' College Republicans are distributing leaflets at football games this fall, urging students to register to vote and, if necessary, obtain absentee ballots. Local campaigns will be staging what Mr. Gaylord calls ''hoopla activity,'' public events to convince the young that ''the campaign is alive.'' A memorandum from the Republican Congressional Committee urges candidates to court the youth vote by speaking at high schools, participating at career planning fairs, and printing fliers about job opportunities that carry an ''underlying message'' about the importance of voting. Mr. Reagan is using his campaign speeches to talk about issues, such as overhauling the tax code, that could appeal to new voters. And some settings for his talks, from a college campus to a marine base, are also aimed at the young. There is even talk of producing music videos with a get-out-the-vote theme. But even the Republicans are not sure the political world is ready for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IN OIL-POOR OKLAHOMA, ANGRY VOTERS LOOK FOR SCAPEGOATS AND FOR SAVIORS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/30/us/in-oil-poor-oklahoma-angry-voters-look-for-scapegoats-and-for-saviors.html,"Alexander Holmes, an economist at the University of Oklahoma, invokes the words of the country singer Kris Kristofferson to sum up the attitude here these days: ''The goin' up,'' the ballad proclaims, ''weren't worth the comin' down.'' In this election year, that just about says it all for a state that once claimed the world's largest Rolls-Royce dealership; a place where the lobbyists and legislators and oilmen used to feast in the red splendor of Junior's restaurant here and savor the days of $80-a-barrel oil to come. But oil is at $15 a barrel, the farmers are in trouble and unemployment in some counties is running at 15 to 25 percent. Statewide, it is 9.3 percent. This has made 1986 an unusual political year for Oklahomans, who are angry and looking for someone to blame and someone to save them. The election calendar has dealt them an unusual opportunity to do both. They will be voting in a closely watched Senate race, and they will be electing a new governor. In both races, the voters used the primaries to deal themselves a remarkable range of choices for both saviors and scapegoats. The man who best fits the role of Cincinnatus, coming off his farm to put things in order, is 65-year-old Henry Bellmon. A two-term United States Senator, the stocky, blunt-spoken Republican quit in 1980 because he really did not like life in the most exclusive club in the world. He preferred his previous job; in 1962 he became the first Republican elected governor of this state with a Dixiecrat heritage. Now, he's back, he says, because he would like to help his state out. ''The state's in a jam right now,'' he said. ''I believe we can't afford right now to elect a greenhorn governor who needs on-the-job training.'' 'Politicians Had Their Chance' The man Mr. Bellmon refers to as a ''greenhorn'' is 34-year-old David Walters. Though he has worked in state government and is backed by some supporters of the current Democratic Governor, George Nigh, Mr. Walters has never held elective office. This year, that turned out to be a prime qualification. ''The politicians have had their chance,'' he declared in advertising before the primary. ''Now it's our turn to lead Oklahoma.'' Mr. Walters, who made much of the fact that he had been in business, came in first in a bitter race, outpolling the Attorney General and favorite, Mike Turpen. After an even more bitter runoff, Mr. Walters emerged victorious by about 4,000 votes out of 467,000. That same runoff showed just how angry voters were, since they threw out four incumbent State Senators and forced the State Treasurer, Leo Winters, into a runoff. Mr. Winters, with more than two decades in his job, withdrew. Governor Nigh was probably lucky that he could not run for a third term. Once exceedingly popular - he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1958 and has, with one four-year rest, held that job or the governorship ever since - Mr. Nigh now finds himself sharing the blame for the bad times. The Senate race is something else. While Mr. Bellmon is a moderate conservative who has supported school busing and choice on abortion, his ticket-mate, Senator Don Nickles, is a prototype of the Republican New Right. Mr. Nickles was only 31 years old in 1980 when he was swept in with President Reagan, supported by church activists who admired his firm conservatism on just about every issue. And if the Democrats have a self-styled outsider as their gubernatorial candidate, they have one of Washington's most adept insiders running against Mr. Nickles. Jim Jones, the Congressman from Tulsa, got his start as a top aide to President Johnson, and as head of the House Budget Committee in 1981, he was the point man for Democrats in President Reagan's year of triumph on budget and tax matters. That experience is not helping Mr. Jones this year, because it ties him to the national Democratic leadership. A man who has spent much of his political life being criticized by liberal Democrats, he finds himself accused of being, of all things, ''a liberal.'' One effective Nickles television advertisement speaks of some of Mr. Jones's votes and concludes with a man who looks like a farmer saying: ''You know, Jim, if you talk like a liberal and act like a liberal and vote like a liberal, you're a liberal.'' Bellmon Sees a 'Centrist' State The campaign infuriates Mr. Jones, who is rated in the center or somewhat to the right of center by the ideological groups who study Congressional voting records. ''It's the same way the Nazis did it,'' he said in an interview. ''You take a big lie and repeat it.'' Clinton Key, Mr. Nickles's campaign manager, defended the attack, saying that Mr. Jones had to ''carry the water for the Democrats'' in Congress and was now paying for it. Besides, he said, conservative in Washington may not be conservative enough for Oklahoma. But Mr. Bellmon does not see his state as being as conservative as Mr. Key does - ''it's basically a centrist state,'' he said - which is why he is not worried about conservatives defecting to Mr. Walters. In a curious role reversal, it is Mr. Walters who is firmly for a ''right to work'' law that unions hate because it would ban the closed shop; Mr. Bellmon wants a referendum. And Mr. Bellmon has been more unequivocal in his promises not to cut education budgets. That is why the Republican is expected to get the backing of the teacher unions. The imponderable in both races is how Oklahomans decide to vent their outrage. The element of placing the blame at home has made the governor's race the center of voters' attention so far, even though the Senate candidates have been spending far more on television. Mr. Walters's best hope is that voters will continue to see him as the youthful outsider against a too-familiar Mr. Bellmon. But questions raised in the primary over $162,000 in loans Mr. Walters took for his campaign ''tarnished Walters's shining star,'' said Tom Cole, the Republican state chairman. 'Less Brilliance, More Wisdom' And Mr. Bellmon? He tells a story whose moral is that government needs ''a little less brilliance and a little more wisdom.'' Widely respected here for personal integrity, Mr. Bellmon is presenting himself as the safest bet for a state in trouble. In the Senate race, Mr. Nickles, who has proven more popular than Washington political experts expected, is clearly ahead. Democrats say private Republican polls show that the race is tightening substantially, but Republicans say those polls do not exist and that Mr. Nickles has a lead of 25 to 30 percentage points. One incumbent still popular in the state, the Democratic Senator David Boren, is now campaigning for Mr. Jones after a public - and for Mr. Jones, embarassing - disagreement over a Jones campaign commercial. But the key question, here as elsewhere, is whether Oklahomans turn some of their ample anger toward Washington and the Republicans. ''I see it coming,'' said Mr. Jones, whose chances depend on just that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DISMISSED STUDENT IS SUING STANFORD FOR LIBEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/30/us/dismissed-student-is-suing-stanford-for-libel.html,"A former student who was expelled from a Stanford University doctoral program on grounds of illegal and unethical conduct in a research project filed a civil lawsuit today charging the university with seriously damaging his professional reputation. The former student, Steven W. Mosher, who was expelled from the anthropology program in 1983 in connection with research in a villaqe in China, accused the university and officials there of breach of contract, libel, slander and violation of his First Amendment right of free speech. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court here, asks that Mr. Mosher, who was recently named director of the Asian Studies Center at the Claremont Institute in southern California, be reinstated in the doctoral program. The suit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money in damages, also asks that the defendants publicly retract any negative statements about Mr. Mosher's professional conduct. Stanford Denies Allegations In a statement issued by Stanford University in response to the suit, Iris Brest, a staff attorney for the university, said Stanford's investigation of charges against Mr. Mosher had been fair. Mr. Mosher, 38 years old, maintains that the real reason he was expelled was because of pressure brought to bear on the university by the Chinese Government because of an article he had published in a Taiwan news magazine. He contends that the article disclosed excesses in China's birth control program, including forced abortions on women who were in their seventh and eighth months of pregnancy. The Chinese cut off access to rural areas to other scholars after the article was published. Members of the university's anthropology department voted to drop Mr. Mosher from the doctoral program in February 1983. The decision was upheld after reviews by a special faculty committee and later by the dean of the graduate school. Appeal Is Rejected An appeal by Mr. Mosher was rejected by Stanford's president, Donald Kennedy, in 1985. In a 76-page letter, Mr. Kennedy said that while it was ''very likely true'' that Mr. Mosher's article had angered the Chinese, he was expelled because he had ''destroyed the confidence'' of Stanford officials that he could objectively and fairly report events and behave professionally in the field. ''You persist in adopting a manipulative and strategic mode of interaction, never acknowledging error however clear it may be,'' Mr. Kennedy wrote. Mr. Kennedy, a defendant in the suit along with the university and members of the anthropology department, cited several instances of what he called unprofessional or deceptive conduct by Mr. Mosher. For example, he said, Mr. Mosher conducted research near Canton when he was supposed to be writing his dissertation about a fishing village in Taiwan. He said Mr. Mosher then submitted a ''popular ethnography of China instead of a scholarly demographic study of Taiwan'' as his dissertation. Mr. Kennedy also accused Mr. Mosher of deliberately lying about his fabrication of a sales receipt for expensive camera equipment that he said he had bought with research grant funds. He said Mr. Mosher refused to return the equipment to the university as required by school policy. An investigation by the university concluded that grant funds may have been used to buy a truck for the village Mr. Mosher was studying. At a news conference today, Mr. Mosher maintained that he did not have to return the camera equipment to Stanford and admitted buying the truck with grant and stipend funds amounting to $4,000. He said he left the truck with the village when he left in 1980 and it was ''construed as a bribe by Peking.'' In an interview with The New York Times in 1985, Mr. Mosher said his former wife and her clan who lived in the village actually purchased the truck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questions Raised by the New Reproductive Biology,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/opinion/l-questions-raised-by-the-new-reproductive-biology-197786.html,"To the Editor: If King Solomon were alive today, he would be sorely vexed. As the case of Baby M, the child born last March to a surrogate mother who did not want to give her up, so clearly demonstrates, the new technology of reproduction has far outstripped the capacity of the legal system to deal with it. Advances in medical technology over the last decade have given us three new techniques of conception: artificial insemination, where a male donor's sperm is used to impregnate a woman; in vitro fertilization-embryo transplant, where a woman's ova are removed, fertilized outside her body and then transferred back into her or into another woman, and surrogate motherhood, where a woman impregnated through artificial insemination or an embryo transplant will bear a child on the understanding that she will give it up to another at birth. The new biology, a blessing to the one couple in six in this country unable to conceive, raises profound legal and ethical issues, with which courts and legislatures are just beginning to grapple. Can a couple who contracted with a surrogate mother order her to stop drinking and smoking during pregnancy? Can a father by artificial insemination demand visitation rights? Or can he be sued for child support? Does a single woman have the same right as a married woman to be artificially inseminated? Should eggs fertilized by in-vitro procedures, but not transplanted, be destroyed? If they are saved, to whom do they belong? What happens if nobody wants a baby born to a surrogate mother? What happens, as with Baby M, when a surrogate mother refuses to give up the baby? With more than 10,000 births a year attributable to artificial insemination, more than 1,000 children by in-vitro fertilization since the world's first test-tube baby in 1978 and an increasing number of surrogate maternities (exact numbers are hard to come by), these complex questions will be raised more and more. There is a clamor for legislation to make the answers standardized and more predictable. But the new reproductive biology is an area legislators should hesitate to enter at this time. First, the cases that arise are often unique and sometimes bizarre. They are better left to courts to settle individually by applying general principles to particular circumstances. Like the technology, the law should be permitted to evolve. Second, history has demonstrated that government should keep out of reproductive matters. The controversy about birth control and abortion clearly shows the negative effects of governmental intrusions. Some regulation is desirable, for example, screening of sperm donors for inheritable diseases or for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but it should be kept to a minimum. Two general principles should guide cases involving the new reproductive biology. The first is the paramount importance of the right of privacy, i.e., the constitutional right of individuals to make their own decisions about fundamental personal matters, such as having a baby or not. It would follow that the new reproductive technologies should be considered legal, including surrogate motherhood, which has been banned in some states as baby selling. The second principle is the importance of informed consent and honoring the intentions of the parties. Where, for example, a sperm donor intended to remain anonymous and not be responsible for the expenses of child rearing, he should not be made to do so. Similarly, where it is the intention of the parties that a surrogate mother will bear a child for an infertile couple, and all the parties give their informed consent to the arrangement, that intent should be honored even if one of the parties has a change of heart. These principles will not resolve all the issues raised by the new reproductive biology. However, applied with an understanding that technological advances create new human problems, they can help create a climate where law will be able to catch up with science. STEPHEN L.

Required Reading; Religion in Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/02/us/required-reading-religion-in-politics.html,"In a speech at the University of Missouri, on Sept. 17, Education Secretary William J. Bennett criticized those who contend ''religious faith gives them a monopoly on political truth'' as engaging in ''invidious sectarianism.'' He cited the case of ''a public figure'' who ''recently said that Christians feel more strongly about love of country, love of God and support for the traditional family than do non-Christians.'' Such sectarianism should be ''renounced in the strongest terms,'' Mr. Bennett said. The unidentified public figure was the Rev. Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, who on that day announced he might seek the Republican nomination for President. Here are excerpts from their recent exchange of letters, provided by Mr. Bennett's office. Robertson to Bennett, Sept. 19: Although we have been personal friends and you have access to me at anytime you wish, you made no effort to clarify whether or not I said the things attributed to me, or whether indeed in the middle of a heated press conference, I had been guilty of a slip of the tongue. The truth is, as you must know only too well by now, is that what I said was distorted. What in heaven's name provoked you to lash out at a simple statement by a fellow Reagan supporter who merely said that maybe Evangelical Christian people supported Ronald Reagan's issues more strongly than others. Do you really feel that the Democratic platform, which advocated abortion on demand, special rights for gays and lesbians, a reduced role for America's defense and the elimination of prayer and the Bible from our schools, was as fervent in its support for God, country and traditional family values as was the Republican platform of 1984? In short, on this issue it seems that you may not have done your homework as well as I have on the attitudes of the American people. You shot from the hip and in doing so you have done me and the Republilcan Party a disservice. Speaking as a friend, in all candor I think a statement of clarification -Lord willing an apology - would certainly be in order. Bennett to Robertson, Sept. 23: As I believe you know, two researchers from my office had checked the accuracy of the statement with your office, so I had no reason to think that the newspapers had misrepresented your views. Nor had we learned of any correction or clarification on your part. So I used your statement as an example of the kind of sectarianism that should, I think, be rejected. If the statements I cited do not correctly characterize your view, then I would suggest that by all means you should clarify it. I, for one, would welcome such a clarification. The heart of my view is this: ''On the one hand, religion should never be excluded from public debate. But on the other, it should never be used as a kind of divine trump card to foreclose further debate.'' Let me add, Pat, that I am troubled by anyone who celebrates electoral success by writing, ''The Christians have won,'' or ''What a breakthrough for the Kingdom!'' This is just the sort of statement that I think should be avoided. I am not alone in sensing some ambiguity in your position on the role of religion in politics. And I think that not only I, but many Americans, would welcome some elaboration on your part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AT THE MOVIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/movies/at-the-movies.html,"IN ''Menage,'' the new film by Bertrand Blier, Michel Blanc plays a down-on-his-luck Frenchman - in love with a wife who despises him - who is slowly seduced by a burly energetic thief who sets out to teach him how to enjoy life. Mr. Blanc won the best actor prize at Cannes for his portrayal of Antoine, the downtrodden little man who fights to hold on to his heterosexuality with the nervous tenacity of a fox terrier and is finally overwhelmed by a homosexual passion that transforms his idea of who he is. By the end, when Antoine dresses as a woman to go dancing, the audience sees something more than the usual scene in which a man dons a woman's clothing. Nor is Mr. Blanc playing a transvestite. He actually took it upon himself to attempt to play a woman. ''I think that at the beginning Antoine tries to fight against what seems to be happening to him,'' he said. ''He feels guilty. But when he suddenly puts on those clothes I think he's just happy being a woman. Suddenly he wants to be loved so much he really psychologically becomes a woman. The guilt disappears. ''In my acting I played this consciously. I thought there was no use to have pain in his eyes. The woman's clothes are liberating. The technical problem was to try to act not as a homosexual or a transvestite, but as a woman. The only thing I had in mind was not to make a judgment on what was happening. I think women are more dedicated to life than men are - they know better how to deal with desperate ideas, and love is the most desperate idea.'' The actor said he asked his girlfriend to help him with the part, practicing how to sit and walk. He said he found the role exciting and difficult: ''It's painful for a man to be dressed for 8 to 10 hours a day as a woman. You can't relax between shots. Even if you take off those terrible shoes, you feel very uncomfortable, troubled, confused and people don't react the same way to you. Even people on the set felt threatened. All the crew acted totally differently when I arrived on the set with my dress.'' Mr. Blanc said that he was nervous when he accepted the part, because he was afraid of failing and looking ridiculous. ''It was like a dream to have this part to play,'' he said, ''but it could have turned into a nightmare.'' He said he thinks that the evolution in the character's development is crucial to the success of the film, which was shown this week at the New York Film Festival and is opening commercially today at the Cinema Studio 1. ''At the beginning he's always dominated, first by a woman and then by a man,'' Mr. Blanc said. ''He's like a man who can't swim and sinks to the bottom and pushes with his feet. He has new energy when he comes up as a woman. He can dominate this huge man. He finds a new power.'' The Way It Was In 1960's Denmark ''Twist and Shout,'' a Danish film about two youths who come of age in 1964, is a major box-office success in Denmark. Americans watching the film - aside from seeing a story about growing up, taking responsibility and maintaining hope even in bleak surroundings - might also notice that it contradicts the stereotype of Scandinavian society, thought of here as sexually liberated, classless and paternalistic. Instead, the movie shows a troubled environment, with large class differences, illegal and primitive abortion methods, individual isolation and regressive and neglectful treatment of mental illness. Is this a true vision of Denmark in the early 1960's? ''I think that the idea of real social democracy in Denmark was more a dream than a reality in those days,'' said the film's director, Bille August. ''We were so much dependent then, and are still, on the rest of Europe. The politicians are trying to build up more of a social democracy but they didn't really succeed. ''After 1968 many of the changes most people associate with Scandinavia came to Denmark, but now we have a right-wing party in power, which is trying to change things back again. People don't feel safe economically anymore. They are scared. They look to the old days as a time when things were better. In part I was trying to show these people that the 60's were not so fantastic - that they are looking back to a romantic rather than a real picture of what went before.'' Independent Film Makers Sell Their Wares at Market The American Independent Feature Film Market began an 11-day run of 41 feature-film screenings this week, as well as shorts, documentaries and works in progress, all aimed at finding both foreign and American distributors for independent films. The purpose of the market, according to Sam Kitt, director of the Independent Feature Project - the nonprofit organization that sponsors the event - is to be a bridge. ''These directors usually labor outside of conventional industry channels,'' Mr. Kitt said. ''We were created to give them a point of ingress to the marketplace because, after all, distribution and marketing is the final step in the communication process.'' The market is attracting additional interest this year as independent films - those movies that are not produced by Hollywood studios -have been earning awards ranging from Oscars (''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' ''The Trip to Bountiful'') to prizes at Cannes and showings at the New York Film Festival, which opened this year with ''Down by Law,'' an independent film. ''Down by Law'' will be shown again in the market to try to pick up additional foreign distribution. Last year such films as ''Sherman's March,'' ''We Were So Beloved'' and ''The Partisans of Vilna'' were shown and picked up for distribution. The screenings are not open to the public, but there will be several seminars that are. On Sunday, the market will offer a seminar at the Fashion Institute of Technology entitled ''Directing: Be Prepared,'' at which Frank Perry and other independent directors will speak. (Information: 496-0909.) ''This year we see a trend of noted actors being more and more open to independent work,'' said Mr. Kitt. Robin Williams, James Earl Jones, Geraldine Page and Linda Hunt will all appear in new independent films. 'Dead End Kids,' Alchemy to Nuclear Science One of the highlights of the Independent Feature Film Market is ''Dead End Kids,'' directed by JoAnne Akalaitis, already scheduled for a two-week run at the Film Forum 1 starting Nov. 5. The film is based on Ms. Akalaitis's play that was produced at the Public Theater in 1980. The avant-garde director-writer has, in collaboration with her Mabou Mines company, created a comedy about nuclear destruction. On a budget of $500,000, but achieving a more expensive look, the director has translated her play to the screen. The film follows the development of science from the 15th century to the 20th century, from alchemy to the Manhattan Project, and finally to the bombing of Hiroshima. ''It involves human beings in a search for knowledge that implies accumulating power,'' Ms. Akalaitis said. ''And because we're human the power gets out of control and the knowledge doesn't stay pure.'' Ms. Akalaitis said the biggest challenge was trying to make a movie that did not have a linear psychological story, where the story was history, in this case of nuclear power. One change from the play is a scene that features teen-age girls at a high-school science fair, shot in the style of a 1950's science information film. In the play, the same point was made by an exhibition of high school science projects in the theater's lobby. ''There was also a certain element of a 'cinema homage' to certain styles in film,'' Ms. Akalaitis said. ''In the Faust scene, I was thinking of Cocteau, and I tried to make the look of the press conference be reminiscent of Fassbinder, for example.'' Cinerama May Get A Second Chance Remember Cinerama? Developed by Fred Waller, this descendant of such processes as Cineorama, Polyvision and Vitarama celebrated its birthday on Sept. 30. Thirty-four years ago an audience sat in New York's Broadway Theater and watched Lowell Thomas, the producer of Cinerama's first three features, on a traditional screen talking about the development of the moving picture. Then the curtains opened and a vast three-section curved screen -75 feet across and 55 feet high -emerged. Reporters who covered the story said that the audience was stunned. ''This Is Cinerama,'' with its famous roller-coaster ride that made the viewer feel the thrill of sitting in its front seat, was an overnight sensation. For many reasons Cinerama did not have the spectacular future its opening seemed to augur. After the early 60's, it largely disappeared, leaving in its wake the single-lens, wide-screen process that movies have used ever since. George Condon, who worked for Lowell Thomas 30 years ago and is an impassioned devotee of the Cinerama process, is determined to bring it back. Mr. Condon said it took him four years to find the engineers he needed to redesign the Cinerama cameras and projectors. He hired them to design one projector and one camera instead of the three each required before. They are also working on perfecting close-ups - a goal that Mr. Condon says is two to three years away. When it's done, Mr. Condon intends to remake ''This Is Cinerama'' and install it in a Broadway theater. ''We can show vast America,'' he said. ''We can put a space camera on the shuttle, we can do ballet and opera, and it would give an exact vision of what you see onstage.'' Will the process fare any better this time? Mr. Condon says he thinks so. He is looking for more financial backers who agree with him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Wrong Way to Pick Judges,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/opinion/the-wrong-way-to-pick-judges.html,"It is sometimes said that a Federal judge is a lawyer who knew a senator. The cynical adage contains more than a grain of truth, since it describes the traditional mechanism for selecting candidates for the Federal bench: sponsorship by a senator of the incumbent President's political party. As a Republican conservative, I am personally distressed that the Reagan Administration is well on the way to compounding the worst features of a partisan spoils system. The Administration is going beyond mere political affiliation and is applying an ideological strain of such narrow gauge that it filters out the vast majority of American lawyers. There is no doubt that other Presidents have searched for judicial candidates who shared their vision of the Constitution or used political affiliation as a criterion for judicial selection. But there are several flaws in that claimed ''defense'' for this Administration's behavior. First, it distorts the historical record. While many Presidents, from George Washington forward, have considered a lawyer's overall constitutional philosophy in deciding whether to nominate him (or, occasionally, her), there are only rare instances in which a President focused on how a candidate would vote on a particular issue or type of issue. The Administration's repeated refrain that ''we won the elections'' is particularly misguided. The Constitution gives life tenure to Federal judges in order to assure that they are above the political fray. They are not supposed to be ''responsive'' to a particular quadrennial election. Elections are not referendums on the administration of justice. Nor do they license any President to reshape the constitutional system by creating a monolithic Federal judiciary. Second, most Presidents have sought prominent, experienced lawyers for judicial appointment, either through their own search processes or through senatorial proposals. Political affiliation has provided a source of recognition, not a litmus test for philosophical orthodoxy. Over time, this pattern has created a Federal judiciary rich in diversity and perspective. Today the message is quite different: ideology is the primary qualification, and it is a candidate's demonstrated orthodoxy that brings his name before the President and ultimately before the Senate. Unique in our nation's history, the current Justice Department has been processing any judicial candidate through a series of officials whose primary duty is to assess the candidate's ideological purity. One major reason why this Administration has chosen an unusually high percentage of law professors to serve on major appellate courts is that they are more likely than practicing lawyers to have committed themselves to a set of sharply defined doctrines. Thus, the Administration finds it easier to predict how they will vote. Although the President has promoted a number of judges of high quality by anyone's standards, the bitter fight over Daniel Manion's nomination vividly illustrated that the President now has to dip down further down into the barrel of ideologically screened lawyers. Mr. Reagan mobilized all of his prestige in order to force through the nomination of a lawyer whom only a bare majority of the A.B.A. evaluation committee considered minimally ''qualified.'' Yet the Manion nomination is simply the most glaring example of a distressing trend. Most of the President's early choices were - apart from their philosophy - mature, experienced, well-regarded lawyers. That supply apparently has been virtually exhausted, and Mr. Reagan is turning increasingly to marginal candidates with little seasoning or experience in the world of law practice, but full of ideological zeal. Third, after a succession of political scandals linked by the common defense that ''everybody does it,'' the President should offer a better excuse for his standards for choosing judges. The American people have a right to insist that a President who has the unique privilege of appointing fully half of the nation's Federal judges should strive for candidates of the highest quality, and should be encouraging senators and the Justice Department to offer him people who have the capaciousness of mind and the breadth of experience to equip them to administer justice into the 21st century. Instead, the President accepts, and indeed appears to prefer, candidates who fit the most rigid and stagnant stereotype of ''conservatism.'' The experience in Washington highlights this myopia. Although there are more than 45,000 members of the District of Columbia Bar, Administration officials have declared, both privately and publicly, that they are finding it virtually impossible to locate even minimally qualified Washington lawyers who are also ideologically acceptable for appointment to the United States Court of Appeals. All of this has a special sting for me. I was once a participant in the Administration's judicial selection process and now have been disqualified by it. I have always considered myself a conservative Republican, at least by traditional standards. In 1964 I co-chaired the ''Columbia University Students for Goldwater'' (a small group, as the election showed). During the Nixon Administration, I served in the Justice Department as the ''law and order'' Deputy Solicitor General responsible for handling the Government's criminal cases in the Supreme Court. As one of a handful of registered Republicans living in Washington, I supported Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 and his re-election in 1984. I even think the Supreme Court's abortion decisions are bad law. Indeed, in 1981 Mr. Reagan appointed me as his representative on a panel that screens candidates for the President to name to District of Columbia local courts. Yet I have experienced firsthand the Justice Department's version of a jurisprudential Holy Office. From time to time when vacancies have opened on the Federal appellate court in Washington, my name has been floated as a candidate. Key Justice Department officials, however, regularly have passed the word that they view me as ''too liberal'' and ''not politically reliable.'' They have indicated that my involvement in two civil rights groups, the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the A.B.A. Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities (perhaps compounded by my service as the senior Republican in the Watergate Special Prosecutor's office a dozen years ago) disqualifies me from consideration. If I am a dangerous and subversive radical, I wonder what kind of lawyer is adequately ''safe'' by current standards. Of course, with a handful of exceptions (within which I do not number myself), no lawyer ''deserves'' to be appointed a Federal judge. I worry, though, when the people advising the President view concern about human rights as somehow inconsistent with ''true conservatism.'' Both the President and the country are badly served by a judicial selection policy that avowedly focuses solely on the narrowest and most extreme slice of the American bar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dearie and O'Connor To Discuss Church Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/nyregion/dearie-and-o-connor-to-discuss-church-ban.html,"Assemblyman John C. Dearie is to meet with John Cardinal O'Connor today in an effort to reverse a ban on the Assemblyman's speaking at events sponsored by his local Roman Catholic parish. Mr. Dearie requested the meeting after the pastor of his Bronx parish, St. Raymond's, said that he had been instructed ''by the Cardinal's house'' to bar the Assemblyman from speaking because he had voted in favor of using Medicaid funds to pay for abortions. Cardinal O'Connor has since denied taking any personal role in barring Mr. Dearie. But he has left open the possibility that an aide might have done so. Mr. Dearie said that, under one proposal he wanted the Cardinal to consider, he would be allowed to speak in the parish on issues other than abortion and Medicaid. Mr. Dearie, who is 46 years old, has been an active member of the parish all his life. Msgr. Peter Finn, a spokesman for the Cardinal, confirmed that a meeting was planned for today, but he had no other comment. ''I'm a little upset that he's advertising the meeting,'' he said. ''It's private and we don't discuss private meetings.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO REAFFIRMS HIS ADHERENCE TO TEACHINGS OF CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/nyregion/cuomo-reaffirms-his-adherence-to-teachings-of-church.html,"Governor Cuomo sought last night to separate himself from theological dissidents in the Roman Catholic Church and reaffirmed his own adherence to church teachings. After a recent weeklong debate in the press with John Cardinal O'Connor of the New York Archdiocese, the Governor went last night to St. James Cathedral, the seat of the Brooklyn Diocese, to distinguish between two kinds of dissent - the theological and the political. ''I do not come here as a theologian - I do not have that competence,'' Mr. Cuomo said at a forum at the cathedral, adding later, ''I am here as a politician and public official who has found that trying to be both, as a Catholic, has raised some questions.'' The Governor said his dispute with church leaders was a political one, over the extent that Roman Catholics in public office were obligated to apply church teaching to government policy. He said that argument was far different from the current theological debate between the church hierarchy and liberal theologians and made clear that he was not qualified to participate in that debate. Nevertheless, without endorsing the views of the theological dissenters, the Governor went out of his way to say that he did not think that dissent itself was harmful to the church. ''How, after all,'' he asked, ''has the church changed and developed through the centuries except through discussion and argument?'' ''We ought not to be afraid of that,'' he said later, ''because in the long run we will be stronger for it if we manage it well.'' The Governor's comments - in a 25-minute speech and in an hourlong question-and-answer session that followed - were the latest in what has been a running two-year series of comments by him on the problems faced by a Roman Catholic in balancing his religion with his responsibilities in public office. Mr. Cuomo, much to the annoyance of the Cardinal, has argued that a Catholic is not obligated to follow church teachings in executing public policy. And he strongly reaffirmed that stand last night. In his most recent debate with the Cardinal, the Governor took issue with an arch-diocesan policy, issued in August, that prohibits those who are opposed to church teaching from speaking at parish-sponsoredevents. But Mr. Cuomo said the policy of the Cardinal, who was referred to by one questioner as ''the big boy across the river,'' did not apply to him because he personally followed church teachings. Referring to those teachings, Mr. Cuomo said, ''I agree with the bishops and the Cardinal - well, I'm not sure about the Cardinal - but with the Pope, certainly.'' The archdiocesan policy on speakers was issued as the Vatican has been cracking down on dissent in the American church. Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen of Seattle was recently ordered to relinquish much of his authority because he tolerated liberal practices involving marriage annulment and liturgy. And the Rev. Charles E. Curran, who holds liberal views on birth control and other sexual matters, was stripped of his license to teach theology at the Catholic University of America, in Washington. ''We are living through a time of turbulence in the church's history,'' the Governor said, adding later, ''But I think that we should be neither surprised nor feel seriously threatened by disagreement among bishops and theologians, or bishops and politicians, in areas that don't touch the vital, central core of our belief.'' ''It is not uncommon,'' he continued, ''for people who share a great deal -people even part of the same family -to find themselves sometimes at odds, their closeness sometimes marred by suspicion or distrust.'' Emphasis on Agreement Mr. Cuomo did not back down from his comments last month taking issue with the archdiocesan policy on speakers. But the overall tone of his speech stressed how much he agreed with -not disagreed with - the church hierarchy, and he declared that any disputes within the church were overshadowed by Catholics' shared faith. At one point, the Governor vigorously defended the Cardinal against allegations by one questioner that the archdiocese was not doing enough to help the poor. But when being pressed by a priest, Msgr. Michael Wrenn, that he was not using his position as Governor to block abortion, Mr. Cuomo grew agitated, suggesting that the church was selectively enforcing its teachings on some matters but not on ones that were widely unpopular among Catholics in general. ''Why isn't the church calling on the Governor of New York to strike all the family-planning money?'' Mr. Cuomo asked. ''Why aren't you coming to the microphone, Father, to ask about that?'' He drew sustained applause from the audience of 500 spectators, hundreds of whom sat fanning themselves with programs in the stifling auditorium adjacent to the sanctuary. Mr. Cuomo was invited to speak at the forum - the first in what the parish hopes will be an annual speech by a prominent member of the Catholic laity - last April, before his most recent dispute with Cardinal O'Connor. A spokesman for the Brooklyn diocese, Frank DeRosa, said yesterday that Bishop Francis J. Mugavero, the head of the diocese, regretted that Mr. Cuomo had been invited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SENATE APPROVES $557.6 BILLION IN SPENDING, EXCEEDING '87 TARGET",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/04/us/senate-approves-557.6-billion-in-spending-exceeding-87-target.html,"A weary Senate today approved a $557.6 billion bill to finance Government programs for 1987, including $1.54 billion to fight drugs, a measure that pushed spending above a limit approved earlier in the budget resolution for the year. The Senate approved the money for the drug program on a voice vote. The overall bill, which combines 13 appropriation bills, was then approved, 82 to 13. The Senate action today, if agreed to by the House, would allow the deficit for the fiscal year 1987, which began Wednesday, to increase to pay for the program. The House has approved a $2.1 billion drug program that makes cuts in military and nonmilitary programs to pay for the increase. Differs From House Bill The Senate appropriation bill now goes to what is expected to be difficult conference with the House of Representatives, which has approved a $562 billion version. There is the strong possibility of a Presidential veto of an eventual compromise, which could interrupt the drive to adjourn Congress next week. While the Senate was concerned about fiscal restraint, the election-year drive for an anti-drug program and the Senate's unwillingness to approve other spending reductions to offset the increase swept these concerns aside. On Tuesday, when the Senate voted 97 to 2 to approve details of the program to control illicit drugs, it also adopted a resolution saying it would find new sources of money for it rather than cutting existing programs. The drug program would increase penalties for dealers and step up enforcement efforts. The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, told his colleagues that the increase would not be enough to break the $154 billion deficit ceiling for 1987 set by the budget-balancing law. The Reagan Administration generally supports the Senate version of the bill, which covers the fiscal year that began Wednesday. Since then the Government has been running on an eight-day stopgap spending bill. Provisions on Arms Control But the House version includes many provisions that, if incorporated in a House-Senate compromise, would force the President Reagan to veto the bill, the Administration says. Among these are five arms control proposals the President opposes, a move to gradually close down the Civil Rights Commission and the possible rehiring of air traffic controllers dismissed by the Admistration in 1981 after an illegal strike. The House included in its version of the bill a one-year freeze on spending for all but the smallest underground nuclear tests, a prohibition on the production of weapons that would violate the unratified 1979 treaty on strategic arms, a freeze on the program for a defense against missiles, a ban on tests of antisatellite weapons in space, and a ban on production of new chemical weapons. In addition, the Administration wants the higher figures of $292 billion for the military and $13 billion in foreign assistance that are in the Senate bill. Issues May Be Put Off Congressional sources said that House and Senate negotiators on arms control were discussing putting off a resolution of the issues until January. This would be done by reaching an agreement that would guarantee the House-Senate negotiators would resume work on a compromise package at the beginning of the new year and the new Congress. One way to do this is to terminate financing for a program, like the antimissile research program, the President's Strategic Defense Initiative, in January and tie the arms control issues to the legislation to resume financing. However, reaching a compromise on the omnibus appropriation bill and the arms control provisions just as the President prepares to meet in Iceland with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is just one of the many obstacles the Congress faces before adjournment. House-Senate negotiators working on a separate package of $13 billion to $15 billion to reduce the deficit were still at odds. The Administration, which initially supported the Senate-approved version, was indicating a veto of a possible compromise was likely. A third bill, now in conference between the House and Senate, must be approved to raise the debt ceiling so the Government can continue to borrow to pay its bills. Hours Take Their Toll Today the final Senate vote on the comprehensive appropriation bill came after a week of debate and after the Senate drove itself to near exhaustion in 21 hours of debate from 8:30 A.M. Thursday to 5:27 A.M. today, then returning at 9:30 this morning. Senator Robert C. Bryd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader, demanded on the Senate floor early this morning that the Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, let the weary senators go home. ''It doesn't do any good if a Senator dies on this floor,'' Mr. Byrd said. ''We're going to look silly. I've had enough of it. Mr. Byrd said he would hold the floor for eight hours, preventing any action, and tell his Democrats to go home if Mr. Dole did not. Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, had insisted, just as adamantly, that the Senate continue working. But Mr. Dole recessed the Senate. This morning when debate resumed, Mr. Hatfield showed the effects of the prolonged debate. He spoke with a barely audible croak as he guided the bill to approval. Hundreds of Amendments More than 100 amendments were considered, most of them election-year proposals unrelated to the approriation bill. And the Republican leadership defeated most of them on the procedural challenge that were not germaine. Among the proposals defeated were the repeal of tax-exempt status for institutions that provide abortions; two amendments to reduce or withhold the United States contribution to the United Nations; a ban on Federal funds for programs that do not require parental consent for use of contraceptives by minors; and deletion of $18 million for the National Endowment for Democracy. But while these broad amendments were set aside, the Senate approved a host of proposals, many of them of special interest to their sponsors. Among these are the naming of courthouses; a ban on further construction of the new United States embassy in Moscow until a study is done of defects in construction; approval of use of surplus Polish currency held by the Government to support church-sponsored programs in Poland; reimbursement of moving expenses that the Navy said it should have paid to a Virginia woman for a move from Hawaii; and the cutoff of funds for a pilot pre-inspection program by the Customs Service in Shannon, Ireland, which was taking work away from a facility in Bangor, Me. Also approved was $1 million for a study of ways to stop the influx of killer bees into the United States, an amendment by Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., the retiring Maryland Republican.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the Assemblyman said that both he and the Cardinal had agreed to ''keep communications open.''

POPE TO BEGIN A 4-DY TRIP TO FRANCE TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/04/world/pope-to-begin-a-4-dy-trip-to-france-today.html,"Pope John Paul II is scheduled to begin a four-day visit to France on Saturday, and the local authorities and the national Government have mounted what is said to be one of the most extensive security operations ever seen in this country. With tensions heightened by the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, some 10,000 local policemen, gendarmes and riot policemen will be on duty in Lyons and the nearby communities the Pope plans to visit. Charles Pasqua, the Minister of the Interior, who is charged with police and security matters, reportedly asked the Vatican to delay the Pope's trip, his third to France, until the end of the Jewish High Holy Days. The Vatican reportedly refused, saying plans for the trip were too far along. The trip will be the John Paul's third to France since becoming Pope in 1978. Mitterrand to Greet Pope He will be greeted at Lyons-Satolas Airport by President Francois Mitterrand. After greeting the Pope, Mr. Mitterrand is to travel to Cannes to attend an energy conference. Faced with so many security problems, the Interior Minister canceled vacations and time off for all the French police until Oct. 15. This is the first time all police leaves have been canceled since the student riots of 1968. The Pope's visit is centered in the Rhone-Alpes region around Lyons, which is France's second largest city. He will offer masses here, in Paray-le-Monial, 100 miles to the north, at Ars, 20 miles to the north, and at Annecy, 60 miles to the east. The mass on Saturday at Eurexpo, an exposition center in the middle of Lyons, is expected to attract 300,000 people. More than 14 miles of metal barriers have been brought into the center to control crowds. The Pope's first trip to France - to Paris and Lisieux in 1980 - received mixed reviews at the time. His motorcade through Paris streets in 1980 was largely ignored by passers-by. A youth rally that was first thought to be a spontaneous outburst of fervor for the Pope was later shown to be a highly organized affair, with many of the young people having been bused into Paris from other parts of France. A Nontraditional Church The church in France and particularly in Paris has long been known for its progressivist, nontraditional stance on theological and social issues. But church officials in Lyons traditionally have been more conservative. Parish priests all over France have been been reading appeals from Albert Cardinal Decoutray, Archbishop of Lyons, asking the faithful to come to Lyons this weekend. The diocese has chartered 30 trains to bring visitors here. ''If there are 300,000,'' the Cardinal said, ''I will be the happiest of men.'' The visit comes less than a week after the publication of a nationwide poll showing that the Pope is popular in France but that his message has little impact. Forty-eight percent of those questioned, Roman Catholics and non-Catholics alike, disagreed with the Pope's positions on contraception and abortion; 24 percent disagreed with his positions on political and social matters. The poll, in Le Monde, showed that 81 percent of the French consider themselves Catholics. But more than half of that group, 52 percent, indicated that they do not practice their faith. Fully 80 percent of the Catholics polled said they would never take the church's positions into account when making major decisions in their lives. Called Spiritual Capital Lyons has been called the country's spiritual capital, and the church is said to be a more vital factor in the life of the community here than it is in Paris. In 177, less than two centuries after the death of Jesus, some 50 Christians were killed here. They were among the first Christian martyrs in what is now France. Pothin, the first Bishop of Lyons, died in prison here around the year 187. Cardinal Decoutray has said both he and the Pope see this trip as a kind of pilgrimage to the sources of Christianity in France.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A LIFE ON THE COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/magazine/a-life-on-the-court.html,"SHORTLY BEFORE 10 tomorrow morning, as the United States Supreme Court begins its 1986 October term, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. will leave his chambers, turn right, then left, toward the small locker-lined robing room. There, he will slip his black judicial robe over his suit before crossing the corridor to await, along with his colleagues, for 10 o'clock precisely to arrive. At that time, a short electronic beep will sound, followed immediately by the sound of the marshal's gavel. Brennan will pass through the red velvet curtain that divides the anteroom from the courtroom to take his place on the mahogany bench just to the right of the Chief Justice, the seat traditionally occupied by the Associate Justice with the greatest seniority. Tomorrow will mark the beginning of Justice Brennan's 30th year on the Court. He is 80 years old and very fit, in part as a result of daily sessions on his exercise bicycle. Only two Justices appointed in this century, William O. Douglas and Hugo L. Black, have sat on the High Court longer than Brennan. During his tenure, he has written not only leading, but landmark, cases. And yet, despite his colorful personality, his long tenure and the enormous impact he has made on American life, Brennan remains, like all of the Justices, relatively unknown to most people. This is not because the public or the press has lacked curiosity. It is the result of the traditions of the Court. With the exception of the intelligence agencies, no institution in American political life operates with such secrecy. The Court's decision-making meetings, known as conferences, are closed not only to the public, but to the staff. Arguments before the Court are not televised nor broadcast on radio. Internal rules and procedures are unpublished and are unknown even to those who appear regularly before the Court. Appointed for life, Justices do not attend political meetings, make speeches on behalf of candidates nor appear on Sunday morning newsmaker shows. Moreover, even when Justices are publicly criticized, their practice is to remain silent. The public is rarely given a glimpse of why they think the way they do. Three weeks ago, for instance, an official of the Justice Department attacked Brennan. In a speech at the University of Missouri School of Law, William Bradford Reynolds, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, said that ''the Justice has allowed his liberal orthodoxy to shape his jurisprudence,'' and described Brennan's ''radical egalitarianism'' as a ''major threat to individual liberty.'' Not surprisingly, Justice Brennan declined to answer the charges or comment on this particular attack. But, to judge from his more general comments below, he finds remarks such as Reynolds's puzzling. He takes a long view of these matters and says that, in time, he might even be thought of as ''Brennan the right-winger.'' From July 1985 through July 1986, I served as one of four law clerks to Justice Brennan. The clerkships are one-year appointments made by the Justice to recent law school graduates. In addition to his secretary and messenger, the four of us comprised the Justice's entire staff. Our job involved being research assistants, sounding boards, writers of memos and drafters of opinions, as well as staplers, collaters, brewers and bringers of coffee. Justice Brennan's law clerks are especially fortunate, because of the man's command of the Court's history and the access he affords to his younger colleagues. He is also easily the warmest member of the Court, famous for his charm, always linking arms with his colleagues or reaching out for a hand or a shoulder. The Brennan clerks are given a much greener light than the clerks of some other Justices to talk about cases. He told us we were free to discuss his views with other law clerks. We were also in a good position to tell him what we thought the views of the other Justices might turn out to be. He said to us, ''I take help from wherever and from whomever I can get it.'' When I first met him, the Justice noted that I was born in 1956, the year he was appointed to the Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Brennan has participated in more than a quarter of the cases decided by the Court in this century. Including dissents and concurrences, he has written more opinions than any other Justice in the history of the United States with the exception of Douglas. ''His footprints are everywhere,'' says Judge Abner J. Mikva, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a friend of Brennan. ''His influence can be felt in nearly every area of the law.'' ''Everything I am,'' the Justice told us, ''I am because of my father. William J. Brennan Sr. had emigrated from County Roscommon, Ireland, in 1893 and settled in Newark. He stoked fires at the Ballantine brewery there and later became a labor leader and an elected public official in Newark. William Jr. was born in Newark in 1906, the second of eight children. As Justice Brennan tells it, his father became particularly friendly with some very prominent lawyers and asked them often to his house. ''He watched them and decided he was going to make a lawyer of me, by golly,'' the son says. Brennan Jr. was an honor student at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He completed Harvard Law School on scholarship after his father died, graduating in the top 10 percent of his class. In 1928, while at law school, he married Marjorie Leonard, with whom he eventually had three children. She died in 1982. The following year, Brennan married the former Mary Fowler, a woman then in her 60's and his secretary for more than 26 years. Brennan has eight grandchildren. Upon receiving his law degree in 1931, he began practicing with a Newark law firm, becoming a partner in 1937. Five years later, he resigned to accept a commission in the Army and served until 1945. He then returned to his firm as a name partner. In 1949, Brennan again resigned from private practice, this time to accept the nomination of Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll, a Republican, to a judgeship on the New Jersey Superior Court. One year later, he was elevated to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court, then, in 1952, to the New Jersey Supreme Court, where he remained until President Eisenhower appointed him to the Supreme Court of the United States. I asked Justice Brennan if his father would have been surprised to see him as a Justice. ''No,'' he answered, ''he would have expected it.'' Justice Brennan, perhaps better than any living person, understands the workings of the Court. Accordingly, in recent years his law clerks have sought - and generally failed - to persuade him to share his views by giving interviews to the press. ''I write them, I don't explain them,'' has been his standard response to these requests, echoing almost every judge's conviction that written judicial opinions need no embellishment. But as the Justice's 80th birthday and his 30th anniversary on the Court approached and the requests from the press mounted, we law clerks sensed he was beginning to change his mind. In late June, as the work of the Court tapered off, I asked him to discuss with me on the record his work as a Justice and his life on and off the Court. He agreed, stipulating that the interviews would appear in a question-and-answer format. Shortly before we began the first of our summer conversations, President Reagan nominated William H. Rehnquist to be the next Chief Justice and Antonin Scalia to be a new Associate Justice, the first since Sandra Day O'Connor was appointed in 1981. Would this lead to a dramatic shift in the direction of the Court? To what degree do a Justice's personal views inevitably determine his or her vote on a particular case? What, finally, is it like to live a life on the court? QUESTION: You are often described in the press, and have been attacked by members of the current Administration, as the Justice on the ''extreme left.'' Are you at all surprised to find yourself labeled that way? ANSWER: Quite honestly, I don't understand it. Anyone familiar with what I have done here, the opinions, and anyone with historical perspective, would have to know that I am not on the extreme left. It does make me chuckle. I have never gone as far as the extreme left on the Court, let alone the country. How would you characterize Justices Black and Douglas? We didn't see eye to eye in so many things. They were, I suppose, far to the left of me. Q: It doesn't bother you? A: No. People have short memories and times change. Maybe one day, someone will talk about Brennan the right-winger. Q: When you sat in the Oval Office with President Eisenhower back in 1956 and heard him offer you the job of an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, did you think: This man doesn't know what he is letting himself in for? A: Never gave it a thought. Very frankly, the difference between the responsibility of this Court and the responsibility of a state supreme court -particularly in those days when we hadn't yet extended the Bill of Rights to the states - is just vast. Enormous. There is nothing that you do that prepares you for this job. Even Felix Frankfurter used to say that his lifelong study of the Court never really prepared him for this job. You simply cannot study it from afar and expect to know it. You simply cannot know how you will respond to the legal issues as a Justice, as opposed to a law professor, or a judge on a court of appeals or even a state supreme court. I know that was certainly true of me. Q: Burger is gone, Rehnquist is Chief Justice. Scalia is an Associate Justice. Is the Court - and the country - about to experience momentous change? A: That's a hard, perhaps even impossible, question. It's been observed that in terms of personnel, a conservative has been replaced by another conservative, and that, for that reason, there may be no change in terms of votes in individual cases, assuming, of course, that Chief Justice Rehnquist votes in the future as he has in the past. However, in an institution this small, personalities play an important role. It's inevitable when you have just nine people. How those people get along, how they relate, what ideas they have, how flexible or intractable they are, are all of enormous significance. Q: What kind of a Chief Justice do you expect Justice Rehnquist to make? A: I'm not sure what value predictions have, and, of course, we will know soon enough. But I do think that Bill is not going to be a loner to the extent that he has been one. I think the figure that appeared in the press was that he had dissented by himself in 54 cases. I think you will see less of that. This means he may have to moderate some of his positions. My guess is that he is going to do it. Also, with the extra work that goes with being Chief Justice, he may have to stop writing books and give fewer speeches. Didn't I see that he was in a play this year? His acting career may also be in jeopardy. Q: What about Antonin Scalia? Do you know him? A: We've met. He's delightful. If what they say about him is true, he will be great fun to have as a colleague. But I would rather not speculate.Like everybody else, I will wait to read his opinions. Q: In addition to being thought of as a great liberal, you seem to have the reputation of being the ''play-maker'' of the Court, the consensus builder who somehow manages, in case after case, to get five votes for very liberal opinions. Do you think that is accurate? A: I have always had an uneasy feeling about that. I don't know if it is completely accurate. I don't think I do anything differently. What do we do in these chambers? We have an opinion to write. We think about it, and then we talk about it and then write it, and we circulate it, and we get suggestions, and perhaps we make some changes, and then we end up with five votes. What is so special about that? Q: I suppose the success rate has been special. A: Perhaps. Doesn't that mean only that we are doing our work well? Writing sound opinions that are persuasive to at least four others? It really isn't very mysterious or complex, what we do. Just look at how we work in these chambers. We debate the issues, the merits, and when it comes time to write, we discuss the various possible approaches. We ask about some of the approaches. Will this be rejected by Lewis Powell or Harry Blackmun? Will Thurgood agree with this? Has John Stevens written any cases which may suggest how he is thinking and about which we should be aware? What does Sandra think? You try to get, in advance of circulation, a sense of what will sell, what the others can accept. And you write it that way, and when it works out - and maybe you have suggestions that come in and perhaps you make sub-stantial revisions - but when it works out and you have a Court, you are delighted. I don't think what I did when Earl Warren was here is any different than what I did when Warren Burger was Chief or what I intend to do now that Bill Rehnquist is Chief. That is the job as I see it. The implication about the ''play-maker'' phrase that I reject is that you go running around the building talking, shaking hands, putting your arm around everyone. Only once did I go around and talk to everybody, and that was on the Nixon tapes case. I thought that case, in the context of the times, called for the kind of opinion we had in 1958 with Cooper v. Aaron, a critically important desegregation case, with everybody signing the opinion to emphasize the fact that we were unanimous. And I went around to see everyone and tried to sell that idea, and, of course, it was a complete failure. Nobody agreed. Not one. So, I suppose it is a good thing I have not tried to do business that way over the years. If I have been successful, it is because of the advance preparation, the hard work, the careful thinking that we try to do in here. Q: The play-maker reputation generally seems to go hand in hand with accounts of your relationship with Earl Warren. Do you remember your first impressions of him? A: Oh yes. My first impression was that he and I weren't going to have any difficulty in getting along. Q: Isn't that something of an understatement? A: As things developed, yes. But not as a first impression. Q: Where and when did the first meeting take place? A: The very day I learned that I was to be named to the Court. Herbert Brownell, who was the Attorney General at the time, had shuttled me from the White House to the Department of Justice and then back to the White House to be introduced to the press. After the press conference, Brownell said we ought to get down to the Supreme Court and meet the Chief Justice. And so Brownell, Bill Rogers and I came here. We had a lovely lunch, and that was that. The Chief and I made a date for me to come back to meet the others. That was a famous day, when Warren took me upstairs to Room 317. He opened the door, and it was pitch dark, and then he turned on the light, and there were all my new colleagues huddled around a television watching the opening game of the 1956 World Series. The Chief introduced me to each of my new colleagues, and they each shook my hand, and then someone said ''Put out the lights,'' and they did. And that was my introduction to the Brethren. Q: When did you realize that you and Chief Justice Warren were going to have a special relationship? A: Our relationship just developed, just grew, from the outset. From the very beginning we did a lot of things together, particularly in sports. We were both very sports-minded, especially about football and baseball, and we often went to games. Then, with some frequency, we would dine at one another's homes, but generally little was said about the Court. As far as Court work was concerned, we began to compare notes on cases, and that finally led to a weekly meeting on Thursdays, here in chambers, before the conferences. He would sit just where you are sitting now. Q: Why did he come in here to your chambers? After all, he was the Chief Justice. A: He believed in the old adage that he was Chief among equals. He fought like the devil against increasing the disparity between what he got paid as Chief and what the Associate Justices received. Q: Was your relationship off the Court an intimate one? A: We were very close, personally, but I think probably the closeness was largely judicial. Black always was further from us, and Douglas was even further. It's funny. I suppose we just gravitated together. We had more of the same approaches to the cases than the others. Their analyses were not quite the same as ours, they were a little bit more extreme, as we were just saying, than ours. We were just kindred spirits on many of the issues that came to the Court. Q: Give me an example of how Black and Douglas were extreme. A: Well, we were all for the same results. And more often than not, we did agree on the analysis, but as for the First Amendment area, for example, Black's and Douglas's position was that when the Constitution directs that Congress shall make ''no law'' abridging freedom of speech, that means no law, and this was something that neither the Chief nor I could accept. In our view, there were limits. And this extreme view of Black and Douglas carried into the libel area and obscenity area and religious area. Very often we could all agree on a case, but sometimes we couldn't. In the New York Times case, for example, neither Black nor Douglas could join, because it didn't go far enough for them. Q: If someone had asked you in 1963 or 1964 who your best friend was, would it have been Earl Warren? A: Well, that is interesting. Somehow, he was always the Chief Justice. In that sense, it might not have been something that he would have wanted, but it was there anyway. There has to be a distance between yourself and the Chief Justice. He was always the Chief, the Super Chief. Q: Did you call him the Super Chief? A: Yes, but not to his face. I think I first used it in an appreciation of him in the Harvard Law Review. I just called him ''Chief.'' Q: Not ''Earl?'' A: Never. That is just not the way it ever is. Once Bill Rehnquist is confirmed, he will never be anything but ''Chief'' to me. Q: What made Earl Warren so great a Chief Justice? A: He had everything. He was hard-working, he knew how to work with people. He was marvelous with people. He would take approaches that would often escape my eye. He was just extraordinary. Q: Should the Chief Justice be a leader with respect to jurisprudence? A: I think the old expression is the ''massing'' of a point of view, of a Court - of ensuring at least five votes for an opinion, and, on those cases that require it, of seeking and getting nine votes, a unanimous Court. Of course, John Marshall was the great master of that technique. Earl Warren was also. I suppose, in a sense, it is less doctrinal than it is institutional. Q: How did Warren do that? Did he go to the other chambers to sound out the others? A: Oh yes, he did it all the time. Of course, some Justices are more receptive to visits than others. You know that my door is always open, but that is not true throughout the building. And of course, Bill Douglas was often not even in the building - or in Washington, for that matter. Q: What was Douglas like to work with? A: Well, his great mistake, Bill's, was his insistence -and he repeated it time and time again - ''I have no soul to worry about but my own.'' This was always his justification for his conduct as a Justice. He was not a team player ordinarily. Q: Was that something he would actually say - about his soul? A: Oh, yes, a good number of times he said that, when walking down the hall or talking one-on-one in his chambers or mine. Q: And you would argue with him and tell him that he was wrong to take that view? A: Yes, and I wasn't the only one that would do that. I am sure. Q: What else does it take to be an effective Chief? A: A conviction that you have to be fair in the assignment of opinions - this ensures good feelings all around - and an extraordinary capacity for persuading others to a point of view. Q: What do you think the historical assessment will be of Chief Justice Burger's performance as a Chief Justice? Many people feel that he lacked some of the qualities you describe as important. A: Yes, I am afraid that is the contemporaneous assessment and will be the historical assessment as well. Q: Many have observed that Rehnquist is very personable. Will this be to his advantage as Chief Justice? A: It's to all of the Justices' advantage. Q: But not to Rehnquist especially? A: It's hard to know what that would mean. It's not as simple as there being two sides on the Court, or even a case. I think people are very wrong who think that is the way it is. Q: Certainly, that's the way the Burger Court was often characterized. A: I think if you look at a lot of important cases and areas -abortion, free speech, the religion cases - the votes did not align the way a simple approach would expect. Q: Still, didn't the Burger Court depart from the Warren Court? A: Perhaps in terms of direction and momentum, yes. But the times changed also. Of course there have been some erosions in some areas, for example the Fourth Amendment right not to be subject to unreasonable searches or seizures, but I don't think it's very accurate to speak of the Burger Court having unraveled the work of the Warren Court. Some important decisions affirming personal liberties came down during Burger's years. The abortion decision was not a legacy of the Warren Court, but the Burger Court. The first case to strike down the dealth penalty in a number of states came out of the Burger Court. Also, important cases involving the separation of church and state - prayer in school in particular - and the affirmative-action cases this past term. Q: In 1967, when Warren was Chief Justice, you did not write a single dissent, and you averaged roughly four a term during his tenure. This last term alone, you wrote 26 dissents. Was the changeover to the Burger Court very dramatic in terms of your role as a Justice? A: No. I feel so strongly about that. This Court is final on constitutional matters. Outside of overruling itself, only constitutional amendments can change the constitutional interpretations that the Court renders, and because of that fact, I have always felt that a member of this Court is duty-bound to continue stating the constitutional principles that have governed his decisions, even if they are in dissent, against the day when they may no longer be in dissent. It has happened so often in the history of the Court, and must continue to happen, that views that represent the minority position come to be understood as correct. That is why I continue to dissent on the death penalty and in other areas, and I am going to continue to do so because I am duty-bound. So the job hasn't changed. I still work hard to interpret the Constitution as I believe it must be read. The Court has, of course, changed, and the results in some cases have changed. They will change again. Q: Was the changeover personally disruptive? A: It was an inevitable change. It had to be. In a sense, it became a bigger challenge and it made the occasions when you managed to have the majority of your colleagues agree with you sweeter than it had been. We have certainly continued to prevail in many important areas. In other words, there is room for the old dog. Q: You were the first Democrat appointed to the Supreme Court by a Republican since Benjamin Cardozo was appointed by Herbert Hoover. Did anybody in the Eisenhower Administration grill you about your politics or your judicial philosophy before you were offered the position? A: Oh, there was no grilling at all. Not a single question was asked. Q: No one asked you any questions about politics or policy? A: No, although the press did ask. When Jim Hagerty picked me up to take me to the press conference where my nomination was to be announced, I was asked, ''Did you vote for Eisenhower in 1952?'' I was able to say that I wasn't eligible to vote in 1952, since we had moved to a new county in 1952, and under New Jersey law you had to be a resident of the county where you wanted to vote for six months before you could vote. Well, I was then asked, ''If you had been eligible to vote, would you have voted for Eisenhower?'' I said, ''I really can't answer that - I don't know.'' Q: Do you believe the period we are going through now is different, in the sense that the Administration really does have a specific agenda in terms of judicial appointments? A: I think it was different then. My experience, as far as I know, was also the experience of those who followed - Stewart and Whittaker in the Eisenhower days. And Justice Harlan, who had preceded me, never suggested to me that there had ever been any question of any kind. Of course, this isn't to say that the only concern was with the quality of the mind or the legal training. But probably there was less concern with specific results in specific areas. Q: How does a new Justice learn the ropes and develop a style? I know that Felix Frankfurter was your professor at Harvard. When you first came to the Court, was there any effort on his part, or anyone else's, to win you as an ideological ally? A: Well, the interesting thing about Felix specifically is that he was absolutely superb in doing this without your being conscious of it. His chambers were next to mine, and he used to come in with some frequency, and he would tell me much about the great giants that he had known and worked with and what brilliant contributions they had made. He made con-versation, he flattered you, he made you feel that it would be an honor to be associated with him and his crowd of giants. Felix also worked socially. I recall he had a dinner at his home for me, and the guests were Dean Acheson and John Lord O'Brian, and I heard much in the discussion after dinner over brandy about the role of the Court and the role of the Justices. I recall particularly the story that Acheson told of how Justice Brandeis, for whom he had clerked, on one occasion asked him to footnote an opinion which was to come down on Monday. And Acheson footnoted the opinion, and Monday came and Brandeis did not announce the opinion. Acheson was amazed, of course, and asked the Justice afterward what had happened. Brandeis took the opinion and pointed to a footnote that cited two cases, state cases, that Acheson had discovered and cited in the footnote. Brandeis said, ''I looked at those cases and they won't stand for the proposition for which they were cited.'' And Acheson said he was grateful he wasn't fired. The main reason for telling this story, I realized later, was to communicate that you had to be that meticulous about what you produced sitting on this Court. Felix wanted me to understand that. Q: Did he finally give up on you? A: I suppose we reached an understanding. We always were good friends. He never stopped or gave up trying to persuade me in individual cases, but he knew that I would not, could not, accept his approach across the board. Q: Were you aware of a change in yourself sometime after you arrived? A: I must say, I wasn't conscious of the change, although I suppose I did change. It is hard to say why it happens. All I can attribute it to is what I suggested, that when you have actually to discharge the responsibility - not just think about it or talk about it - things go a lot differently. Everyone thought Felix Frankfurter would be a flaming liberal when he came, and there was a lot of reason to think he would. And yet, when he got here, his conscience wouldn't let him, because of his conviction that the judiciary should not be resolving many issues that, in his view, should be decided by the legislative or executive branch. Talk about disappointing a President -certainly Felix disillusioned F.D.R. Q: Do you think Justice O'Connor is changing, jurisprudentially? A: I think she has, but I don't think it is a satisfactory answer to say she has moved to the left, which I read or heard somewhere. A change in a new Justice is so often a product of the significance of this responsibility - of being a Justice - and it is something that you simply have no idea of until you get it. And when you get it - I don't care who has appointed you - there come issues that no matter what may be the popular, or the Administration's or anyone else's view, in conscience you find that you can't resolve the issue in that way. The Constitution requires a different resolution, and that is pretty obvious to you. It is just so important that all Federal judges are independent, not the voice of any Administration. As a Justice feels more comfortable here, the judicial independence tends to put some distance between the political people who were so excited, initially, about the appointment. It is very interesting, Sandra fitted in so quickly, more quickly than I had expected. She ceased immediately to be ''the first woman Justice'' and became just another Justice, and quite a fine one. Moreover, she is delightful. Q: The Administration aside, Justice O'Connor may have disappointed some women who were hoping for more unequivocal support for the abortion right. A: Even so, but the fact that there is a woman makes women generally feel a little more comfortable. I think everyone is better off ultimately when a Justice is truly independent-thinking. Q: There has for many years been a so-called ''Catholic seat'' on the Supreme Court, and the same used to be said about a ''Jewish seat.'' Since Abe Fortas left the Court in 1969 there has not been a Jewish Justice. Do you think it is, beyond the symbolic value, important to have ethnic and cultural diversity on the Court? A: I do indeed, I think there ought to be, although I think it has got to be done very carefully. There ought to be diversity in many respects: localitywise, for example. Not everyone should come from the East or the West. There ought to be diversity in political persuasions. There ought to be a black, a woman, and, of course, religious diversity. These are all segments of our pluralistic society, and I think people are a little more comfortable when they see a broadly representative group. It is more than a symbol. People bring different ex-periences and insights to their work. I believe that when President Reagan nominated Justice Scalia, there was an express acknowledgment that his Italian heritage was a factor in the appointment. Of course, it is also true that individuals turn out to be disappointments to an ethnic group. I have been a disappointment to some Roman Catholics. Father Andrew Greeley wrote a piece in which he said that if the Roman Catholics who played a role in the Brennan selection had had any idea he would turn out the way he did, he would have never been appointed. Q: How important was your religion to your appointment? A: It has been reported that Eisenhower was looking for a Catholic, and, even more important, in order to emphasize the nonpartisanship of his Administration, a Democrat from the Northeast. You have to remember that the 1956 elections were coming up. Eisenhower was also asked directly how he came to appoint me, and he said - well, we asked everybody who would be the best man for the job. We asked our friends in California, and they said Bill Brennan of New Jersey. We asked our friends in the South, and they said Bill Brennan, this fellow up in New Jersey. We asked Senators, Governors, business leaders and union men, and they all recommended this Brennan fellow. Q: Have you ever had difficulty dealing with your own religious beliefs in terms of cases? A: No. That is very interesting. I really crossed that bridge in my confirmation hearing when initially the committee unanimously said it was most inappropriate to ask me whether, as a Catholic, I would follow the Constitution. But then they did ask me. And I had settled in my mind that I had an obligation under the Constitution which could not be influenced by any of my religious principles. As a Roman Catholic I might do as a private citizen what a Roman Catholic does, and that is one thing, but to the extent that that conflicts with what I think the Constitution means or requires, then my religious beliefs have to give way. And, as I say, I settled that in my mind and that took care of it. Q: If the Constitution were being rewritten now and you were given the responsibility to decide whether there would be a right to abortion, what would you do? A: I would say that, in this society, nobody can dictate for everyone else what m",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
st be done with respect to the most intimate choices, private choices, family decisions, that individuals face. I would adhere to what we have said. And I don't know that I could ever agree that the right to privacy that is protected by the Bill of Rights should not be a part of a fundamental charter of a civilized society. Q: What is the most difficult decision you have had to make as a Justice? A: A couple of cases, and, I suppose, particularly the school-prayer cases. The 1963 Schempp opinion is some 80 pages long. The position I finally took took a long time to come around to. In the face of my whole lifelong experience as a Roman Catholic, to say that prayer was not an appropriate thing in public schools, that gave me quite a hard time. I struggled. And of course I've said some things I wish I hadn't. I've had 30 years to make mistakes. Q: Such as? A: Oh, I prefer to correct myself in opinions, and I have. After all, I've also had 30 years to make those corrections. Q: Was there a case or line of cases that have been singularly disappointing not to prevail on? A: I don't know whether to prevail on, I do wish we had found a solution to the definitional horror of obscenity. Perhaps it has been my fault; this has been a very difficult issue which we seemed to have not gotten quite right. Q: You seem to possess an abiding faith that the most difficult problems are susceptible to legal resolution. A: I certainly believe so. We must never give up trying, because how are we going to have an ordered society unless the problems are redressable somehow by law? I don't mean necessarily law as pronounced by the judges. Major problems can be as effectively addressed by the Congress, as it demonstrated in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Q: Where do you think that faith of yours in the law comes from? A: I can only suggest, I don't know if by osmosis, but I surely came away from law school with that. I don't know if I started with it. It is what is so magnificent about law. Q: You have been a lawyer for almost 60 years. Have you ever awakened in the morning and wondered what it would have been like to have tried something else? A: Never. Q: Always happy with the choice? A: I would have loved to have been a great quarterback. Q: A play-maker perhaps? A: Oh, I don't know. On my team, plays could have been called by consensus. Q: Only 10 other Justices in the history of this country have served 30 years, as you will," beginning this term. Is it a particular time for reflection? A: No. It is another term with a lot of work to do.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TEXAS SAYS CENTER USES DECEPTION TO STOP ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/us/texas-says-center-uses-deception-to-stop-abortion.html,"The realization usually sets in when the film's narrator says that abortion is the equivalent of murder. That is when many women first understand that the Pregnancy Problem Center does not perform abortions; that, in fact, the center personnel are there to talk them or frighten them out of the procedure rather than to help them through it. A Texas Assistant Attorney General, Steve Gardner, believes that kind of confusion is the purpose of the center's carefully vague advertisements and what he says are evasive answers to questions over the telephone. So the state has gone to court to seek a revocation of the center's corporate charter on the ground that it is using deceptive trade practices. Mr. Gardner says women are being emotionally harmed when they go to the center seeking abortions and instead are shown films of aborted fetuses. ''If women are deceived, it is self-deception,'' said Chuck Pelletier, who opened the center here in 1984. But he agrees that his workers avoid telling callers that abortions are not performed there. And he says that at least half the women who visit the center are looking for abortions. #100 Similar Centers in Country Mr. Pelletier's center is one of at least 100 such facilities around the country set up to resemble abortion clinics but with an opposite intent, according to the Texas Attorney General's office. Several such centers in other states are also facing legal challenges, the Texas authorities said. Many of the centers were created according to the guidelines of the Pearson Foundation, an anti-abortion group begun in St. Louis by Robert J. Pearson. The Pearson Foundation's guidebook on ''How to Operate a Pro-Life Center That Looks and Sounds Like an Abortion Clinic'' has been entered into the court record here. The book advises that an ideal site is an office space near the entrance to an abortion clinic. ''If the girl who would be going to the abortion chamber sees your office first with a similar name,'' the book says, ''she will probably come into your center.'' The book also advises workers to be persistent with callers. ''You want to give the woman information but not too much,'' it says. ''Be put off by nothing. The stakes are life and death. A phone put back on the receiver with no appointment made probably will mean death for the unborn baby and perhaps for the soul of the mother.'' Mr. Pelletier said that ''a thousand babies are alive today'' because of his center. He estimated that more than 75 percent of the pregnant women who have come to the center ''have let their babies live.'' Testimony was taken this week from seven women, three by deposition, in Tarrant County District Court, where the center is charged with violating the Deceptive Trade Practices Law. The women told about the films, the dawning realization of what type of center they were in, the personal questions from counselors and of the fear the center's counselors tried to instill in them about the abortion process. In addition to revoking the center's charter, which would deprive it of its nonprofit status, the state is asking for $10,000 in civil penalties and a stop to the practices that make the center appear to be an abortion clinic. Mr. Pelletier says he does not know how his center will be able to operate if it loses its corporate charter. He says the center is financed by many small donations. 'Opposed to Deceiving Women' Mr. Gardner emphasizes that the issue of abortion is not being debated in the trial. ''The state is not pro-abortion or anti-abortion,'' he said. ''But it is definitely opposed to deceiving women who are pregnant and possibly emotionally distraught.'' Mr. Pelletier said that because his business was not profit-seeking, it should not be bound by the Deceptive Trade Practices Law. He also said that nothing was permanently hidden from the pregnant women who come to the center. ''All that really matters is the timing,'' he said. ''We disclose everything we do.'' He said workers were instructed not to lie to callers but to avoid answering some of their questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
First Monday in October,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/opinion/first-monday-in-october.html,"The summer's debate about William Rehnquist's fitness to be Chief Justice battered the Supreme Court as much as its new leader. It aroused fear among legal scholars and politicians that a chief with a 15-year record of hostility to civil rights and civil liberties, joined by a conservative new Justice, Antonin Scalia, would produce fundamental changes in law. To the extent that such fears are warranted, they hurt the Court - and that should trouble the justices as much as the public. The speculation hurts by disparaging the ideal of a government of laws and not of men. The claim that objective justice is a myth hardly mitigates the problem. Americans treasure the ideal as worth pursuing even if it can never be fully realized. They look to the courts for wisdom, objectivity and fairness of the sort they never expect from the other branches of government. The Court's ability to deliver depends in part on the statesmanship of its Chief Justice. He can do much to insure that his colleagues honor their judicial duty instead of pursuing a mostly political agenda. He can help the Court to live with precedent, departing only in principled directions that can be convincingly charted. He can help it resist the temptation to rekindle debates over issues like abortion and the exclusionary rule unless case and circumstance clearly require it. Some of those who most rejoice in the Rehnquist and Scalia appointments protest a double standard: liberals feel free to shatter precedents when they're in control, so why should right-leaning justices submit to greater constraints? On issues like abortion and the exclusionary rule, at least, that argument won't wash. The Court's decisions about a woman's liberty and right to privacy are hardly radical. Illegally seized evidence is no more acceptable for use in American courts in 1986 than in 1914, when the exclusionary rule was fashioned. Both positions grew out of experience and plainly evolving understandings of constitutional liberty. Wisdom and fairness should transcend any political stance. Some of the Court's finest moments have come when the objective judge overruled the opinionated lawyer. Justice John Harlan deplored vulgarity yet upheld a man's right to write his contempt for the military draft on his jacket. Justice Lewis Powell detested campus radicals but held that they had every right to organize. Justice Rehnquist, momentarily shedding his pre-Victorian personal views about women, delivered the Court's first judgment that sexual harassment violated civil rights law. On this first Monday in October, let that splendid tradition, and not just the election returns, be uppermost in the justices' minds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JUSTICES TO OPEN 1986 TERM TODAY FACING KEY ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/06/us/justices-to-open-1986-term-today-facing-key-issues.html,"With a new Chief Justice and a new member, the Supreme Court will begin its 1986-87 term Monday facing issues that include racial disparities in death sentencing and the constitutionality of teaching creationism in public schools. Job discrimination and the use of affirmative action as a remedy are among the contentious issues posed by the 91 cases the ideologically polarized High Court has agreed to hear in the coming months. One of the employment cases, on whether Federal law bars granting special benefits to pregnant employees, has caused a deep split among feminists. Another involves discrimination against people with such diseases as tuberculosis and AIDS. Briefs Are Less Bold The Reagan Administration has filed briefs in these and other cases in support of its conservative civil rights policies. It has opposed broad affirmative action plans, special benefits for pregnant employees and the use of Federal law to combat discrimination against people infected with the virus that can cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome. But Solicitor General Charles Fried's briefs so far this term seem generally less bold in tone than the last term, when the Court rejected his aggressive arguments for abandoning its protection of abortion rights and for outlawing affirmative action preferences. The Administration is keeping up the pressure on the lecture circuit, though. Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds recently made the most direct attack in many decades by a high-ranking official on a member of the Court. He denounced Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. as reading ''radical egalitarianism'' and ''liberal orthodoxy'' into the Constitution. #2 Changes at Court President Reagan's elevation of William H. Rehnquist to be Chief Justice and of Antonin Scalia to become an Associate Justice capped the most determined effort by any Administration in more than 40 years to entrench its ideology in the Federal courts. These changes may sharpen the Court's ideological differences. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, two fervent conservatives with formidable intellects, will anchor the conservative wing. But they do not appear the have enough allies to produce any immediate shift in the Court's voting patterns. Here are some of the cases the Court has agreed to review: Racial Discrimination And the Death Penalty The Court will hear arguments Oct. 15 in a sweeping challenge to alleged racial discrimination in the administration of the death penalty in Georgia and elsewhere. The appeal, by a man sentenced to death for the murder of a white police officer in a robbery of an Atlanta furniture store in 1978, is based on statistics showing that in Georgia the killers of whites are far more likely to be sentenced to death than the killers of blacks. Other studies have found similar disparities in other states. Opponents of capital punishment say this suggests that judges and jurors place a lower value on the lives of black victims than of white victims. If accepted by the Court, the defendant's argument that this ''systematic bias'' was unconstitutional would cast grave doubt on the death penalty as administered in many, perhaps all, of the 36 other states that have such laws. Many experts, however, doubt the Court would take such a step. It would amount to a virtual admission, with nearly 1,800 prisoners now on death row, that the Court's elaborate efforts since 1972 to purge the death-sentencing process of racism and arbitrariness have failed. A Federal appeals court rejected the defendant's legal arguments, ruling that racial disparities in capital sentencing would be unconstitutional only if there were proof that race was intentionally being taken into account. It also said the study had shown ''no discrimination as to the race of the defendant.'' (McCleskey v. Kemp, No. 84-6811.) Disability Leave For Pregnant Employees Confronting an issue that has produced a major split among feminists, the Court will consider whether Federal law bars preferential fringe benefits, including disability leave and guaranteed reinstatement, for pregnant employees. While some feminists argue that employers should be required to accommodate women who have children, others say special treatment for pregnant employees revives sexist stereotypes and makes employers reluctant to hire women of child-bearing age. The case involves a California law that requires employers to give up to four months of unpaid leave to employees who are unable to work because of pregnancy, but not to other disabled employees. The question is whether this violates the Federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. The Federal law states that ''women affected by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes'' as other people who are ''similar in their ability or inability to work.'' A Federal appellate court upheld the California law, saying Congress did not intend to bar additional benefits for pregnant employees. But some women's groups, including the National Organization for Women, have joined with business groups and the Justice Department in arguing that Congress intended to outlaw discrimination in favor of pregnant employees as well as against them. The Justice Department and the business groups have urged the Court simply to strike down the California law and similar laws in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Montana. The National Organization for Women said the Court instead should extend to all disabled employees the special benefits mandated by state law for pregnant employees. (California Federal Savings & Loan v. Guerra, No. 85-494.) Job Discrimination And Affirmative Action The Court has agreed for the first time to consider the legality of an affirmative action plan favoring women over men. Together with another case involving preferences for blacks, it may answer questions left open by three major rulings last term. In those decisions the Court endorsed limited racial preferences for members of minority groups in hiring, but only when ''narrowly tailored'' to redress past job discrimination. It said the effect of layoffs on identifiable employees was so severe that racial preferences in layoffs would rarely, if ever, be justified. This term's cases involve promotions. One is an appeal by a veteran employee of Santa Clara County, Calif., a man, who asserted that a less-qualified woman had been promoted ahead of him to be a road dispatcher under a plan to increase the number of women promoted. The Justice Department filed a brief in the case supporting the man's argument that the county had violated the Federal law against sex discrimination. It said the county's plan was not based on findings of past discrimination and had too severe an effect on men. Women's and civil rights groups have defended the county's affirmative action plan as necessary to redress gross underrepresentation of women in the county's skilled job categories. (Johnson v. Transportation Agency, No. 85-1129.) In United States v. Paradise, No. 85-999, the Justice Department has urged the Court to overturn as ''plainly unconstitutional'' a lower court order requiring that one black Alabama state trooper be promoted to a higher rank for each white promoted. The lower court ordered the 1-for-1 quota as part of a court-ordered plan to cure a long history of intentional discrimination that had excluded blacks from the state police force until 1972. The Justice Department, stressing that it had joined the black plaintiffs in suing to end discrimination, said the lower court had gone too far by using a flat racial quota, violating the rights of white troopers. Another job rights case raises an issue that has become increasingly important as AIDS has spread: Whether Federal law bars discrimination against sick people who are, or are incorrectly thought to be, contagious. The case grew out of a Florida school board's dismissal of a teacher who had tuberculosis out of concern that she might infect her students. The teacher sued under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which bars programs receiving Federal money from discriminating against anybody with a disability who was ''otherwise qualified.'' The Justice Department, supporting the school board in the Supreme Court, has argued that Section 504 bars only discrimination based on the disabling effects of a disease, not ''discrimination based on concern about contagiousness,'' even if the concern is unreasonable. In the Administration's view, Federal law allows discrimination against victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome based on fear of contagion even though the medical authorities agree that AIDS cannot be spread through normal personal contact in the workplace. The American Medical Association, homosexual rights groups and others filed briefs in the case disputing the Administration's position. (School Board v. Arline, No. 85-1277.) Religion in Schools And the Workplace The Court is to rule on the constitutionality of a 1981 Louisiana law that requires the teaching of creation science in any public school that teaches the theory of evolution. A Federal district court and a three-judge appellate panel struck the law down as an effort by fundamentalist Christians to promote religious belief in the biblical account of creation, in violation of the First Amendment, which prohibits an official establishment of religion. The full United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit voted, 8 to 7, to let these rulings stand. In its Supreme Court appeal, the state argued that ''creation science consists of scientific evidence and not religious concepts,'' and is a legitimate alternative to the theory of evolution, which the state said had not been proved correct. Many prominent scientists have joined parents, school officials, the American Civil Liberies Union and others who sued to invalidate the law in arguing that it represents a religiously motivated effort, dressed in pseudo-scientific garb, to distort the teaching of science. (Edwards v. Aguillard, No. 85-1513.) The Court has also agreed to consider whether a Federal statute barring religious discrimination in employment requires school oficials in Connecticut to accommodate a teacher's religious practices by granting him more religious holidays a year than most other employees. (Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook, No. 85-495.) In addition, the Court has agreed to consider whether Florida violated a recently converted Seventh-Day Adventist's religious freedom by denying her unemployment compensation after she was dismissed from her job for refusing, because of her new religion, to work Friday nights or Saturdays. (Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Commission, No. 85-993.) Election Laws And First Amendment Two cases involving corporate campaign spending and closed primaries present tensions between election laws and the First Amendment rights of free speech and association. On Tuesday, the Court will hear the Federal Election Commission's appeal of an appellate decision permitting nonprofit, ideological corporations to spend directly on political campaigns. The law prohibits all direct corporate spending. The case, Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, No. 85-701, involves charges by the commission that the anti-abortion, nonprofit corporation acted illegally in spending $9,812 in 1978 to print and distribute a newsletter that included candidates' voting records on abortion issues. The Election Commission said in its appeal that the appellate decision could open the way for any corporation to set up a separate ''ideological'' affiliate, which could then funnel coporate money into poliical expenditures without having to disclose the actual source of the money. The Court will hear arguments Wednesday in Connecticut's appeal of a Federal appellate ruling that it violated the state Republican Party's right of freedom of association by barring it from opening to all voters its primary elections for Congress and statewide offices. The case, Tashjian v. Republican Party, No. 85-766, could have an important impact nationally because more than 35 other states, including New York and New Jersey, have similar ''closed primary'' laws. They bar citizens who have not affiliated themselves with a political party from voting in that party's primaries. The Exclusionary Rule And Rights of Suspects The Court has been asked to expand the exception it created in 1984 to its rule that excludes the use of evidence in criminal trials if the evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. An Illinois law authorized warrantless inspections of automobile wrecking yards, in which stolen cars are often found. After the police had charged three men with possession of a stolen car based on such an inspection, the law was held unconstitutional and a state court suppressed the evidence obtained in the search. In its appeal, supported by the Justice Department, the state urged the Supreme Court to create a new exception to the exclusionary rule to allow the use of evidence seized in reasonable, good-faith reliance on a statute later held to be unconstitutional. (Illinois v. Krull, No. 85-608.) The Court also has before it a trio of appeals by state prosecutors, supported by the Justice Department, from state court rulings that suppressed confessions by broadening the rules that require the police to warn suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present when they are questiond. One case, Colorado v. Connelly, No. 85-660, involves a man who spontaneously walked up to a Denver police officer and said he had killed someone. After being told of his rights, the man proceeded to confess in more detail the murder of a girl. The Colorado Supreme Court barred prosecutors from using either the first statement or the more detailed confession. It said psychiatric testimony showed the statements had been involuntary because the man was driven to confess by mental illness. In Colorado v. Spring, No. 85-1517, the Colorado Supreme Court suppressed a suspect's statements implicating himself in a murder because Federal agents, who had arrested him on other charges, had not disclosed when they read him his rights that they would ask about the murder. In Connecticut v. Barrett, No. 85-899, the Connecticut Supreme Court reversed a sexual assault conviction on the ground that the police should have stopped asking questions when the arrested suspect stated that he would answer questions orally but would not make a written statement in the absence of an attorney. Pocket Veto Power And Rights of Congress The Court faces a major dispute between the President and Congress over Presidential pocket veto power and the right of Congress or its members to challenge Presidential actions in court. The case is a Government appeal of a ruling by the United States Court of appeals for the District of Columbia that Mr. Reagan could not use the pocket veto between two yearlong sessions of Congress. In what may be the most important issue in the case, the lower court also upheld, by a 2-to-1 vote, the legal standing of the Senate, the bipartisan House leadership and 33 House Democrats to sue for a judicial ruling on the issue. The Administration urged the High Court to rule broadly that none of them had standing and that judges may not entertain suits brought by Congress or its members to challenge the validity of Presidential actions. The case began in 1983 with a bill passed by the House and the Senate conditioning military aid to El Salvador on human rights progess there. Mr. Reagan neither signed nor vetoed the bill within the time allotted by the Constitution. In such an event, Article I provides that the bill becomes law ''unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return,'' in which case the President, by figuratively keeping the bill ''in his pocket,'' has effectively vetoed it and does not give Congress a chance to override the veto. The appeals court held that the President may make a pocket veto only at the conclusion of a two-year Congressional term, when all pending legislative business comes to an end. Thus, it ruled, the El Salvador aid provision automatically became law. Even so, the provision expired by its terms on Sept. 30, 1984, so the case is important mainly for the precedent it will set.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robertson Depicts Abortions As Racial Suicide in the West,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/06/us/robertson-depicts-abortions-as-racial-suicide-in-the-west.html,"Working toward a potential Presidential campaign here Saturday night, the evangelist Pat Robertson asserted that an increase in abortions was leading to ''racial suicide'' in the West. Mr. Robertson said abortion was causing a ''depopulation of the West'' that threatened the power of Western industrial nations. He tied the trend to abortions. In the United States, there will be 40 million abortions performed between 1973 and 2000, he said. ''What we are doing is committing racial suicide,'' Mr. Robertson said, apparently referring to a reduction in the population of the developed nations of the West rather than to any particular racial group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FETUS RETURNED TO WOMB FOLLOWING SURGERY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/science/fetus-returned-to-womb-following-surgery.html,"In a pioneering operation, a team of California surgeons has removed a 23-week-old fetus from his mother's womb, successfully operated to correct a blocked urinary tract and then returned the unborn baby to the uterus and sewed the womb back up. Nine weeks later, Baby Mitchell was born alive and well at a Texas hospital near his parents' home. Last week, a few weeks after his first birthday, Mitchell was back in San Francisco for minor surgery that completed repairs on his urinary tract. According to Dr. Michael R. Harrison, the pediatric surgeon from the University of California at San Francisco who led the team, Mitchell would have died in the uterus without the surgery. ''Today he's doing fine,'' said Dr. Harrison. ''He may have some kidney problems in future, but I'm confident he'll do O.K.'' Dr. Harrison is scheduled to present the first full medical report of Mitchell's case to the American Academy of Pediatrics at its meeting in Washington later this month. Medical experts familiar with the surgery say Mitchell's operation is a dramatic milestone in the controversial new field of fetal therapy and fetal surgery. This surgery was remarkable for having removed the child from the womb, but it also occurred against a backdrop in which there is growing excitement and significant qualms over the possibilities of fetal surgery. Only in recent years have other techniques been developed in which, for example, doctors use long needles to install shunts to drain excess fluid from the infants' bladders or brains. Baby Mitchell's successful operation ''is a remarkable technical achievement,'' said Dr. Frederic Frigoletto, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard University and chief of maternal and fetal medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. But, he added, much more needs to be learned about how to determine which fetuses will benefit from surgical intervention and which will not. The safety and efficacy of fetal surgery are not proven, he said. ''The overriding question is: Are you really doing any good with these therapies?'' said Dr. John C. Fletcher, chief of the bioethics program in the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. ''It is time to bite the bullet and do a properly controlled clinical trial'' on the use of shunts, said Dr. Fletcher, who said he was speaking for himself and not N.I.H. According to experts in bioethics and law, if fetal treatment ever does become routine, it will join a list of controversial social issues such as regulations for the treatment of handicapped infants, court-ordered Caesarian operations on women unwilling to have them and the rights of frozen embryos whose parents have died. ''This is essentially an uncharted area where the basic values of maternal autonomy and of fetal welfare may come into conflict,'' said George J. Annas, a professor of health law at Boston University School of Public health. Fetal surgery is a new medical field that is being pioneered at 13 centers in five countries, according to Dr. Frank Manning, director of an international Fetal Treatment Registry at Women's Hospital in Winnepeg, Canada. Dr. Manning said Baby Mitchell was the third infant treated since 1982 with open surgery, all by Dr. Harrison's group in San Francisco. Two other fetuses with blocked urinary tracts were given bladder shunts that were sewn into place. One died at birth because the procedure had been performed too late to prevent lung and kidney damage. The other lived for about six months but died of complications of another birth defect. The last, Mitchell, is thriving. In his case, a hole was surgically created in his abdomen through which his bladder could drain. Dr. Manning said 124 other fetuses have been given shunts - little tubes about the size of dry spaghetti, placed by way of a catheter into fetal bladders and brains to drain away fluids. Fetus as Full-Fledged Patient In addition, new therapies are developing to medically treat fetuses by giving mothers drugs, vitamins, hormones or special diets to correct a specific defect in her fetus. While fetuses have been given therapy in the form of blood transfusions since the early 1960's, the newer therapies are driving physicians as never before to view the unborn child as a full-fledged patient. ''There are two thrusts in medicine that have brought us to think about the fetus as a patient,'' Dr. Harrison said in a recent interview. ''One came from people like me who take care of babies after birth. We look at them and realize we're too late.'' If the problem could be fixed earlier, he said, some babies could be saved. The second thrust came from advances in detection. Using the noninvasive imaging technique of ultrasound, Dr. Harrison said, ''people have become incredibly slick at seeing fetuses and at diagnosing fetal problems.'' Birth defects can now be detected after just nine or ten weeks of pregnancy with a variety of new methods. Prenatal diagnosis, which has prompted controversy because it can lead to elective abortion, was never meant to be merely a ''search and destroy'' mission, said Dr. Harrison. Diagnosis can now make fetal therapy possible. Eight years ago Dr. Harrison, with his colleagues Dr. Roy A. Filly and Dr. Mitchell S. Golbus, formed a Fetal Treatment Program that led first to extensive animal experiments with open fetal surgery techniques. ''We asked ourselves what diseases would be amenable to therapy,'' Dr. Harrison said, ''and found that each falls along a spectrum. At one end is the doomed fetus. It will die no matter what you do. At the other end is the fetus who has problems but we know from experience it will be all right. Most birth defects, in fact, are best treated after birth,'' he said. In between are conditions that call for active management of the pregnancy. Sometimes babies are delivered prematurely by Caesarian section, Dr. Harrison said, ''because defects produce on-going trouble and the longer the fetus stays in the womb, the worse off it is.'' Some anatomic malformations, if severe enough, will destroy an organ system such as the kidneys, brain, lungs or heart before an induced early delivery is possible. ''We can now, in some cases, prevent that maldevelopment by surgical intervention,'' either shunts or open surgery, Dr. Harrison said. Three conditions that fall along a such a spectrum and that might, in carefully selected cases, be surgically corrected are hydrocephalus or ''water on the brain,'' a herniated diaphragm and a urinary tract obstruction known as hydronephrosis, the condition Mitchell suffered. Hydronephrosis is the first such anatomic defect to be successfully corrected by open surgery in a human fetus. When the urinary tract obstruction is partial, Dr. Harrison said, the fetus may develop normally. But when the blockage is complete, the fetus cannot urinate. Fluid backs up and puts destructive pressure on its developing kidneys. Amniotic fluid, which is actually fetal urine, is not produced. Without amniotic fluid, fetal lungs do not develop. The exact prevalence of hydronephrosis is not known since so many fetuses die before birth. But Dr. Harrison estimates that 1 in 2,000 may be affected. Mitchell's parents agreed to tell their story to a reporter on a condition that their last name not be disclosed. Mitchell is, however, the baby's real first name, given in honor of Dr. Golbus in San Francisco. ''I asked for a sonogram when I was between five and six months pregnant,'' Mitchell's mother said. ''My grandmother is a twin and we wanted to be prepared.'' Her obstetrician had tragic news. The baby's bladder, kidneys and the tubes connecting them were greatly enlarged. There was no amniotic fluid and it was determined that the baby's urethra was completely blocked. ''They told us to consider ending the pregnancy,'' she said ''or to consult some doctors in California who might be able to operate. I already felt him kicking. We knew by then that he was a boy. Our minds were made up to save his life if we could.'' It was the couple's first pregnancy. A special test, developed by the team in San Francisco, indicated that the baby's kidneys were still healthy. Other tests indicated he had no other birth defects. But with the team's procedure, Mitchell's mother, who is 32 years old, would have to expose herself to considerable risks, including two Ceasarian operations, a drug taken daily to prevent labor after the fetal surgery and the danger of uterine rupture in this and future pregnancies. When the incision is made at the top instead of the bottom the uterus, as it sometimes has to be in this procedure, said Dr. Harrison, the risk of rupture increases. ''Without the operation, Mitchell had zero chance for survival,'' said Mitchell's father. ''They asked us hundreds of times to think carefully about our decision.'' The fetal surgery was perfomed on July 22, 1985. Mitchell's mother was given the anesthesia, halathane. It is a superb relaxant, Dr. Harrison said ''because it puts the mother, the kid and the uterus to sleep.'' An eight-inch incision was made across the mother's belly, a few inches higher than a normal Caesarian, using a special staple-like device that stops bleeding as it cuts. The tiny baby's legs were pulled out while his upper half attached to the placenta were left inside his mother. ''The umbilical cord is not supposed to come into contact with the air,'' Mithcell's mother explained, ''or else it would be damaged.'' Dr. Harrison cut a hole through the baby's abdomen and bladder, sewing the bladder directly to the baby's skin. He added saline water to the uterus to provide some amniotic fluid, ''stuffed'' the fetus back inside and stitched up the uterus along with the amniotic sac. The fetus was outside his mother for three minutes. Mitchell's mother took the drug Ritodrine every day to prevent labor. Nine weeks later, Mitchell was born in a second Caesarian operation made through the same cut. Although he was six weeks premature, the baby weighed six pounds, two ounces. Mitchell needed some assistance in breathing but within a few hours, his father said, ''he was the perfect picture of health.'' Today Mitchell is like many other 1-year-olds. He has straight brown hair, long dark lashes and is cutting his first three teeth. His parents say he is developing normally. ''He can walk holding on to the couch and he smiles all the time,'' said his mother. ''We've decided he's an angel.'' Last week Dr. Harrison finally opened Mitchell's urethra and closed the hole in his abdomen so that the baby now urinates normally. Mitchell's right kidney has very little function, said Dr. Harrison, and the left kidney is about 50 percent efficient. The parents say they take Mitchell regularly to a pediatric kidney specialist. ''We are watching closely and if he fails to grow,'' his mother said, ''he may one day need a kidney transplant.'' Other surgeons, in the meantime, are experimenting with bladder shunts inserted nonsurgically, through catheters, to drain fetal urine. Of 79 babies given bladder shunts since 1982, said Dr. Manning, 55 died before birth. Of the 34 survivors, all are doing well except one child who had serious complications stemming from the shunt. Forty-five other fetuses have been given shunts to drain excessive fluid that collected on their brains. The survival rate is very high, about 85 percent, said Dr. Manning, but only about a third have normal brain function, he said. The rest have serious brain damage. Without treatment the condition is often fatal. ''This our worst fear,'' he said, ''that we will save babies who are badly damaged.'' ''There is now agreement that there should be a moratorium on brain shunts,'' said Dr. Friggoletto. ''There is lack of evidence that they provide any benefit and substantial evidence that they may be bad.'' 'The Jury Is Out' All fetal shunts, Dr. Manning said, are notorious because they kink, fall out or get plugged up. Babies are born holding them in their fists. Thus ''the jury is out,'' he said, on whether shunts or open surgery techniques are the best way to treat selected children. Other congenital malformations, such as hernias of the diaphragm, in which the liver pushes up into the chest, and spina bifida, in which the spine fails to close, are undergoing experimental treatment in animals. Novel transplant techniques using fetal cells and even fetal organs are being developed in animals. Fetal therapy will open a pandora's box of problems, said Professor Annas. ''I can envision a woman saying she doesn't want to be cut open. So her doctor goes to a judge who tries to force her to be cut open.'' The law has not begun to think seriously about such questions, said Professor Annas. ''Because a disorder can be treated, ought it to be treated?'' He said he believed the mother's rights were likely to prevail over those of the fetus. ''But where fetuses are concerned, there is a supercharged atmosphere,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURT SELECTS 22 CASES FOR NEW TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/us/court-selects-22-cases-for-new-term.html,"Opening its new term today, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether Jews, Arabs and members of other minority groups who do not belong to distinct nonwhite races may bring racial discrimination suits under an 1866 civil rights law. The Court also agreed to decide whether government-owned airports can ban the distribution of religious, political and other literature in their buildings and whether an Illinois obscenity law violates the Constitution. Among other issues the Court agreed to resolve were whether it should overrule a 125-year-old Supreme Court decision that Federal courts have no power to order a state's Governor to extradite a fugitive to another state; whether a New York law authorizing warrantless searches of automobile junkyards violates the Constitution, and whether a city may make it a crime to oppose ''in any manner'' a police officer in the execution of his duty. These were among 22 cases the Court agreed to hear, as William H. Rehnquist, the new Chief Justice, took his seat at the center of the Court's bench and Justice Antonin Scalia joined in hearing the first four arguments of the 1986-87 term. Symbolic Significance The 1866 civil rights law was raised in two appeals, one brought by members of a Maryland synagogue against eight men who are accused of defacing it with Nazi and anti-Semitic slogans, and the other involving a college instructor who asserts that he had been denied tenure because he is Arab. Legal experts said that while the two cases had limited practical importance because the 1866 law is not used very often, their symbolic significance was considerable. Rejecting a Reagan Administration appeal, the Court also declined, at least for the time being, to overturn a ruling by a Federal court in Manhattan that abortion rights groups have legal standing to sue for revocation of the Roman Catholic Church's exemption from Federal taxes. The groups assert in their suit against the Government, which has not gone to trial, that it has allowed the church to support anti-abortion political candidates and lobby against legal abortion in violation of Federal restrictions on the use of tax-exempt funds. LaRouche Appeal Rejected The Court also refused to hear the last appeal by Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. of a $202,000 jury award against him for harassing NBC News by impersonating one of its employees in a telephone call to a senator's office. The Court listed most of the more than 1,000 appeals that had accumulated over the three-month summer recess, designating the 22 it would set for arguments and the much larger number it had declined to review. It takes the votes of four of the nine Justices to accept a case for full review. The cases accepted today for review, together with four in which the Court heard arguments and 87 others it had already agreed to hear, will fill the calendar into March. The two cases under the 1866 civil rights law involve conflicting interpretations by two Federal appellate courts on whether the law can be used to combat discrimination against members of minority groups that are not distinct nonwhite races. Law Passed After Civil War Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, passed to protect newly freed slaves in the aftermath of the Civil War, extended various property, contract and other rights to all persons to the same extent ''as is enjoyed by white citizens.'' A Federal appellate court in Richmond held, by 2 to 1, that a Jewish congregation could not use this law to sue eight men who had defaced the Shaare Tefila Synagogue in Silver Spring, Md., in 1982 with swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans, including ''Death to the Jude.'' The majority said the 1866 law did not protect Jews against discrimination by other whites because Jews were not members of a distinct nonwhite race. In its Supreme Court appeal, Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, No. 85-2156, the congregation argued that although Jews do not consider themselves a scientifically distinct race, the 1866 law should be available to victims of any discrimination motivated by racist animus. Conflicting Rulings Made The dismissal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit conflicted with the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Phailadelphia. In the same week, that court held that an Iraqi-born college professor who said he was denied tenure at a Pennsylvania college because of his Arab background could sue under the 1866 law even though he was Caucasian. The Court will hear that case, Al-Khazraji v. St. Francis College, No. 85-2169, with the synagogue case. In the case involving government-owned airports, the Court agreed to hear an appeal by Los Angeles airport officials from a Federal appellate ruling that its terminal buildings were ''public forums,'' like city streets and parks, so that religious and other groups had a right to distribute literature there. The case began as a suit by Jews for Jesus Inc. and one of its ministers after he was barred in 1984 from distributing religious literature inside airport buildings. Official airport policy limited the interior of airport buildings to ''airport-related uses.'' Policy Ruled Unconstitutional The Federal appellate court held that this policy, which relegated ''First Amendment activities'' to the sidewalks outside, was unconstitutional. (Board of Airport Commissioners v. Jews for Jesus, No. 86-104.) The obscenity case is an appeal by two clerks at adult book stores who were convicted of selling obscene magazines. They argued that the Illinois statute violates the First Amendment because it allows use of local community standards rather than an ''objective'' national standard to judge the social value of allegedly obscene works. Under a 1973 Supreme Court ruling, sexually explicit material may be banned only if it appeals to ''prurient interest,'' depicts sexual conduct ''in a patently offensive way'' and lacks ''serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.'' It is undisputed that judges and juries may use local community values in applying the first two elements of this test. (Pope v. Illinois, No. 85-1973.) Debating Warrantless Searches The Court will consider the constitutionality of New York's law allowing warrantless searches of automobile junkyards in a prosecution appeal of a decision by the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, which held the law violated the Fourth Amendment's restrictions on searches and seizures. The New York court barred use of evidence seized from a junkyard in Brooklyn by five plainclothes police officers in 1982, in a routine warrantless inspection. The highest courts in at least five states have upheld similar laws. (New York v. Burger, No. 86-80.) The extradition case grew out of the refusal of two successive Governors of Iowa to extradite an Iowa man to Puerto Rico to stand trial in the murder of a pregnant woman, allegedly by running her over deliberately and repeatedly with his car after an argument with her husband in a grocery store parking lot. Gov. Robert Ray and then Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa refused the extradition request by Puerto Rico's Governor out of concern that the murder charge was too severe and Ronald Calder, the defendant, might not get a fair trial in Puerto Rico. It Questions 1861 Ruling Puerto Rico appealed to the Supreme Court from a decision by a lower Federal court that it could not order Iowa's Governor to extradite Mr. Calder because an 1861 Supreme Court ruling held that Federal courts have no power to enforce the Constitution's explicit requirement that a state's Governor honor an extradition request from another state's Governor. Puerto Rico, noting in its appeal that it has the same rights as a state under the extradition clause, urged the Court to overrule the 1861 decision as a relic of the era of slavery and order that Mr. Calder be extradited. (Puerto Rico v. Branstad, No. 85-2116.) In Houston v. Hill, No. 86-243, the Court agreed to hear the city's appeal of an 8 to 7 decision by a Federal appellate court striking down a city ordinance that makes it a misdemeanor to ''in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt'' a police officer in the execution of his duty. The appellate court ruled in a civil suit brought by a homosexual rights activist who had been arrested several times for violating the ordinance, but never convicted, that the ordinance was an ''overly broad'' restriction on the First Amendment right of free speech.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXTREMIST FINDS CABLE TV IS FORUM FOR RIGHT-WING VIEWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/us/extremist-finds-cable-tv-is-forum-for-right-wing-views.html,"Rules that require cable television systems to offer access to local residents are enabling a former Ku Klux Klan leader here to promulgate his racist and radical views in a number of towns and cities around the country. ''Three years ago when cable was getting off the ground, I realized that public access channels were perfect for views like mine that were having trouble getting expressed,'' Tom Metzger said in an interview in his office here, 25 miles north of San Diego. Mr. Metzger's program, called ''Race and Reason,'' has prompted controversy in a number of places where it is telecast. It consists of interviews by him with people whose views are at least somewhat similar to his own. He calls himself ''a racialist'' and says he opposes abortion ''because we have lost a whole generation of white children to abortion since it became legal.'' On Blacks and Abortion He says, ''I understand the black experience as well as any white man could, but I don't sympathize to the point I want the white race pushed off this continent by the rising black birth rate.'' ''We support anybody who is against the system,'' he said. He said his television programs attracted protest when ''some Klan or Nazi'' group would ''hit on deporting Jews'' or speak of the alleged genetic inferiority of blacks or urge racial separation. Mr. Metzger directs the White Aryan Resistance, which publishes WAR, a newspaper that calls itself ''The Newspaper of the International White Racist.'' Each edition lists cable systems that carry ''Race and Reason.'' There are now 35 of the 30-minute ''Race and Reason'' programs in circulation. More are made each month as Mr. Metzger, or occasionally a substitute, conducts interviews. It is produced in a studio in Fullerton, Calif., provided to him by a cable television company that is required by its franchise to give such service to people who ask for it. Controversy in Idaho The most recent controversy created by his programs came in mid-September when a cable system in Pocatello, Idaho, carried its first ''Race and Reason'' program. The program was one of the few that did not feature Mr. Metzger. He said Roy Frankhauser of Reading, Pa., interviewed Richard Barrett, a Mississippi lawyer. Problems of racial conflict in Philadelphia were discussed, and Mr. Barrett spoke out for a return to racial segregation and racial separation. The Pocatello Human Relations Council had previewed the tape and decided that it was unable to block the telecast, because the franchise agreement between the city and the cable company forbids only the use of the public access channel for advertising commercial products or displaying pornography. So the council conducted a call-in program that ran for 90 minutes after the Metzger tape was played. Forty people called, and 39 of them protested, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Metzger said conflicts occurred when the program was first shown in Austin, Tex., and in Corvallis, Ore., but have been resolved by opponents creating their own programs that run before or after his. Hitler Birthday Cards ''Race and Reason'' is no longer shown in Corvallis. It ceased after 16 tapes were shown because the local sponsor, Richard Masker, one of Mr. Metzger's followers, moved away without renewing for 16 additional weeks. ''He lost his job, his wife divorced him and he said 'to hell with it' and moved to Arkansas,'' Mr. Metzger said. The Corvallis Gazette-Times reported that Mr. Masker lost his job after he mailed Hitler birthday cards to many Jewish residents of Corvallis. The cards said: ''May his memory refresh your soul and give you inspiration. Heil Hitler.'' Mr. Metzger said sometimes he has had ''historical revisionists on my show.'' He said ''they do not deny that some Jews got hurt'' in Nazi Germany in the Hitler years, ''but they say not so many were killed as the numbers they claim.'' Mr. Metzger grew up in Warsaw, Ind., attended high school, and spent three years in the Army, which taught him electronics. Earlier Days in Politics He came to California in 1961. Anti-Communist luncheon meetings sponsored by the Douglas Aircraft Corporation, where he worked, led him to politics. He joined the John Birch Society, became a Goldwater precinct worker in 1964, moved to Fallbrook in 1968 and supported George C. Wallace for President. His 1972 tax protest over the Vietnam War wrecked his thriving television business but introduced him to other tax protesters who, he said, were ''atheist racists, Christian Identity racists, Nazis, all kinds of people.'' In 1975 he joined the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and soon became the Grand Dragon for California. He left the Klan in 1980, he said. He managed to win the Democratic nomination to the House of Representatives in 1980 in a district with a strong Republican incumbent and low Democratic registration, causing an outcry. He was disavowed by the state Democratic organization. The district is heavily Republican, and he lost by a margin of 7 to 1. He lives and operates his television repair business from a house on a back street here. He said all the other people on the street were Mexican immigrants. While he gets along with them, he said, ''I would just as soon they were still back in their own country.'' Range of TV Viewers The television program is broadcast, Mr. Metzger said, to one million subscribers of the Group W cable network in Pennsylvania alone, as well as many more in San Francisco, San Diego, Memphis, Pocatello, Austin, Atlanta, parts of Los Angeles, and nine smaller southern California cities. Most cable franchises require the operators to provide a channel for public access, and some require maintenance of production facilities that must be provided free of charge. These rules derive from the 1972 Federal Communications Commission rules on cable TV. While the requirements at the Federal level were removed by court decision in 1979, they live on in the local franchises. ''We haven't got on in New York yet because cable access is so crowded,'' Mr. Metzger said. ''But we will.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NASSAU COUNTY COMPTROLLER IN A TOUGH STATE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/nyregion/nassau-county-comptroller-in-a-tough-state-race.html,"In the Republican stronghold of Nassau County, Comptroller Peter T. King has had everything going for him as a politician: incumbency, fund raising and party organization. All those partisan advantages are reversed, however, as Mr. King mounts his first statewide campaign. He is running for Attorney General as the Republican, Conservative and Right-to-Life nominee. This time Mr. King is the challenger in an arena dominated by Democrats. The incumbent is Robert Abrams, who has held the office eight years and last won re-election by the biggest margin of any attorney general in New York history. The Abrams campaign expects to outspend the King campaign several times over. The statewide Democratic organization, headed by Governor Cuomo, is much bigger than the Republican. So is the statewide Democratic voter enrollment. Hopeful Against Odds Despite the odds, Mr. King remains hopeful. He has been traveling the political circuit, charging that his opponent represents the ultra left and has not done enough to fight crime, which Mr. Abrams denies. ''I believe politics should be a contact sport - and it's better for the public, too,'' Mr. King said in an interview. In attacking the Attorney General, he has been making forays upstate. Limited in funds, he has found free publicity easier to get there, in contrast with the scant attention the contest has attracted downstate. In the final days before the election, Mr. King plans statewide radio and television advertising. So far he has collected $147,000. He hopes to push the total to $250,000 with more fund-raising events in Manhattan and Rochester. In Manhattan he will seek help on the East Side and Wall Street, from the fashion industry and union officials. He plans also to appeal to Irish groups around the state. Fiscal Goals Shortened But Mr. King's $250,000 would be only a fraction of the $1.5 million goal he first set - and an even smaller fraction of the more than $2 million that Mr. Abrams is budgeting. Now in his second term as Nassau County Comptroller, the 42-year-old Mr. King previously served as a Councilman in Hempstead, the most populous town in the United States. Before that he held Republican appointments as deputy county attorney and general counsel to Nassau's offtrack betting agency. Mr. King is also the G.O.P. leader of Seaford, the middle-class suburb on the South Shore, where he lives with his wife, Rosemary, and their two sons. Despite a penchant for controversial stands, involving occasionally even opposition to his party leadership, Mr. King somehow has avoided banishment from a party usually described as monolithic. His most daring display of independence came in the power struggle after the Nassau Republican chairman, Joseph M. Margiotta, was convicted of mail fraud and extortion in 1982. When Mr. Margiotta insisted on staying in party office while appealing his case in court, Mr. King called for the succession of Vice Chairman Ralph J. Marino. 'Supposed to Be Dead' A stormy meeting of party leaders voted Mr. King down, 69 to 1. ''It was like a shooting gallery, and I was the target,'' he recalled. ''I was supposed to be dead after that.'' However, Mr. King said he endured retaliatory efforts ''to remove me.'' Eventually Mr. Margiotta was forced out and replaced by Joseph N. Mondello, whom Mr. King quickly supported. Further, while local Republican officials normally refrain from issues beyond municipal services, Mr. King became a vocal champion of Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland and made repeated, publicized trips there. ''A number of old-time Republicans didn't want me to get involved,'' he said, and polls indicated the issue did not help him politically. But in recognition of his efforts, Mr. King, a grandson of Irish immigrants, was named grand marshal of last year's St. Patrick's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. Ties to Democrat Questioned Republicans were dismayed, too, when Mr. King struck up a partnership in support of Northern Ireland Catholics with the Nassau District Attorney, Denis E. Dillon - the only Democrat holding town or countywide office. Their friendship paid off for the G.O.P., however. Mr. King played a key role in persuading Mr. Dillon to accept Republican endorsement for re-election in 1981, effectively neutralizing the District Attorney's power to draw voters from other parties to the Democratic ticket. In another headlined controversy, this time with the top elected county official of his party, Mr. King warned in 1983 that Nassau was headed for a serious deficit. County Executive Francis T. Purcell at first denied the deficit, but the year ended with a record gap of $36 million. Nassau Democrats criticize Mr. King's record, though they have never beaten him at the polls. For one thing, they have twitted him for his changing numbers projecting the deficit. The Hempstead Democratic chairman, Edward A. Grause, charged that although Nassau had the nation's highest local taxes, Mr. King had never used his authority to audit the myriad Republican-controlled town and village agencies. ''The problem is, he's part of the problem,'' Mr. Grause said. Audit Policies Defended In response, Mr. King said that he would have to expand his staff tenfold to audit the localities and that doing so would only duplicate the audits already done by the state Comptroller. As the son of a city police detective and one who worked his way way up, Mr. King sees himself representing ''traditional Democrats and Republicans, middle of the road.'' Some of his views, however, are the mirror opposite of Mr. Abrams's: Mr. King opposes abortion, supports capital punishment and is against racial hiring quotas to help minorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EL AL TRIAL OPENS; SYRIAN ROLE CITED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/world/el-al-trial-opens-syrian-role-cited.html,"A Jordanian accused of trying to blow up an El Al jumbo jet told British investigators that Syrian military intelligence officers had supplied him with an official Syrian passport, $12,000, a bag with deadly explosives hidden in a false bottom and training on how to detonate the bomb, a prosecutor said here today. The Jordanian, Nezar Hindawi, 32 years old, is charged with giving the carry-on bag to an unwitting Irish woman who was pregnant with his child. On the first day of his trial at the Old Bailey, he saw the woman, Anne-Marie Murphy, for the first time since April 17, when she believed herself to be on the way to Israel to marry her lover. Miss Murphy, who has since had the baby, described to a jury of seven men and five women how Mr. Hindawi parted from her at Heathrow Airport that morning, having assured her that he would fly on another flight and meet her in Tel Aviv. 'He Just Kissed Me Goodbye' ''He just left me there,'' she said, testifying as the prosecution's first witness in a voice so hesitant that it was often inaudible. ''He just kissed me goodbye on two cheeks.'' Earlier, she described how her lover, riding in a London taxi to the airport, put what appeared to be a square battery in a pocket calculator that he then pushed down deep into her bag, having explained that it was a gift for a friend. According to the prosecutor's opening statement, explosives experts discovered that the battery armed a timing device hidden in the calculator, which would have triggered a detonator, setting off three and a quarter pounds of Czechoslovak-made plastic explosives concealed at the bottom of the bag. At 1:04 P.M. on April 17, when the bomb was set to explode, El Al Flight 16 was due to be flying over Austria at an altitude of 39,000 feet with 375 people aboard, including 220 who had boarded the plane at Kennedy International Airport in New York, Miss Murphy and 137 others who boarded in London and 17 crew members. 'One of the Most Callous Acts' ''It was one of the most callous acts of all time,'' the prosecutor, Roy Amlot, declared. Mr. Hindawi, a handsome man with dark curly hair flecked with gray, flashed a confident smile from the dock at his lawyers as Miss Murphy, a chambermaid at the Hilton Hotel when he met her, was called to testify. Described by the prosecutor as ''a simple single Irish girl,'' the auburn-haired witness was smartly dressed in a stone-colored cotton jacket over a print blouse. Obviously nervous, she looked ahead steadfastly until she had been on the stand for nearly an hour before stealing a long glance at the man she thought she would wed. There was a sharpness to that look, but otherwise she kept her feelings in check. Sometimes she chewed her lower lip as she paused to take in the meaning of a question, but it was not until late in the afternoon when she came to the moment at the airport when El Al Israel Airlines security agents called in the police that she broke down. 'There Was Something Wrong' ''I got a fright,'' she said, sobbing briefly. ''It hit me then there was something wrong.'' Mr. Hindawi, who had periodically broken into smiles during her testimony, now stared blankly from the dock. Her answers had come slowly and painfully as Mr. Amlot led her step by step through the course of her romance with the Jordanian who was, by her account, out of touch and out of London for most of the year and a half that she knew him. In that period, she had twice become pregnant. On the first occasion, she had a miscarriage; the second time, she said, ''he didn't want to know about it,'' once she finally reached him in West Berlin. His Attitude Changed According to her testimony, Mr. Hindawi pressed her to have an abortion, promising to take her on a holiday if she did. But when he appeared at her door on April 7, his attitude had been transformed. Then, she said, he wanted to marry her. ''He said in Israel, the holy land,'' she replied when asked by the prosecutor where the marriage would take place. ''When we got over there.'' Mr. Hindawi told her not to tell family or friends about their plans, she testified. It would be ''a surprise,'' she quoted him as saying. Later he became ''very angry'' when he discovered that she had told two of her sisters. Mr. Amlot had already supplied the prosecution's version of the defendant's movements in this period and earlier. His Jordanian passport showed that he had visited Poland, East Germany, Rumania and Bulgaria as well as Italy and West Germany in 1985. On Feb. 9 in Damascus, he received the official passport in the name of Issam Shaar. Conflicting Accounts Questioned six times by the police, Mr. Hindawi gave conflicting accounts of what he believed to have been in the bag. At first, he said he had thought he was smuggling drugs for the Syrians. Later, after acknowledging that he knew it had been a bomb, he asserted that he believed he had disarmed it by switching the calculator from ''off'' to ''on.'' In the course of his sessions with the police, Mr. Hindawi was able to name key Syrian intelligence officials and identify their photographs, according to Mr. Amlot, including the head of military intelligence and an air force intelligence officer named Haitham Said who, he said, had shown him the bag in Damascus and taught him how to set the bag.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conviction on Abortion Ads,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/us/conviction-on-abortion-ads.html,"A pregnancy center and its founder were convicted of deceptive trade practices today and fined $39,000 for falsely advertising as an abortion clinic, then trying to persuade pregnant women to have their babies. The Texas Attorney General's office said the civil court trial was the nation's first against a pregnancy center for deceptive trade practices. A jury of five women and seven men deliberated eight hours before voting 11 to 1 to convict the center, the Problem Pregnancy Center of Fort Worth, and its founder, Charles Pelletier, of violating the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. The attorney general's office said the center, run by volunteers, falsely advertised as an abortion clinic when its purpose was to keep women from having abortions. Steve Gardner, an assistant attorney general, said the verdict ''sends a strong message to clinics across the country - don't lie to pregnant women in the names of facts, in the name of help, in the name of God or anybody.'' Mr. Gardner said the center was fined $9,000 for violating the state consumer law and $30,000 for violating a temporary injunction issued July 8 that limited its activities. The jury also assessed $70,000 in attorneys' fees. Mr. Pelletier said he would appeal the ruling. He said the verdict could restrict free speech in churches, nonprofit organizations and other organizations beyond anti-abortion groups. Shelby Sharpe, the center's attorney, argued that the center was not a commercial operation because it did not charge women for advice and pregnancy tests. It, therefore, should not be held accountable under the act, he said. But the state attorney, Eliot Shavin, said the pregnancy center advertised as if it sold a service and attracted customers seeking a service. ''The defendant testified that fetuses have a right to life,'' said Mr. Shavin. ''In order to convince others of their belief, they further assert they have a right to lie. They have no such rights.'' Mr. Pelletier, a disabled Vietnam veteran who founded the center in 1984, said employees purposefully avoided telling women that the center did not perform abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CATHOLIC COLLEGES IN U.S. DEBATE ACADEMIC FREEDOM AMID DISPUTES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/us/catholic-colleges-in-us-debate-academic-freedom-amid-disputes.html,"The nation's Roman Catholic colleges and universities, a key part of the American educational network for more than a century, have recently had to examine a question that goes right to the heart of their identity: Can there be true academic freedom in an institution that retains strong religious ties? The question has gained currency with the Vatican's move this summer to strip the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a relative liberal on sexual issues, of his license to teach theology at the Catholic University of America, and with a proposal by the Vatican to regulate Catholic institutions of higher learning around the world. There are 235 Catholic colleges and universities in the United States, with 595,100 students. The schools, founded by religious orders and dioceses primarily to meet the needs of children of Italian and Irish immigrants, are now largely independent institutions that cater to a student body of varied ethnic and religious backgrounds. The colleges and universities are separate from the church's network of seminaries, which train men for the priesthood. A Vatican report released Sunday finds the seminaries to be places where Catholic doctrine is accurately taught and dissent is rare. At the colleges and universities, however, educators are divided on the wisdom of the steps taken against Father Curran and on the document on higher education. To some, the moves threaten the academic independence that has characterized the colleges and universities in the last two decades. But for others the actions represent a long overdue effort to bring the schools in line with orthodox teaching. ''The Vatican has done us a good service,'' said Msgr. Eugene Clark, the John A. Flynn Professor of Catholic Questions at St. John's University in Queens. ''It is forcing the question: What is a Catholic college?'' To Monsignor Clark, the answer is clear: ''Catholic colleges must be a source of pure Catholic teaching.'' ''To present anything less,'' he added, ''would be consumer fraud.'' An Effort to Quiet Dissent But the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, head of the theology department at the University of Notre Dame, said the purpose of a university was to examine ideas in an open atmosphere and not to limit inquiry. He warned that efforts to impose orthodoxy could extend beyond the teaching of theology to other disciplines. ''It is clear that the Vatican does not know what a theologian is and what a university is,'' he said. Both conservatives and liberals agree that the Vatican's steps concerning educational institutions are part of an effort by Pope John Paul II and some United States bishops to quell dissent in the American church. Among the other actions mentioned were the curtailing of the power of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle, the threat to discipline 24 nuns who signed an advertisement in 1984 on abortion, and criticism of Governor Cuomo by the Archdiocese of New York. All the actions involved dissent on sexual issues, particularly abortion. In a curious way, the Catholic schools themselves can be said to be responsible for much of the turmoil in the American church. As Governor Cuomo has said, the schools have produced a generation of educated Catholics who feel they have a right to participate in the shaping of American Catholicism. 'A Right to Be Heard' ''We lay people have a right to be heard,'' said the Governor, a graduate of St. John's University and its law school. He warned that the current mood could lead to a ''restraint of intellectual activity.'' At the core of the debate on the campuses is the extent to which Catholic theology may be challenged at a Catholic university. The test case has involved Father Curran, a popular lecturer for more than 20 years who questioned the church's ban on divorce, birth control and abortion. In the religion department of a secular university, Father Curran would have been left alone; in a regular Catholic college, he might have been the source of some mild questioning. But at Catholic University, the only American college that operates under a papal charter, his views became grounds for dismissal. The Catholic institutions have much in common with America's secular colleges and universities. They have sports teams, professional schools and rathskellers where students drink beer, but they also have things that set them apart. There are chapels and single-sex dormitories. And most require students to take some courses in theology and philosophy. Monsignor Clark said that in the last 20 years ''secularization has menaced the identity of Catholic colleges.'' He noted that many of today's secular colleges, beginning 350 years ago with the nation's first college, Harvard, were founded by religious groups but over the years became secular institutions. Orthodox Catholic teaching must be emphasized, he said, ''or we will go the way of the Protestant colleges.'' But Sister Alice Gallin, executive director of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities in Washington, said the Catholic character of the schools could be expressed in various ways. ''People tend to look only at theology,'' she said. ''We feel that the total environment which pays attention to social justice issues and the value of the individual person is also a fruit of our religious heritage.'' Sister Alice said this broader approach was in keeping with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960's to reach out beyond the Catholic community. This approach includes the teaching of ecumenism, ethics and social values as well as Catholic theology. The sticking point with the Vatican, however, continues to be in theology. Because of his views, Father Curran's license to teach theology at Catholic University was withdrawn by the Vatican. No license is needed to teach at the other Catholic institutions. Nonetheless, some Catholic educators worry that similar standards might be imposed on them because of a draft being circulated by the Vatican, ''Proposed Schema for a Pontifical Document on Catholic Universities.'' Under the proposal, those hired to teach any subject at Catholic colleges around the world would have to demonstrate ''doctrinal integrity and uprightness of life.'' Final decisions involving those who teach theology would be left to the local bishop. Like most American bishops, John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has not commented on the proposal, according to a spokesman, Msgr. Peter Finn. In the past, however, the Cardinal has emphasized that Catholic institutions, particularly schools, should have a distinct Catholic character. Sister Alice's association, which represents all of the American Catholic colleges and universities, has taken a strong position against the proposed document that would regulate the colleges and universities. The presidents of nearly all of the institutions have also signed a statement against the Vatican proposal. Among them is the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. Proposal Called 'Serious Threat' In the current issue of the Catholic magazine America, Father Hesburgh calls the proposal ''a serious threat'' to the ''historical institutional academic freedom and autonomy'' of the American schools. He noted that the schools received $500 million a year in Federal assistance and said most of those funds were ''directed at helping poor students attend them and pay the relatively high tuition costs, which largely sustains these institutions.'' ''Institutional autonomy is essential to Federal support,'' he added. Catholic colleges in the United States began to proliferate in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the arrival of thousands of Irish and Italian immigrants. The newcomers, feeling alienated from the American Protestant culture, wanted a familiar and value-centered educational environment for their children. Most of the schools were founded by religious orders, including the Jesuits, the Dominicans and the Franciscans. Until the 1960's, many of the colleges and universities maintained a distinct Catholic character. As with other colleges of the time, there were strict rules on drinking and curfews, but there was also mandatory attendance at mass, and there was no meat in the cafeterias on Fridays. There were few non-Catholics in the student body and even fewer among the faculty. Things began to change in that decade, in part because of the general changes taking place on other campuses, but also because of the special circumstances within the Roman Catholic Church. There was a liberal mood because of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, and the number of priests and nuns in religious orders began to decrease. A More Nonsectarian Posture Faced with growing financial burdens, most of the Catholic colleges and universities chose to become independent of the religious orders and dioceses that founded them. They began to accept more and more funds from the Government, which required that they adopt a more nonsectarian posture. Nonetheless, the schools kept their identity as Catholic colleges. Under their charters, certain key positions, such as that of university president, were retained by representatives of the founding religious orders. With increased lay control in the last two decades, the schools have flourished; many have gained national reputations. Father Curran and others who support him have warned that the recent Vatican moves could damage the reputation of these schools. At a news conference after the Vatican took away his license, Father Curran said he was concerned that those interested in studying and teaching Catholic theology would look elsewhere when selecting a college. But Monsignor Clark said that today's students were looking for sound teaching rather than for experimentation. ''They are far more conservative and pragmatic than students were 10 years ago,'' he said. ''The faculty, on the other hand, is still giving the old liberal answers that no longer work.'' He cited as an example the position of some Catholic theologians that the Vatican should relax its ban on divorce. ''To a 20-year-old student who has suffered the effects of divorce, that is a horrifying prospect,'' he said. ''It is our students who are changing the atmosphere.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WAGNER TO SEEK SCHOOL CONTRACEPTIVES LIMIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/nyregion/wagner-to-seek-school-contraceptives-limit.html,"The president of New York City's Board of Education said yesterday that he would ask the board to prohibit the dispensing of contraceptives on school grounds to students under 18. The board president, Robert F. Wagner Jr., said that while he still supported the distribution at the health clinics at the schools, there had been ''concern among some board members'' in the last two days about the practice. He said he was eager to expand the number of clinics and hoped to win board support eventually for the contraceptive distribution. Two high schools have been dispensing contraceptives directly to students who have parental consent to use the clinics. Clinics at seven other high schools write prescriptions for students to receive the devices at hospitals or community health services that run the school-based clinics, and that approach would still be allowed under Mr. Wagner's proposal. The two city high schools are among at least 10 nationwide that dispense contraceptives, and 39 more have physicians who can prescribe birth-control pills or devices. [ Page B4. ] In another development yesterday, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York described the schools' program as a ''clandestine effort'' and called it ''outrageous.'' In a statement, Bishop Edward M. Egan, the archdiocese's vicar for education, said the policy was ''dangerous to healthy family values.'' ''At a time when educators at the highest levels are speaking of the crying need for values in education, is this clandestine effort not establishing promiscuity rather than restraint as part of the value system for young Americans?'' the statement said. The superintendent of education for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, Msgr. Vincent D. Breen, said yesterday that the problem of teen-age pregnancy would not be solved ''by encouraging promiscuity, which is the conclusion you can draw from the Board of Education proposal.'' The birth-control program in the health clinics, which began as early as 1984 in some of the schools, was not publicly disclosed until this week. But Mr. Wagner said yesterday that there had been no deliberate effort to keep the program secret. Three of the seven board members, Edward L. Sadowsky, Richard I. Beattie and Mr. Wagner himself, said they approved of the distribution of contraceptives at the schools. But two board members whose votes are considered swing votes on the board, Dr. Irene Impellizzeri and Dr. Gwendolyn C. Baker, are opposed to such distribution. The distribution of contraceptives at school-based clinics or through affiliated clinics run by major hospitals or community health centers came to light in a report on sex education distributed to board members last week. The report said nine high schools had state-financed health clinics that, along with general health services such as physical examinations and treatment of illnesses, offered birth-control counseling, distribution of contraceptives and laboratory testing. Asked at a City Hall news conference yesterday if the school health clinics recommended abortions for pregnant students, the city's Schools Chancellor, Nathan Quinones, said: ''I don't believe a counselor should be an advocate of abortion.'' If a girl was found to be pregnant, her parents should be called in and the clinic's counselor would then discuss what ''options are available'' without advocating a position, he said. Mr. Wagner pointed out that publicly financed health clinics outside the schools legally dispensed contraceptives to people under 18 and without parental permission. Parental Consent Forms Mr. Quinones said new parental consent forms, which parents must sign before a student can participate in any school health clinic services, including obtaining birth-control devices, would be circulated in the next several weeks. Mr. Wagner, in addressing the archdiocese's concern that there had not been public debate on the matter, said he had only learned of the distribution program in last week's report. He said Mr. Quinones knew about it last spring when preparing new consent forms. One high school, West Side High School in Manhattan, an alternative high school for dropout-prone students, where the average student age is 18, has been distributing birth-control devices at its clinic since the clinic was opened in the spring of 1985. At Louis D. Brandeis High School in Manhattan, the parents association, in consultation with the principal, Murray Cohn, has approved the distribution of birth-control devices. Mr. Cohn said Sunday that the distribution had begun, but clinic workers said they were waiting for the new parental consent forms before dispensing the devices. At Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, the new principal, Frank Mickens, said he had halted contraceptive distribution at the school's clinic when he found out about it two weeks ago. Mr. Mickens, who is one of the few blacks who are high school principals in the city system, said he questioned why the nine school-based health clinics were in schools with large numbers of students from minority groups. 'Areas of High Need' A Board of Education spokesman, Robert H. Terte, said a resolution adopted by the board in 1984 authorizing the opening of the nine clinics specifically stated that the clinics should be ''in areas of high need.'' Mr. Wagner, in lining up support for his view that the school-based clinics should be able to provide contraceptives, found unequivocal support only from Mr. Sadowsky and Mr. Beattie. One board member, Dr. Impellizzeri, who is dean of the School of Education at Brooklyn College, said she objected to dispensing contraceptives in the school clinics but did not oppose writing prescriptions for them in a ''privileged doctor-patient relationship.'' Mr. Quinones said four new health clinics would open soon at four junior high schools. But these clinics will not provide prescriptions for contraceptives nor distribute them, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DESPITE U.S. OBJECTIONS, MORE SCHOOLS OFFER FAMILY PLANNING",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/us/despite-us-objections-more-schools-offer-family-planning.html,"Despite objections from some Reagan Administration officials, there has been a rapid increase in the number of clinics that provide family planning and other health care services to students at public schools around the country. Typically, local officials said, the clinics, with the permission of the school authorities, are run by hospitals or community groups that serve the needs of adolescents. Data collected by the Center for Population Options show the number of such clinics has increased from 12 in 1980 to 28 in 1983 and to 61 today. The center, a private nonprofit group based in Washington, seeks to prevent unwanted pregnancy among teen-agers. At least 10 of the school clinics, including 2 in New York City, dispense contraceptives, and 39 more, including one in New Haven and seven in New York City, have physicians who can write prescriptions for birth control pills or devices. The clinics say that two-thirds to three-quarters of their work involves first aid, physical examinations for school athletes, laboratory tests, immunizations, drug abuse counseling and other activities unrelated to family planning. But they regard family planning services as an essential element of their programs. Geraldine W. Johnson, who supervises clinics at two public high schools in Bridgeport, Conn., said today; ''We offer comprehensive health care, but our bottom line is that we want to address the crisis of adolescent pregnancy.'' Parental Consent Needed In some places, such as DuSable High School in Chicago, there has been opposition to the clinics, with picketing by critics. But elsewhere there has been little debate. Dr. Leroy Taylor 3d, director of the clinic at Pinkston High School in Dallas, said birth control and other services were provided to students only with parental consent. Virtually all of the clinics have similar requirements. At many schools parents give consent for their children to receive health services in general, without specifying birth control as a separate item. The Secretary of Education, William J. Bennett, has denounced school birth control clinics as ''a classic bureaucratic response'' to the problem of teen pregnancy. ''This is not what school is for,'' he said in April at a seminar for education writers. ''It offers a bureaucratic solution -a highly questionable, if not offensive one - in place of the exercise of individual responsibility, not just by the children but by the adults around them,'' Mr. Bennett said. Judith Senderowitz, executive director of the Center for Population Options, said the clinics' work was directly related to the educational mission of the schools - to keep students in class. ''A major objective of the clinics is to keep kids in school so they won't drop out because of teen pregnancy,'' she said. Dr. Otis R. Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that teen-age pregnancies were a ''top priority'' of his department, and he noted that, on the average, nearly 3,000 teen-age girls become pregnant in this country every day. While the Reagan Administration has recommended abstention as the best way to prevent such pregnancies, officials at Health and Human Services have not yet developed an official position on the dispensing of contraceptives to students. Judith Steinhagen, principal of DuSable, said that of the 1,850 students enrolled at the school last year, more than 800 used the clinic and 21 percent of the users received family planning information or contraceptives. Opposition to the clinics comes from anti-abortion groups, among others. Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, said his group was concerned that the clinics were acting as funnels into abortion clinics. The Center for Population Options said that none of the school clinics performed abortions. But local officials said that clinics do sometimes refer pregnant teen-agers to abortion clinics after a full discussion of all the options available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABRAMS AND KING TRADE PROBITY CHARGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/09/nyregion/abrams-and-king-trade-probity-charges.html,"Peter T. King, the Republican candidate for State Attorney General, repeatedly questioned the integrity of the incumbent, Robert Abrams, yesterday. Mr. Abrams, in response, tried to link Mr. King with insurance commission kickbacks and pressure on county and town workers to contribute to the Republican Party in Nassau County. The accusations were traded during the candidates' first face-to-face confrontation, a 90-minute debate at The New York Times. Each appeared to be stung by the accusations but reacted with controlled anger, often leaning toward the other to make a charge or rebut one. ''The campaign, I believe, is a campaign to restore integrity in the attorney general's office,'' Mr. King, the Nassau County Comptroller, said. Contributions Under Scrutiny He accused Mr. Abrams of jeopardizing an investigation into organized crime so that he could gain a public relations advantage and of accepting $42,500 in campaign contributions from two New Jersey partners in a Brooklyn co-op conversion. One partner had been convicted 14 years ago of tax evasion as part of a broader investigation of extortion and fraud in the construction of a postal center in New Jersey. Mr. Abrams said that he did not know about the criminal background and that a campaign panel of lawyers was determining what to do about the contributions. Mr. Abrams, in attacking Mr. King, cited scandals in the Nassau Republican Party in the 70's. ''Was he aware of what was going on? Were you aware?'' Mr. Abrams asked, leaning toward Mr. King, who was seated next to him. ''If you were aware, why didn't you say something? If you weren't aware, why weren't you aware?'' A jury in Federal Dstrict Court last year found that the Nassau County Republican Committee had required government workers to contribute 1 percent of their salaries to the party to obtain promotions and wage increases. The verdict has been appealed. Other Topics Covered Mr. King, who has been the Seaford Republican leader since 1975, denied any role in the kickbacks and contributions. He said he had been the leading opponent of Joseph M. Margiotta, the former Nassau Republican leader who was imprisoned for his role in the insurance kickbacks. The personal attacks and talk about crime and corruption dominated the session, but the candidates also covered other issues in replying to questions by four reporters of The Times. The topics included these: * Regarding the New York City corruption scandals, Mr. King favored the appointment of a special state prosecutor to supersede Democratic district attorneys, so that ''Democrats aren't investigating Democrats.'' Mr. Abrams said that a special prosecutor was unnecessary and that he favored creating a state ethics board to investigate potential conflicts of interest. He said the city ethics board was ''very weak.'' * Both candidates opposed testing state employees for drugs, calling it an invasion of civil liberties. ''Note this well, I agree with the Attorney General,'' Mr. King said with a smile. * The candidates argued that the Long Island Lighting Company, rather than its customers, should bear the full $4.6 billion cost of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station if it did not open -even at the risk of bankrupting the utility. * They also strongly criticized the State Public Service Commission, and called for its reorganization. ''I believe it has totally outlived any usefulness it ever had,'' Mr. King said. Mr. Abrams said the P.S.C. had ''lamely'' allowed cost overruns at Shoreham and other nuclear plants. He said that if the agency were more effective, the attorney general would not have to be involved in rate cases. Role as State's Advocate Both candidates said they had obligations to defend the state's positions in the courts, even if they disagreed with them. Mr. Abrams acknowledged that he had not done so in the case of Westway, the long-disputed highway and development project on the West Side of Manhattan that was killed last year, because he had voted against it as Bronx Borough President, just before he was elected Attorney General in 1978. Mr. King said he would step aside and assign an assistant if he were required to defend the state's position permitting Medicaid financing of abortion, which he opposes. Mr. King said he would use the attorney general's office as ''a pulpit'' to promote capital punishment. Mr. King charged that in several instances, including Shoreham and a dispute over the Attorney General's Organized Crime Task Force, Governor Cuomo had shown a lack of confidence in Mr. Abrams. He noted that Mr. Cuomo had assigned his special counsel, Fabian Palomino, rather than Mr. Abrams, to represent the state in the Shoreham case. 'Crime Is Pre-eminent Issue' Mr. Abrams did not respond directly, although he had earlier acknowledged that there had been disagreements between him and the Governor. Mr. Abrams said his first priority, if re-elected, would be to seek more money for all aspects of law enforcement, from the local to the state level. ''Crime is a pre-eminent issue,'' Mr. Abrams said. ''You have to put your money where your mouth is,'' he said, but he could not estimate how much his proposals would cost. Mr. King said his priority would be to coordinate agencies investigating organized crime. ''This is something that requires a total and concerted effort among all facets of the criminal-justice system,'' he said. Both said state legislators should be barred from representing clients before state agencies. They then engaged in an angry exchange over a former Abrams aide who had joined the law firm of Andrew M. Cuomo. The firm has represented seven clients before the real-estate financing bureau of the Attorney General's office. Mr. Abrams said that there had been no impropriety, but that he favored stricter limitations on former state employees in business. Mr. King responded that ''I have no doubt that if Andrew Cuomo's father was Republican, you would have called a news conference and put out a press release on it to condemn it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"KEAN, THE JERSEY POWER, TESTS THE NATIONAL SCENE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/09/nyregion/kean-the-jersey-power-tests-the-national-scene.html,"If Tom Kean is not putting his toe in the water, his aides like to say, he is at least standing on the shore throwing in pebbles. As the Governor of New Jersey has traveled across the country in recent weeks, spreading his message about opening up the Republican Party to members of minority groups and women, his name has popped up more and more often as a Vice-Presidential prospect in 1988. ''I see that stuff, but I don't know how you'd run for Vice President even if you wanted to,'' Mr. Kean said recently, taking a break in his Newark office during a day of official appearances. ''Anyway, I do not want to be 'vice' of anything. I love being Governor of New Jersey, and I like having the executive power to do things.'' 'My Son's in Dartmouth' Well, if ''vice'' doesn't appeal and ''executive'' does, how about President? Mr. Kean came in third in the East, after George Bush and Bob Dole, in a Harris poll of Presidential preferences taken in March. ''Being realistic, you've got to do certain things to run for President,'' Thomas Howard Kean said in his Brahmin accent. ''For one thing, you have to spend a good part of your life in Iowa. I'm not doing that. And I only visit New Hampshire because my son's at Dartmouth.'' His advisers say the Governor understands that, given the current field and the conservative mood, his candidacy would be a very long shot. But their attitude is nothing ventured, nothing gained. When asked if the 51-year-old Mr. Kean is testing the waters, they respond in the spirit of a nod and a wink - a marked contrast to the labored protestations of New York Governor Cuomo's staff on the same subject. ''Any Republican candidate who can win over 60 percent of the black vote and 68 percent of the labor vote has obviously got something to teach the Republicans nationally,'' said the political consultant who worked on Mr. Kean's two gubernatorial races, Roger Stone. But can Mr. Kean - a Republican who supports the Equal Rights Amendment, freedom of choice on abortions, sanctions against South Africa, gun control and environmental protection - ever gain the sup-port of the conservative wing of his party? ''If he has balanced the budget, cut taxes and signed the death penalty, what difference does it make if the self-appointed figures of the far right in Washington don't like him?'' Mr. Stone asked. ''The guy has taken what Reagan gave us and built on it.'' Mr. Kean may not have won over the far right, but the patrician Republican - an Episcopalian millionaire who is a direct descendant of William Livingston, the first governor of New Jersey, and a relation of Theodore Roosevelt and Peter Stuyvesant -has won over this consummately earthy, ethnic, industrial and Democratic state. He went from the slimmest gubernatorial victory margin in New Jersey history in 1981 to the largest one in 1985. Keeping his reputation as ''a nice guy,'' Mr. Kean has been firmly pushing his programs through the Legislature and, with a little help from Brooke Shields and Bill Cosby, polishing New Jersey's image. ''Nobody's made a joke about New Jersey since Gary Hart,'' Mr. Kean said proudly, recalling the Colorado Senator's quip in 1984 about the dubious joys of campaigning at New Jersey toxic-waste dumps. Affairs of One State On this October day, the tall, genial man with the duck-footed walk and gap between his front teeth is concentrating on the affairs of his state. Tom Kean may not be flashy, but he is not dull. His conversation ranges from ''The Federalist Papers'' to the opera ''Otello,'' from Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' to the Jefferson-Hamilton conflicts, from the charms of okra to the culture of China. In the course of a few hours, the former high school history teacher quotes James Baldwin, Thomas Jefferson, Aristotle, Winston Churchill, Adam Clayton Powell, Paul the Apostle, Arthur Conan Doyle, Benjamin Franklin, Lao-Tzu and George Santayana. ''If you know the main threads of our country's history,'' he said, ''you are better equipped to look toward the future and understand the present.'' His brand of Republicanism, he said, is rooted in the beliefs of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and, in some ways, Ronald Reagan. ''Opportunity is the operative word,'' he said. ''Abraham Lincoln's first program was to open up the Western lands and tell people that if they worked a piece of land, they could own it. He made no distinction between black or white people.'' Consistent Manner Unlike many politicians, he does not change his persona to suit different groups. His manner is the same, whether he is talking to mayors or to maintenance workers, to board chairmen or to black children standing outside a Newark hospital. After a rally for Republican candidates in Bloomfield, the Governor continued on with Nick Amato, the Essex County Surrogate who is running for county executive, and Earl Harris, a Newark City Councilman running for Surrogate, to a luncheon of black ministers. ''Isn't it about time that our neighbors in New York State began divesting in those South African companies?'' he asked, to the cheers of the crowd. The Republicans in the New York Senate blocked a divestiture proposal, arguing that the state could better influence events there if it held on to its stock. New Jersey is in the process of divesting itself of $4.3 billion in pension-fund holdings in companies doing business in South Africa. Jefferson and Apartheid ''I don't have much sympathy for those who say there are two views on apartheid,'' he said later. ''I don't think you can teach your children to read Thomas Jefferson and not at some time recognize that apartheid is exactly the opposite of what American democracy is all about.'' He often talks about morality and doing the right thing, but there is no trace of self-righteousness. One of the guests at the luncheon was George Richardson, a black man who was serving in the Assembly with Mr. Kean when the Newark riots broke out in 1967. ''Tom and I met at the Owl Club, a nightclub in Newark, to try to formulate some kind of approach to the cities,'' Mr. Richardson recalled. ''There hasn't been any Republican around since Nelson Rockefeller who could deal with both blacks and whites the way Tom can.'' Prefers Executive Branch Although his grandfather served in the United States Senate and his father in the House, Mr. Kean said he was not drawn to that branch of government. The Governor likes the feeling of accomplishing things every day, sometimes large and sometimes small. When a child wrote a letter last winter, saying that his father would not buy him a skateboard for Christmas unless ''there's a brand new Rolls Royce in the driveway or unless the Governor comes calling at the front door,'' Mr. Kean asked for the address. ''He got the skateboard,'' the Governor said. And finally, those who say Tom Kean is too nice to go far in the rough-and-tumble world of national politics should consider this: The Governor of New Jersey is the man who stood up to Frank Sinatra. The crooner from Hoboken threw one of his famous fits after the Liberty Weekend opening ceremony in July, when he was forced to wait to leave the island because Mr. Kean's boat was first in line for departure. Dock workers were scurrying to move the Kean boat out of the way when the Governor arrived. ''Get that boat out of here,'' the singer screamed. ''That was a very nice performance tonight,'' the Governor replied, with his gentle smile. ''New Jersey appreciated it.'' As Mr. Sinatra mumbled ''Thank you,'' Mr. Kean and his guests boarded and sailed off - leaving the blue-eyed one red-faced. The Governor grinned at the memory. ''A fascinating guy, Sinatra,'' he said, with only a wisp of irony.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICAL NEWCOMER CHALLENGING BRODSKY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/nyregion/political-newcomer-challenging-brodsky.html,"ROBIN BERGSTROM said her interest in politics was awakened as a reporter and news editor of radio station WVIP in Mount Kisco, and then intensified in Albany during the legislative year she worked as an assistant to State Senator Mary B. Goodhue. ''That really turned me on to politics, seeing you could accomplish something - and that women could do anything,'' Ms. Bergstrom said. Now she is seeking to take her interest one step further, as a candidate for the State Assembly in the 86th District of Greenburgh and north Yonkers. But the 39-year-old Republican of Hastings-on-Hudson, who also has the Conservative Party endorsement, faces a formidable task, challenging one of the county's most visible Democrats, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Greenburgh, who is seeking re-election to a third term as an Assemblyman. Mr. Brodsky, who is 40 years old and a former four-term county legislator, won handily in his first try for the Assembly seat in 1982, beating William R. Crosbie, a Republican. Mr. Brodsky got 59 percent of the vote, to Mr. Crosbie's 39 percent in a three-way race. Two years ago Mr. Brodsky won again, this time with 54 percent of the vote against Richard A. Fontana, the former Mayor of Ardsley. The Democrat saw it as a more satisfying victory than the one over Mr. Crosbie ''because 1984 was a Reagan year, and I more than survived the Republican landslide.'' Ms. Bergstrom is seeking to portray Mr. Brodsky as a ''party-line Democrat,'' who represents a ''faction in Albany that continues to spend and not return tax revenues to the people despite tax cuts.'' Mr. Brodsky scoffs at that notion, saying that constituents have benefited handsomely from Cuomo administration tax policies. ''Tax rates are lower, with the maximum down from 10 percent to 9 percent, and personal exemptions are higher,'' Mr. Brodsky argued, while other benefits, credits and deductions have also improved, he said. He also spoke of legislation that he said had helped the district, and he described what he felt was his influential role in the Assembly's Democratic majority. Ms. Bergstrom, for her part, would support amendments offered by the Assembly's Republican minority that would establish educational tax credits providing a typical ''$465 a year for homeowners based on the amount of school taxes they pay.'' She also favors a constitutional amendment to limit spending, ''a state Gramm-Rudman bill,'' she said, referring to the Federal legislation that provides automatic limits on expenditures. ''New York State's short-term debt is the largest of any state, and our per capita taxes the third highest in the nation,'' she said. Ms. Bergstrom argued that she would more adequately represent the views of the district's voters than Mr. Brodsky - ''based on what they tell me on train platforms'' and in other encounters. One such issue is the death penalty, which Ms. Bergstrom favors and Mr. Brodsky opposes. ''The average convicted murderer spends only seven years behind bars,'' she said. ''Crack and the drug problem also is of prime concern,'' the Republican challenger asserted. She said the Legislature ''made it a Class B felony for anybody convicted of selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school, but that doesn't go far enough.'' She favors a Republican amendment that would have eliminated plea-bargaining in such cases, which she said Mr. Brodsky opposed. She has released her 1984 and 1985 tax returns, calling on Mr. Brodsky to do the same. He said he had ''no reluctance'' about releasing his records before the election, saying that ''it's one of the many levels of privacy one gives up in running for office.'' Mr. Brodsky has a list of 26 bills he has sponsored or co-sponsored that have been signed into law in the last two years. A dozen relate specifically to the district, the majority dealing with financial aid to Yonkers. He speaks proudly of having worked closely with State Senator John E. Flynn, a Yonkers Republican who is retiring this year. In fact, Mr. Brodsky's campaign literature includes an article describing this bipartisan relationship, and while it refers to Mr. Flynn as easygoing, gentlemanly and well-liked, it characterizes Mr. Brodsky as aggressive, ambitious and occasionally annoying, but effective. Mr. Brodsky's legislative role has come to the attention of county Democratic leaders who have approached him as a possible County Executive candidate and as a replacement for Mr. Flynn, whose Senate District includes Mr. Brodsky's Assembly District, but the Democrat has rejected those overtures. ''I enjoy my work in the Assembly, and especially being in the majority,'' he said, recalling his frustration as a minority member of the Republican-controlled County Legislature. In the Assembly, by contrast, ''I'm in a leadership role, as a member of the Democratic Steering Committee and chairman of two subcommittees, on economic development and on air quality and nuclear issues.'' He has proposed some controversial legislation, including state takeovers of Consolidated Edison and other private utilities, and he identifies himself with what he feels is the positive record of the Cuomo administration, particularly in terms of tax cuts. ''We put through the largest tax cut in the state's history,'' he said, and more legislation is required. Unless a change is made, the new Federal tax legislation will produce an extra $2 billion in state revenues because the state income tax is linked to the Federal form, thus confronting state taxpayers with higher taxable income but without the lower rates in the Federal version. Mr. Brodsky said he thought further tax cuts would be addressed in a special session of the State Legislature. Ms. Bergstrom has taken aim at Mr. Brodsky for working to oppose a a Westchester hotel tax sought by the Board of Legislators. Assessed on hotel rooms at a rate of 3 percent, the tax would bring in $3 million a year to be used for transportation, according to county officials. But Mr. Brodsky has helped keep the bill from the floor of the Legislature, saying the county government had a $22 million surplus, and that the potential hotel-tax revenues should go to local governments. He accused Ms. Bergstrom, meanwhile, of changing her position on Medicaid financing for abortions to garner the Conservative Party's endorsement in the legislative race. Ms. Bergstrom said she was ''prochoice,'' adding: ''But I would like to see people who believe that abortion is tantamount to murder not have to pay for Medicaid abortions.'' She said this could be done through a tax-form checkoff, just as taxpayers were able to indicate that they wanted a dollar of their tax to help support Presidential campaigns. In the meantime, Conservative Party leaders said she had agreed not to support Medicaid financing for abortions. Mr. Brodsky questioned whether she could be prochoice while opposing Medicaid financing for abortions. Ms. Bergstrom, who is divorced, lives with her two children, Jenny, 17, and Chip, 11, and was the editor of a small news magazine in Dutchess County before coming to Westchester seven years ago. She said she helped develop an all-news morning format for WVIP during her five years as news director. In addition to working for Senator Goodhue, she has been employed on a part-time basis by Reader's Digest, interviewing authors around the nation for a television service provided by the magazine to 160 stations. She has also been involved in community work, she said, and is a vestryman of the Grace Episcopal Church in Hastings. Ms. Bergstrom also had sought an independent line on the November ballot, collecting most of an estimated 2,000 signatures on petitions herself, but some people who signed ''thought they were registered voters, and they were not,'' she said, so the effort failed. Nevertheless, she said, ''it was a marvelous opportunity to meet people.'' The Republican candidate works with volunteers at train stations, supermarkets, fairs and other events in the district, as well as going door-to-door in the evenings and afternoons to meet voters and promote her campaign. She said she had raised $30,000 for the campaign, ''not counting the amount the State Republican Committee is putting into mailings to Republicans, Conservatives and independents.'' Mr. Brodsky puts his own spending figure at $20,000 to $25,000. Mr. Brodsky, married a year ago and the father of a baby girl, Emily, said his opponent had collected ''quite a lot of money; she's by far the most well-financed opponent I've faced.'' He said top Republican leaders were hoping to ''bloody me up'' for future races. The Democratic incumbent, who is also traveling the political circuit to press his case, maintained that the district had become increasingly Republican in the last four years.

MR. POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/magazine/mr-power.html,"IN HIS CORNER OFFICE AT THE JUS-tice Department, a private sanctum guarded by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, Edwin Meese 3d, the 75th Attorney General of the United States, has surrounded himself with symbols of the power he wields: a Border Patrol pistol; a United States marshal's badge; miniature police cars and helicopters. The office says much about the way Meese sees himself, for its motif reflects not so much the lawyer in Meese as it does the hard-nosed lawman: America's top cop. Just outside his door hang two Herblock drawings, portrayals of Meese as the beady-eyed zealot. ''Oh, they're just a couple of funny cartoons,'' Meese says. Yet it is clear that these two caricatures, and some others like them on the walls of his outer office, mean much more to him - they are a symbol of how he has made his presence felt in 19 months as Attorney General. If the next two years produce the conservative transformation in judicial precedent that the Ronald Reagan Presidency has promised but so far not delivered, much of the credit must go to the 54-year-old Meese. The most prominent loyalist from the Reagan California days still in the Administration, Meese has taken center stage in an ideological debate that previously lacked a credible point man within the Government. Now it has one: pornography or drug smuggling, abortion or school prayer, the Attorney General's legal agenda is the President's political agenda. ''His instincts are Ronald Reagan's instincts,'' Fred F. Fielding, the White House counsel during the President's first term, says of Meese. For Meese, the path has been a tortuous one, muddied by infighting at the White House and nearly broken up altogether during his long confirmation hearings by allegations of earlier wrongdoing. But the strength of Ed Meese is perseverance. An iron-willed partisan with a polemical, confrontational style, he is also the quintessential available man, an ambitious loyalist who defines himself through the approbation and acceptance he receives. That combination of loyalty, availability and ambition are essential elements in the rise of Meese, giving him power and access unequaled in the Reagan Administration. Meese frequently sees the President a couple of times a day, offering counsel on matters ranging far beyond his duties at Justice. ''Often, just privately, I'll see him for a few minutes here, or a few minutes there,'' says Meese. ''Sometimes I'll ride in the car with him to someplace.'' Besides serving as Attorney General, Meese is chairman pro tem of the President's Domestic Policy Council, comprising the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and five Cabinet officers in addition to Meese. He also attends meetings of the National Security Planning Group, the handful of top foreign policy and national security advisers that devised last summer's ''disinformation'' campaign against Libya. But it is what he has done at the Justice Department that will be his legacy, for Meese has returned the department to a political role it has not played since the Nixon Administration. Prior to him, the post-Watergate Attorneys General -men with names such as Saxbe, Levi, Bell, Civiletti and Smith - offered a subdued leadership. But Meese has quickly steered the department back to the political arena, shaping it into a reflection of how he sees himself - boldly, morally conservative. In the process he has become its most forceful leader since Robert F. Kennedy. ''This department will be fiercely independent in . . . upholding the law,'' Meese promised at his ceremonial swearing-in in March 1985. ''But this is not inconsistent with conscientiously and vigorously implementing the President's philosophy, which is in the mainstream of today's American political thinking.'' Since then, Meese has played a key role in judicial nominations and has publicly chided the Supreme Court for decisions he disagrees with. In turn, he has experienced the unprecedented public rebuke of two sitting Justices, William J. Brennan Jr. and John Paul Stevens. While conceding that Meese ''has every right to assert his own perception of what justice is,'' Burt Neuborne, professor of law at New York University, who until recently was the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, calls the Attorney General's views ''disastrous.'' ''He is genuinely committed to the proposition that if a majority of the electorate expresses itself on a particular sub- = ject, that majority should not be held in check by the courts,'' says Neuborne of Meese. ''By crippling the courts, he would sacrifice effective protections of individual rights and radically transform society into a majoritarian tyranny. ''The only bright spot in all of this, is that so far he has been able to achieve so little. His rhetoric has far outstripped his effectiveness.'' Over the last several months, I had five interviews with Meese, in which he talked about the Supreme Court, about his perception of the roles of judges and the police, and about his efforts to change the Justice Department. He also discussed his confirmation ordeal, his close friendship with Ronald Reagan, and the death of his son - all of which have profoundly affected him. Because of his blunt, feisty outspokenness, the public perception of the Attorney General is often devoid of the humanizing nuances. But Meese says he is baffled by that image. ''I would ask you to go through all the press conferences I've had since I've become Attorney General, and all the interviews I've given,'' he says. ''I would defy you to find statements or collections of statements that would give rise to the kind of caricature that too often is created of me.'' In person, the Attorney General exudes genuine warmth. His suite of offices is energized by those waiting to see him - F.B.I. Director William H. Webster leaves as an interviewer enters; a group of law-student interns mill about, photographer in tow, to memorialize their moment with Meese; trusted aide William Bradford Reynolds is in the anteroom. But Meese is not preoccupied. He clearly relishes the interchange with his questioner. His gaze is direct and he speaks with certitude. I AM NOT BY NATURE an unduly combative person,'' Meese says. ''I believe in persuasion rather than mortal combat. And to the extent that people are trying to use me as a target for attack, possibly the reason is that I have stood very strongly for the objectives and the priorities and the principles and the philosophy of the President. He stands just as strongly as I do. But when you're the President, you're not as vulnerable to attack.'' Yet Ed Meese rarely misses an opportunity to tackle head-on those who disagree with him. ''To withdraw because there's opposition on the other side,'' he says, ''to back down in the face of that would be cowardice.'' When he works hard to see that judges nominated to the Federal bench will share the Administration's philosophy about such matters as abortion, school prayer and federalism, Meese calls it ''getting the best people.'' When someone criticizes an appointee, that is ''partisan politics.'' ''That's the combination of a party being out of power and being enraged by the fact that Ronald Reagan will be selecting as high a percentage of the judiciary as he is,'' the Attorney General says. ''The fact that it's an election year, and the fact that you just have some people who like to politicize things.'' Meese calls Jefferson B. Sessions Jr., whose nomination for an appeals-court judgeship was rejected in June by the Senate Judiciary Committee, ''a very courageous prosecutor.'' There was a fierce debate over the attitudes of Sessions, a United States Attorney from Mobile, Ala., toward blacks; Meese says it was ''a campaign of ideologues.'' Meese believes that Daniel A. Manion, who narrowly won Senate confirmation in July as an appeals-court judge, was also unfairly singled out. ''If his name had been Smith or Jones,'' Meese contends, Manion wouldn't have been opposed. ''But he was a lightning rod for these ultraliberals, because his father had been connected in some way with the John Birch Society. Anything in which the John Birch Society was involved in was seized upon by the ultraliberal groups to be a basis for politicization.'' But at the suggestion that he has politicized the Justice Department, or that he has favored conservative interests over any others, Meese bristles. ''That's an exaggeration,'' he says. ''I've spoken out on some issues which I think need to be aired. But I don't think that there's anything partisan about my comments on the Constitution.'' Meese says: ''We've tried to find the kinds of judges that should be acceptable to any group. If you look at the judges who have had difficulties, I mean, how can you do better, or get a more acceptable person, than a man who has got 15 years of distinguished service on the Supreme Court to be appointed Chief Justice? How can you get a better person, or a more acceptable person, than a man like Nino Scalia, who has got an impeccable record in a variety of ways: as a practicing lawyer, as a teacher, on the appellate court? I think you can't find two more qualified people in the history of Supreme Court appointments.'' MEESE TAKES from a folder on his desk several sheets of paper that together constitute his blueprint for change at the Justice Department. He has drawn up these documents so that he can clearly focus on the task at hand. In a two-page outline entitled ''Policy Goals,'' he has neatly encapsulated his agenda. There are the usual priorities that any Attorney General would have - controlling narcotics trafficking, terrorism and public corruption - and there are others which are innocent-sounding euphemisms for the conservative political course that the Attorney General has embarked on. ''Total nondiscrimination policy,'' for instance, stands, among other things, for an end to racial quotas benefiting minority groups, an Administration goal that was directly repudiated by the Supreme Court in its last term. Meese, however, has not given up on it. ''Preservation of constitutional values'' encompasses some of the most important issues on the Reagan Administration's social-policy agenda, including leaving to the states the issues of abortion reform and prayer in the schools. ''Religious liberty'' means going to court, as the department did this summer, to defend the Roman Catholic Church against the loss of its tax-exempt status when another church-related group contended it was engaging in political lobbying and campaigning in opposition to legal abortion - activities the tax exemption does not permit. Meese believes that even in defeat there is still glory in losing for a good cause. That is why he was willing last spring to use a relatively trivial case to ask the Supreme Court to overturn its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion - even though the constitutionality of Roe hadn't been an issue in the case and even though the High Court had specifically reaffirmed the Roe decision three years earlier. The department lost its case, 5 to 4, but then-Chief Justice Warren E. Burger switched camps, questioning for the first time the wisdom of the Roe decision. ''We got one step closer,'' Meese says. Similarly, he sees the Justice Department's defeat earlier this year in three affirmative action cases as hinging on a mere technicality. Though conceding that the Court directly repudiated his contention that quotas can be used only to aid specific, identifiable victims of discrimination, Meese says that ''even in losing, there was acquiescence by the Court that the point we were making should be the end result, someday. They just said we're not ready to do that yet.'' The biggest victory of the term, Meese says, was the Supreme Court's upholding of the Georgia antisodomy law - a case the Justice Department wasn't even involved in. ''We don't have to be in a case to get our view across,'' Meese says. ''The point of view that we've been making - that the Court should not supersede its judgment for the judgment of the states -was vindicated in that case.'' Another of the Attorney General's innocuous-sounding policy goals is to ''promote truth in the courtroom.'' But what Meese really wants is the total repeal of the Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda v. Arizona decision, which requires the police to inform suspects of their constitutional rights, and its 1961 Mapp v. Ohio decision prohibiting the introduction of evidence obtained without a valid search warrant. These two rulings have, according to Meese, ''inhibited truth in the courtroom.'' He maintains: ''They have cast aside probative evidence for non-truth-finding reasons. Neither Mapp nor Miranda helps any innocent person. They only help guilty people. I think if you look at all the cases, the only evidence that ever's been excluded is evidence of guilt. ''Obviously, in taking public positions, I don't have the time, or the audience, to go into legal subtleties. But I think the average man in the street understands what it means if the truth about criminals is excluded from the courtroom. And when the Mapp and Miranda cases are explained to most people, they understand that they are less safe from criminals. That's not hard to figure out.'' According to Meese, ''there are better ways'' to avoid the police abuses that the two decisions were meant to counteract. One, he says, is, ''videotaped confessions, so there will be no possible way that you could have coercion or any intimidation by the police.'' But he adds, ''The best way, frankly, is with well-trained, well-disciplined, well-supervised policemen.'' Since his youth - when his father, a clerk at the Oakland police court, would come home and regale him with stories about the cases he'd heard that day - Meese has had a fascination with police work. His sympathies are with the cop on the beat who wants to nab the culprit, and he seems genuinely perplexed by the judicial concern about police misconduct. ''Most of the time,'' he says, ''the officer is not acting illegally.'' To Meese, lawyers and judges are the ones who argue the technicalities. ''I wouldn't want to be a judge,'' he says; not even the Supreme Court would interest him. ''That's the one thing I've absolutely ruled out. For me, the job of being a judge, on whatever bench, would be much too confining for anything I would really enjoy.'' Meese is proud of the stand he has taken against judicial activism. A judge's job, he insists, isn't ''to decide how the police officer's going to act -his function is to find the facts. ''You may want to argue on what should be the niceties,'' he says. ''But if you take my approach, and the approach of most people in law enforcement, the more evidence you get in, the more likely you're going to find the truth, which ultimately should be the end result of the courtroom process.'' TO ''IMPROVE THE MAN-agement'' of the 62,500-employee Justice Department, Meese is centralizing policy planning and budgeting under the control of a few trusted deputies. To implement his policy goals, he has organized key executives into small teams whose job it is to focus on Administration priorities. Meese and six top aides, including F.B.I. Director Webster and Assistant Attorney General Reynolds, comprise the ''command group'' that meets every morning at 8:10 to map strategy. Another group, chaired by Meese's new Deputy Attorney General, Arnold I. Burns, matches the department's budgetary resources to its priorities. A third group, headed by Reynolds, does strategic planning because, Meese explains, ''I wanted a group of people who were not involved with the day-to-day issues to look to see where the justice system and the department ought to be five years from now.'' Of Meese's aides, the 44-year-old Reynolds is probably the best known. Reynolds retained his position as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division after the Senate Judiciary Committee last year refused to confirm him as Meese's new Associate Attorney General. Reynolds has been the Justice Department's most uncompromising foe of racial quotas, and he continues to play a key policy-making role within Meese's inner circle. He has also kept up the attack on the Supreme Court, last month accusing Justice Brennan of possessing ''radical'' views that threaten individual liberty. Meese, who says he has not read the speech in which Reynolds made his charges, refused to comment on it. ''I don't know any reason why I should particularly read it,'' he said. ''People give speeches all the time in the department here.'' T. Kenneth Cribb Jr., 38, is the Attorney General's closest aide, and probably the least-known outside of the department. A one-time national director of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, the oldest conservative student organization in the country, and a consultant to the Heritage Foundation, Cribb served on Meese's staff at the White House and followed him to the Justice Department. Now, as the Attorney General's counselor, Cribb stays in the background and receives almost no publicity, yet he serves as a link between Meese and conservative interest groups. ''I am a source of information for the Attorney General about people who want him to entertain their views,'' Cribb says. ''I am sometimes asked to attend meetings to make his views known, and to report back to him.'' During Meese's long confirmation battle, Cribb sat behind Meese every day that he testified. One Senate staff member swears they even dressed alike, so that ''from behind the dais they just sort of melded together.'' At the White House, a ''principals only'' rule was imposed to keep Meese from bringing Cribb into the weekly meetings at which judicial nominees were chosen. ''Ken Cribb is kind of my principal personal assistant,'' says Meese. ''He's an additional set of arms, legs and, particularly, brains.'' In Cribb's view, the debate over judicial activism still has many years to run: ''The public discussion has been started by this Attorney General, but it takes a generation for day-to-day politics to catch up with ideas that are first expressed in a philosophical context. For example, the politics of the 1960's were the result of philosophical ideas first expressed in the 1930's. So what we're saying now will be important for generations to come.'' An inveterate note-taker and maker of charts and diagrams, Meese likens his role at Justice to being atop a well-regimented corporate structure. During his tenure at the White House, however, where his Cabinet-level staff job of counselor to the President gave him responsibility for seeing to it that each department hewed closely to the President's policies, Meese found himself part of an organization beset by jealousies and infighting. The battle among the President's top advisers was frequently waged through the press, and it was Meese's reputation that suffered the most. ''He was supposed to formulate policy and James Baker, the chief of staff, was supposed to make the trains run on time,'' one White House aide recalls. ''But he never really got the policy-development syndrome. You'd go through a meeting with him and think everything had been decided, and then absolutely nothing would happen. The uncertainty led to internecine fights, and ultimately the policy development got done elsewhere.'' Meese now strongly defends his record at the White House, saying that he ''established what is generally looked upon as the strongest Cabinet system of any President in modern time.'' He was, however, outflanked by Baker, who took the White House policy-making role for himself. But Baker's credentials were suspect among conservative factions. Baker had been George Bush's Presidential campaign manager. He hadn't even registered as a Republican until 1970. This closet moderate couldn't be the conservatives' friend in the White House. But Meese could. ''It turned out that Baker was the pragmatist, the doer,'' says a former Reagan Administration official. ''But he was also the one the conservatives tended to scream about. They thought he was breaking the faith. And Meese became the person who conservatives turned to. He filled a vacuum. He became, in essence, what other conservatives thought he was - what they made him into. He became the darling of the conservatives.'' Paul D. Kamenar, executive legal director of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation, describes the relationship between the Justice Department and conservative interest groups as ''conscious parallelism.'' ''It helps the department when we come in as an amicus curiae taking a more extreme viewpoint,'' Kamenar says. ''That way they can't be called extremist.'' ED MEESE WAS born and raised in Oakland, Calif. ''I was born in 1931, in the Depression,'' Meese says. ''Our family never had a lot of money. This was never a big thing to my folks, and never a big thing to us.'' At the age of 10, he and his three younger brothers published their own weekly neighborhood newspaper and put the $6.40 they earned from it toward war bonds. He was valedictorian of his public high school class and the winner of a Lions Club speakers' contest. He notes with pride that all four of the Meese boys went to college. ''My folks made a lot of sacrifices so that we could,'' he says. He traveled East for the first time in 1949, to attend Yale, where 60 percent of his 1,123 classmates had graduated from elite Eastern preparatory schools. Meese, having been awarded a last-minute scholarship that he now calls ''a fluke,'' was virtually the antithesis of the typical Yale student, but he found a niche for himself with a slew of extracurricular activities: debate team; Political Union; a religious club; freshman crew; manager of the track team; librarian at his residential college. Among his notable qualities were an abiding loyalty to even casual acquaintances, and his energy and enthusiasm for almost any task. Two of Meese's younger roommates at Yale recalled recently how he took an almost parental interest in them, patiently teaching one to play bridge and helping another to get into a Yale society. ''He was naive,'' recalls Maxwell K. Dickinson, a former roommate of Meese's and now a Florida stockbroker. ''He didn't look under rocks to see what was bad about everything. He wasn't jaundiced. He never had bitter things to say. I don't remember anything ever disappointing him.'' After graduation, Meese returned to California and started law school at Berkeley, finishing in 1958, after a two-year interruption to serve as an artillery officer in the Army. He joined the Oakland District Attorney's office just out of law school, and was still there a few years later, when Sanford H. Kadish, a Berkeley law professor, recruited him to help teach a clinical law program. ''I needed someone who was actually working in the field,'' Kadish remembers. ''Ed was willing. He was very reliable. Always did what he was supposed to do. Genial. Likable. There was a softness and a gentleness to him, no sharp edges to his personality. ''Ed didn't have profound political convictions. He was your average, diligent young fellow from an average Republican background, and he might have continued in just that way, except that his attractiveness led to opportunities. He became an ally of people who had very profound political beliefs, and he assimilated those beliefs.'' There is a disarming simplicity to the way Meese characterizes his relationship with the man who has given him, or helped him get, just about every important job he has had during the last two decades. ''Well, I guess the way I'd describe it, we have worked together closely for almost 20 years,'' Meese says of Ronald Reagan. ''We are good friends. And we are people who, by and large, without any real effort on my part to do this, come up with the same viewpoint on most issues, pretty much totally independent of each other.'' Privately, White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan has bridled at Meese's easy access to the President. But anyone who has ever attempted to cut Meese off has ended up the loser. Always, the President stands by him. The two first met in Sacramento. Reagan was the newly elected Governor of California, and Meese was a young deputy district attorney from Oakland with a penchant for publicity. Campus turbulence in the 1960's had already given Meese his first big break: he had directed the arrest in 1964 of 761 protesters at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1966, he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee that the Berkeley organizers of an early antiwar group were giving ''aid and comfort to the enemy'' and that penalties of $20,000 and 20 years in prison wouldn't be inappropriate if the group carried through with plans to march on an Army induction center. Meese signed on as the Governor's extradition and clemency secretary but soon transformed the job into that of Reagan's legal-affairs adviser, and within two years was his executive secretary, the highest staff job. He was the capable, loyal aide who reduced complex problems to a few clear choices for his boss to choose from. When Reagan left office in 1974, Meese moved to the San Diego suburb of La Mesa. After a year with Rohr Industries Inc., a manufacturer of aerospace components, he started a law practice; his main clients were the Reagan precampaign committee, called Citizens for the Republic, and the state Chamber of Commerce. In 1977, Meese began teaching at the law school of the University of San Diego, a small private school. He also became director of the law school's Center for Criminal Justice Policy and Management. During his three-year tenure with the center, which was financed by conservative groups, Meese published three papers, two dealing with police-press relations and a third on child abuse. The Attorney General now looks upon his days in San Diego wistfully. ''We had a beautiful home,'' he says. ''I had a good job. I had the ability to do three things: teach, direct the criminal justice center, and practice law on the side. And, economically, we were doing very well. So it was an ideal situation. I would have been very happy to stay there.'' It is easy to understand how Meese could romanticize his time in San Diego. It had been a charmed existence compared to what awaited him in Washington. Besides the infighting at the White House, there were financial problems brought on by carrying two big mortgages. Unable to sell his home in La Mesa for 20 months, Meese had nonetheless purchased a new house in McLean, Va. He fell 15 months behind in his payments on the California residence, but two savings and loan officials who oversaw Meese's account looked the other way. Both later got Federal jobs, as did a La Mesa businessman who arranged a $70,000 loan - later forgiven - to a buyer to facilitate the purchase of Meese's house. Questions were also raised, among other things, about Meese's stock trading and whether he obtained special treatment from Government agencies for businesses in which he had an interest. It was such goings-on that led his predecessor at Justice, William French Smith, to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Meese. When Meese has occasion to mention Smith now, it is almost never by name. He is ''my predecessor'' the same way a candidate might refer to ''my opponent.'' The investigation was an election-year liability for Ronald Reagan, but he stuck by his friend as he always had before, and Meese - who denied any wrongdoing - was eventually cleared. In March 1985, 13 months after he was first nominated, he was sworn in as Attorney General. One of his lieutenants remembers how his boss tried to laugh off the ignominy during one of his first staff meetings. ''Not such a bad record,'' Meese had quipped, ''nominated in February, confirmed in March.'' Meese does not like to discuss the year he spent in limbo, a period when Justice Department morale sank perceptibly. But it is clear he was deeply affected by it. He calls the confirmation battle ''an unfortunate byproduct of the ultrapartisan politics that's practiced by some people here. But I don't think you're ever going to change people. There are just some people who believe in political character assassination, and it's unfortunate that they get elected. It's one of the sad parts about any political system.'' Of this time, Meese now says: ''You always have days when you wake up and say, 'Why are you doing this?' I told the President that if he at any time felt it was hurting him, I didn't want to proceed. He insisted just absolutely the opposite. He wanted me to go through with the thing. It was that kind of support. I felt a commitment to him. I wanted to carry out what the President wanted me to do.'' In the summer of 1982, Meese's 19-year-old son Scott, the middle of three children and a sophomore at Princeton, was killed in an automobile accident. Meese and his wife, Ursula, were devastated by the tragedy. ''It's the worst thing, obviously, that's ever happened to us,'' he says now, his eyes welling up. ''And I think I was just fortunate to have a lot of very good friends who were helpful at that time, including the President, who was extremely helpful and supportive. The President and Nancy Reagan.'' Meese holds dear the traditional values that his relationship with the Reagans embodies. In his own mind, the Justice Department is an extension of those values, providing law enforcement that is not just vigorous but, he says, ''compassionate'' as well. As Meese sees it, that means protecting the average man from crime, from pornography or even his own Government. And he has no doubt that the people who really matter are behind him. ''The law enforcement community has labored for many years being the scapegoat for the increase in crime, while having to take a lot of court decisions which have been inimical to effective law enforcement,'' he says. ''I have gotten a tremendous response from the law enforcement community because I am willing to speak out on issues which are key to protecting the public.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BELAGA AND THE GENDER FACTOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/nyregion/belaga-and-the-gender-factor.html,"IF you know that Julie D. Belaga is the first Republican woman to run for Governor, it is probably not because she told you. Mrs. Belaga does not talk much about being a woman. Governor O'Neill, the Democratic incumbent, challenges her politics, not her gender. But it is Mrs. Belaga's sex, not her politics, that some say could change voting patterns. Any split between how women view the election and the issues and how men take sides in the contest could make the difference for some candidates between winning and losing on Nov. 4, they say. ''That difference is the difference between Democrats being able to recapture the legislature,'' said Dr. Stanley Greenberg, president of the Analysis Group, a polling company in New Haven. ''It's the difference between who wins control of the Congressional delegation,'' which stands even now, with three Democrats and three Republicans. The difference between how men and women vote, with the tendency of women in recent years to vote Democratic more than men, ''exists at an issue level, it exists at a party level, it exists at a voting level,'' said Dr. Greenberg, who is working for the Democratic Party. The presence of female candidates such as Mrs. Belaga could change that. Although she is a Republican, will female voters be more likely to vote for Mrs. Belaga because she is a woman? In exit polls during the 1984 Presidential election, the three major television networks found fewer women than men voting Republican - 56 percent of the women compared with 62 percent of the men, according to The New York Times-CBS News poll. Other polls found that women provided the margins that elected Democratic Senators in Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Iowa. Women are a substantial majority of the Connecticut electorate. Of the more than one and a half million registered voters, 893,328, or nearly 60 percent, are women, according to the Analysis Group. Although statistics on turnouts in the state are not available, nationally in 1984, turnout among female voters was clearly higher than for men, for the first time. According to a Census Bureau survey, 61 percent of the registered female voters, as opposed to 59 percent of the men, voted. Women cast 53.5 percent of the vote. Republicans nationally and in the state are apparently counting on female candidates to help reverse the trend toward the Democrats. But it will be Mrs. Belaga's stands on issues that concern women, say Republican leaders, that will persuade women to vote for her. Dr. Barbara Kaplan of the Gene Reilly Group, a market researcher in Darien, doubted the effect of a candidate's sex. ''I'm not sure that being a woman is any more important than being a candidate who understands'' how to stress issues that appeal to women, Dr. Kaplan said. ''I don't think the Democrats or the Republicans can lay claim to the women's vote,'' said Dr. Kaplan, whose research is based on interviews with groups of women. ''The candidate who gains an advantage is the candidate who can present the issues in a compelling way that shows women how public policy can resolve their personal problems,'' she said. The problems, according to Dr. Kaplan, generally concern economics and go far beyond what are considered traditional women's issues, such as equal pay or abortion. ''Being a woman and being appealed to as a woman is not as important as being poor and having to pay the rent and pay for day care,'' she said. Republican leaders said Mrs. Belaga should be able to appeal successfully on the issues. ''If the economy and those things are of big importance'' to female voters, ''then we're going to be right on target, because of the kinds of things we'll be selling to the public and the issues that Republicans stand for,'' the state chairman, Thomas J. D'Amore Jr., said. ''If you do things in an artificial sense that says, 'O.K., we're going to go after the women's vote and try to buy it,' so to speak, I think the public's much too sophisticated for that.'' The Democratic chairman, Timothy J. Moynihan, said: ''People don't specifically vote on ethnic background, gender or whatever. They make the comparison on ability, credibility and performance.'' Mrs. Belaga, a five-term legislator from Westport, conceded her gender helped. But, she added, she is not making a ''conscious effort to woo women.'' ''There's an instant affinity there,'' she said. ''There are women who come talk to me immediately about the fact that I am out there running, proud of what I'm doing, excited that I have good credentials, that there are no apologies for who I am or what I'm all about, and they're cheering me on.'' Being a woman, she said, ''is an asset in that it helps me break into traditional groups of people that might not vote Republican if I were a male candidate.'' ''When you meet someone for the first time as a woman,'' Mrs. Belaga said, ''you have to show them that you're bright, that you can handle the issues and that you have ideas on how to solve problems. 'Once you do that, I think it becomes an asset.'' State Representative Christine M. Niedermeier, a four-term Democrat from Fairfield who is challenging United States Representative Stewart B. McKinney in the Fourth Congressional District, said, ''We're still at the point where women are given the benefit of the doubt and looked upon as being extrasensitive to people and their problems.'' However, she acknowledged that if statistics showed women moving to the Democratics, they also show men moving to the Republicans. ''I need to get support from women, so I can't take them for granted, but if I play a campaign just to women, I'm going to lose support from men who are just as equally an important part of the electorate,'' she said. However, even in Connecticut, where from the statehouse, Ella T. Grasso calmed many skeptics about women in politics, questions linger. Mrs. Belaga mentioned that some older, ethnic women were skeptical of her candidacy. Miss Niedermeier, as she was campaigning at a picnic for the elderly, was asked when she would marry. The ultimate test will be at the polls. The 1984 shift of men to the Republicans, along with President Reagan's ability to attract a majority of women, closed many disparities nationally. But they remain open in state and local races. ''The gender gap is as large now as it ever was,'' Dr. Greenberg said. ''I don't see anything in Connecticut politics that would make me think it would override that process. Ronald Reagan was able to override it, but there is no Ronald Reagan in Connecticut politics.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 CENTS A WORD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/books/2-cents-a-word.html,"IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY Memoirs of Writing, Presidential Politics, and the Diplomatic Life. By John Bartlow Martin. 345 pp. New York: William Morrow & Company. $19.95. AT 71, John Bartlow Martin is a survivor of a virtually extinct breed of journalists who thrived in the glory days of ''the big slicks'' - one of the best of some 50 freelancers prolific enough to earn a living writing ''heavy fact'' pieces for The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and other mass magazines in the 1940's and 1950's. He is also (not quite obsolete) a devoutly liberal Democrat, unabashed and unregenerate. Catching his first sight of Eleanor Roosevelt on a Manhattan street in the mid-1950's, he stood at attention and put his hat over his heart. And he worked as a speechwriter for all of his party's Presidential candidates from Adlai Stevenson to George McGovern. His work for Stevenson led eventually to the most distinguished of Mr. Martin's 16 books, ''The Life of Adlai E. Stevenson,'' a labor of 10 years that he published in two volumes in 1976 and 1977. His work for John F. Kennedy led him into the rough-and-tumble role of Washington's Ambassador to the Dominican Republic after the dictator Rafael Trujillo Molina was assassinated in 1961, and he received a special reassignment to that hot spot after United States troops were dispatched there by President Johnson in 1965. All this is very much the stuff of reminiscence, and Mr. Martin recounts his story in ''It Seems Like Only Yesterday'' with candor, modesty, a fine reportorial gift for detail and anecdote and the kind of easy flow that is more artful than it seems. He is disarmingly unstuffy. He began his freelance career at the age of 23 by leaving The Indianapolis Times and setting up shop in a Chicago hotel that advertised ''$1 a day, laundry free, we pay cab fare from the railroad station, $5 a week on a monthly basis.'' In a few years he was writing a million words a year and selling half of them, at 2 cents a word. His mainstay was true crime stories; sometimes under different names he had as many as four pieces in a single issue of Official Detective. Soon he broke into Harper's and developed a tonier genre, ''crime in its social context.'' Then came a major coup - his monumental report on the Centralia, Ill., mine blast that took 111 lives in 1947. At some 18,500 words, the longest story Harper's had ever run, it documented relentlessly that everyone up to the Governor of Illinois had known the mine would explode and nobody had stopped it. The story vastly widened Mr. Martin's market and his horizon of subjects - prison reform, desegregation, mental illness, abortion, the criminal justice system, all made vivid in human terms. Many of these stories sprang from a do-good impulse that made him a natural recruit when chance brought him into Governor Stevenson's orbit early in the Presidential campaign of 1952. Though he had never written a speech before or grappled as a partisan with a political issue, he became one of the Governor's ''Elks,'' a team of writers tucked away at the Elks Club in Springfield, Ill., because Stevenson was jealous of his own reputation for grace at the podium. Mr. Martin mastered the craft (in later years Hubert Humphrey once exclaimed gratefully, ''He makes me sound like Stevenson'') and added some wrinkles of his own. He developed a technique of ''editorial advance,'' traveling ahead of the candidate to do reportorial legwork and briefing papers that told him what to expect and what was expected of him at each stop. It was a technique Mr. Martin later brought to the Kennedys, John in 1960 and Robert in the primaries of 1968. THESE memoirs should be especially rewarding to aspiring (and even some practicing) journalists for the smoothly integrated instruction of how a superb professional goes about his job. There are plums for the general reader as well, such as a paean to Chicago's tawdry magnetism, an anatomy of its guileful political machine and an appreciation of Mayor Richard Daley, who had a memorable response to Adlai Stevenson 3d's request for political advice: ''Don't change your name.'' Interwoven in these memories of John Bartlow Martin as writer, political honcho, diplomat and liberal activist is an affectionate tapestry of family life that may contain the ultimate judgment on him and his influence. His three grown children are all in the public sector in Washington. His daughter is a social worker helping Cambodian refugees. One of his sons has worked for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and the other for Walter Mondale and then Governor Cuomo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An Imposed Ignorance,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/opinion/l-an-imposed-ignorance-378986.html,"To the Editor: ''Room for Darwin and the Bible'' is a good vehicle for raising an important issue that is seldom discussed: our unwillingness to tolerate rational discussion of claims made in the name of religion (or allegedly backed by religion) as proper subject matter for public education. Irving Kristol is a case in point. He holds that the scientific theory of evolution should not be taught as dogmatic fact but as a hypothesis. But how then should the creationist account be taught? Apparently not at all in the public schools, even though Mr. Kristol holds that as a matter of faith it ''is perfectly defensible.'' Leave this defense to the parochial schools and churches. Suppose we generalize this advice. We live in an age where morality itself is linked with Christianity and the very association of a belief with ''secular humanism'' is sufficient to condemn it, where many politicians and even one potential Presidential candidate claim religious backing for their viewpoints and where religious leaders of various faiths use the prestige and authority of their offices to express opinions on abortion and other matters of public policy. Mr. Kristol's view leaves no place for the rational evaluation of such claims in the public school setting. It condemns to ignorance those who do not have the means or will to study theology. It is often said that a person's religion is a private matter. Fair enough. But when religion is used to defend public policies that affect all of us, believer and unbeliever alike, the rational evaluation of its claims becomes proper subject matter for the general educational process. I strongly suspect that our failure to encourage such an evaluation as part of the normal process of education in the public schools is associated with a common fallacy: the confusion of the question whether a person has a right to hold a religiously oriented opinion with the quite different question of the rightness (correctness) of that opinion. A person has a right to hold such an opinion, but that does not make it right.DONALD F.

APARTHEID ISSUE ROILS OSSINING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/nyregion/apartheid-issue-roils-ossining.html,"DURING the last few weeks officials of the town and village of Ossining have been confronting the issue of South Africa's apartheid policy instead of the zoning and budget questions that generally occupy their agendas. What brought the issue to the forefront in the town of Ossining was a yearly running event; in the village, it was the adoption of an investment policy for village funds. The yearly Ossining Town Road Race is scheduled to take place today as it has on this date for the last seven years, but with one difference. The town has withdrawn its sponsorship, in the process removing its contribution of publicity and cleanup and some of the police protection previously given to the race. The split came when the race committee insisted that the official race T-shirts carry an antiapartheid slogan and the town insisted that it could not get involved in political issues that were beyond town matters. The five-member Town Board voted unanimously to withdraw its support of the road race because, as Supervisor Barbara C. Fratianni explained, ''We don't wish to make political statements.'' She added: ''The members of the Town Board are all personally opposed to apartheid, but the town should not get involved in making political statements because you're opening up the floodgates. Once you establish a precedent, how can you decline any other requests?'' The 16 members of the race committee, all of whom voted to go ahead with the T-shirt slogan even if it meant losing town support, said ''Stop Apartheid'' did not set a precedent because it was not like other political statements. ''This is not an issue like any other issue because it has only one moral stand that you can take a side on,'' Clay Tiffany, the race director, said. He accused town officials of harassment in an effort to block use of the slogan and discourage sponsors. During the three Town Board meetings when the race was discussed, Mr. Tiffany said, he was told that he had not submitted papers necessary to administrate the 13.1 and 1-mile runs and that he could not include the name Ossining in the official name of the race. Once a decision not to sponsor the race was made, the town used paid advertisements, in addition to legal notices, to announce the town's disassociation. Originally the race committee had agreed to use ''Save the River'' as a slogan, and Mr. Tiffany said the Town Board had not objected. But when the slogan changed, the board, despite 1,800 local signatures collected supporting the antiapartheid slogan, withdrew town sponsorship. The signatures had no bearing on the decision, Mrs. Fratianni said. ''It's a cut-and-dried case,'' she said. ''The town should not be the vehicle for the expression of self-interest groups. Next year it may be 'Stop Abortion' or some other slogan.'' Mrs. Fratianni, expressing disappointment over the controversy, said the nonprofit race had been a very important town event. When it was established eight years ago, it was part of an effort to familiarize people outside the town with Ossining. Because road races were relatively new then, it became a success, featuring about 300 runners, plus entertainment, food booths and a large turnout of residents. Mr. Tiffany beleives that today's race will be a success in spite of the town's withdrawal. By last week about half of the $4,600 he said was needed - to pay for additional police protection, insurance, publicity, printing, refreshments and entertainment - had been raised, he said. He added that the committee had difficulty this year in attracting large sponsors. American Cable Systems is the major contributor, he said, adding that most businesses in town had contributed smaller sums. Meanwhile, another controversy involving South Africa's racial policy is coming to a close in Ossining. The village of 22,000 residents is ready to adopt an investment policy that does not include the antiapartheid clause that had been demanded by a village Trustee and a resident. The village is required by the state to formulate an investment policy to assure the reliable investment of village funds, in this case several million dollars, according to the Mayor. But Thomas Cambariere, a village Trustee, said adoption of a policy presented an opportunty for the village to take a stand against apartheid by including a clause that would prevent investment of village funds in banks that have investments in South Africa. ''If every municipality took such a stance it would make a significant difference,'' Mr. Cambariere said. ''Whether it's a dollar or a million dollars, it's the same principle - dollars don't govern the principle. And I think I'm in synch with the feelings of many people in the community.'' Al Berger, a village resident, agreed, arguing that if the village's money supported apartheid it was the responsibility of the Village Board of Trustees to act. But Mayor Joseph G. Caputo said state guidelines had been used to formulate the village's investment policy and that the other trustees felt that their personal opposition to apartheid should not influence their decision as village officials. He added that only one of the five banks designated by the Village Board to be considered for handling village funds, Barclay's, had South African connections and that the bank was making no new investments in South Africa. The United States Congress in fact barred new investment in South Africa by American businesses earlier this month when the Senate voted to override a Presidential veto of legislation imposing stiff economic sanctions on South Africa. ''We are a village, and we are interested in our own priorities,'' Mr. Caputo said. ''I just didn't think it was necessary to put such a statement in the policy.'' There is a tacit agreement among the officials of some municipalities in the county not to invest in banks with South African connections. In Yonkers there was an ''earnest request'' from the City Council to formalize such an agreement, said Arthur J. Doran, the City Manager. However, he added, the city was advised by the State Comptroller's office that each municipality was required to invest where yields were highest and that ''it was inappropriate for local jurisidictions to formulate foreign policy.'' While most municipalities have not dealt with the issue, the county adopted a resolution a year ago barring investments in banks that had made loans to the Government of South Africa or to private banks in South Africa, according to Mark Moran, a county spokesman.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCHOOL CLINICS ACROSS NATION DEFEND ROLE WITH TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/13/us/school-clinics-across-nation-defend-role-with-teen-agers.html,"An increasing number of schools around the country are looking beyond the school nurse's office in an effort to bring health care to low-income students and to combat teen-age pregnancy. According to participants in a national conference on school-based clinics held here this week, comprehensive clinics are providing services and a sense of community for students who might otherwise never see a doctor or counselor. An estimated 61 of such clinics are in operation around the nation now, many providing sex counseling and reproductive health information along with examinations, immunizations, first aid, drug and alcohol abuse programs, nutrition advice and other services tailored to adolescents in low-income areas. The Center for Population Options, a national advocacy group, says 100 more schools expect to open clinics. The sex counseling aspect of the clinics' work stirred controversy in New York City this week when attention was called to the practice of school-affiliated clinics' dispensing contraceptives to teen-agers. Conference participants here in Denver acknowledged their concern with teen-age pregnancy and birth control, but stressed that the clinics provide a positive climate while offering general health care. Most of the clinics require written consent from parents before they see a child. ''We look at sex education as a part of good health care - sex education is separate from health care in people's minds,'' said Truman Thomas, director of social services for the Children and Youth Project of the pediatric department at the University of Texas, which opened a school-based clinic in Dallas in 1967. Looking at Broader Problems In his opening speech, Dr. James P. Comer, director of the School Development Program at the Yale University Child Study Center, argued that poverty, large families, low education levels and unconcerned parents force adolescents out of the mainstream of values. The way to change these ''structural problems,'' Dr. Comer said, is to help teen-agers feel related to the clinics in their schools. In Kansas City, Mo., the Adolescent Resources Corporation reported that 63 percent of the students using clinics would not have sought treatment elsewhere, and at the West Dallas Youth Clinic, undiagnosed health problems, including 100 heart murmurs, were discovered in 30 percent of the patients. Administrators also say the teen-agers need an accessible, comfortable place to talk, , whether about self-image and depression or sex and pregnancy. When pregnancy occurs, the clinics say part of their success is a high rate of return to school after delivery. A St. Paul clinic says about 80 percent of its mothers remain in school. Focusing on Prevention In a report the St. Paul clinic, Healthstart Inc., said one goal was to provide counseling on family planning and ''primary prevention counseling'' stressing self-esteem, problem-solving and decision-making. Abstinence and postponement of sexual activity are emphasized. St. Paul's program is one of the 32 in the country in which schools prescribe birth control measures, but do not fill the prescriptions. In response to concerns that availability of contraception promotes promiscuity, Dr. Laurie Schwab Zabin, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, cited a program in Baltimore in which the pregnancy and abortion rates were said to have decreased. ''Among those that had not begun sexual activity before the program began, there was a postponement of sex for an average of seven months,'' she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCIENTISTS DEVELOPING A NEW DRUG THAT BLOCKS AND HALTS PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/13/us/scientists-developing-a-new-drug-that-blocks-and-halts-pregnancy.html,"Within a year, a drug should become available in France for use under physicians' supervision that both blocks and terminates pregnancy, according to a World Health Organization official. If a woman wishes to avoid pregnancy after intercourse or if she has missed a menstrual period and believes she may be pregnant,a single pill would initiate menstruation, sweeping the egg cell out of her system. Dr. Jose Barzelatto, the director of W.H.O.'s program on human reproduction, noted that in such a case the woman could not tell whether she was actually pregnant. The new drug is still known only by the designation RU 486, given by its developer, the Roussel-Uclaf Company, a French affiliate of Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, based here in Switzerland. 'Exciting' Advance Seen The development of RU 486 is ''one of the most exciting advances in the family planning field in a number of years,'' said Dr. Wayne Bardin, director of the Center for Biomedical Research of the Population Council in New York. Research by the Population Council, which was founded in 1952 to explore ways to cope with global population growth, is financed by a number of foundations and government agencies in the United States and abroad. The new drug is the fruit of a prolonged search for a ''morning after'' pill that would also have an abortive effect. Pills previously developed for use after intercourse contain female sex hormones, or estrogens, and must be given in such high doses that they induce vomiting and abdominal pain. After RU 486 has initiated menstruation, the woman's monthly cycle returns to normal. A number of contraceptive procedures now in widespread use sometimes lead to cycle irregularities and bleeding. Abortion Opponents Alarmed According to Dr. Bardin, the prospect that RU 486 will allow a woman to abort a pregnancy in the privacy of her home has already alarmed opponents of abortion. He said he and other researchers had been questioned by members of Congress seeking to insure that no research on such drugs was being done with Federal funds. While the drug has been tested in the United States, there are no immediate plans to make it generally available there. Before that happens, it would have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The new drug is one of a number of contraceptive strategies being explored under auspices of W.H.O. to stem the global population explosion. Some appear particularly well adapted to developing countries, where population growth is rapid, health care facilities are limited and frequent contraceptive dosages are impractical. Every year, according to the most recent annual report of the W.H.O. program, about 500,000 pregnant women in developing countries die, and 15 to 20 percent of these deaths are the result of illegal abortion attempts. Reports from 74 such countries indicate that in half of them only one out of five women practice contraception. Tested in Australia and India The new strategies include a vaccine that immunizes the woman against the hormone chorionic gonadotrophin, whereby a fertilized egg signals its presence to the mother, causing her menstruation to cease. If this signal is not received, the egg is swept out. A single vaccine injection appears effective for about 18 months. It is being tested on 30 women in Australia and others in India. A contraceptive strategy developed by the Population Council, increasingly used in Scandinavia as well as in many developing countries, implants silicone tubes the thickness of a toothpick under the skin of the upper arm. The tubes contain the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel, which is gradually released into the bloodstream, preventing pregnancy for five years in a high percentage of cases. If a woman wishes to become pregnant, the tubes can be removed and fertility returns almost immediately. But a visit to a clinic is required both to start and end the procedure. Monthly Cycle Is Disrupted And while, according to Dr. Barzelatto, the procedure is ''extremely effective,'' in most users the monthly cycle is disrupted and some users have reported irregular bleeding. With Copronor, an implant being developed by W.H.O. and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., no return to the clinic would be needed: Its tube is gradually absorbed by the body. Copronor should be ready for marketing in about three years. Another new device is a vaginal ring that slowly releases levonorgestrel. Its diameter resembles that of a contraceptive diaphragm and it is inserted in the same way. When it is ready for the market, it could be sold across the counter and used without the help of a clinician. Its dosage is lower than that needed in pills, since its secretions enter the bloodstream more directly. Thus its side effects, such as interference with the monthly cycle, are less. Similar Molecular Structure The drug RU 486 is the product of efforts by researchers at Roussel-Uclaf to find a way to block the action of progesterone, the hormone needed to maintain pregancy and turn off menstruation. The blocking action has been achieved through synthesis of a steroid, RU 486, part of whose molecular structure is like that of progesterone. This enables it to attach itself to chemical receptors in the uterus that normally receive the progesterone. In this way, progesterone from the ovary finds no vacant receptors and its activity is blocked. Prostaglandins and their chemical analogues are used to induce uterine contractions as an aid to normal deliveries and also to induce abortions, although large doses needed for the latter role produce severe side effects. According to the most recent annual report on the W.H.O. program, a number of clinical trials have used sulprostone, a prostaglandin analogue, in combination with RU 489. The two drugs together seem to be more effective than either of them when given separately. Single Dose Is Sufficient In tests with 37 Swedish women in early pregnancy, all but two aborted after a four-day course of RU 486 plus an injection of sulprostone on the last day of dosage. In hundreds of tests of RU 486 on women in Scandinavia, the United States and elsewhere, a single dose of the drug has been found to be sufficient. When it is made more widely available in France it will at first be given only to physicians. They will be advised to use it in a period beginning three days before the ovary is due to discharge an egg cell and ending a week after that. As stated in the annual report, the tests with RU 486 ''strongly suggest'' that treatment with such a drug, combined with a prostaglandin, ''constitutes a safe, simple and effective medical approach to the termination of early pregnancy.'' ''Furthermore,'' the report said, ''it does not require special skills and is relatively free of side effects.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SCIENCE WATCH; Abortion Trend,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/14/science/science-watch-abortion-trend.html,"Forty million to 60 million induced abortions are performed in the world each year, about 33 million of them legally, according to a new study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. By contrast, about 131 million babies will be born in the world this year, according to estimates by the United Nations. The Guttmacher report said that the worldwide abortion rate, including illegal abortions, is 37 to 55 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age, well above the United States rate of 27 per 1,000. The long-term trend is toward more permissive abortion laws, according to the report by the institute, a private organization in New York that studies population issues. More than half the world's people now live in countries where abortion is available on request, and another fourth live in countries where abortion is permitted to protect a woman's health. The most restrictive policies tend to be in fundamentalist Islamic countries and in countries of sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. But in a number of these countries, medical practitioners provide abortions without being prosecuted, the researchers found. While the abortion rate in the United States is lower than the estimated worldwide average, it is higher than that in other Western industrialized countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOES' DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/nyregion/excerpts-from-lieutenant-governor-foes-debate.html,"Following are excerpts from a debate yesterday at The New York Times between the three candidates in the Nov. 4 election for New York State Lieutenant Governor, Stan Lundine, Democrat-Liberal; Michael Kavanagh, Republican-Conservative, and Thomas A. Droleskey, Right to Life. Their Role in Office Q. Do you have any agreement with your Governor candidate as to your role as Lieutenant Governor. If not, in any event, what do you consider the role of Lieutenant Governor? LUNDINE: Yes, I have an agreement with Governor Cuomo that the Lieutenant Governor will be a full partner in developing all the public policy of the state, and in implementing that part of our administration's initiatives that we determine make sense for the Lieutenant Governor to take responsibility for. Governor Cuomo and I . . . are both convinced that any enterprise that is billions of dollars in scope deserves more than just the chief executive officer; it deserves an executive vice president or a second officer. . . . Q. Does it bother you, Mr. Lundine, that this Governor has a reputation of not delegating authority? LUNDINE: Well, that's certainly a matter that I wanted to talk to him about and wanted a clear understanding about. But our understanding is that I will be involved in all the decision-making. . . . KAVANAGH: Well, I think first of all it's unfortunate that you have to address that question to the lieutenant governor candidates. It seems to me the best person to answer would be the gubernatorial candidate and the Governor's refusal to participate in exchanges such as this, to debate, to tell the people what role he envisions for the Lieutenant Governor, is just another extension of his irreponsible conduct. Andy O'Rourke and I have reached an agreement that because of my expertise in the field of criminal justice, that I will assume a lead role in the O'Rourke administration in implementing substantial reforms to our criminal justice system. The criminal justice system in this state, with particular emphasis upon this city, doesn't work. The criminal community in the city of New York views the criminal justice system primarily as an inconvenience; it has absolutely no deterrent value whatsoever. . . . Q. On Medicaid funding of abortion, would either one of you want to repeal it in the state? LUNDINE: I would not. KAVANAGH: I would. The Tax Windfall Q. Let's talk about the $2 billion tax windfall. What should we do with that money? How should we return it to the taxpayer? And should we not also cut taxes at the same time? LUNDINE: The Governor was the first responsible public official in this state who last spring said that this state should not and will not, under his administration, spend this money but will return it to the taxpayers by cutting rates of taxes. . . . We need to reform state taxes so that they're more fair to working lower-income people and to middle-income people. Second, he proposes that we must take action to make New York more competitive with other states for economic development. . . . Q. Do you think the money ought to be given back proportionately to whoever paid the increase? LUNDINE: I think we have to retain progressivity in taxes in New York. . . . At the same time, we have to make compensation for the capital-gains taxpayers who will be paying more, and I personally feel that rate reduction ought to be a top priority for New York because it has a tremendous effect on decision-makers who affect jobs in New York. KAVANAGH: They're not even willing to make the commitment now. We stand for the proposition that this is a windfall in every sense of the word and that this state government must take responsible steps to insure that every bit of this $2 billion or $2.5 billion, or whatever it turns out to be, is in fact returned to the people who paid it, and that this state government not only has to do that as an act of fundamental fairness to those taxpayers but it also has to do that as an act of credibility on its part to convince the business community that in fact New York is sincere when it talks about tax reform. This Governor makes a great to-do about the fact that he's initiated this massive tax cut. In fact, in his first year in office he resisted Senate initiatives to reduce taxes, and raised taxes by $1 billion. The second year, he went along with this proposal. We think that much more can be done, and what we proposed - in addition to returning this windfall to the people who paid it - we propose that there be substantial reductions in taxes beginning first off with sales-tax reform. . . . Ethics in Government Q. We talk about the New York City scandals. Is there any state role in combating such scandals or making sure it doesn't happen again. KAVANAGH: The state can play a lead role in investigating and rooting out corruption amongst municipal officials. Here we have the situation where the Governor of this state has failed to take a resonable and responsible step to deal with this corruption. We have four district attorneys who are investigating and in charge of prosecuting state violations that have been generated by this scandal. These district attorneys have political relationships with some of the targets of these investigations. . . . That sort of relationship does not lend itself to a full, fair and thorough investigation. . . . We have the situation here that the Governor's son has in effect developed a law practice, which I think everyone would agree, the relationship of Andrew Cuomo with these clients and with his father creates, at the very least, very serious ethical improprieties about this practice and his access. . . . LUNDINE: The Republican campaign started off with mud-slinging and they just continued it right on through. . . . The Governor's proposals on ethics go beyond those that have been proposed by any other responsible party in the state. They've been blocked by the State Senate in the main. . . . Cuomo and Lundine will be at the forefront of getting the kind of legal reform of the political system in New York State to make its ethics of the highest integrity and to make the punishment for any abuses by public officials appropriate to the crime. . . . In my judgment, the district attorneys in these cases have been doing their job effectively. There is not one bit of evidence that someone has been given soft treatment, or not prosecuted. . . . I would say the same of the Republican United States attorneys. . . . This business of bringing in Andrew Cuomo is just another example of trying to equate him with these things. It is as underhanded a political tactic as I can imagine. These people are public officials accused of serious crimes. Andrew Cuomo at best is a accused of practicing law and attracting clients because of who he is. . . . In fact, he has refused, though neither legal ethics nor the law would require him to, to represent clients before state agencies, something, incidentally, that Mr. O'Rourke refuses to disclose whether he did or did not do in Westchester County. . . . KAVANAGH: . . . The fact is that he's indicated that he does not recall. If there were some, it was incidental to his practice and I've accepted that. Summing Up Q. It's time for sum-up. DROLESKEY: . . . Last week in The New York Times - a week ago today in the science section -there was an article about a procedure done by some surgeon who had removed a 23-week-old fetus from the womb, performed urinary tract surgery on it and returned it to the womb and it was born. For those who say they are pro-choice, what makes that one child human and worthy of medical treatment and another child the same age worthy of destruction? This I believe is the critical question of the campaign. Do we want a person as Governor who believes in one thing yet uses his public career to do something else? . . . LUNDINE: We base our candidacy on three things. One is that the Governor has a good record. He cut taxes, balanced the budget; he's invested in our state's future, in education and infrastructure. There's 932,000 more jobs in New York than when Governor Cuomo took office. He's led the way toward economic revitalization. Secondly, that we have the experience relevant to the offices we seek - I at the local and national level, the Governor's lengthy experience at the state level; and that our integrity, I believe, should be beyond question. I guess mine hasn't been questioned. But I know of no person in public life whose integrity I respect any more than, or as much, as Mario Cuomo. Finally, we have laid out an agenda for the future in terms of jobs and new technology, in terms of housing programs, education, environment and the other major public issues facing this state. KAVANAGH: I think it's a tragedy for the democratic process that you folks - and you represent the people of this city and great state -have to rely upon what the lieutenant governor candidates say are the great issues for this campaign. It's a tragedy for the people of this state, for the democratic process, that this Governor has arrogantly refused to defend his record and to reveal his plans for the next four years. If you had heard from the candidates you would have heard that Andy O'Rourke represents a constructive and necessary change, that he is a person who is committed to placing a cap on state spending, on fighting these terrible and traumatic increases in state spending that we've suffered. He is a public official committed to long-term and meaningful tax reform. He believes in a firm, fair and effective system of criminal justice that would begin with the imposition of the death penalty upon people who commit premeditated murder. . . .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LUNDINE AND KAVANAGH CLASH IN DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/nyregion/lundine-and-kavanagh-clash-in-debate.html,"The two major party candidates for lieutenant governor of New York differed yesterday on the need for a special prosecutor to investigate corruption in New York City, the death penalty and the necessity for special anti-crack legislation. Their views came in a debate at The New York Times that was dominated by talk of crime and corruption. It was the first debate between Representative Stan Lundine, the Democratic-Liberal candidate for lieutenant governor, and his Republican-Conservative opponent, Ulster County District Attorney Michael Kavanagh. Thomas A. Droleskey, the Right to Life Party candidate, also participated. The respective gubernatorial candidates have yet to debate because of conditions imposed by Governor Cuomo. Mr. Kavanagh, who was a more aggressive debater than his opponents, concentrated throughout the 90-minute session on the current corruption in New York City, calling it a ''total breakdown'' of the criminal justice system in the city, and what he said were Mr. Cuomo's broken promises from the 1982 campaign for governor. Kavanagh Wants Prosecutor The lower-keyed Mr. Lundine, resting on what polls indicate is a substantial lead for Mr. Cuomo and himself -voters cannot split their ballot, a vote for one gubernatorial candidate is a vote for his running mate - talked about the Cuomo record, defended the Governor and accused the Republican ticket of ''mudslinging.'' In calling for a special state prosecutor, the 42-year-old Mr. Kavanagh said that Democratic district attorneys who have the prime responsibility for investigating corrruption ''have political relationships with some of the targets of these investigations.'' He noted that party leaders under investigation played major roles in nominating the prosecutors. Mr. Lundine responded that he found it ''amusing'' that a district attorney would suggest the superseding of fellow prosecutors. ''In my judgment, the district attorneys in these cases have been doing their jobs and doing them effectively,'' Mr. Lundine said. Some of the most heated moments came when the two candidates discussed Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate for Governor, and Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son, and their legal clients. Mr. Kavanagh began the exchange when he said that there were ''very serious ethical improprieties'' in Andrew Cuomo's law practice, which includes several major real-estate developers as clients. Andrew Cuomo Defended Mr. Lundine charged Mr. Kavanagh with ''underhanded'' political tactics in raising questions about Andrew Cuomo's law practice in the same context as New York City corruption. ''These people are public officials accused of serious crime,'' Mr. Lundinesaid. ''Andrew Cuomo at best is accused of practicing law and attracting clients because of who he is.'' Declaring that Andrew Cuomo has declined to represent clients before state agencies, Mr. Lundine said Mr. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, had refused to list clients whom he represented before Westchester agencies while he was a part-time county legislator. Mr. Kavanagh contended that Mr. O'Rourke was barred by legal canons from disclosing clients without their approval. The two also differed on the death penalty, with Mr. Lundine opposed although he had voted for the death penalty in the case of a military officer convicted of treason. Mr. Droleskey, like Mr. Kavanagh, supported capital punishment. Differences on Crack Addressing the problem of crack, the concentrated, smokable form of cocaine, Mr. Lundine said he agreed with the Governor that there should be greater penalties for crack dealers -including a maximum of life in prison for selling three vials of crack. But Mr. Kavanagh, contending that Mr. Cuomo and other politicians have ''postured'' on the issue, said that current laws are adequate. ''The problem has been that the laws are not being enforced,'' Mr. Kavanagh said. Criticizing plea bargaining in New York City courts to eliminate case backlogs, Mr. Kavanagh said, ''There is an unholy devotion toward the disposing of cases.'' On the abortion issue, Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Droleskey said they would support legislation prohibiting Medicaid funding of abortion in New York, but Mr. Lundine supported the Governor's position in favor of Medicaid financing. The sides shifted on a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, with only Mr. Droleskey in support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; JUSTICES TO HEAR APPEAL ON ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-to-hear-appeal-on-abortions.html,"The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether states may require girls under 18 years old who seek abortions either to wait 24 hours after the doctor has notified their parents of their plans or to obtain a judicial exemption from the notification requirement. The abortion case is an appeal by the State of Illinois from a Federal appeals court decision striking down a provision of a 1983 state law as an undue burden on minors' rights to have abortions. While the issue is relatively narrow, the Court could use the case to clarify its confusing line of decisions on what kinds of restrictions on the access of minors to abortion may be required to give their parents a chance to consult with them. Different state laws impose a wide variety of restrictions, many of which have been struck down by lower courts. New Debate Likely The case also seems likely to provoke another heated debate among the Justices, who split 5 to 4 in June in striking down a Pennsylvania law regulating adult access to abortion. And it will provide the first occasion for Antonin Scalia, the Court's newest member, to vote on an abortion issue as a Justice. He suggested publicly in statements before President Reagan made him an appellate judge in 1982 that the Supreme Court had been wrong to hold that the Constitution guaranteed a right to have an abortion. But Justice Scalia has not disclosed whether he agrees with the views of Justices William H. Rehnquist and Byron R. White that the Court should overrule itself and abandon its protection of abortion rights. The Illinois law required that a minor, dependent child seeking an abortion must wait at least 24 hours after both parents had been notified by the doctor, unless the parents waived the waiting period. The 24-hour wait and the notification requirement could also be bypassed if the minor could persuade a state judge that she was mature enough to make her own decision or that parental notification would not be in her best interests. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the state could require parental notification or judicial approval, but that the 24-hour waiting period was too burdensome because it might cause much longer delays, increased costs and medical risks. The Illinois law differs somewhat both from the restrictions on minors' abortion rights that the Supreme Court has previously upheld and from those that it has struck down. Earlier Court Rulings The Court has ruled that states may not impose 24-hour waiting periods on all women, including adults, who seek abortions, and may not require parental consent for all minors seeking abortions. But it has upheld requirements that doctors notify parents before performing abortions on immature, dependent children under 18, as well as parental consent requirements, so long as the minors may bypass these requirements if they can convince a judge that they are mature or that parental involvement would not be in their best interests. In its appeal in the pending case, Hartigan v. Zbaraz, No. 85-673, the state said the 1983 law was ''designed to protect minors against their own immaturity, to foster and preserve the family structure, and to protect the rights of parents to rear their children.'' It said a 24-hour waiting period was necessary to give parents a chance to consult with their minor daughters. The case is an action challenging the constitutionality of the 1983 state law on behalf of all Illinois physicians who perform abortions and dependent children who want abortions. A Federal district court ruled the entire notification requirement unconstitutional, along with the 24-hour waiting period, before the law had gone into effect. The Seventh Circuit upheld the notification requirement but not the waiting period. It also held that the procedures for judicial waiver of the notification requirement were constitutionally inadequate. The Supreme Court indicated today that it would not review that aspect of the decision directly. In other developments today, the Court took these actions: Sexual Privacy The Justices refused to hear arguments on whether states may make heterosexual sodomy between consenting adults a crime. The case was an appeal by Oklahoma from a state appellate court decision that all private sexual acts between consenting adults of opposite sexes were protected by the constitutional right to privacy. Today's action did not create a national precedent. But it left intact the lower court decision that an Oklahoma law providing up to 10 years in prison for the ''crime against nature,'' including oral or anal sex, was unconstitutional as applied to heterosexual acts. In June, when it issued its much-debated 5-to-4 decision upholding prosecution for homosexual acts under a Georgia law making all anal and oral sex a crime, the Court explicitly declined to say whether the Constitution would protect heterosexuals from prosecution under the same law. Today's action indicated that at least for now, the Court would rather leave that emotionally charged question unresolved than grapple with it, experts said. The Oklahoma decision grew out of a prosecution on rape, ''crime against nature'' and other charges of a man who was said to have forced a woman to commit various sex acts after meeting her in a bar and taking her home. The jury acquitted him of rape but convicted him of ''crime against nature,'' after being told that he could be guilty of that crime even if the woman had consented. The jury recommended a long prison term. In reversing this conviction, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that for purposes of his appeal, it must assume that the woman consented to all the sex acts. It based its decision, which predated the Supreme Court's ruling on homosexual sodomy, on earlier Supreme Court rulings that recognized a constitutional right of privacy. (Oklahoma v. Post, No. 85-2071.) Search Without Warrant The Court agreed to decide whether the police may search apartment house garbage bins without a warrant. The case was a prosecution appeal of a California appellate court's ruling that without a warrant, the police may not comb through garbage bins in apartment buildings for evidence of crime. The appellate court, following earlier rulings by the California Supreme Court, held that such searches violate the privacy rights of people who dump their trash into such garbage bins. It barred prosecutors from using papers recording sports wagers that they had recovered from a garbage bin in the underground parking garage of an apartment building in a gambling proscution of a man who lived there.

"SEX: AT CITY SCHOOL CLINICS, IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/nyregion/sex-at-city-school-clinics-it-s-a-health-issue.html,"A 16-year-old student visited the health clinic at Martin Luther King Jr. High School yesterday morning for a pregnancy test. She waited 15 minutes and had her suspicions confirmed: she was pregnant. The resident nurse practitioner, Fran Combe, called the girl's mother. ''She and her mother had discussed it, and they both decided she would have an abortion,'' Ms. Combe said. ''I recommended a clinic to her where we have been very pleased with the care.'' In the first month of the school year, Ms. Combe has conducted three pregnancy tests at the school. Two were positive. Last year, 10 girls - all except one were under 18 years old - visited the clinic and were found to be pregnant. Five were recommended to the abortion clinic in Manhattan that Ms. Combe mentioned; two others were recommended to another abortion clinic; three girls, aged 16 and 17, gave birth and dropped out of school. The clinic at Martin Luther King, at 122 Amsterdam Avenue near 66th Street, is one of nine state-financed clinics at New York City high schools. The clinics provide general health care such as diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, physical exams and dietary advice, in addition to birth-control counseling. Two of the clinics have been dispensing contraceptives, although one has ceased; the others write prescriptions for contraceptives. At its meeting today, the Board of Education is to have its first full discussion of the role of the health clinics since the birth-control services were revealed in a report to the board two weeks ago. A doctor at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, Dr. Alwyn T. Cohall, works one day a week at the Martin Luther King clinic and one day a week at the Louis D. Brandeis High School clinic at 145 West 84th Street. Dr. Cohall said it was vital that the clinics provide a full range of health services. Many of the students had not seen a doctor since childhood and needed such services as dental examination, tests for sickle-cell anemia and treatment for asthma. Further, he said, if the clinic provided only birth-control counseling, students would be more reluctant to visit for fear that they would be ''stigmatized as sexually active.'' ''Teen-age girls, even in 1986, have a tremendous amount of mythology as far as fertility and birth control is concerned,'' said Dr. Cohall, a 31-year-old pediatrician. ''There are still girls who think you can't get pregnant the first time they have sex, or that you can't get pregnant having sex standing up, or that if you douche with Coca-Cola right after having sex that you will prevent yourself from getting pregnant.'' Similarly, he said, young men often expressed reluctance, for unfounded reasons, to use condoms. ''It's a kind of gambler's philosophy,'' Dr. Cohall said of the prevailing attitude among the students about the risk of pregnancies. It was not uncommon, said Ms. Combe, who has a master's degree in nursing science from Yale University, for girls to visit the clinic either unaware that they were pregnant or denying their condition. ''Two weeks ago,'' she recalled, ''a 16-year-old in the ninth grade came down for a headache and a stomach ache. She complained that 'my tummy hurts.' She did not have a parental consent form. ''Then I noticed she was in the corner, quietly crying. I put her in the exam room. Like all the girls she was wearing a baggy sweat shirt. I pulled up her sweater and obviously she was five months pregnant.'' Abortion Ruled Out Ms. Combe said that a sonogram taken at Eastern Women's Center, the abortion clinic at 14 East 60th Street that she most frequently recommends, showed the girl to be seven months pregnant - one month too late for the abortion she said she wanted. After informing her mother of the pregnancy, the girl decided to have the baby. In all pregnancy cases, Dr. Cohall said, the options are put before the student. ''Our recommendation is they tell their parents, so they can make an informed decision,'' he said. ''We talk about what life would be like with a child, what an abortion would involve, adoption.'' In some situations, parents are not informed of the student's decision to have an abortion, if in the judgment of the nurse practitioner the student would be physically abused by the parents, Ms. Combe said. Many, Dr. Cohall said, first visited the clinic with complaints such as head and intestinal pains. During the taking of routine personal medical histories, questions are asked about sexual activity and birth control is broached. ''We talk about what things don't work and about what things do work,'' Dr. Cohall said. ''We talk about abstinence, the pill, the diaphragm, spermicidal agents, condoms.'' ''Abstinence is often not a realistic choice,'' Dr. Cohall said. ''But if a girl is just testing the waters with a partner, we can work on abstinence. One of the things they want to hear is that it's O.K. to say no.'' Prescriptions are written at the Martin Luther King clinic that can be filled, free of charge, at Roosevelt Hospital, four blocks from the school, he said. So far, the school clinic has not distributed contraceptives, although he would like it to, Dr. Cohall said. Robert F. Wagner Jr., the Board of Education president, has proposed that the distribution of contraceptives at health clinics be restricted to students 18 years or older. ''I don't see why there should be an arbitrary cut-off at 18,'' Dr. Cohall said. ''There are 15-year-olds who are more mature than 18-years-olds and vice versa.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A BRITISH ADAPTATION OF SHELLEY'S 'ZASTROZZI',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/16/arts/a-british-adaptation-of-shelley-s-zastrozzi.html,"RETURNING for a second season tonight at 11, WNET's ''Channel Crossings,'' a collection of international television films, continues to be admirably adventurous and provocative with ''Zastrozzi, a Romance.'' Consisting of four 52-minute episodes - two will be broadcast this evening, the rest next Thursday -the work is described by its producers, Lindsey C. Vickers and David Lascelles, as a ''totally irreverent translation'' of Shelley's ''bad but inspired'' 1810 novel into the modern idiom of a television mini-series. Actually, the result, made for Britain's Channel 4, bears a remarkable resemblance to those Gothically overheated television commercials for a perfume called Obsession. In 1810, Shelley was a mere 18 years old but already an established rebel, quite willing to be sacked from university and socially ostracized for his propounding of atheism. His ''Zastrozzi,'' vaguely Italianate in style and setting, explored the darker corners of the subject of desire. This TV version, written and directed by David G. Hopkins, takes bits and pieces of the original - brief passages from the text periodically appear in close-up on screen - and, while retaining the Italian names of the characters, transforms them into a scathing commentary on contemporary England. As decaying walls crumble around him, a gin-guzzling priest (Max Wall) declares: ''England has been taken away from us by mucky profiteers. We've been sold out. England has been cashed in. Watch it, they'll have your dreams next.'' And this ''Zastrozzi'' is, of course, a dream, a nightmare drenched in fear. At the center is Verezzi (Mark McGann), passionately in love with the mysterious, seemingly unattainable, perhaps dead Julia (Tilda Swinton). He is being pursued by Zastrozzi (Geff Francis), his opposite, his shadow, who explains that ''we exist together, we circle each other.'' Adding another dimension to the story, Mr. Francis is a black actor with a pronounced West Indian accent. For reasons never fully explained, Zastrozzi, driven by ''the fiercest revenge,'' wants Verezzi dead. Meanwhile, the sultry Matilda (Hilary Trott) is determined to make Verezzi forget Julia. The supporting players include an aristocratic cripple and a seedy doctor who could be Verezzi's parents, but aren't; a couple of comic thugs named Ugo and Bernardo; and a pair of silly young businessmen who, after the beautiful Julia dumps them, comfort each other with babble about ''bad management, unions out of control, abortion - human nature!'' In short, this is not your average TV movie. ''Zastrozzi'' disdains social realism as it wanders, sometimes exasperatingly, through a world of murders, kidnappings, demons and even poltergeists. Dreadfully indulgent, the production threatens to self-destruct at least once every 15 minutes, but it keeps coming up with fleeting details that are stunning enough to reward patience. One memorable little bit in the first hour: A cafe singer, accompanied by soprano saxophone, doing a ditty titled ''The Sun Has Got His Hat On and He's Coming Out Today.'' Andrew McAlpine's production designs and Maggie Hayes's costumes are marvelous, and Martin Kiszko's score, conducted by Harry Rabinowitz, is splendidly haunting. This strange and imaginative film was made by Occam Ltd., an independent production company in Bristol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"POLAND'S MIXED BLESSING: ITS MANY, MANY BABIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/16/world/poland-s-mixed-blessing-its-many-many-babies.html,"The empirical evidence is as clear and strident as an infant's howl at midnight. Poles are having more children than Government demographers thought they would, and more children in relation to population than any country in Europe. Schools in cities are often in triple session. Nurseries and day-care centers have long waiting lists, and in every town and city the numbers of toddlers, baby carriages and obviously pregnant women attract attention. In a country that lost one out of every six citizens in World War II, and that reached its prewar population of 35 million only five years ago, such fecundity is often a matter of pride and joy. But for demographers and planners at the hub of a centrally planned economy, the anomalies and imbalances caused by the Polish pattern of population growth are troublesome. ''By the late 70's we started to see a leveling off in the birth rate, and we were all predicting that the same thing was happening that happened in West Germany, East Germany, Belgium, Hungary, where the reproductive rate stabilized or even dropped,'' said Waldyslaw Kondrat, a demographer at the Institute of Work. ''Then came 1981, and all our predictions proved wrong and the birth rate of some 700,000 shot up by some 60,000 more than expectations.'' Family Size Going Up Average family size also appears to be inching up from the 2.3 children per family, and today one out of every five people added yearly to the population of Europe, not including the Soviet Union, is a Pole. The reason for this increase is a matter of debate, with some sociologists arguing that after the collapse of the Solidarity labor union many people retreated from public life into family life. Others say it was simply the extended maternity leave benefits gained during the Solidarity period that encouraged women to space their pregnancies at shorter intervals, effectively taking 6-to-10-year leaves from work to give birth and raise two or three children. Mr. Kondrat said it was not the growth of the population itself that was troublesome as much as the dislocations and imbalances caused by the unanticipated demographic trends. For example, he said that with the prolonged baby boom, the ratio of productive to nonproductive citizens was growing. He added that needs for schools, clinics, nurseries, textbooks, notepads and crayons were confounding planners who already had to deal with a longstanding housing crisis. Food Becoming an Issue Another study by the Polish Academy of Sciences found that a growth in population of 5 to 10 million, a level that some demographers say they think could be achieved by the end of the century, would necessitate a 40 percent growth in agricultural production. But farm productivity has risen only slightly in the last decade, and meat is still rationed. Meanwhile, young people from the farms are continuing to pour into cities, with women leaving the rural areas at a faster rate than men. This, according to Janina Wasilewska, a Polish demographer who works at the Academy of Science, has created farm pockets where young and middle-aged men outnumber women of the same age by 40 to 50 percent. Adding to the complexity of Poland's demographic picture are the sensitive and ambivalent attitudes toward birth control and abortion in what is both an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic society and a Communist nation. Abortion has been legal in Poland since 1956, and sociologists estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 abortions occur each year. One study showed that in Poland there were 230 abortions performed in Government clinics for each 1,000 live births, a figure that is slightly more than the rate in Sweden and the United States, though far less than that of any other Warsaw Pact country, where abortion has been the major means of birth control. In East Germany, for instance, the figure was 556 abortions per 1,000 live births; in Hungary it was 1,161 abortions per 1,000 births, and in the Soviet Union, according to international population experts, there are 2.3 times as many abortions as live births. Church Staying Silent Despite the devout and widespread devotion to Catholicism in Poland, abortion is far less a public issue here than in the United States. Occasionally, there may be a display condemning abortion in a church or a passing reference to the issue in a sermon. But as D. Peter Mazur, an American demographer, wrote in an international bulletin on family planning, ''The Catholic Church apparently does not speak out against the abortion law, in part because it believes its followers are fully aware of its position in this regard and in part for political considerations.'' Mr. Mazur, a professor at Western Washington University in Bellingham, wrote his article in International Family Perspectives after spending several months in Warsaw reviewing a 1972 Polish survey of 16,000 married women between the ages of 20 and 49. Polish demographers, who recommended Mr. Mazur's article as the best available analysis, said the data on which it was based were nearly 15 years old, but added that except for some relatively minor shifts the figures accurately reflected current practices. The survey showed that the most common form of birth control was withdrawal, which was relied on by 21.3 percent of the women interviewed. The second most favored method was rhythm, cited by 21.3 percent of those surveyed. Use of condoms was cited by 10 percent, birth-control pills by 1.8 percent and interuterine devices by three-tenths of 1 percent. Attitude Toward Abortion In the survey, the same women were asked about their attitude toward the law that legalizes and subsidizes abortions for women in the first three months of pregnancy. Only 15 percent favored the measure as it now stands, and a third wanted all abortions made illegal; 51 percent favored severly restricting abortions. Mr. Kondrat said that there were family-planning groups of volunteers working in the country but that they were ineffective in spreading birth-control information. He said access to pills and devices was limited. A Western diplomat, a woman who served two tours here, said that from her point of view she found the lack of birth-control information available to Polish women ''a form of real oppression.''

''I think the students are ready for such courses,'' she said, ''but not the teachers.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOARD BARS CONTRACEPTIVES AT CLINICS IN CITY SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/16/nyregion/board-bars-contraceptives-at-clinics-in-city-schools.html,"The Board of Education voted yesterday to prohibit the distribution of contraceptives at health clinics in high schools, but to allow the clinics, at nine schools, to continue to operate for six months. During that time, prescriptions for birth-control devices - but not contraceptives themselves - would be dispensed to students who request them. The board president, Robert F. Wagner Jr., had sought to have the board approve a plan to distribute contraceptives at all clinics. But he did not offer his proposal for a vote because he had the support of only two other members on the seven-member board, Edward L. Sadowsky and Richard I. Beattie. Mr. Wagner said he hoped that at the end of the six months he would be able to persuade the board that the distribution of contraceptives was necessary to reduce unwanted pregnancies among teen-age students. The decision, in a 5-to-2 vote, directly affects one high school, West Side in Manhattan, where contraceptives have been distributed at the health clinic for about two years. At another school, Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, the distribution of contraceptives was stopped several weeks ago. Objections on Prescriptions Both Mr. Wagner and Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones said they hoped that after the six months, clinics would be opened at more schools. ''My hope is we would have contraceptive distribution in all of the schools,'' Mr. Wagner said after the vote. ''I believe after a careful review my colleagues can be persuaded that it tends to make youngsters less promiscuous and not more promiscuous.'' The two female board members, Drs. Gwendolyn C. Baker and Irene Impellizzeri, said they could not condone the clinics' prescribing birth-control devices. ''We cannot support the location of clinics in any school that provides abortion counseling and the distribution of contraceptives that may encourage sexual activity and promiscuity among teen-agers,'' Dr. Impellizzeri said. Dr. Baker said sex-education courses should be improved and questioned the role of school clinics as ''distributors of contraceptives.'' Adoption of Curriculum In barring the distribution of contraceptives, the board rejected the opinions of the City Health Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, and the director of two of the school clinics, Dr. Alwyn Cohall. Earlier in the meeting the board had unanimously agreed that material from a sex-education curriculum, written by the division of curriculum and instruction, would be compulsory in all schools, from kindergarten to 12th grade, by next fall. Mr. Quinones said the curriculum, which in the high school years deals with birth-control methods, childbirth and abortion, would be used as a ''base'' for parental advisory groups at each school. The groups, in consultation with local officials, would submit plans for approval by the Chancellor by next March on teaching about sex. In the last two years, 21 of the 32 community districts that run the elementary and junior high schools have introduced sex education. At high schools, the subject is taught depending on the school's choice, board officials said. Referrals at 7 Schools The sole school where contraceptives had been distributed until yesterday is West Side High School, an alternative institution for dropouts and foreign students, many of whom are 18 and older. At Boys and Girls High School, the new principal discontinued the distribution of contraceptives several weeks ago. At clinics at the other seven schools, prescriptions are written for birth-control devices, and the students have been referred to the affiliated hospitals or community health centers that run the school clinics. The clinics provide an array of general health-care services. They were approved by the board in 1984. At the time, board members were not informed that dispensing birth-control devices and prescriptions would be among the services. At the Board of Education meeting, according to its procedures, no public comment was permitted; five hecklers opposing the role of the schools in sex education were removed by guards. After all the board members had given their views, it was clear Mr. Wagner did not have the votes to approve the distribution of contraceptives. Instead, he offered a resolution allowing the six-month review, birth-control prescriptions and referrals for filling them. 'Gray Area' of Legality Several members asked a panel of lawyers whether it was constitutional to require the students to have parental consent to use the clinics, a requirement that has been the practice and will continue to be the practice, according to Mr. Wagner. The counsel to the board, Mary Tucker, said the question was a ''gray area.'' She pointed out that under state law, teen-agers could use public-health clinics without parental consent. And she cited similar Federal case law. Mr. Sadowsky, a lawyer and former City Councilman from Queens, said that ''because of the special place school plays in society,'' he favored requiring parental consents. But, he stressed, ''Once that child is given consent and walks into the clinic, I don't care whether that clinic is in a Board of Education site or at a hospital; the doctor-patient relationship pertains and should be the rule of conduct.'' Question of Affordability Mr. Beattie, a lawyer from Manhattan, said parental consent should not be necessary. ''When a teen-ager comes into a health clinic,'' he said, ''because it is in a high school doesn't mean it should be any different from any other.'' During a long question-and-answer session between Dr. Cohall and board members, the doctor said that ''merely writing a prescription is not good enough, because many teen-agers can't afford the $10 and $15 a month for the pill.'' ''Having it on site would get around that,'' he said. The Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, issued a statement opposing the views of Dr. Baker, who is his appointee to the board. ''It seems clear that when distribution of contraceptives is an integral part of a comprehensive education and health program,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''it becomes an effective way to promote more responsible adolescent sexual behavior.'' PLANNED PARENTHOOD CAMPAIGN NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 15 (AP) - The Planned Parenthood Federation unveiled a national campaign today to prevent teen-age pregnancies by persuading sexually active teens-agers to use birth control, and by discouraging teen-agers from having sex. Planned Parenthood's president, Faye Wattleton, speaking at the group's convention here, said the $1.5 million campaign would to try to build teen-agers' self-esteem and show them how to be responsible. ''We have to be realistic about our sexuality,'' Ms. Wattleton said. ''It's O.K. for a child to be interested in their sexual development.'' Ms. Wattleton said the campaign is designed to debunk myths about sex, get lawmakers to push for more sex education, and make the public aware of the growing number of teen-age pregnancies in the United States. The campaign also will focus on teen-age boys. ''Often the men have been left out of the debate of teen pregnancy,'' she said. The organization is preparing television and radio advertisements, which Ms. Wattleton said they hoped would appear in November.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 CATHOLIC LEADERS DIFFER ON DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/18/us/2-catholic-leaders-differ-on-dissent.html,"Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles and the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a theologian who has been censured by the Vatican for his views about sexual issues, differed sharply but gently in an unusual public discussion of dissent in the Roman Catholic Church. The event Thursday night, which drew a capacity audience of 1,500 to the University of Southern California here, was one of the few times an American archbishop had publicly discussed dissent since the Vatican dismissed Father Curran from his post at the Catholic University of America two months ago. While neither man engaged in a formal debate, the two exchanged views on a variety of issues: the extent and degree to which a theologian may dissent, the role of the church as the authority on church doctrine and teachings, and the role of Catholic scholars in bringing about change. Archbishop Mahony, while not entirely ruling out dissent by scholarly theologians, argued that the ''current tensions'' occurred when theologians began to ''usurp'' the teaching role traditionally held by the hierarchy. 'Room for Dissent and Debate' Father Curran, who agreed with the Archbishop that Roman Catholics must adhere to certain basic principles taught by the hierarchy, said that in teachings that were outside the core of the central tenets of Catholicism, there was room for dissent and debate. He said, ''There will always be some tension in the church precisely because no one in the church - Pope or theologian - has a monopoly on the Holy Spirit.'' Father Curran has maintained in his writings and in his lectures that church teachings on divorce, abortion, the use of contraceptives and homosexual acts, all officially banned or condemned by the church, may in limited circumstances be justified. Father Curran said he was challenging his dismissal from a tenured post at the Catholic University in Washington, D.C., where he has taught for 20 years. Turning to the Courts At a news conference following their discussion, Father Curran also said he had engaged the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore of New York City to represent him. He said that if he lost his case in the academic arena, as he suspected he would, he would then turn to the courts. Archbishop Mahony, who presides over the nation's largest diocese and is considered a theological conservative, told the audience, ''It is misleading and wrong to describe the situation of dissent, even legitimate dissent, from authentic church teaching as if it were only a matter of diversity or plurality of opinions in the church.'' Church teachings from the hierarchy and the Pope, the Archbishop went on to say, ''is not simply one theological opinion alongside others; it is rather, church doctrine.'' Without referring to Father Curran, Archbishop Mahony said at one point that ''when certain Catholic theologians confidently assert that Popes and bishops are teaching error, they appear to put their own judgment above that of the hierarchical magisterium -the teaching authority of the church hierarchy - and in so doing inevitably discredit the latter.'' Family and Sexual Issues However, Father Curran argued that in the area of ''noninfallible'' hierarchical teaching, those teachings that fall outside the core teachings considered essential to the Christian faith, there was room for discussion and debate. Those areas, he said, include family and sexual issues. He said that official Catholic history abounded with instances of ''erroneous'' teachings that the church was later forced to revoke, often at the prodding of dissenting theologians. He cited several instances, including a 19th-century view that slavery was acceptable. He outlined how the church had changed its views on the meaning of marital sexuality over time. Father Curran also suggested that the magisterium ''by definition will tend to lag behind the theological enterprise.'' He noted that several influential 20th-century theologians ''had all experienced disciplinary action by church authorities.'' ''Thus,'' he went on, ''history indicates that hierarchical teaching in the past has been erroneous.'' Father Curran said the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith dismissed him on the basis of his writings. ''Your writings have accused you,'' he said he was told of the 16 books and numerous articles that he has written over the years. He observed with just a hint of a wry smile that there might even be dissent about scholarly writings among bishops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OPPENHEIMER, STEPHENS PRESS ELECTION BIDS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/nyregion/oppenheimer-stephens-press-election-bids.html,"THE race for State Senate in the 36th District centers on the question of whether the incumbent, Suzi Oppenheimer, a Democrat, ''gets the job done,'' as she says, or whether, as her Republican opponent, Willis H. Stephens Jr., asserts, the salary paid her is a ''waste of taxpayers' money.'' Mrs. Oppenheimer, 51 years old and a former four-term Mayor of the village of Mamaroneck, is completing her first term in the State Senate in the central Westchester district. As Mr. Stephens, 30 years old and a resident of Port Chester, sees it, Mrs. Oppenheimer has been ineffective for two main reasons: she is a Democrat in a State Senate that is controlled by the Republicans, and she ''doesn't have the respect of the Republican leadership.'' ''She's basically just occupying a seat,'' Mr. Stephens said recently. ''The record is very clear that a lion's share of the legislation introduced under her name has not been passed.'' Noting that he is an assistant counsel to Warren M. Anderson, the majority leader of the State Senate, Mr. Stephens said, ''I'm probably responsible for passing more legislation than she is.'' If elected, he said, it is very likely that he would be given a committee chairmanship even in his first term. Mrs. Oppenheimer, a former Wall Street securities analyst, offered a very different view of her first term in office. ''I have accomplished a great deal, but my name isn't on it,'' she said, explaining that typically legislators of the minority party find that their proposals are passed only after a member of the majority party is made the lead sponsor. For example, she said, early this year she introduced bills to deal with the state's municipal insurance crisis. Several of her bills, such as one calling for creation of a statewide insurance fund for all municipalities and nonprofit agencies, were incorporated into an omnibus bill passed by the Legislature, she said. On the home front, she said she had won approval of a $2 million allocation to install noise barriers on the New England Thruway. Also, she said, ''My district office is one of the best in the state. We've helped thousands of people.'' Mrs. Oppenheimer, who is also running on the Liberal line, and Mr. Stephens, who also has the Conservative line, are vying in a district made up of parts of Mount Vernon and White Plains, all of the cities of New Rochelle and Rye and the towns of Eastchester, Harrison, Mamoroneck and Rye. The candidate of the Right-to-Life Party is Humphrey Sarlo. The Democrats have about a 6,000-vote edge in the district, but the election could be decided by the independent voters, who represent about 39,000 of the district's 160,000 registered voters. Mr. Stephens has never run for public office, but he said he was hoping to continue a family tradition. His father, Willis H. Stephens Sr., represented Putnam County in the State Assembly from 1953 until 1982, as did his grandfatherfather, D. Mallory Stephens, from 1925 until 1952. ''I'm trying to fulfill every son's dream: to follow in my father's footsteps,'' the younger Mr. Stephens said. Both candidates have been waging their campaigns primarily on the streets of the district. Mrs. Oppenheimer, who won narrowly two years ago, said she expected to spend about $100,000 for mailings and advertisings. Mr. Stephens said that he had so far raised about $30,000, used primarily on mailings, and was hoping to raise additional funds. Mr. Stephens's mailings, which attack Mrs. Oppenheimer's record, have been called ''pure rubbish'' by the incumbent. She takes issue, for example, with one brochure that shows a traffic jam and suggests Mrs. Oppenheimer is responsible for it because she voted against a bill directing the State Department of Transportation to consider doing its construction work after 8 P.M. Mrs. Oppenheimer insisted that she had voted for this bill, which passed the Senate but was not approved by the Assembly. Mr. Stephens said that Senate records show she voted against it. When contacted last week, a spokesman in the Journal Clerk's office of the State Senate reported that Mrs. Oppenheimer voted for the bill when it came to a vote March 4 last year. On other issues the two also have differences. For example, Mrs. Oppenheimer voted against the death penalty; Mr. Stephens said he would vote for it. But while he is against abortion, Mr. Stephens said he would probably vote for continued Medicaid financing of abortions on the premise that poor women should not be deprived of abortions so long as other women may legally obtain them. Mrs. Oppenheimer is a supporter of Medicaid financing of abortion. According to Mr. Stephens, Mrs. Oppenheimer has been too liberal on issues involving crime, drugs and public safety. For example, he said, Mrs. Oppenheimer voted against bills to increase the penalties for fraudulent check writing and to allow law-enforcement agencies to check pharmaceutical records. ''Her liberal positions show in many of her votes,'' he said. Mrs. Oppenheimer described her political philosophy this way: ''I maintain a very independent record. I tend to be more conservative and am voting pretty Republican on all the insurance and Government fiscal issues and on many crime issues. However, I vote Democrat on the human issues.'' Mr. Stephens said of his own political philosophy: ''I am not a staunch conservative. I'm a fiscal conservative more than an ideological one.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WEARY LAWMAKERS PUT FINAL TOUCHES ON HECTIC SESSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/us/weary-lawmakers-put-final-touches-on-hectic-session.html,"An exhausted 99th Congress completed its business and adjourned tonight, and the lawmakers eagerly headed home for a final stretch of campaigning before the November elections. In reviewing the last two years, Congressional leaders maintained that they had written a solid record of legislative achievement highlighted by major revisions of the nation's tax regulations, immigration laws and budget procedures. However, the leaders conceded, it was also a Congressional session that had missed most of its deadlines, lapsed frequently into partisan fighting, and sometimes approached paralysis before ending at 9:34 P.M. As a result, the lawmakers failed to make a significant impact on reducing the huge Federal budget deficit, which will be the principal issue facing the 100th Congress when it convenes in January. Tough and 'Productive' Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, offered this epitaph for the 99th Congress: ''It's been tough, but it's been productive.'' The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, said today, ''We leave behind a record of unusual accomplishment.'' However, he added, the narrow six-vote margin held by Senate Republicans, plus the intense political maneuvering for control of the next Senate, had limited his flexibility. ''It hasn't been easy,'' the Republican leader from Kansas admitted. As they ended their work, many lawmakers expressed frustration at the way Congress had spent so much of the last two years thwarted by a combination of inefficient procedures and independent lawmakers determined to use those procedures for maximum leverage on the legislative process. Capitol Hill is a place these days where every faction seems to think time is on its side, and as Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat, noted, the 99th Congress ''scored most of its points in overtime,'' the final two weeks after the original adjournment target of Oct. 3. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, expressed a widely held view when he said: ''The flow of legislation must be substantially improved if we are to avoid these end-of-session nightmares we create for ourselves. The manner in which we conclude our sessions is a national embarrassment.'' A New Mentality Legislators of both parties agreed that the biggest item of unfinished business is the budget deficit, which could reach $150 billion to $170 billion in the current fiscal year. Last year, Congress adopted a law committing itself to reducing that deficit to $108 billion next year, and to zero by 1991, and that law has clearly altered the spending mentality on Capitol Hill. In recent debates over drug legislation and aid to the Philippines, for instance, lawmakers frequently asked the questions ''What will it cost?'' and ''How will we pay for it?'' Spending for the military, as well as for social welfare programs, was practically frozen by this Congress, and Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who was the chief author of the budget-balancing law, told the Senate Friday night, ''We turned the corner, we changed direction.'' But there is also a broad belief among members of Congress that they have not begun to deal with the fundamental problems underlying the deficit. ''Next year is going to be the test,'' said Representative Dick Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican in the House leadership. ''This year, we just played around with it. The real crunch is getting to $108 billion.'' To many analysts, Congress's failure to make substantial inroads on the deficit reflects some basic facts of political life. The two chambers remained in separate hands for the third straight Congress, the first time in 100 years that power has been so fragmented on Capitol Hill. Moreover, analysts agree, the fact that President Reagan has no plans to run for office again places him on a different political wavelength from legislators in both parties who have to face the voters. ''There's a much different climate when all elements of the Government are in the hands of one party,'' said Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Democratic whip. ''This is a most unusual situation.'' Many Democrats, and some Republicans, say that the biggest obstacle blocking a serious assault on the budget deficit is Mr. Reagan's adamant refusal to consider a tax increase. The White House says that Congress is not prepared to trim popular domestic programs, particularly benefit programs that increase automatically every year. The resulting deadlock has left many lawmakers sputtering with dismay. Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee, told his colleagues Friday night: ''I think the real question is, how do we get the deficit to zero in four or five years? These are the stark facts staring us square in the face.'' Checks and Balances The dispersal of power in the capital, many lawmakers noted, means that each camp has a greater ability to block legislation than to enact it into law. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader, said the 99th Congress ''will be remembered as a Congress that made the system of 'checks and balances' work.'' For instance, he said, Congressional Democrats were able to alter ''the President's ill-conceived policies'' by such measures as economic sanctions against South Africa. But the same tactics praised by Mr. Byrd were denounced by Mr. Michel, the Republican leader, who said: ''Neutralizing the power and popularity of President Reagan has seemed almost like an obsession among the House Democratic leadership. It has not been a healthy atmosphere.'' In this atmosphere, many proposals did not make it through the legislative maze. The House passed legislation to require the Administration to take a tougher stance against its trading partners, but the measure died in the Senate. A bill rolling back textile imports from a dozen countries passed both houses, but Congress then failed to override the President's veto. The House also approved legislation that would require the President to abide by the strategic arms limitation treaty, and to stop most nuclear testing for a year. Both provisions were dropped under pressure from the President on the eve of his meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in Iceland. Liberal Democrats failed to reverse a Supreme Court decision that severely limits the application of antidiscrimination laws to colleges and other recipients of Federal funds. But conservative Republicans were equally thwarted in their attempts to legalize officially sanctioned prayer in the public schools and to limit a woman's right to have an abortion. Revamping of Tax System The most successful legislation had enough political appeal to attract bipartisan backing from both parties. The huge tax-overhaul bill, which stands out to most members as the highlight of the session, was able to survive because neither party wanted to be held responsible for killing it. The President's signature has been delayed, to await action on corrections to the original bill, but Mr. Reagan is expected to sign it shortly. Similarly, the national concern about drug abuse that inundated Congress last summer helped produce a bill in record time that allots $1.7 billion for enforcement and education efforts. The immigration bill, which seemed dead several times, would permit the legalization of millions of aliens while barring employers from hiring workers who are in this country illegally. This measure, too, had bipartisan backing, and finally passed when Hispanic lawmakers softened their opposition. In some cases, Congressional sentiment was so strong that it was able to overcome resistance in the White House. For example, Mr. Reagan fought bitterly against imposing what he called ''punitive sanctions'' against South Africa, but Republicans and Democrats alike said he was out of step with the mood of the voters, and Congress. Lawmakers overrode Mr. Reagan's veto, inflicting his most embarrassing defeat on a foreign policy issue. Mr. Reagan also proposed a vast increase in Pentagon spending but Congress approved about $290 billion, barely more than it allotted last year. Here again, Congressional leaders said Mr. Reagan was not in tune with the budget priorities of most Americans, who had been subjected to a steady barrage of reports about waste and inefficiency in the Pentagon. In Senator Byrd's view, the decision to hold down military spending injected ''a healthy dose of reality'' into the budget blueprint. On a number of environmental issues, Congress took the lead in passing bills that the Reagan Administration did not favor. In particular, it pushed through a $9.3 billion, five-year program to clean up serious toxic waste dumps. Mr. Reagan threatened to veto the bill because he did not like the new taxes that would be imposed to finance the cleanup. But a fervent plea by Mr. Dole and other Republicans, who thought a veto would be politically disastrous, helped persuade Mr. Reagan to sign the measure. The nature of compromise in a divided Congress was highlighted by approval of hundreds of new water projects, such as harbor dredging and flood control. The bill was strongly backed by many lawmakers whose regions would receive Federal funds, but the White House insisted that any measure include a requirement that local communities pay part of the cost. Apart from revision of the tax code, Mr. Reagan's top domestic priority, the White House advanced a meager legislative program. But the President did succeed, after years of frustration, in pressuring Congress to allocate $100 million to the rebels battling the Marxist Government of Nicaragua. #2 Views of Aid Package Representative Cheney hailed the vote as a ''big victory.'' But Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who is retiring as House Speaker after 10 years, said his failure to block the package was the biggest disappointment of the year. For all the problems experienced by the 99th Congress, for all the divided powers and cross pressures, the lawmakers usually found a consensus that reflected the views of their constituents. In a statement today, Mr. Dole admitted that ''not every policy dilemma was resolved, and some of our answers are less than complete.'' THE 99TH CONGRESS: ITS 1986 RECORD Following are the major actions of the 99th Congress, second session: THE COURTS: President Reagan's nominations for the Supreme Court passed Senate muster. William H. Rehnquist was confirmed on a 65-to-33 vote, after a somewhat bitter committee debate, to replace Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice. Antonin Scalia was confirmed unanimously to be Associate Justice. Vice President Bush cast the tie-breaking vote for Daniel A. Manion's nomination to the Federal appellate bench. And, for the first time in 50 years, the Senate removed a Federal judge, convicting Harry E. Claiborne, imprisoned for tax evasion, on three impeachment counts voted by the House. INCOME TAX: After long behind-the-scenes negotiations over the most comprehensive changes in the Federal income tax system since World War II, Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, consolidating 15 tax brackets into two and eliminating many tax breaks. Sixty percent of Americans are expected to pay lower taxes, 25 percent the same and 15 percent more. SOUTH AFRICA: In a major rebuff to the President's foreign policy, Congress overrode his veto of economic sanctions against South Africa. Among other things, the legislation bans all new investment by Americans in South African businesses and prohibits key imports from South Africa. THE ENVIRONMENT: Congress expanded the national program to clean up toxic waste sites. The $9 billion, five-year program, with five times more money than previously authorized, will be financed largely by new taxes, including one on corporate earnings. Congress also approved, although a veto is possible, legislation to strengthen the Clean Water Act and provide money for building sewage treatment plants. WATER PROJECTS: The first major legislation to finance water projects in 15 years was approved, and beneficiaries are to help pay for them. The $16.3 billion program includes many projects for the New York metropolitan area, such as dredging New York Harbor. GUN CONTROL: Federal laws on gun control were softened in legislation making it easier to buy, sell and transport firearms across state lines. IMMIGRATION: To curtail the influx of illegal aliens, Congress approved the most sweeping changes in immigration law in at least two decades. The legislation would prohibit the hiring of illegal aliens and would offer legal status to those who have lived here continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982. DRUGS: Responding to the emotional issue of illegal drug use, Congress substantially increased penalties for Federal drug crimes and provided $1.7 billion for enforcement, education and treatment programs. THE MILITARY: The most sweeping reorganization of the military command structure in a generation was approved. The reorganization strengthens the role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making him the President's principal military adviser, and gives new authority to field commanders. Congress approved $3.5 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative; the President had asked $5.34 billion for the antimissile plan. The Pentagon budget was set at $290 billion, for the smallest increase of the Reagan Administration. THE DEFICIT: Congress met the deficit ceiling set by the budget-balancing law with a package of accounting maneuvers and sales of Federal assets, including Conrail. CONVENTION AGAINST GENOCIDE: Thirty-seven years after it was first submitted by President Truman, Congress approved a United Nations convention declaring genocide an international crime and obliging the nations that adhere to the convention to punish those who commit genocide. EMBASSY SECURITY: Security at oversees embassies was bolstered with legislation authorizing $2.4 billion over the next five years. CONTRA AID: Congress authorized $100 million in aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, supporting one key aspect of the President's foreign policy. Congress allowed for $70 million in military aid and $30 million in humanitarian aid to be released in three installments if the President determined that negotiations could not solving that country's civil war. A five-member commission would have to certify his assessment for the aid to be released. NATIONAL FLOWER: Congress declared the rose to be the national floral emblem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
German Doctors and the Nazi Mentality,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/magazine/l-german-doctors-and-the-nazi-mentality-429886.html,"Professor Lifton's article, without directly raising the issue, provides a powerful brief for today's Right to Life movement. It clarifies the statement made by a German official explaining why the Federal Republic has no abortion-on-demand law: ''We have been down that road before.'' ''That road'' went from enforced sterilization, to abortion, to infanticide of the unfit, to generalized killing of the unfit, to genocide. We bypassed the first step because feminists have enough political power to protect women. But abortion on demand is now a solidly established and court-protected right, and infanticide of the ''unfit'' is rapidly attaining the same status in American society. Influential voices are already calling for further steps along ''that road.'' WILLIAM L.

IDEAS & TRENDS; A Doubly Effective Birth-Control Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/weekinreview/ideas-trends-a-doubly-effective-birth-control-pill.html,"The search for a ''morning-after'' birth-control pill has yielded a variation - it might be called a ''few-weeks-after'' pill - that should be marketed in France within a year, the World Health Organization says. The drug, a steroid known as RU 486, works as both a contraceptive and an abortifacient. RU 486 prevents the uterine lining from absorbing progesterone, a hormone necessary to sustain pregnancy. It also induces menstruation, which would carry any fertilized egg out of the uterus. Its developers envision RU 486 as an occasional or back-up method of birth control, to be used when pregnancy is suspected but before it can be confirmed. The World Health Organization said in a recent report that the drug was ''relatively free of side effects.'' Earlier ''morning-after'' pills have contained unacceptably high levels of hormones. Dr. Wayne Bardin, director of the Center for Biomedical Research of the Population Council in New York, described RU 486 as ''one of the most exciting advances in the family planning field in a number of years.'' The drug was developed by Roussel-Uclaf, a French company. Although RU 486 has been tested in the United States, there are no immediate plans to seek approval for its distribution here. In addition, Dr. Bardin said, because RU 486 and similar drugs induce abortion, some members of Congress have sought assurance that no Federal funds were being used in their development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABZUG VS. DIOGUARDI: A BATTLE FOR THE CENTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/nyregion/abzug-vs-dioguardi-a-battle-for-the-center.html,"With two weeks to go before Election Day, Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi, a freshman Republican from Westchester, and his challenger, former Representative Bella S. Abzug, are locked in a spirited battle for the political middle ground. The DioGuardi campaign, which until now has been forced to issue news releases with the candidate still in Washington, has sought to portray his opponent as an ''out-of-touch'' liberal seeking to disguise her past. Ms. Abzug's general theme has been that Mr. DioGuardi is ''too conservative for the district,'' which was represented for 16 years by Richard L. Ottinger, a liberal Democrat. While both candidates struggle for the center - and for the substantial uncommitted vote in the 20th Congressional District, where there are 94,000 registered Democrats, 90,000 Republicans and 65,500 unaffiliated voters -the harshest exchanges so far have had little to do with the broad issues. For example, Mr. DioGuardi said at a fund-raising event in White Plains a few weeks ago that Ms. Abzug tried to legalize marijuana in 1974, when she served in the House of Representatives. That ''might have been in step with Greenwich Village,'' he said, in a reminder of Ms. Abzug's Manhattan background, ''but we in Westchester find it reprehensible.'' He was referring to a proposed amendment to the Controlled Substances Act, which would have decriminalized possession of three ounces of marijuana. ''It never went anywhere,'' Ms. Abzug said, explaining that ''lots of kids were being picked up and sent to jail for smoking a joint, and we were saying the police should be going after the drug trade.'' She said Mr. DioGuardi, meanwhile, supported President Reagan in cutting funds for drug-control programs. He denied that, saying he voted for the Omnibus Drug Act, which includes $114 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration, and asserted that she sought to oppose creation of the D.E.A. Ms. Abzug's reply was that she voted for appropriations for the agency. Ms. Abzug, for her part, rebuked Mr. DioGuardi for his membership in the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, saying, ''I'm told it does not accept blacks or Jews and I think that's shocking.'' The club would not comment on its selection process, but Mr. DioGuardi said that as a 15-year member he had never ''witnessed'' such discrimination. He said he would consider resigning if such bias existed. Mr. DioGuardi said that in 1971, Ms. Abzug voted against a welfare reform bill that would have increased Social Security benefits, ''demonstrating that she says one thing but, in the past, did another.'' Ms. Abzug was recorded as saying at the time, however, that ''under the guise of being a reform measure'' the bill ''will leave many recipients of public assistance perhaps 90 percent worse off than they are under the present system.'' In recent days Ms. Abzug has accused Mr. DioGuardi of ''repeatedly voting against legislation that would benefit children'' by supporting the Higher Education Act, which kept aid at 1985 levels, while opposing an amendment to the school lunch program legislation that would have maintained cost-of-living increases. Mr. DioGuardi's staff discounted the criticism, saying that the Congressman was voting for spending freezes in both cases. Kieran Mahoney, Mr. DioGuardi's campaign manager, said the Congressman had sponsored legislation making it easier to prosecute child sexual abusers, and that Mr. DioGuardi was a prime mover in a youth suicide prevention program. The candidates take opposite views on many issues. Mr. DioGuardi favors the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings fiscal reform act, the ''Star Wars'' proposal and military aid to the contra forces in Nicaragua, while Ms. Abzug opposes them. Ms. Abzug supports Federal financing of abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment, while Mr. DioGuardi opposes both. He supports the use of New York harbor as a port for the Navy's nuclear warships, which Ms. Abzug opposes. Ms. Abzug would like to see the Indian Point nuclear power plant closed; he favors its continued use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A FORMER CONVENT TO HOUSE PREGNANT TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/nyregion/a-former-convent-to-house-pregnant-teen-agers.html,"MELISSA DOLPH is 18 years old, nine months pregnant and homeless. Her mother is dead, she does not know where her father is, and the father of her unborn baby is in jail. Her foster parents, she said, do not want her anymore. For now, she is staying at St. Agnes Home Inc., in West Hartford, which up to last year was the only shelter for pregnant teen-agers in the state. ''This teaches me responsibility'' and to be able to interact with different people, she said. If Ms. Dolph had lived in another part of the state, she may not have been so lucky. She may have ended up on the street or in a run-down boarding house, as others in her situation sometimes do. Until last year when a shelter in Bridgeport opened, St. Agnes, a 15-bed facility, was the only one in the state. In response to the growing need for shelters for pregnant teen-agers, a new one is to open next year in New Haven. The shelter, Life Haven, will attempt to do more than simply provide housing for homeless, pregnant young women and their newborn babies. Coordinators of the project say they will try to give hope and guidance to carry these teen-aged mothers through life. ''We don't see ourselves as the overall solution to a very complex problem,'' said Mary Ellen Pascale, director of Life Haven. ''But we feel we can make an impact in preventing second pregnancies, and we will help these girls to stay in school or get job training and raise their self-esteem.'' Their lack of self-esteem, Ms. Pascale said, began long before they became pregnant. The chief of maternal and child health for the State Department of Health, Dr. Vijaya Bapap, noted that when teen-agers feelisolated and do not receive affection from their parents, they tend to ''get into antisocial behavior. This results in truancy, drug abuse and pregnancy. To top all that, society, the media promotes sex as the 'cool' thing to do. You can't watch a half hour of television without seeing champagne in one hand and the girl in the other. ''So when teen-agers are exposed to this and feel no purpose to life, they get into trouble,'' she said. Dr. Bapap said the teen-age pregnancy problem was not new, but unlike years ago when the family and community helped more, many of today's teen-agers have little or no such support. ''Many times they are thrown out of the house or have no home to begin with,'' she said. Cornell Scott, the director of Hill Health Center in New Haven who worked with Ms. Pascale on the project, said many of the efforts being made on behalf of homeless teen-age mothers were merely ''Band-Aids.'' ''We need to have some kind of prevention for those at risk,'' he said, suggesting decent housing, education, job opportunities and encouraging family support. ''It's obvious when young women have nothing to look forward to they are more apt to get pregnant,'' he said. According to the State Department of Health, between 1982 and 1984, the lastest year for which such statistics are available, there were 12,384 births by teen-agers in the state and probably twice that many pregnancies since roughly half of them end in abortion. Ms. Pascale said that about half the number of teen-agers who gave birth in that time period were either homeless or in need of alternative living arrangements because of abuse or inadequate housing. During that same period, there were 15 shelter beds - all at St. Agnes - available. Last year, Mary Glen in Bridgeport opened with three beds and Life Haven, which is to open next spring, will provide shelter to at least 25 pregnant and postpartum teen-agers. The new shelters for pregnant teen-agers, Ms. Pascale said, are in response to a growing need that communities are now beginning to recognize as requiring priority financing. ''We're responding to this need, not creating it,'' she said. ''And if we don't respond and become part of the solution, society will suffer.'' Part of the reason for the current acute need for shelters for pregnant teen-agers, Ms. Pascale said, is the decline of the so-called ''host homes'' of the past. Private families would take in an individual teen-ager for the duration of her pregnancy, providing her with shelter and support. But with the rise of the two-income family, fewer homes are offering to take in teen-agers. She said homes for unwed mothers - there were few in the state to begin with - fell victim to the changing trends among teen-agers, most of whom now keep their babies as opposed to giving them up for adoption. Life Haven, which has no religious affiliation, is in the Fair Haven section of New Haven - a mix of blue-collar and blighted neighborhoods. Housed in a 60-year-old former convent that belongs to the adjacent St. Francis Roman Catholic Church, the large red-brick structure is now being brought up to meet fire and housing codes as well as undergoing some renovation. Situated on a residential street, the building is bordered by a thick row of bushes in the front and an old black wrought-iron gate on one side with a parochial school connected to the church on the other. Large Gothic stained-glass windows and an impressive dome-shaped entrance to the front door with a stone statue of the Virgin Mary standing on the peak, lend evidence that this building was once a convent. Inside, with its green walls, high ceilings and heavy oak doors and windowsills, the three-story, 25-bedroom building is eerily quiet. An infant car seat and baby clothes in the foyer are the only signs that next year dozens of pregnant teen-agers and new teen-ager mothers will fill its hallways and rooms. The chapel, hidden behind stained-glass double doors, will serve as a day-care center. Catherine McMurty, a volunteer who is setting up diets and working on health and home maintenance issues, works in one of the rooms surrounded by scores of books on Catholicism that the nuns have yet to be removed. Ms. Pascale, a petite, energetic 32-year-old mother of a 13-year-old, said she was leasing the building from the St. Francis Parish Corp. for $1,000 a month. She chose the building because of its accessibility to hospitals, clinics and public transportation. It was used up until last year by the Sisters of Mercy who were looking for other living arrangements. Start-up costs have exceeded $300,000 so far and Ms. Pascale expects the operating costs - staff salaries, food, utilities - to be at least $250,000 a year. The staff will include herself, a full-time social worker, secretary and six group-home care workers to provide 24-hour supervision. Financing has come from the State Department of Health, the Episcopal Deanery, the Archbishop's Annual Appeal, the Carolyn Foundation - a Minneapolis-based organization -and the New Haven Foundation. She said most of the operating costs would be covered by third-party reimbursements from the state, notably the Department of Children and Youth Services. She said the young women living in the facility would not be expected to pay anything and any homeless pregnant teen-ager or teen-ager with a newborn would be eligible. Most, she said, will be referred by schools, state or private agencies. Unlike the shelter in West Hartford where high school and business education courses are offered on the premises, Ms. Pascale said Life Haven would refer the young women to other community agencies for those services. In return, the residents will be responsible for keeping doctor's appointments and for cleaning, cooking and caring for their own children. Ms. Pascale predicted that the average length of stay would be three to five months, but said she would consider each teen-ager's individual needs. Ms. Pascale worked in a Jewish home for the elderly and, in 1979, served on a state commission to study the needs for shelters for pregnant and postpartum teen-agers. She said the findings overwhelmingly concluded that shelters were desperately needed. She said she would help teen-agers who wanted to place their babies with adoption centers but was not working with any center on a regular basis. She also indicated that the women who would come to Life Haven were from varied backgrounds. ''We'll have kids from the suburbs and the inner cities and all kinds of I.Q.'s,'' she said. Ms. Pascale said she was trying to take the concerns of starting the shelter in stride. She met with Mother Theresa in New York recently, and said she left with more confidence in her project. ''Mother Theresa said to me, 'People will see what you're doing and the money will come, don't worry,' '' she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LOSERS IN A ZERO-SUM GAME,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/books/losers-in-a-zerosum-game.html,"WHY ERA FAILED Politics, Women's Rights, and the Amending Process of the Constitution. By Mary Frances Berry. 147 pp. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. $17.95. WHY WE LOST THE ERA By Jane J. Mansbridge. 327 pp. Illinois: University of Chicago Press. Cloth, $35. Paper, $9.95.  FOR many feminists, one of the most compelling events of recent years was that historic moment when Geraldine Ferraro was nominated for Vice President of the United States. But if her nomination represented a feminist dream come true, the dark night had come a year earlier when the time limit on the equal rights amendment expired, leaving the E.R.A. as one of a tiny number of constitutional amendments passed by Congress but failing in the states. In different ways, these two books try to explore what went wrong. Mary Frances Berry, professor of history and law at Howard University and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, looks at the question from her vantage point as a historian and a lawyer. By using the lessons of several controversial amendments - among them the income tax, Prohibition, and woman suffrage - Ms. Berry seeks to draw some general conclusions about the fate of the E.R.A. The analysis leads her to conclude that controversial amendments get passed only when two conditions prevail simultaneously. First, proponents must show that a constitutional amendment (and only a constitutional amendment) can remedy some serious social wrong; and second, there must already exist a broad-based and regionally diverse consensus in the states that such an amendment is desirable. Even then, social change is arduous; all of these controversial amendments took over half a century to pass. If Ms. Berry gives us the long historical view of how the E.R.A. failed, Jane Mansbridge, associate professor of political science and sociology at Northwestern University, tells us the inside story. Using a rich range of sources, she shows us who the E.R.A. advocates were, who their opponents were, how the two sides were recruited and the nature of the dialogue between these two groups and members of state legislatures. In what will probably become the most controversial aspect of the book, Ms. Mansbridge concludes that at least some of the political outcomes of the fight over the amendment were byproducts of the organizational structure of the pro-E.R.A. movement itself. In brief, she argues that in the period between 1972 and 1982 the Supreme Court found unconstitutional the most blatant forms of formal sex discrimination, thus making the E.R.A. an amendment with largely symbolic rather than substantive effects. Further, she notes that because pro-E.R.A. groups were voluntary organizations, whose members belonged because they cared passion-Continued on page 9 ately about women's rights, such organizations were illprepared to make any symbolic concessions in order to pass the amendment, especially when few substantive gains could be expected in return. As her most intriguing case in point, Ms. Mansbridge focuses on the debate over the draft, by showing that its proponents took it for granted that the E.R.A. would require the drafting of women for combat. She argues convincingly that an alternative interpretation was always possible, an interpretation she calls the ''deferential'' one. In this interpretation, E.R.A. advocates could have argued that the question of women in combat was irrelevant, because the war powers clause of the Constitution would take precedence over an equal rights amendment, just as the courts have held that it takes precedence over the First Amendment. (Those on active duty in the military, for example, do not have the rights of free speech guaranteed to ordinary citizens.) E.R.A. supporters could therefore have finessed the question of women in combat by arguing that the war powers clause left it up to Congress to decide women's roles in the event of national emergencies. For those who care about women's rights, the critical question is the one central to both books: if E.R.A. supporters had done something different, would the amendment be part of the Constitution today? In effect, both Ms. Berry and Ms. Mansbridge think the answer is at least a qualified yes. Ms. Berry thinks that E.R.A. supporters should have built a state-by-state coalition before the amendment reached Congress, and should have been more active in educating opponents and legislators out of their irrational fears. Ms. Mansbridge, on the other hand, is concerned that organizational dynamics blinded proponents to alternative resolutions of some critical issues; she explores the possibility that different stances on these issues might have swayed key legislators in key states. But is this true? And if it is true, would it have been worth it? The history of America is dotted with zero-sum conflicts between competing groups, where any gain, real or symbolic, is matched by a corresponding loss on the other side. Almost all the controversial amendments Ms. Berry cites as examples reflect such conflicts: between slave labor constituencies and wage labor constituencies (the Civil War amendments); between native-born Protestants and immigrant Roman Catholics (Prohibition); and between traditional forms of property and new industrial property (income tax). THE debate over the E.R.A. represents another such zero-sum conflict between women who are positioned to take advantage of a ''gender-neutral'' world and those whose status is enhanced by the preservation of traditional sex roles. If this truly is a zero-sum conflict, the kinds of alternative strategies Ms. Berry and Ms. Mansbridge suggest may be impossible or irrelevant. Pro-E.R.A. activists might have had a hollow victory, for example, had they chosen the ''deferential'' model of women in combat that Ms. Mansbridge suggests. If, as she argues, the amendment was more symbolic than substantive by 1982, a ''deferential'' E.R.A. would have merely duplicated protections that the Supreme Court had already created, but left unchallenged the idea that men and women could legitimately have different treatment based on sex alone. This could have proved a fatal flaw, incapa-ble of protecting women in periods of conservative retrenchment. And anti-E.R.A. activists, as ''Why We Lost the ERA'' demonstrates, were ''irrational'' only in blaming the E.R.A. for social changes already well under way long before the amendment passed Congress. (Beautifully documented in this book, for instance, is the flight of higher-status women from the role of housewife and the consequent decline of that status to the new one of ''just'' a housewife.) Yet anti-E.R.A. activists were not mistaken in assuming that the symbolic impact of the amendment would be to accelerate precisely these forces, and in the fundamentalist churches and the new conservative movement they found traditional political organizations (mostly male) more than willing to respond to their concerns. ''Education'' of these women and their legislative supporters, therefore, is quixotic at best. Both these excellent books have important lessons to teach. They demonstrate the truth of the political theorist Susan Moller Okin's observation, in ''Women in Western Political Thought,'' that there is a fundamental political tension between women's family roles and the rights of citizenship, and that opposition to ''equal rights'' will be fierce when such rights come up against these traditional roles. Moreover, they suggest that the new battles feminists face today in trying to reduce this tension between citizenship and parenthood - ''comparable work,'' day care, parental leaves, an accessible range of reproductive choices, increased spousal and child support - will be opposed not only by those with symbolic objections but by new groups as well who will be asked to pay for these programs. As feminists prepare for these struggles all of us would do well to ponder the lessons that may be drawn from these two illuminating studies. With an ever-increasing number of women in the paid labor force -and with young women who take for granted they can have it all - the question of women's rights is destined to remain at the heart of American politics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE UNIVERSITY AS A METAPHOR FOR BRITISH LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/arts/the-university-as-a-metaphor-for-british-life.html,"The old image of Cambridge was of golden boys, fresh from their Homer or Virgil, spending mellow afternoons indolently punting past ocher cloisters to serene picnics somewhere far up river. ''Stands the church clock at 10 to 3?'' the poet Rupert Brooke famously rhapsodized in an ecstasy of nostalgia for the university and its rural trimmings, ''and is there honey still for tea?'' But in recent years, novels, stage plays and television dramas have combined to present a harsher picture. Cambridge, in this revisionist view, is a blend of dream factory and success mill, filling the heads of its undergraduates with standards that they then proceed to compromise and expectations that they inevitably fail to fulfill. As a more jaundiced Brooke might put it today: stands the clock at 10 to 4, and is their liquor still to pour? The most recent example of this iconoclasm - the latest attempt, maybe, to use the university as a metaphor for the hopes and failures of the English intelligentsia - is Simon Gray's ''Common Pursuit,'' which opens at the Promenade Theater tonight. The play begins, and ironically closes, with a group of undergraduates setting up a literary magazine at some unnamed Cambridge college in the early 1960's. In between, we witness the moral, emotional and spiritual ravages inflicted by the next two decades on the editor, his associates and the journal itself, which they've boldly shifted to London. Just about everything ends up being betrayed, from principles to friendships, from literary seriousness to marriage. Simon Gray himself ''went up'' (in the university jargon) to Cambridge in 1956 and didn't ''go down'' until he'd spent eight years there, first as an undergraduate ''reading'' English and then as a postgraduate student failing to complete several projected theses. That meant he arrived slightly later than the generation whose apotheosis and decline Frederic Raphael described in his novel and television serial ''The Glittering Prizes''; but it allowed him to overlap with many who went on to make their names in the media and the arts. If Peter Hall, Thom Gunn, Andrew Sinclair, Ted Hughes, Jonathan Miller and Mr. Raphael himself preceded him, he was at Cambridge when Margaret Drabble was winning a reputation for academic brilliance, Michael Frayn was writing a witty column in the university newspaper, Trevor Nunn was directing plays at the Amateur Dramatic Society, or A.D.C., Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen were establishing themselves as the actors, and David Frost was editing the student literary magazine, Granta. Mr. Gray was still there when Mr. Frost became host of a fashionably irreverent BBC program called ''That Was the Week That Was,'' and there when Mr. Frost's contemporary, Peter Cook, left to start a fashionably irreverent nightclub in Soho. The ''satire boom'' of the early 60's, and indeed London's international image as the era's ''swinging city,'' owed much to Cambridge and especially to its revue club, the Footlights. Mr. Frost, Mr. Cook, Mr. Miller all belonged. So did John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle and many others who became well known as comedians in the 60's and 70's. Cambridge, it seemed, led directly to London, acceptance and applause, with nary a pause for drama school or other vocational study. To be active as an undergraduate in extracurricular theater, extracurricular journalism, or extracurricular anything else, was virtually to be professional already. When Eric Idle, then Footlights' president, was asked by a visiting American if he hoped to be an actor after Cambridge, his reply was curt and indignant: ''I am an actor.'' The wonder is that most of them also managed to scrape their way to a B.A. in anthropology, Serbo-Croatian, or whatever they were officially at Cambridge to study. Simon Gray wasn't a great undergraduate careerist. He co-edited a magazine called Delta, in which he published some of his own early fiction and launched a memorable attack on the university's exam system, getting himself denounced as a ''psychopathic hoodlum'' by the establishment Cambridge Review for his impertinence. But by his own admission, he spent most of his time sleeping, drinking, playing poker, seeing movies, and cultivating a reputation for sophistication. In the essay he contributed in the late 70's to a book called ''My Cambridge'' - the narcissistic title of the collection seems significant - he conducted a cutting post-mortem on his student life, accusing himself in retrospect of slickness, intellectual pretension, arrogance and laziness. Indeed, the only lectures and seminars he attended were those offered by the only local figure he admired: F. R. Leavis, the most formidable of the university's English dons and the author of a volume of criticism called ''The Common Pursuit,'' the same title Mr. Gray has wryly borrowed for his play. Dr. Leavis, with his implacable integrity and ferocious contempt for even the slightly second-rate, was a major influence on many Cambridge students in the 50's and 60's. For Thom Gunn, ''his passion, his discrimination, his commitment to literature as neither pastime nor occasion for scholarship helped teach me to write better than any creative writing class.'' For Peter Hall, director of the National Theater, his death in 1978 was a ''terrible shock.'' ''His lectures were the inspiration of my Cambridge years,'' the director wrote in his recently published diaries, ''he somehow inculcated a feeling that art was to do with better standards of life and better behavior.'' Indeed, Mr. Hall went so far as to attribute to Dr. Leavis all the seriousness at the basis of his own theatrical work and that of Trevor Nunn, the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Nevertheless, high standards are intimidating and hard to sustain in the world beyond the university. Reviewing a book about Dr. Leavis in 1984, Mr. Gray paid a passionate tribute to his ''genius as a teacher'' and declared him ''the only great man I have met.'' But the new ''Common Pursuit'' shows the difficulty, maybe the impossibility, of keeping alight the cultural torch lit by the old ''Common Pursuit.'' At one point, the editor's wife actually sacrifices a much-wanted child to his impoverished journal, having an abortion so he can afford to bring out something that has already started publishing pop poems he despises. And before long the magazine has collapsed. The editor has turned his professional attention to junk books, and the most severe of his Leavisite contributors is dead. It is the familiar Cambridge story: infinite promise, inevitable disillusion; excellence as a beguiling chimera that ends by tormenting those who fail to meet its demands. But excellence was not always so rigorously defined at Cambridge. For some, it simply meant proving oneself the cream by rising to the top and staying there. That's the aspiration of most of the characters in ''The Glittering Prizes,'' if not always their achievement. The undergraduate director of an acclaimed student production of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' goes on to win an Oscar nomination for a movie he's made, then deteriorates into just another wealthy, exploitative Hollywood hack. The young man who played Claudio becomes a smart, shallow, mean television interviewer. The brilliant girl who was Beatrice also joins the BBC, only to be dismissed for alcoholism. The production's Benedick is played by an undergraduate not unlike the late Tony White, a real-life student who reputedly brought star quality to role after role at the A.D.C. in the 50's, joined the Old Vic Company in London, then abandoned both stage and glitz, becoming a plumber, house-painter and odd-job man before dying at age 45. Everywhere in ''The Glittering Prizes'' the cream is turning sour or revealing itself as scum, or simply evaporating. In ''The Common Pursuit'' there are parallel portraits, notably an outrageously pushy student who end up incompetently fronting a BBC books program and coveting the job of the Sunday Times theater critic. But of course Cambridge did foster genuine achievement as well as opportunism. Mr. Gray himself is proof of that, accomplished dramatist as he is. So is Mr. Raphael, and so is Michael Frayn, who arrived at Cambridge from the London suburbs in 1954 and was instantly and lastingly seduced by the excitement of the place. ''I liked its sheer exclusiveness,'' he said in a recent interview, ''the feeling of being somewhere hard to get into, full of the sort of people I'd never met before, people with a certain style, sense of irony and panache. It was a miniature world where there was all the pain and possibility and ambition of the macro-world, yet things were somehow small, intense and graspable. I once met a very grand figure in the advertising business who'd done some acting as a student there, and he said, 'One is never so famous afterward as one was at Cambridge.' '' Leaving Cambridge, Mr. Frayn added, was like being ripped from the womb; yet there's a sense in which he carried the place away with him. It is a living presence, or powerful memory, in work after work that he's published since. And his affectionate reminiscence is sometimes combined with a certain cynicism. In his play ''Donkey's Years'' a government minister, a senior civil servant and other middle-aged graduates return to Cambridge for a reunion, only to revert emotionally to the spoiled students they once were. In his novel ''Sweet Dreams'' the main character is killed in a car accident, and finds himself in a ''heaven'' where his afterlife consists mainly of having chic dinner parties with his old college chums and fulfilling one megalomaniac fantasy after another. Eventually, he becomes chief sidekick to God - who turns out to be the most gifted, most fashionable undergraduate of his Cambridge generation. Mr. Frayn's satire is not, of course, altogether original. Cambridge people have often been accused of being self-seeking, go-getting, obsessive in pursuit of their worldly aims. That's a view of them widely held at Oxford, whose typical students Cambridge tends to regard as effete, dandified, and (perhaps rudest of all) amateurish. Again, it's a truism in the outside world that Cambridge graduates remain clubbable to the point of being incestuous, still going to each other's parties, still doing one another favors, still reviewing each other's work as they reviewed it at the university itself. But the fundamental point of ''Sweet Dreams,'' perhaps, is that just three years as an undergraduate at Cambridge can stamp one deep and for life - it is an experience of such intensity that it colors whatever happens to one afterward. That's the case even with some of those who have criticized and attacked Cambridge. Why else would David Hare, who hated being at the university in the later 60's, have set his best play, ''Teeth 'n' Smiles,'' at an undergraduate ball - and ended it with part of the college being burned down? Why else would Mr. Gray admit in ''My Cambridge'' to feeling violently sick in the stomach, and remembering ''something continuously, undiagnosably unpleasant'' at the university, on the few occasions he's returned since being there? Why has he felt impelled to write ''The Common Pursuit'' now? His play seems a testimony to the magnetic force of the world he rejects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COLUMN ONE; POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/us/column-one-politics.html,"Back BurnerHow much does Governor Cuomo think you should pay in state taxes over the next four years? How much in rent? The answer is that he hasn't taken a stand. Those issues - a restructuring of the state tax code, revision of the rent-stabilization laws - are among several politically sensitive decisions that the administration has put off until after the election. And some groups are beginning to complain: after all, they ask, isn't one purpose of an election campaign to elicit from candidates a commitment on the issues? Tenant groups are planning a rally for Thursday outside the Governor's Madison Avenue campaign office to press Mr. Cuomo to take a stand now on rent stabilization. Meanwhile, some Wall Street brokers are pressing for the Governor's thoughts on taxes. He has promised to return to taxpayers the $2 billion a year in extra taxes the state is expected to take in as a result of the new Federal code. But, pending study by his advisers, he has declined to give even a hint on how that should be done and on whether he wants to benefit any particular group. Said Gary Fryer, chief spokesman for the Cuomo campaign: ''If there is political posturing here, it is not by us; it is by those saying, 'Do these things now.' '' ''Some people go out in a campaign and promise this, promise that,'' Mr. Fryer said. ''The Governor is acting responsibly and saying: 'No, I won't make promises now for political advantage. I'll wait till the facts are in.' '' Borough ExecutiveAll those years that everyone thought Robert Abrams was Bronx Borough President, it turns out he was really ''County Chief Executive'' - at least according to a television commercial for Mr. Abrams's re-election as Attorney General. Does Mr. Abrams think the title Borough President carries a negative image, considering the suicide of a Borough President, Donald R. Manes of Queens, who had been linked to the city's corruption scandal? ''The ad is running heavily upstate,'' said Ethan Geto, a top Abrams political adviser, ''and we found people upstate didn't know what he was talking about when he said, 'Borough President,' so we came up with this way of describing it. This has nothing to do with Donald Manes or anything like that. There's no ulterior motive here.'' In the AudienceThe seating arrangement at the Roman Catholic Church's annual Alfred E. Smith dinner is analyzed each year as if it were the May Day lineup of Soviet officials on Red Square - an indication of who is in favor with the archdiocese and who is not. This year, it turns out that Mark Green, the Democratic candidate for Senate, was missing from among the dozens of politicians - Democrats and Republicans alike - who sat on the dais. As the evening wore on last week, he was spotted sitting among the lesser lights, at one of the ordinary tables. ''He was overlooked,'' Randy Daniels, Mr. Green's spokesman, said when asked why the candidate wasn't on the dais. ''Whether it was deliberate or not, I don't know.'' Mr. Green, like many Liberal Democrats, advocates several positions that are at odds with the those of the Catholic church, supporting, for example, a woman's right to have an abortion and the use of Medicaid funds to pay for it. Mr. Daniels said Mr. Green wound up attending as a guest of ''someone who shall remain nameless'' who had bought tickets to the dinner. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican being challenged by Mr. Green, was invited to sit on the dais but was detained in Washington. Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican challenger to Governor Cuomo, was seated prominently. As for the archdiocese, a spokesman would say only that ''we don't invite every officeholder or candidate for office to the dinner.'' No Co-StarsMr. Cuomo announced with great fanfare on Aug. 12 that the Members Only sportswear manufacturer would undertake a $6 million advertising campaign against illegal drug use and that he would be featured in one the nationwide commercials -not a bad vehicle for a man who is running for re-election as Governor and who might one day run for President. But when Mr. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate for Governor, got wind of all this, he put his foot down. If Mr. Cuomo gets a nationwide spot courtesy of Members Only, Mr. O'Rourke said, then he wants one, too. The result? Members Only decided it would rather do no commercial than do one with Mr. O'Rourke. It seems the company doesn't think he is much of a name nationwide. Filming of the Cuomo commercial has been suspended and would resume after the Nov. 4 election.

"THE STATES, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ATOM",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/us/the-states-the-federal-government-and-the-atom.html,"Once the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission decides that a power plant has been properly designed, built and staffed, should a state or local government be able to block its operation? The issue is already before the courts in New York, where the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station on Long Island has been held up for more than a year. The issue is expected to reach the courts here in the next few days because of the commission's decision to allow loading of nuclear fuel at the Seabrook plant, in New Hampshire. Its operation is opposed by neighboring towns in Massachusetts. In both places the ostensible issue is whether the plant operators' preparations for a nuclear emergency are adequate, or even possible. But the emergency planning question, because it is the only one still pending at the plants, masks a variety of others. Perhaps foremost among these is the question of who will pay for the plants, which are 10 times more expensive, per unit of capacity, than older nuclear plants. These costs might have been justified if oil prices had continued to rise rapidly, but now the cost of the oil the nuclear plants would replace in their 30-year lifetimes seems unlikely to approach construction and operating costs. No Consensus, No Middle Ground A broader question is whether changing politics and public policy will accommodate projects that take decades to complete. In New York state and New England the shifts in public opinion since the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania and the explosion at the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Union this spring have added passion to a debate whose tenor resembles that over abortion: The partisans do not seem able to create a consensus for either side, and there is no obvious middle ground. Because of the similarity of the cases and Shoreham's earlier completion, it appears that as New York goes, so goes New Hampshire. The Seabrook plant, an 1,150-megawatt reactor undertaken by the Public Service Company of New Hampshire in conjunction with 15 other utilities serving all six New England states, was conceived a decade before the Three Mile Island accident, at a time when utilities thought that putting their generators close to major consumers would improve the reliability of electricity supplied. Massachusetts objected early to the situation of the plant a stone's throw from its northern border, but the opposition meant little until after the Three Mile Island, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission required that all new plants have plans for warning, sheltering or evacuating the populations within 10 miles in emergencies. That circle takes in six Massachusetts communities. Governors Divided Over Seabrook Opposition to Shoreham, an 809-megawatt plant in Suffolk County on the Island's North Shore, is likewise of long standing. The first major government body to take up the cause was Suffolk, and while the County Executive later wavered, opponents have enlisted Governor Cuomo. In New England, some New Hampshire towns would like to prevent operation of Seabrook, but they have been overruled by Gov. John H. Sununu. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts was considering whether to back the border towns in his state when the Chernobyl explosion occurred. With advice from a dean at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, he has since decided that in the immediate area, which includes some of New England's most popular beaches, neither sheltering nor evacuation is a practical option in case of a rapidly developing accident. Last week the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the owners of the Seabrook plant that they could load fuel and test the reactor at extremely low power. Mr. Dukakis wants the fuel loading stopped because, he argues, testing will contaminate the reactor's innards with radiation, making it far more expensive to convert the plant to another fuel or abandon it - a contention the owners dispute. Massachusetts officials say they will appeal the commission's order. New York state made the same argument over Shoreham, reasoning in pleadings before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that nothing should be done to foreclose alternatives at a time when it was unclear whether commercial operation would ever follow. The regulatory commission decided in the Shoreham case, however, that no accident that could conceivably occur at low power would require evacuation or sheltering of those outside the plant, and that the utility, the Long Island Lighting Company, could proceed with low-power testing at its own risk. For Lilco and for the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, Seabrook's main owner, the plants have become a life-or-death proposition, in which failure almost certainly means bankruptcy, and they have always shown every determination to plunge forward. Costs Continue to Rise While the debate continues, the meter is running. Interest and other overhead costs run more than $1 million a day at each plant. The combined cost of Seabrook and Shoreham approaches $10 billion. In New Hampshire, a law passed almost a decade ago in response to Seabrook's mounting costs bars companies from charging consumers for plants not in service. If the courts or the Federal regulators rule that the plant is not safe, the financial error of having built the plant would fall on shareholders, bondholders and banks, not ratepayers. Public Service of New Hampshire, which owns about one-third of the plant, has already agreed not to charge consumers for at least a portion of its cost. The New York Public Service Commission has ruled that if Shoreham does operate, $1.35 billion of its estimated $4.5 billion cost will have to be borne by Lilco's investors and lenders. The owners of both plants are expected to try to make consumers pay for as much as possible, no matter what the plants' fates. If the economics are murky, the politics are not; neither Governor appears to have suffered much for his position, and neither seems likely to suffer if he is eventually overruled by the Federal agencies or Federal courts. Elsewhere, the Federal Governments's exclusive authority over nuclear power under the Atomic Energy Act is under challenge. In August at the National Governors Conference, Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont won committee approval for a resolution proposing to allow the states to set regulations over nuclear plants stricter than the Federal ones. In Ohio, Gov. Richard F. Celeste has declined to cooperate with emergency planning for the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company's Perry nuclear plant. Smaller Evacuation Zone Sought The industry is pressing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cut the 10-mile circle for emergency planning to 2 miles, using data from Three Mile Island and research in progress about the movement inside nuclear plants and in the environment of radioactive contamination. Critics respond that while the estimates now in use may overstate the risk in some cases, it is far from clear that this is true for all accidents and all radioactive materials. One plant already operating in Maryland has applied to shrink its emergency zone, as has Shoreham. Another hope for plant operation is what the utilities call the ''realism'' argument, maintaining that local governments and states can be judged to be prepared for an accident even if they deny it. In the event of an emergency, the utilities hold, public officials would uphold their sworn duty to protect public health and safety, even if they had sat out planning and drills. The five commission members, all appointed since the Pennsylvania accident and since the emergency planning rule was strengthened, endorsed that argument in the Shoreham case. But Lilco was dealt a blow when a Federal court ruled that utility linemen and meter readers could not substitute for law-enforcement personnel. The states' efforts to carve out a role in nuclear regulation may have more impact on the nuclear industry's future than its present; only about 20 plants listed as under construction appear likely to be completed, and most of those are adjacent to reactors already in operation for which emergency planning has been completed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM D'AMATO-GREEN DEBATE IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/22/nyregion/excerpts-from-d-amato-green-debate-in-albany.html,"Following are excerpts from a debate last night between the two candidates in the Nov. 4 election for United States Senator from New York - the incumbent Alfonse M. D'Amato, and Mark Green. Opening Statements GREEN. Thank you. I want to thank the League especially for allowing the public to hear tonight the clearest choice in a generation for the United States Senate, between a fighting Democrat out of the party of Roosevelt and Truman and Cuomo and a far right Republican out of Joe Margiotta's corrupt Nassau machine. Ask yourself tonight as you watch which of us can best represent your needs and your beliefs in the United States Senate in the future. For example, I think it's wrong to send $100 million in aid to thugs called the contras in Nicaragua. My opponent says it's fine. I think it's essential that we have tougher handgun control laws to reduce the killing on our streets. My opponent disagrees. I think women have the right to choice. My opponent wants to make all abortions criminal. Well, based on my years of experience with Ralph Nader, I think Al D'Amato is a consumer fraud . . . Because while he talks like Jacob Javits he votes like Jesse Helms, and because while he ways that he brings home the bacon, in fact New York has lost more Federal aid than any other state per capita. As a result of my opponent's votes there is less money for Social Security, less money for pollution control enforcement, less money for student loans. . . . D'AMATO: . . . We've just concluded a rather historic session - the 99th Congressional session came to an end. And with it, some historic legislation has been passed. Tax reform, true tax reform. And I voted for that and fought for it, and fought in that bipartisan tradition to see to it that New York's interests and concerns were heard and observed. I led the battle, along with my colleagues, along with Governor Cuomo and Pat Moynihan, to preserve the deduction of state and local taxes. We won that fight by coming together. I fought the battle to bring more dollars in mass transportation to this state. As a result of that, $600 million more have come to New York due to my efforts to see to it that there was a dedicated source of funding for mass transit. It's been Al D'Amato who's been fighting for working middle-class families in New York; fighting to preserve senior citizen housing, Urban Development Action Grants. It's a record that I'm proud of. It's the kind of record that has brought bipartisan support to my candidacy. . . . ... Campaign Contribution Q. You testified on behalf of a discotheque owner from your home town of Island Park. Your testimony was as a character witness for a man who was accused of being an associate of a major mobster. Now, on one hand we've seen you out speaking very forcefully against the mob, yet here's your testimony. Do you see this as contradictory? D'AMATO: Not only speaking forcefully but doing something: passing the comprehensive crime control bill. Doing more to bring about an effort in terms of mobilizing this nation and its resources against the scourge of a drug epidemic. And to more particularly respond to your question, this was a person in my community, a local community, who I had known as a hard-working family man businessman. I was not aware of his associations that have come subsequently. And by the way, there have been some who've said you've accepted some money. I was not aware of that. We had more than 70,000 individual contributions to our campaign. Our campaign checked out the records. Indeed, he and I believe his wife have made contributions. Those contributions were returned. ... GREEN: Let me talk about Philip Basile since you asked the question. He's a man whose nightclub had 20 drug arrests in one year. He's a man who was indicted and convicted of conspiring with an organized crime member, a member of the Lucchese family to get a drug dealer out of prison. You know who his only character witness was? Al D'Amato. He exploited the position of U.S. Senator, walked into court and said that this man, Philip Basile, was a man of integrity. Instead, the jury thought that he was a felon. What kind of signal does it send on the issue of drugs, on the issue of crime, when Al D'Amato testifies for such a man and then takes $1,000 from him ... Dealing With Soviet Q. Mr. Green, both your Democrat and Republican opponents have painted you as a leftist Democrat. Following that theme, do you feel we can negotiate with confidence with the Soviet Union? GREEN: Of course. First, I am in the progressive mainstream of both my parties. My first job in public life was with Jacob Javits. I worked a decade with Ralph Nader, then with Senator Gary Hart. Governor Cuomo's appointed me to the State's Industrial Cooperation Council. So I think I'm working for patriots and my public career . . . as a public interest lawyer demonstrates it. Of course we have to stand up to the Soviets in places like Afghanistan. We have to sit down with them as well when it comes to negotiating arms control treaties. I'm very disappointed that this administration said that Star Wars would be a bargaining chip but they wouldn't spend it. And they went there with high hopes and came back with alibis. I think this is the first Administration since the nuclear genie got out of the bottle, that hasn't produced one single arms control treaty. . . . ... Q. Senator D'Amato, . . . you said President Reagan was correct in not giving up the Strategic Defense Initiative, but the agreement that the Russians were willing to sign would continue to allow S.D.I. research. This agreement would have been the only one in history that was an actual arms reduction agreement, which is something the President said he wanted. Isn't this simply standing up to the Russians for the sake of standing up to the Russians? D'AMATO: I don't believe so. I think Ronald Reagan will eventually have that nuclear arms accord - one that is verifiable, one that really reduces weapons - nuclear weapons. I think we are very close. But I also think there's another reason that he's come so close, and that's because he has insisted on bringing us to a position of strength. We were teetering on the brink of falling perilously behind, in terms of being able to preserve peace. I think that our S.D.I. is an important part in terms of securing for American today, and its future, its legitimate defensive needs. Why should the Soviets be concerned about a defensive system, and the testing of that system? We're not talking about an offensive system - a defensive system. . . . ... Central America Q. . . . The President said that one of the things that caused him to go into aid to the contras was the placement of MIG's at an airbase in Nicaragua, or the preparation, rather, of the base for MIG's. Do you think that was not cause for him to take action? And what action would you have told him to take were you to be a U. S. Senator? GREEN: The President does not yet return my phone calls. But if I called him, and he took the call, I would say that if the Soviets went into any country in Central America with MIG's or nuclear missiles - as they did, of course, in Cuba in the early 1960's - that would be cause for an American response. Realize, of course, there are no Soviet MIG's in Nicaragua, to our knowledge. Why are we in Nicaragua? We're saying that we're protecting the Contadora nations around Nicaragua from them exporting their revolution. Well, let me tell you, the Sandinistas, I think, have betrayed a lot of their revolution. . . . But the Contadora nations, who are supposedly the beneficiaries of our policy, oppose Al D'Amato's $100 million in aid to the contras. . . . They prefer, instead, to negotiate with Nicaragua. . . . Q. Senator D'Amato, on that question? D'AMATO: You know, it's interesting that the same people who today oppose aid to Nicaragua are for the most part the same people who opposed aid to El Salvador. El Salvador would have been lost. We would not have had President Duarte, who's attempting to build and does have the broad-base support of the people, who are now themselves under attack by the guerrillas. I might suggest when we begin to liken Nicaragua to Vietnam that we just don't understand history, or where we are in this nation. ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN; DODD AND EDDY ARGUE ROLE OF U.S. IN CENTRAL AMERICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/nyregion/the-political-campaign-dodd-and-eddy-argue-role-of-us-in-central-america.html,"Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, and Roger W. Eddy, his Republican challenger, clashed sharply yesterday over the role of the United States in Central America and in providing aid to the rebel forces in Nicaragua. Mr. Eddy charged that Mr. Dodd ''often speaks for'' and sides with President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua and displays what Mr. Eddy called ''a strange hypocrisy'' by not criticizing the loss of free speech or a free press in Nicaragua, as he had done in the Philippines. Mr. Dodd, in turn, said he had spoken out against the Sandinista Government of Mr. Ortega and that it was ''absolutely incorrect'' to suggest that because he opposed aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels, known as contras, he was a defender of the Sandinistas. In a debate at The New York Times, only their second confrontation of the campaign, the two candidates agreed on a number of key issues, despite their pointed remarks on Central America and campaign tactics. 'Star Wars' Research Backed They generally agreed, for example, on the need for a stronger stance by the United States to open foreign markets, such as Japan, to American exports. They both said they supported the Equal Rights Amendment and Federal funds to pay for abortions. They also said they would support research on the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as ''Star Wars,'' although Mr. Dodd said he differed with President Reagan on the amount of money to be spent. At one point, Mr. Dodd praised Mr. Eddy for his support of environmental issues when Mr. Eddy served in the Connecticut General Assembly in the late 1960's. ''I wish you were running for the state legislature,'' Mr. Dodd said with a grin. Mr. Eddy, a 66-year-old farmer, inventor and novelist from Newington, who trails far behind Mr. Dodd in most polls, criticized his opponent for not being a leader on issues and for ''wavering back and forth so that nobody ever really knows where you stand.'' In deciding whether to run, Mr. Eddy said, he had been told in Washington that Mr. Dodd had ''the safest incumbent seat in the United States Senate.'' Such a position, he said, should bring strong leadership. He said Mr. Dodd had ''squandered a great opportunity.'' Mr. Dodd, 42, of East Haddam, who is seeking a second, six-year term, said he had focused on issues such as Latin America, housing and programs for children, instead of being what he called a ''Jack of all issues.'' He also said he had been ''a good regional senator,'' working with the Congressional delegations from other states, such as New York. Mr. Dodd said Mr. Eddy had resorted to ''gimmickry,'' which he called ''insulting to voters,'' in recent newspaper ads offering a $10,000 prize in a drawing of coupons, which asked readers to evaluate critical statements about Mr. Dodd's voting record. Mr. Eddy, saying his ads were ''totally fair game,'' said he had tried to talk about issues and Mr. Dodd's voting record, but had attracted little attention. ''And suddenly I put out a questionnaire, or a survey, and all of a sudden the issues are being focused on,'' he said. Mr. Eddy called his differences with Mr. Dodd on Central America ''the clearest division'' with his opponent. He said that if the United States had ''abandoned'' the rebels in Nicaragua, it would have sent a signal to Central America and Mexico ''that we basically didn't feel we could control that whole area down there anymore.'' He added, ''The time to stop potential disaster is early.'' 'Getting Ourselves Into a Mess' Mr. Dodd said, ''It's not a question of being for the Sandinistas but rather trying to find a way in which you can resolve those differences and disputes, if you can, short of having to engage in the military conflict,'' He said of the United States involvement, ''We're slowly getting ourselves into a mess.'' Mr. Dodd said that if Mr. Eddy felt so strongly about removing the Sandinista Government, ''Why don't we just go in and do it, instead of this muddling along, as we apparently are?'' Mr. Eddy said he was ''overwhelmingly against sending American troops down to Central America, and I'm trying to avoid the necessity of that.'' Before ending their debate with handshakes and exchanges of ''Thank you, Christopher,'' and ''Thank you, Roger,'' Mr. Dodd said he would leave it to his Congressional colleagues and people in the region to measure his effectiveness. Mr. Eddy said: ''Now I represent, I think, the future - even though there's quite a difference in our age. I think I represent the return of government to the state level and to the local level.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Civil Liberties of the Unborn,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/opinion/l-the-civil-liberties-of-the-unborn-082686.html,"To the Editor: As one who considers herself a civil libertarian, I am disturbed by the position the American Civil Liberties Union has taken on the California woman facing criminal charges in connection with her newborn infant's death (news article, Oct. 9). Janet Benshoof of the A.C.L.U.'s reproductive freedom project holds a woman's right to privacy rules out any interest on the part of the state in her pregnancy. The A.C.L.U. attorney directly involved, Lynn Palprow, calls the California legal action ''a nightmarish intrusion into this woman's life.'' Neither of them, it seems, considers how this woman's behavior has ''intruded'' on the well-being - and the very life - of her unborn infant. A primary consideration in this case is the placenta previa condition of which the mother was reportedly aware and concerning which she had been given specific instruction, which she then failed to follow. Her use of drugs and participation in intercourse, given this condition, were active abuses of her vulnerable unborn infant. Her failure to follow medical directions in the event of hemorrhage was an act of neglect, which deprived the baby of the oxygen and nutrients necessary to sustain life. If any of these acts had occurred once the baby was outside her womb, there would have been no question of her criminal culpability. The more general issue here is drug abuse during pregnancy. The term ''fetal distress syndrome'' is well chosen. The unborn infant of a drug abuser suffers physical distress, which is then compounded by withdrawal effects following birth. Can anyone who has seen such infants -many born prematurely and underweight - attached to wires and tubes in neonatal units ever again think of drug abuse during any phase of pregnancy as a victimless crime? With increasing neglect caseloads in the courts based on positive toxicologies in newborns, the argument that a woman's body is hers at all times to do with as she pleases loses validity from moral, ethical and legal perspectives. When that body houses a viable being capable of pain, total bodily autonomy is no longer permissible. The freedom of choice, which I believe to be a woman's right for first-trimester abortions, is not applicable past the point of viability. Once a woman has made the choice to bring a pregnancy to term, she has given implicit recognition to the existence of two bodies - her own and the person-in-the-state-of-becoming inside her body. That this person is not visible before birth does not mean he or she is without a right to legal protection from harm - especially harm at the hands of the mother-to-be on whom he or she is fully dependent before birth. There must be an assumption of responsibility for the well-being of the unborn infant. Where because of immaturity or characterological problems this responsibility is not assumed by the mother herself, legal measures are called for. It is my hope that the California case will break some legal ground on this complex issue. It is also my hope that the A.C.L.U. will recognize the right of the unborn in-fant to protection of civil liber-ties.

AROUND THE NATION; Girl Will Have Abortion Despite Parents' Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/us/around-the-nation-girl-will-have-abortion-despite-parents-protest.html,"A State Appeals Court panel today gave a 15-year-old who is 11 weeks pregnant the right to obtain an abortion despite objections by her adoptive parents. The panel upheld a ruling by a Superior Court judge that said the girl, whose name was not disclosed, was mature enough to decide whether to end her pregnancy. Under state law, a judge may grant an abortion to an unmarried girl under the age of 18 without parental permission if the court is convinced the girl is mature enough to make the decision. The girl's parents said the law deprived them of their right to take part in key decisions in their child's life, said Edgar L. Kelley, their lawyer.

TALKING POLITICS; Standing Up on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/us/talking-politics-standing-up-on-abortion.html,"While most candidates around the country seem to be treading lightly on social issues, Harriett Woods has taken an unusually bold stand on abortion in her Senate race against Christopher S. Bond, the former Governor of Missouri. In her latest television commercial, the Democratic candidate looks somberly into the camera and says, ''I believe abortion is a deeply private matter that should be decided by each individual, not the Government.'' She then attacks her Republican opponent, who has said he favors a constitutional amendment that would give states the right to rule on the legality of abortions. Her decision to inject abortion into the political debate has nothing to do with her trailing Mr. Bond in the polls, says Mark Ulven, Mrs. Woods's press secretary. ''She has always maintained a consistent position on the issue,'' said Mr. Ulven. ''We wanted to make sure people heard it in her own words.

EPISCOPAL RESOLUTION ASSAILS VATICAN 'COERCION',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/us/episcopal-resolution-assails-vatican-coercion.html,"By a unanimous vote, the 518-member Convention of the Episcopal Diocese of New York has passed a resolution deploring what it says is ''coercive discipline'' or other action ''that narrows the realm of free debate'' among theologians and biblical scholars. The author of the resolution, the Rev. Christopher Webber, rector of an Episcopal church in Bronxville, said he was prompted by actions of the Roman Catholic Church that ''are creating an impression of the Christian church as authoritarian and not open to freedom and diversity.'' The resolution was passed late Tuesday by the diocese convention, an annual meeting of members of the clergy and the laity, held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The diocese, the third-largest in the United States, represents 46,000 Episcopalians in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, Sullivan and Orange counties. 'Free and Open Inquiry' The resolution, titled ''Freedom and Authority in the Catholic Church,'' says in part: ''We believe that truth is best served by free and open inquiry and that God calls us to allow and preserve to the fullest possible measure freedom of biblical and theologial scholarship and diversity of expression within His church. For these reasons, we deplore any action that narrows the realm of free debate. With concern for the greater unity within the church, we would avoid any use of coercion because we believe the witness and mission of the whole church is impeded by such action.'' Bishop Paul Moore of the Episcopal Diocese of New York said he supported the intent of the resolution. Neither John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, who was in Rome yesterday, nor Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago could be reached for comment last night. A spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said the conference would have no immediate comment. Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee, who has strongly questoned the Vatican's actions in disciplining dissidents, also declined to comment. Father Webber, rector of Christ Church in Bronxville, said that last August he ''began to feel that events taking place in the Roman Catholic Church were having an unfortunate impact; that these events were creating an impression of the Christian Church as authoritarian and not open to freedom and diversity.'' Disciplining of Theologian Cited He said he was particularly concerned about the disciplining of the Rev. Charles Curran and Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle. Father Curran, a professor of theology at the Vatican-chartered Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., was told by the Vatican in July that he was no longer eligible to be an official Catholic theologian because of his dissent from the Vatican's views on abortion, divorce, homosexuality and birth control. Archbishop Hunthausen announced on Sept. 6 that, because of his opinions, the Vatican had stripped him of his authority in several areas, including the liturgy, ministry to homosexuals, marriage annulments and dealings with priests who had left the ministry. ''These are instances of the Roman Church attempting to tighten its discipline,'' Father Webber said. ''It was important to say there is another kind of Catholic Christianity which respects human freedom and reason, and has room within it for diversity of expression.'' Bishop Moore said last night that he first learned of the resolution when it came to the floor of the convention from the ecumenical commission of the diocese. ''I can't speak for the convention,'' he added, ''but, personally, I felt very pleased that it was passed because I feel deeply that freedom is an essential part of being a Christian and that in order to reach the truth about God, which continues to be revealed in new ways as years go by, we must allow our minds the freedom to explore new understandings of the ancient truths of the faith.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VOLUNTEERS AROUND U.S. SUBMITTED TO RADIATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/24/us/volunteers-around-us-submitted-to-radiation.html,"Hundreds of human volunteers around the nation were exposed to radiation to determine its effect on fertility and other biological functions, and how the human body absorbed and retained radioactive contaminants, according to documents released earlier this year by the Department of Energy. The Atomic Energy Commission and its successor, the Energy Research and Development Authority, both forerunners of the Department of Energy, financed studies involving researchers from Government laboratories and such private institutions as the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Researchin New York City and the University of California at Berkeley. The latter two studies involved injecting trace amounts of radiation in volunteer patients to study metabolism. In one major experiment involving inmates at the Washington State Prison, the testicles of 64 volunteers were exposed to large doses of radiation. ''Vasectomies were performed prior to discharge from the study to eliminate the possibility of defective offspring,'' according to a summary of the experiment prepared by the Department of Energy, but it added, ''In several instances the volunteers changed their mind and did not desire a vasectomy at the conclusion of the study.'' Other government documents, gathered by the House Energy Committee's Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power, found that the vasectomies would be necessary ''to avoid any possibility of contaminating the general population with irradiation-induced mutants.'' The committee found ''an appalling number and variety of such expermients,'' on more than 1,000 subjects nationwide, according to its chariman, Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who said that the panel would issue a report next week. At the Oregon State Prison, the testicles of 67 volunteer inmates were irradiated from August 1963 to May 1971, according to Government documents, after which there were sperm counts, hormone evaluations and other studies of the inmates. According to research by the subcommittee, the Government intended to keep in contact with the irradiated prisoners, to watch for further health effects, ''but these plans were dropped in 1976 at the request of the U.S. Attorney in Portland after several irradiated inmates filed suits against the Federal Government.'' Prisoners Were Paid The Oregon prisoners were paid $5 to $10 per irradiation and $100 at the end of the study, according to documents gathered by the subcommittee. The subcommittee research also outlines experiments in which 14 human subjects in Richland, Wash., were immersed in tritium, a radioactive form of water, or given the material to drink or inhale, to measure retention and excretion. Others were injected with radioactie phosphorus, or fed fish from the Columbia River that were contaminated with phosphorus discharged by reactors at the Hanford site. ''The data from these experiments indicated that humans absorbed tritium at a rate 4 times faster than measured for rats,'' according to the report of the subcommittee staff. The tritium study was financed by the Atomic Energy Commission. Other experiments sought to measure the helpfulness of radiation in fighting cancer. The documents released by the Department of Energy mention one study in which progesterone, a hormone found in women, was ''labelled'' with small amounts of radiation and injected into three patients, one 10 weeks pregnant.

THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN; REAGAN MILITARY STAND UNITING CONSERVATIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/25/us/the-political-campaign-reagan-military-stand-uniting-conservatives.html,"President Reagan's handling of the arms talks in Iceland and his strong support for a defense against missiles have cooled a feud among conservatives over the direction of their movement and the strategy that Republicans are pursuing in this year's elections. While Democrats dispute how much of an impact the President's handling of the arms issue will have on the Congressional races this year, and insist the economy will predominate, relieved Republican conservatives contend that Mr. Reagan's strong stand has united their ranks and given them a powerful election issue. ''The arguments are a healthy sign for a movement growing into a new majority,'' said Representative Newt Gingrich, a conservative strategist involved in a tough campaign for re-election here. ''But a lot of conservatives who were worried about the campaign are now reasssured.'' For the conservative movement that regarded Ronald Reagan as a hero before the rest of the nation did, 1986 has been a difficult year that included internecine struggle and, for some, disappointment and malaise. Feuding Over Strategy It has been a year in which the Old Right, which got its start in Barry Goldwater's campaigns, took the neo-conservatives as ''Johnny come latelys'' to the movement. There has been fierce feuding as well over electoral strategy between ardent believers in conservative doctrine and elements of the White House staff and others whom the conservatives regard as too moderate. The conservatives have argued that without an aggressive, thematic campaign, the Republicans would lose ground to Democrats running races based on local issues or as voices of protest against economic difficulties. But with Election Day less than two weeks away and with many Republicans privately fearful that the Democrats will retake control of the Senate, the various factions have arrived at a truce, thanks largely, if indirectly, to the President. The truce is built around the proposed missile shield that is the central military goal of the conservative movement. What brought the two sides together is the perception that some themes were needed to pick up marginal voters in at least a half dozen Senate races that are expected to be decided by the smallest of margins. For the ''pragmatic'' Republican campaign strategists, the President's speeches in favor of the missile defense, which he calls his Strategic Defense Initiative, have given him an issue through which he can rally voters who support him personally behind Republican Senate candidates. Polls have repeatedly shown that many Americans who approve of Mr. Reagan's handling of his job are nonetheless voting for Democrats this year. G.O.P. Gains at Polls Seen ''I think it has worked surprisingly well,'' said Robert Teeter, a leading Republican poll taker who is widely regarded as a pragmatist. Mr. Teeter said that in the wake of the Iceland summit, most Republican candidates had gained at least a couple of percentage points in the polls. For the conservatives, a missile defense was a matter of principle, and the key for them was that the President showed that he could stand firm against the political pressure to reach arms agreements with the Soviet Union. ''We were expecting the worst from the Iceland summit,'' said Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a leading conservative research organization. Instead, he said, Mr. Reagan refused to sign an unacceptable deal and came away ''more committed than ever to S.D.I.'' The President's speeches in the final days of the campaign are still less sharp in their defense of the antimissile plan than some conservatives might like. But nonetheless they have been heartened by his clear stand on the issue and his charges that Democrats would raise taxes and block the appointment of tough judges. Representative Gingrich, a persistent trouble-maker for the House Democratic leadership, said he was not worried about the battles that have engulfed the conservative movement over the last year. He sees the in-fighting as a reflection of the diversity of the movement that has gathered around the President. ''What we are talking about is leaving the exciting adolescence of 'Rebel Without a Cause' and trying to govern the country,'' he said. Old and New Conservatives The strands of the new movement include the many elements of the Old Right: traditionalist conservatives who emphasize hierarchy and order; libertarian conservatives who accent the free market, and anti-Communist conservatives, for whom the primary goal must be rolling back Soviet influence. Added to this mixture in the late 1960's and 1970's were the new forces of conservatism: the neo-conservatives, former liberals dismayed by what they see as a liberal tendency toward anti-interventionism abroad and racial quotas at home; and the New Right, a diverse array of groups that include the politically active Evangelical Christians and opponents of abortion, of busing to achieve racial desegregation and of gun control. While tactically more aggressive than other Republicans, Mr. Gingrich recognizes that the New Right cannot go it alone, ''The highest priority has to be keeping this coalition together,'' said the 43-year-old founder of the group of young House Republicans, the Conservative Opportunity Society. ''All of a sudden, you have more people in the tent than will ever agree with each other,'' he said. ''You have to keep them from killing each other.'' But that, figuratively speaking, is exactly what has been happening this year. For example, at a meeting this spring of the Philadelphia Society, a group of conservative intellectuals, the Old Right challenged their new allies, especially the neo-conservatives. In an article published at the time, Dr. M. E. Bradford, a professor of English at the University of Dallas who is a leader of one of the older ideological wings of conservatism, said that ''certain groups who have recently attached the conservative label to themselves'' were involved in trying to ''steal our identity and put it to uses at variance with its origins.'' The liberal converts, he said, were essentially still supporters of the welfare state. The pragmatic technicians of the Administration, in the meantime, threatened to make the conservative cause ''synonymous with the tepid compromises rationalized in public by the servants of the President,'' he said. Sober Ideological View ''What we have learned,'' Dr. Bradford concluded, in one of the gloomier statements on the right in recent years, ''is how little is accomplished by winning elections.'' Meanwhile, on the New Right, leaders complained that Republicans were not pursuing the conservative social agenda aggressively enough and that this would lose votes, too. Morton C. Blackwell, chairman of the Conservative Leadership Political Action Committee, a former White House liaison with the New Right and other groups, said that Republicans had operated too much ''on the least common denominator basis,'' to the disappointment of conservative activists who wanted more aggressive stands on gun control, abortion and other issues. For the pragmatist, the entire debate on the right wing is a dangerous sectarian battle that has little regard for governing or building a majority. By refusing to bargain away the missile shield program and effectively selling his position to the public, Mr. Reagan has largely reunited the major factions, at least for the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PASTOR FINDS G.O.P. SUPPORT LUKEWARM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/us/pastor-finds-gop-support-lukewarm.html,"The Rev. Donald Lynch is a 31-year-old assistant pastor who decided to run for Congress this year. With $4,000 and an all-volunteer organization made up mostly of conservative Christians, he won the Republican nomination in Indiana's Second Congressional District. His top issues included AIDS and abortion. ''People are dying from abortion, and people are dying from AIDS,'' Mr. Lynch said in an interview this week. ''Something needs to be done right now.'' He advocates barring AIDS victims from schools, for instance. In the primary, he defeated a Muncie businessman who had strong support in the party's establishment. In the general election, he is waging an uphill battle against Representative Philip R. Sharp, the Democratic incumbent. Mr. Lynch has raised about $62,000 since the primary, a spokesman said, which is not much for a Congressional race. Scant Aid From National Party He has not received much help from the national party; he feels he deserves more. His campaign chairman, John R. Price, asserts that the ''old Republicans'' do not want to see candidates like Mr. Lynch win. The young minister's campaign reflects some of the growing pains of a key movement in the Republican Party: the mobilization of Christian conservatives as party activists and candidates. It is a movement that presents the party with both opportunities and risks, in the view of many people familiar with the situation. It has already led to some tension beween newly energized Christian activists and longtime members of the party establishment. The party's ability to manage these tensions could be critical over the next two years, as it seeks to preserve the electoral gains forged by President Reagan, according to people in political circles. In this election season, Indiana offers a case study of the process. Gordon K. Durnil, chairman of the Indiana Republican Party, presides over a highly successful party that controls both houses of the State Legislature, the governorship and both United States Senate seats. Welcoming Fundamentalists The state chairman said party leaders worked hard in recent years to make fundamentalists feel welcome, as they have with other new arrivals. ''We are now political leaders managing coalitions,'' said Mr. Durnil. ''We're no longer this little inbred country club set.'' But many party regulars were caught off guard this year by the primary victory of Mr. Lynch, assistant pastor of the Beech Grove Independent Nazarene Church, south of Indianapolis. His previous political activity was largely limited to the anti-abortion movement. It was not the only Congressional upset in Indiana in which conservative Christians played a crucial role. In the Fifth Congressional District, most of the Republican county chairmen backed State Treasurer Julian Ridlen in his effort to succeed the retiring Republican incumbent. But the nomination was won by State Senator Jim Butcher, who is heavily supported by conservative Christians; the Rev. Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, appeared at fund-raising events in Mr. Butcher's primary campaign. Stress on Legislative Experience Mr. Butcher, however, emphasized this week that he was a lawyer with eight years of legislative experience. He drew a distinction between himself and political newcomers such as Mr. Lynch. ''I am a Christian, and I'm involved in politics,'' Mr. Butcher said, ''but it's not like all of a sudden I got into politics. I've paid my dues. This is a natural progression.'' Indeed, the party appeared to close ranks quickly around Mr. Butcher. Stuart Rothenberg, who is director of the political division of the conservative Institute for Government and Politics and co-author of the book ''The Evangelical Voter,'' says Mr. Butcher is the ''successful model'' for candidates who come out of a religious background. Voters, Mr. Rothenberg said, are uneasy with candidates perceived only as outgrowths of religious movements. Rougher Road for Pastor The course has been rockier for Mr. Lynch. The National Republican Congressional Committee did not put much emphasis on his district this year, as it has in years past. It gave Mr. Lynch $1,000, a small proportion of what it could provide in money and services under the law. Mr. Price, the chairman of the Lynch campaign, asserted that the committee's treatment of Mr. Lynch amounted to ''Christian-bashing.'' In an interview in his law office this week, Mr. Price argued that ''there's no other discernible reason'' for the national committee not to make a heavier commitment to the Lynch campaign. A spokesman for the committee responded, ''It's not fair to characterize the committee as making a decision based on someone's religious preference.'' Mr. Price, a longtime activist from the party's conservative wing, asserts that candidates like Mr. Lynch are ''the new Republicans,'' with clear-cut positions on the issues. Christian Consultant's Warning As an example, he cites Mr. Lynch's stance on acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Mr. Lynch has campaigned heavily on the threat of AIDS. Gary Jarmin, a political consultant to Christian Voice, a conservative lobbying organization, argues that the party can pay a price for appearing to slight candidates like Mr. Lynch. Mr. Jarmin said: ''Let's say Lynch doesn't win this race, and '88 comes, and you nominate someone you consider a very viable candidate that the establishment's pleased with. You come to us, and say, 'Look, we need you conservative Christians to help us knock off Sharp.' Why should we help you?'' Mr. Durnil, the Republican chairman, said he believed that over the years the party built up a relationship with religious activists that would last. He said he believes the party had been strengthened by their emergence, and he discounted the notion that they could cost the party the support of younger, more liberal voters. However, John B. Livengood, the Democratic state chairman, asserts that Republican leaders are concerned about the heightened visibility of fundamentalists like Mr. Lynch in their party. ''I think the leadership in the Republican Party is, in public, trying to put the best face on it,'' he said. ''And in private, they're hoping they can outlast it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DODD AND EDDY CLASH OVER LEADERSHIP ROLE AND CAMPAIGN TACTICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/nyregion/dodd-and-eddy-clash-over-leadership-role-and-campaign-tactics.html,"THE campaign for the United States Senate entered its final days last week much as it began, with Christopher J. Dodd, the Democratic incumbent, and Roger W. Eddy, his Republican challenger, still trading barbs over the issue of leadership. When they announced their candidacies - by coincidence on the same day, March 20 - Mr. Dodd said he would run on his record, and Mr. Eddy called the Senator ''a young man living in the past.'' Starting their final round of campaign appearances, including a debate last Wednesday at The New York Times, Mr. Dodd praised his record, and Mr. Eddy said his own candidacy represented ''the future,'' which he described as returning power to the state and local governments. Sitting next to each other at a conference table, Mr. Eddy said of Mr. Dodd: ''On no one particular issue has Mr. Dodd emerged as a solid leader, a solid spokesman. Every position he's taken is subject to change, depending on the whims of the voter polls, and that, to me, is not leadership. And I think you have, as I've said, squandered a great opportunity.'' In response, Mr. Dodd said he had focused on issues such as housing, Latin American policy and programs affecting children, rather than becoming what he called ''a jack-of-all-issues.'' He said that in 12 years in Congress he had demonstrated leadership and had taken independent stands. ''I think I've been a good regional Senator,'' he said, noting he has cooperated with the Congressional delegations from the Northeast on issues. In turn, Mr. Dodd chided Mr. Eddy, saying he had not spelled out his positions on issues during the past eight months. ''I think that opportunity has been squandered and missed,'' Mr. Dodd said. Mr. Eddy said he had tried to talk about issues but that nobody paid attention until he offered a $10,000 prize in a contest asking newspaper readers to evaluate some critical comments about Mr. Dodd's record. Mr. Dodd called the contest ''gimmicky,'' and said, ''I think it's insulting to voters in the state.'' Mr. Eddy said it was ''fair game'' and added, ''Suddenly I put out a questionnaire, or a survey, and all of a sudden the issues are being focused on.'' The Dodd-Eddy race has been one of contrasts from the beginning. Mr. Dodd, 42 years old, the son of the late Senator Thomas J. Dodd, has spent six years in the House of Representatives and six in the Senate. He lives in East Haddam. Mr. Eddy, 66, a farmer, inventor and novelist from Newington, served three terms in the state legislature in the 1960's and is making his first run for statewide office. In contrast to the fights for the gubernatorial nominations in both parties, neither Mr. Dodd nor Mr. Eddy had any opposition within their parties. Mr. Dodd wears neatly tailored, dark blue suits. Mr. Eddy wears rumpled gray suits, and the points of his shirt collar seldom stay down. Mr. Dodd has raised more than three times Mr. Eddy's campaign budget of about $360,000. The most recent University of Connecticut-Hartford Courant poll of 500 adults, taken by telephone between Oct. 13 and 18, showed Mr. Dodd leading Mr. Eddy, 53 percent to 9 percent, with 38 percent undecided. Mr. Eddy said that when he was considering whether to run, he had been told in Washington that Mr. Dodd ''had the safest incumbent seat in the United States Senate.'' ''This didn't exactly start me off on an up, optimistic note,'' he said. ''But I used that as an example. If anyone had such a position, he should be able to take strong positions on what he believed and stay with them. . .That's what leadership is.'' Mr. Dodd said he would not pretend that he was a leader on every issue. Senators who try to do that, he said, ''turn out to be the least effective members of the institution.'' While most of the attention has been focused on their differences, and their sometimes barbed exchanges, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Eddy did find themselves in substantial agreement on several topics. For example, they both stressed the importance of a strong Federal presence to open up foreign markets to American exports from manufacturing states, such as Connecticut. They both stressed the need for continued Federal support to help maintain and improve Connecticut's highway and rail systems. They both opposed the Federal tax revision bill, which was signed into law last week. They said they supported an equal rights amendment, Federal funds to pay for abortions and continued research for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ''Star Wars.'' When Mr. Dodd pointed out the similarities and noted that Mr. Eddy had said previously that they disagreed on most every issue, Mr. Eddy interjected: ''major issue.'' ''Well, these are not insignificant issues: tax reform, environmental legislation, educational legislation, all the whole social agenda,'' Mr. Dodd said. With that, Mr. Dodd went on to praise Mr. Eddy for being what he called ''one of the strongest and earliest spokesmen on behalf of environmental legislation'' when he served in the General Assembly. ''I wish he were running for the state legislature,'' Mr. Dodd said. Mr. Eddy just smiled. Responding to a question on whether they would support a Federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit, Mr. Eddy said, ''No.'' Mr. Dodd said he wanted to know what kind of tax would be increased before he responded. ''I don't rule it out,'' Mr. Dodd said of a tax increase. When Mr. Eddy prodded him to give a yes or no answer, Mr. Dodd said he was taking a page from Mr. Eddy's speech in the General Assembly in 1971, urging enactment of a state personal income tax. The tax was repealed a few weeks later after an outcry from the public. ''It was an eloquent speech,'' Mr. Dodd said, referring to one by Mr. Eddy on a similar issue when the state was facing a large deficit. ''I don't consider this an answer,'' Mr. Eddy said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE BETWEE DODD AND EDDY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/nyregion/excerpts-from-debate-betwee-dodd-and-eddy.html,"Following are excerpts from a debate last Wednesday between the Democratic and Republican candidates in the Nov. 4 election for United States Senator - the incumbent, Christopher J. Dodd, and Roger W. Eddy: Leadership Mr. Dodd, your opponent says you haven't taken the job seriously, you have your finger to the wind and you don't lead. What's your response? DODD: Well, I would disagree with that. I think there are any number of instances over the last six years, 12 years - six in the House, six in the Senate - where I've demonstrated leadership, taking independent positions on issues. Going back, you want to just look at the six years in the Senate, certainly the '81 tax cut proposal, which I thought was a mistake. Today, I think if you were to ask most members of the Senate if they'd like to have a vote back in the last six years, that would be one of them they'd like to have back, given David Stockman's recent revelations about it, certainly taking a leadership role on that. On the issue recently of tax reform, which I happened to have disagreed with, there were 23 of us ultimately who voted against that bill to be signed into law today, offering amendments on that bill; starting the Children's Caucus in the Senate -some 32 members actively involved in those questions. Certainly being asked to respond to the President in 1983 on the Latin American policy, having offered the initial amendments in 1981 in that arena. The only housing bill to be adopted under the Reagan Administration in the last five years, the Dodd-Schumer Bill, which was certainly leadership. . . . EDDY: . . . When I first went to Washington and I was being persuaded - and, I must say, I was willing - to make this run, I was told that Mr. Dodd had the safest incumbent seat in the United States Senate. This didn't exactly start me off on an up, optimistic note. But I used that as an example: if anyone had such a position, he should be able to take strong positions on what he believed and stay with them. That's what leadership is. Leadership is not simply being against somebody or being against an incumbent President. And so, he himself has brought up this tax bill of 1981. He was one of eight senators to vote against that bill. And his suggestion that maybe a lot of people would like to have that vote back now, well, that's just his opinion. I think it happens to be the foundation of the prosperity, both in the state of Connecticut and nationally. . . He was the Democratic spokesman against the Central America policy. But I've observed during this campaign that the Senator has backed off even that position. This is what I'm referring to. I say that if you are perceived to be an incumbent United States Senator from an important state such as Connecticut and you believe something or other, you should, in my opinion, youshould come out front on it and stay, within reason, of course. Sometimes evidence comes up which can change your mind, but not be always waivering back and forth so that nobody ever really knows where you stand. . . . Criticism Q. Mr. Eddy, you called your opponent the Senator from Communist Nicaragua. You were giving a $10,000 prize in a drawing evaluating some uncomplimentary statements about his conduct. But one recent poll only gave you 9 percent of your vote. Has your criticism backfired? EDDY: . . . There are three legitimate issues in any campaign. First and most important is one's voting record, how he or she voted on issues. Second, public statements before a group like this, before a television program, before a radio. What do you say? That is fair game, fair campaign game. And finally, public conduct in a public place by a public official I'm not interested in Mr. Dodd's private life, and I'm certain he's not interested in mine. But I am interested in his public life, because he represents me, and I want a senator or a representative or a Congressperson in Washington for whom I can be proud. . . . Now, I didn't refer directly to the other part. I have yet to hear or observe or be told any statement, any voting record, where Mr. Dodd has said that he disapproves of Daniel Ortega and a Communist dictatorship in Central America. On the one hand, I observe great eloquence when Mr. Dodd speaks about access to the press and everything in a place like the Philippines. I sense great conviction on his behalf. He wants an open society in the Philippines, he's spoken out eloquently on that. And yet, I detect utter silence when it comes to precisely the same things in Nicaragua. DODD: . . . Quite the contrary, I have spoken out against the Sandinista Government and my concern for it. In fact, it's one of the reasons why a lot of the groups that are to the left of center on this issue are not, have been terribly pleased because I haven't been a defender of the Sandinistas. I think the issue has been framed, very cleverly by the President and the Administration, that if you're not for the contras, you must be for the Sandinistas. . . . And if we can move away from sort of the bumper-sticker approach - that if you're not for the Sandinistas or if you're not for the contras, you must be for the Sandinistas - and start to look at this issue in the context of what's in our interest, what's in the interest of our allies, I think you can develop a better policy. I relate it back, in fact, since you raised the Philippines, when President Reagan was asked in the 1984 debates whether there was an alternative to President Marcos. He said, no, just Marxism, in that particular debate. In fact, we found out there is an alternative. I'd like to suggest there is here, too. As far as the ad goes, and so forth, that are raised on it, those questions there, it's gimmickry, and I think it's insulting to voters in the state. That's been the reaction I think, by and large, that somehow they're going to decide to vote for someone because there's a $10,000 reward and a drawing. People expect far more out of a candidate and a candidacy. . . . And so we've come down to the last month or so, and so it's scramble time and do whatever you have to do in order to get your word across. . . . And it hasn't worked. And I regret it. I think it's squandering an opportunity to really lay out issues. . . . EDDY: . . . We are the peacekeeper of the world. We have acquired that role in my lifetime. And the Central America area is critical to our national security and our national defense. . . . In my way of thinking, this is maybe the clearest division between Mr. Dodd and me, possibly based on our experience - in my case, the fighting in World War II. I've said this, I believe it. The time to stop potential disaster is early. And that's where leadership is. That's where you have to make a tough decision. You have to say, well maybe the majority of people aren't with me on this, but this is where we take our stand. We take our stand with the tools at hand. Sometimes the tools are not perfect, but I say the ultimate goal of this destabilization process in Central America is Mexico. I say it is serious. I say it is indirect aggression from our major antagonist, the Soviet Union, via their surrogates. . . . And I don't wish to get back into my questionnaire, the response has been, frankly, overwhelming. We've had close to 14,000 replies. It's been interesting. It has been a way for me to get the very thing I tried to do for the length of time that he discussed - to get issues out there. I've talked about every single major controversial or noncontroversial issue facing the people today. And to be perfectly honest with you, got very little attention, either from my opponent - the only thing he said was why don't I talk issues, which is precisely what I've been doing - and, quite frankly, didn't get much attention for a lot of good reasons - overshadowed by the gubernatorial primary, overshadowed by many things, overshadowed by the perception that this was, at the very best, an uphill race for me. And suddenly I put out a questionnaire, or a survey, and all of a sudden, the issues are being focused on. Stand on Reagan Q. Mr. Eddy, you've criticized Mr. Dodd for voting against President Reagan, in your words, every step of the way. Are there areas in which you disagree with the President, and what are they? EDDY: Yes, there are. I'll start with some rather simple social issues - not so simple, but I mean they're very cut-and-dried. I certainly disagree with him on his attitude toward abortion and, say, the woman's right of choice. I do not favor prayer in schools. I do not favor the educational voucher system. I'm a strong supporter of a public educational system, and also I believe in private education, too. I'm not saying we should curtail that, yet I don't want to see us support it. I oppose many aspects of what this Administration's attitude appears to be on the environmental area. I think that I, myself, and others in the state of Connecticut worked for many many years attempting to bring about some changes in environmental attitudes. And I think, along with many others, I was helpful in changing those attitudes - and this spills over into the Federal and national area. I think there've been some steps backward in that area, the attitude of drilling rights and grazing rights, and in the nonfunding of acquisition of park lands and so forth. I particularly disagree with him in what I consider to be a critical area facing this nation today, and that is on trade imbalance. . . . The primary threat comes from the Orient, and Japan, in particular, but it exists everywhere. And I have said - I made this speech, which has achieved some heat for me, as well as some support, that the Japanese Government, in collusion with our industrial leaders in the 50's, devised a policy of predatory trade, which, quite simply - an oversimplification here - but this is basically the way it works. We will close our markets to you, meaning us, but we will take advantage of your wide-open market. And by this means, we will undermine many of your basic industries -which, in fact, they have done - and the only export that Japan has accepted willingly, and now other countries in the Orient, from us is our jobs. It is the major threat today facing American working men and women. There is no question about it in my mind that this is an issue that must be immediately addressed in the next session of Congress. DODD: Well I would add two other issues. Roger, I guess, would disagree as well with the tax-reform bill -which we agree on by the way, he and I agree on - and Gramm-Rudman, where we disagree. And the Administration was supportive of that particular position. EDDY: And by the way, I just want to make it clear I am not for tariffs, because certainly you can argue that tariffs caused the Great Depression of the 30's, but I am for saying that this country has got to forget the role of being the financier for the world. . . . I say listen, American industry, American working men and the women, American management can compete. I just know they can. We've always been able to compete. So there are ways of forcing action in this. And I want some leadership, and I want to be able to use the language that will attract attention to this issue, and in fact, I have. Mr. Dodd is now talking about it. . . . DODD: I gave that speech, Roger, two years ago. EDDY: Well, that's wonderful. I'm proud of you for recognizing this, but I'm saying let's take some leadership here. I know I will. It will be my major effort in Washington . . . DODD: I tell you, again, this has been, I think, worthwhile, I think an area where there's probably some pretty fundamental agreement on what we can keep doing. Maybe it's a modest modification, but the difficulty that began about this issue was, I think, frankly, the comments that the Japanese were culturally liars, cheats and thieves. Now I only read the quote, and didn't hear my opponent say it. EDDY: Well, I did, so I'll give you that. DODD: That, to me, that is not to discuss trade. That to me was the kind of statement that I think does just the opposite - it diverts attention from the issue. All of a sudden, you had a statement that was made that, by most estimates, I'd have to call a racist statement. . . . You've had ample opportunities to retract a statement like that, and I would hope maybe this morning you might, because I don't think it ought to keep coming up. It doesn't serve your candidacy well. . . . EDDY: Well, let me answer, and let me say there's no apology going to be offered here, because I will explain precisely what I meant. And what I thought I said, but, which in a good political way, can be misinterpreted deliberately. The fact of the matter is that the Japanese Government, in collusion with their industrial leaders, decided upon a policy which included the stealing of patents, the lying when it came to trade agreements and cheating insofar as dumping. Those are precisely what I meant by those three words. Now, as far as saying that the ordinary Japanese individual, and then the so-called Japanese man in the street lies, cheats, I had no intention of saying that or implying. But I will not withdraw from my statement of the high-level policy, and if you don't believe what I say, ask I.B.M. Ask the Zenith Radio Corporation. Where do you think all the patents that are now being sold back to us in the form of radio or TV came from? They came from Zenith. They were stolen through industrial espionage. . . . I stand by the statement, and I say that we must recognize that and must suggest to the Japanese Government and their industrial leaders that they have to join the civilized trade world. That's all. And there are other ways that they acquire technology, which are less illegal, in fact, which are legal. Transportation Q. Transportation is always an issue . . . Do you favor Federal legislation creating a centralized register or licensing system of truckers, and would you raise the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit? DODD: No, I voted against raising the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit. . . . I think the data is too strong that supports saving many lives, and the fact of the matter is 55 means 65. If you make it 65, it means 75, as a practical matter. So I think that speed limit is proper. Now I co-sponsored legislation that would require - I don't know, I think it was Senator Heinz, apparently, who offered the legislation - but it would set up standards. There's some 20 or 30 states in this country where to get a driver's license to drive a Volkswagen or a 16 wheeler is no different at all. And with deregulation of trucking, of course, we've had a lot of new, a lot more competition on the line, but the problem is you're getting an awful lot of people driving vehicles that have little or no experience. So some sort of registry, if you will, or requirement that in order to drive one of these big vehicles should require more than just passing a local driving test. I think it's essential. . . . We have a highly congested system. In fact, I-95 is being used now 20 to 25 percent more than it was when the tolls were in. And so you're getting a tremendous amount of congestion along those roads, and I think something along those lines of registry, training and the like, or passing a special licensing requirement -standardized - if you're going to have 20 to 30 states with Interstate traffic as much as it is. . . . And the fact is there is a lot of data there that supports the fact that the numbers of accidents, the number of - where trucks are involved - is pretty substantial. It's been fairly even since deregulation, but nonetheless it has gone up. EDDY: . . . I'm 60 percent in favor of removing the 55, and 40 percent against it. And I really I don't think that's a good answer, but I've offered it. And the reason for it is, I think the major cause of accidents, it's been determined, at least as far as I can read, is by the multiple-purpose highways, the multiple-speed highways, the highways that have some people going 25 miles an hour, others going at 45 and others going at 75. It isn't so much speed that kills, despite the slogan, it is the multispeeds that seem to kill. And another thing that bothers me is when you have an unrealistic law, a law that nobody obeys, then you should really recognize that the people themselves are talking to you. . . . Now, to get into, I think, a far more complicated and possibly important issue, and that is the transportation system in Connecticut is in a state of chaos, absolute chaos. And I'm not going to become narrowly partisan here and say it's all Governor O'Neill's fault or it's all - that's just - electioneering. And I'm not going to indulge in it. But the truth is, the truth is that our highway system is critical to the economic survival of Connecticut. If we don't have good roads, and that includes Interstate 95, if we don't have those good roads and if we can't get easily from one factory to another, then we, as a state, are courting with disaster, economic disaster. So, I use 95 a lot, I think all of you here do. It is probably one of the worst major highways in the United States of America. It needs great, great changes, and it is sort of civilization gone mad. You have trucks, wall-to-wall trucks. You have cars courting disaster. And I can't say here's what I'd do - these are the six steps I'd take. The only thing I know is that we've got to do something, and our representatives and our senators in Washington have got to become aware that Connecticut is on the brink of a serious transportation problem, and it also includes the railroad, as every commuter in Fairfield County has told me at least twice. And I think here I would question a little bit the privatization plan, that this Administration has, in fact urged. Because I think there's grave worry in Fairfield County on the part of those who use this railroad in order to commute to their jobs that the fact is that here's a case where - much as I espouse private industry and believe in it and think it's the ultimate solution for providing jobs and everything else - that they do tend to look at profit and loss, and that if they conclude that the railroad in Fairfield County coming into New York is, in fact, running at a loss or not as much profit, they could let it deteriorate, they could not take the proper care of it. . . . DODD: I think the railroad is important. . . . But obviously to the extent you can support alternative modes of transportation, in addition to talking about registry on trucks and so forth, relieves some of that burden and pressure along our roads. . . . But I would just say, in fairness to Governor O'Neill, you can't have it both ways. You can't be critical of the fact that our roads aren't in great shape and then turn around and be critical because he's trying to do something about it. If anything else, he's being criticized today because an awful lot of the gridlock is being caused by repairs on the highways and roads. And that was something that was very important, people wanted in the state, but we let it go far too long, far too many years, because people didn't want their dollars spent in that arena, and now they are. And it's going to give Connecticut, I think, by the time these repairs are completed over the next year, year and a half, probably the finest road system in the country. There'll be congestion, because the corridor in which we live is one of the most congested in the country. But to fault him for trying to repair these things, right now, I think is, in a sense, unfair. EDDY: Well I think that I have to keep the record straight here. And I did not fault him. I thought I bent over backward to try to avoid getting into the gubernatorial race here. I'm just saying that the truth of the matter is that Connecticut's highways are critical to our survival, absolutely critical. We are a corridor, and if ever we allowed any administration, Republican or Democratic in the state capital to somehow or other sacrifice that, and I think they have been sacrificed and I think we're paying the price now. And I think that therefore this is a critically important issue, also an opportunity for some leadership in Washington, because there is Federal money involved in many of these projects, as we all know. And so therefore, here's an issue where a Congressperson or a senator can say this is critical to our state, it's critical to our survival as the No. 1 in the nation, and I personally would be involved in this. DODD: As I have in that particular case. In fact, one of the major issues is the railroad station in Stamford. And I was able finally to get Mrs. Dole to agree to come up, and knew there was a great controversy with contractors and so forth. A lot of them were just sitting there - come up, begun the work, and that station should be completed - a loan, but it's a revolving thing. But nonetheless, she was interested and lent support on the issues involving National Airport. Who was going to own the National Airport? The State of Virginia or the State of Maryland and so forth? And I felt that the State of Virginia probably had a better case to make, since it was in Virginia, but nonetheless the votes were going to be difficult to count on that kind of a question. If Paul Sarbanes asks me one more time whether or not that Stamford railroad station is complete, one more than that, he's going to lose my vote every time, be in trouble. So we are making efforts and taking leadership and really trying to come up with financing for an important part of that transportation issue. South Africa Q. Could I pose some short questions. . . . Do you support economic sanctions against South Africa? EDDY: Yes, I do. But I must add to that, if you will allow me to, I do not support, would not have supported the present, what I consider more radical, sanctions that have been actually voted into law. . . I would have taken a more moderate position and I think I would have come down more on where the President appeared to come down. . . . DODD: . . . I supported the sanctions bill that was adopted this year by the Senate, and it was sustained -rather we overrode the Presidential veto on that issue. I feel that what we asked for there was reasonable. This is a nation that wants to be perceived as part of the family of Western democracies. It does not see itself as a totalitarian or authoritarian government. I think that's a central point in the debate on South Africa that doesn't often get discussed. 'Star Wars' Q. . . . Do you support research for the Strategic Defense Initiative? EDDY: Absolutely, yes. DODD: Yes, not at the levels the President wants. Equal Rights Q. Do you support the equal rights amendment? DODD: Yes. EDDY: Yes. Abortion Q. Do you support Federal funds to pay for an abortion? DODD: Yes. EDDY: Yes. Federal Taxes Q. Would you support a Federal tax increase to help cut the deficit? EDDY: No. DODD: You've got to tell me what kind of a tax. I don't rule it out. Closing Statements Q. . . . I want to give you each your final two minutes to either go back to a point or summarize your views, or use them however you will . . . DODD: Well, I'll just take that last point . . . what tax? I mean are you going to talk about a gasoline tax, a consumption tax. Are you going to talk about increases in brackets, broadening base? There's a variety of things that can be done. . . . I think to take a position of absolutely no tax increase without considering all the implications of that is a mistaken position to take without assessing what they are. I just come back to what we sort of started on this. It's always these incumbents are running and so forth. It gets egomaniacal, I suppose, to some extent. But I happen to believe the best test of whether or not a person ought to be returned to office - the incumbent, the burden of incumbency - is really the question of effectiveness . . . We're talking about a national-international agenda, but also having enough balance about it that you're not walking away from the problems of your state or your region. I think I've been a good regional senator. When issues involved the City of New York, the state, the New England region generally, I've tried to be a cooperative member. I don't see us as engaging in some of the parochial contests that can oftentimes happen. But if it's Long Island Sound or our transportation networks, the pollution question and so forth, I think I've been a good cooperative member of my delegation, along with those of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and the like. . . . EDDY: . . . 1988 in particular, but even this year, is going to be, I think, a watershed. It's going to be the direction that the State of Connecticut, the whole nation, takes, insofar as national defense issues and also domestic fiscal matters. And here is where Mr. Dodd and I generally are in disagreement. I think that he represents, and you know, the Senate is involved here, the control of the Senate is involved, the direction of the Government. We're very definitely at a watershed position. How are we going to go? Are we going to go backward? Are we going to go back to the policies, which, in my opinion, did bring us to the very brink of national low morale, with all the other things you heard about - high inflation, high unemployment, a feeling that we were no longer moving, that we were no longer what we should be in this country? Or are we going to continue on a direction, which I approve of, which this Administration has made? Now I represent, I think, the future - even though there's quite a difference in our age. . . . I think I represent the ''keep going,'' the ''keep going'' of returning this government to the genius of America, which was to let the local government, the people there, do what they can possibly do and the Federal Government become involved only when it becomes obvious that the problem cannot be solved in that. That's what this election is all about. It contains national defense issues, as our peacekeeping role, and domestic national issues on our overall direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STAKES ARE HIGH IN SUFFOLK HOUSE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/nyregion/stakes-are-high-in-suffolk-house-race.html,"GREGORY J. BLASS and George J. Hochbrueckner, the Republican and Democratic candidates for the House seat from the First Congressional District in Suffolk County, have had at last 25 joint appearances and debates. But there has been little heat and few major differences between them. ''It really comes down to the voters having a pretty good choice,'' said Mr. Hochbrueckner, a former state assemblyman. ''It's coming down to who's the more effective and the more responsive,'' said Mr. Blass, the Presiding Officer of the Suffolk County Legislature. The low-key responses of the two candidates belie the intensity and the significance of their campaign for the seat being vacated by Representative William Carney, who is rarely mentioned by either of his would-be successors. Mr. Carney, after serving four terms, was persuaded by Suffolk Republican leaders to step aside because of their fears that his less than all-out opposition to the opening of the Shoreham nuclear plant would result in his defeat. That is part of the significance of the House contest. If the 37-year-old Mr. Blass loses, Democrats will control all three of the House seats in Suffolk County, a situation that William M. Blake, the Suffolk Republican leader, has acknowledged could jeopardize his leadership. His potential successor, Walter Hazlitt, the Brookhaven Town Republican chairman, also has a stake in the contest because Brookhaven makes up at least half the Congressional district. The other two Suffolk Democrats in the House, Thomas J. Downey of the Second District in Suffolk, and Robert J. Mrazek, whose Third District stretches along the North Shore of Suffolk and into Nassau County, are strong favorites to win re-election. Also heavily favored are two Nassau Republican Congressmen, Norman F. Lent and Raymond J. McGrath, and a Queens Democrat, James H. Scheuer, whose district juts into the Great Neck area. Both Mr. Blass and Mr. Hochbrueckner say that the Island turnout will be critical this year, when many politicians predict that statewide turnout will be low because of the widespread perception that Governor Cuomo and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato are strong favorites to win re-election. Mr. Hochbrueckner, having confronted the Reagan tide in 1984 when he unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Carney, is looking for a favorable wave this year from Governor Cuomo. But Mr. Blass is looking to Senator D'Amato to help propel his fellow Republican into office. Mr. Blake had openly promoted Mr. Blass for the House seat because he was considered a strong candidate. In addition, his position as Presiding Officer of the Legislature could become part of the Republican bargaining over a county executive nomination next year. Mr. Blass, of Jamesport, was elected Presiding Officer late last year over Mr. Blake's opposition. A Blass loss would leave him as Presiding Officer, but facing for a contest for re-election in January. The 48-year-old Mr. Hochbrueckner, who was a five-term Assemblyman before he challenged Mr. Carney in 1984, has said that another defeat would end his political career. The First District contest is also significant because the Conservative and Right to Life Parties, which combined produced nearly 8 percent of the vote for Mr. Carney two years ago, have gone their own way - making Mr. Blass's job more difficult. Mr. Carney, aided by President Reagan's coattails, won 53 percent of the vote against Mr. Hochbrueckner in 1984. The Conservative candidate is Dominic J. Santoro of Rocky Point, the Brookhaven Town Conservative leader, who objected to Mr. Blass's selection because of his anti-Shoreham position. William J. Doyle of Shirley is the Right to Life candidate. Republicans have a 2-to-1 enrollment edge over Democrats in the district (46 percent to 23 percent), but independents are also a sizable factor - about 25 percent of the registration. The First District includes the eastern half of Smithtown, Brookhaven and the five East End towns. Before Mr. Carney's first election, in 1978, the district was represented by a Democrat, Otis G. Pike, for many years, a point that Mr. Hochbrueckner often raises. ''People have to be reminded that Democrats don't have two heads,'' he said. If Democrats do not t have two heads, they do have more money in the district. Mr. Hochbrueckner expects to spend at least $300,000, and Mr. Blass at least $200,000. Unions are a major source of Hochbrueckner funds and workers, while Mr. Blass is relying heavily on business and Republican Party money and workers. Vice President Bush has campaigned with Mr. Blass and Representative Tony Coelho of California, chairman of the House Democratic Campaign Committee, campaigned for a second time with Mr. Hochbrueckner last week. Mr. Coelho has also brought money - $35,000 from the campaign committee. Mr. Blake is actively involved in the Blass campaign and has enlisted Arthur Finkelstein for polling and Richard Bond as a political consultant. Both serve year-round as consultants to Mr. Blake. Although both candidates are in effect trying to ''sell'' their personalities in their mailings, radio advertising amounting to about $9,000 a week for each man and hundreds of public appearances, there are some differences on issues. Mr. Blass is a strong supporter of the Reagan Administration, which his polls indicate is popular in the district. He maintains that the United States should continue its research into antimissile space defenses, known as ''Star Wars.'' Mr. Hochbrueckner has called the program ''a tremendous waste of money.'' Mr. Hochbrueckner says that the United States should abide by the SALT II agreement limiting nuclear arms. But Mr. Blass maintains that the Soviet Union has not complied with the agreement and the United States should continue its ''buildup to a better bargaining position.'' They also differ on American aid to the anti-government forces in Nicaragua, known as the contras. Mr. Blass supports providing material aid but not troops. Mr. Hochbrueckner opposes both. Mr. Blass supported the idea of a Federal death penalty for drug dealers whose drugs cause a death, a legislative provision that was rejected by Congress. Mr. Hochbrueckner opposes the death penalty in all cases. Mr. Hochbrueckner opposes abortion. Mr. Blass says that ''government should not ban abortion.'' Both are Roman Catholics. Each candidate argues that he has been a more vigorous opponent of Shoreham, but privately they both agree that the plant, which is in the First District, is probably not a substantial issue in the race now. Both have independent anti-Lilco lines on the ballot. The ad hoc ''parties'' are the Public Power Alternative to Lilco, which supports Mr. Hochbrueckner, and the Concerned Citizens Against Lilco, backing Mr. Blass. Mr. Hochbrueckner is one of three Suffolk Democratic Assemblymen consistently elected in Republican districts. He gave up almost certain re-election to a sixth term in 1984 to challenge Mr. Carney. A native Long Islander, he attended the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Hofstra University, but did not graduate. He parlayed electronic training in the Navy into what he calls a career as a ''mustang engineer'' - someone who ''came up the hard way.'' He has been vice president of an electronics firm since he left the Assembly. He and his wife, Carol Ann, have four children. They live in Coram. Mr. Blass is also a Long Island native. A graduate of Fordham College and Fordham Law School, he too served in the Navy. He was first elected to the County Legislature in 1979 and is a practicing lawyer as well as a legislator. His wife, Barbara, operates a direct-mail marketing concern.

THE NATION; Meese Dissents On the High Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/weekinreview/the-nation-meese-dissents-on-the-high-court.html,"Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d extended his constitutional critique in a new direction, aiming at what he called an ''astonishing'' arrogation of power by the Supreme Court and at those who place its rulings ''on a par with the Constitution itself.'' A High Court decision, he said in a speech at Tulane University in New Orleans, ''does not establish a 'supreme law of the land' that is binding on all persons and parts of Government, henceforth and forevermore.'' Many legal scholars - including some who agreed with Mr. Meese that the Court in a 1958 ruling used overly sweeping language in calling its 1954 desegregation decision ''the supreme law of the land'' - expressed concern that his statements could be taken as encouraging defiance of Court rulings. Disregarding their status as law would ''shake the foundations of our system,'' said Eugene C. Thomas, president of the American Bar Association. A Meese spokesman said later that the Attorney General was advocating dissent only ''in a responsible fashion'' -seeking a constitutional amendment, for example. Leading the Reagan Administration's efforts to shrink the role of the courts in setting national policy, Mr. Meese has in the past accused the judiciary of usurping legislative powers and of using the Constitution as ''an empty vessel into which each generation may pour its passion and prejudice.'' Instead, he believes, the courts should defer to elected officials on such issues as abortion and affirmative action unless laws clearly conflict with the ''original intentions'' of the Constitution's framers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CUOMO AND O'ROURKE: WHAT EACH PLEDGES TO DO IF ELECTED; REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE STRESSES COMBATING DRUGS AS TOP PRIORITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/27/nyregion/cuomo-o-rourke-what-each-pledges-if-elected-republican-candidate-stresses.html,"Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate for governor, has established three priorities if he is elected - combating drugs, making the state economically competitive with its neighbors, and creating jobs. ''The first and major priority is to do something about the problem of narcotics with drug education and direct prosecution,'' Mr. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, said in an interview last week devoted to a look forward on issues. His second priority, he said, would be a $2.4 billion state tax cut over three years to ''make New York competitive with neighboring states.'' He said Connecticut and New Jersey have been siphoning jobs and business from New York and have half the state's unemployment rate, which is now 6 percent. To create jobs, Mr. O'Rourke's third goal, he has proposed establishing a commission to coordinate Federal and state economic development programs and has called for state subsidies to encourage industry in depressed areas such as the South Bronx and inner-city sections of upstate cities. Mr. O'Rourke has spent much of his campaign talking about what he calls the Governor's reluctance to debate him. But he has also released 16 papers that constitute his assessment of the state of the state. Many of the papers were released with little fanfare. Last week in Albany, at the end of a news conference that concentrated on debates, Mr. O'Rourke, almost as an afterthought, pulled out a paper on governmental authorities and quickly summed it up. Other papers have been released upstate and received little attention downstate, or released downstate and largely ignored. The papers borrow heavily, Mr. O'Rourke acknowledged, from the 1982 campaign of Lewis E. Lehrman, the Republican candi-date who was defeated by Mr. Cuomo. Richard Behn, who said he wrote the O'Rourke papers, was a key figure in the Lehrman campaign, too. Mr. O'Rourke spent most of the weekend campaigning upstate at a time when most statewide candidates are concentrating on the more populous downstate region. ''Our major thrust is upstate,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. He said he expected a low turnout of voters in New York City next Tuesday. Other Republicans say Mr. O'Rourke is trying to shore up his Republican strength upstate to avert a possible rout on Election Day. Crime and Drugs Among Mr. O'Rourke's suggestions are what he called ''one of the most comprehensive proposals on crime and drugs.'' He has suggested that convicted felons be denied release on bail, pending appeal and sentencing within 60 days. He also has proposed what he called ''shock incarceration'' for first-offense drug dealers and people convicted of nonviolent offenses. They could serve 90-day, hard-labor terms as an alternative to state prison, he said, to ''build up discipline, self-esteem and perseverance.'' He supports legislation to give crime victims a greater role in sentencing and parole-board deliberations. He also favors a state constitutional amendment permitting disclosure of circumstances surrounding pardon and commutation applications, which are now kept secret. And he supports the death penalty for premeditated murder. Mr. O'Rourke often talks, especially upstate, about the allegations of municipal corruption in New York City. He has urged the Governor to appoint a special prosecutor for such cases to supersede the Democratic district attorneys in New York City. His contention is that Democratic prosecutors are investigating fellow Democrats, including political leaders who helped sponsor their careers. On drugs, Mr. O'Rourke said, ''We must send a message to drug dealers - deal crack and you deal yourself a prison term.'' He said the state needed 25 more judges to handle drug cases. Death Penalty He favors the death penalty in cases in which the acts of drug pushers can be directly linked to a fatality and wants mandatory drug education starting in first grade. He said that if elected, he would create a state drug enforcement agency to coordinate all anti-drug activities. He also favors more state funds for residential treatment centers and a crackdown on open sale of drug paraphernalia. Mr. O'Rourke has also proposed an economic growth commission to coordinate Federal and state economic development programs and to provide ''one-stop shopping for all business problems.'' Contending that New Yorkers pay far more state and local taxes than residents of neighboring states, he proposed the state tax cut and that the state match ''dollar for dollar'' the Federal Government tax revision measure, which he called a ''windfall.'' He is proposing two state income tax rates, 4 and 7 percent, and a sales-tax exemption on the first $75 worth of clothing a year purchased by a taxpayer. The maximum rate for next year for the state's income tax is now 9 percent for earned income and 13 percent for unearned income. He opposes abortion but, like Mr. Cuomo, accepts the Supreme Court decision permitting it. Unlike the Governor, he has said he would seek repeal of state Medicaid financing of abortion. He has proposed an expanded ''workfare'' program, with the state providing, as it once did, 75 percent reimbursement to local welfare agencies for job placement for welfare recipients. He said he would end welfare payments for those refusing to work. He also supports a 90-day limit on home relief for employable adults. A Mental Health Survey He has called for a halt to deinstitutionalizing the mentally ill, saying this would help reduce the number of homeless. He has also urged a survey of 73,000 released mental health patients to determine their needs. He said he would seek separate Metropolitan Transportation Authority boards for Long Island, the northern suburbs and New York City transit operations and would make the M.T.A. directly accountable to the governor. On education, Mr. O'Rourke said the governor, rather than the Legislature, should appoint members of State Board of Regents. He has favored appointment of an inspector general for education to survey school systems ''to determine what is working and what isn't in our education programs.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REAGAN DUE TO HELP IDAHO REPUBLICAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/27/us/reagan-due-to-help-idaho-republican.html,"The Republican heavy artillery will come to Idaho next week to try to shove Senator Steven D. Symms's re-election campaign out of a deadlock and into the winners' column. Despite the Senator's advantages of incumbency, a solid Republican electorate, and plenty of money to run a campaign, Gov. John V. Evans, the Democratic candidate, has Mr. Symms against the wall, in one of the handful of races likely to decide control of the Senate. President Reagan and Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, the general chairman of the national Republican Party, will be here to help Senator Symms next week. And his home-state colleague in the Senate, James A. McClure, who is immensely popular here, will take Mr. Symms around Idaho in nine major campaign events to urge voters to re-elect him. With polls on both sides showing the race an even match, the campaign has turned bitter. The candidates called each other liars when they debated Thursday night on a statewide public television network. Mr. Symms, who will spend about $3 million on his campaign, accused the Governor of sending out a fund-raising letter that ''called me Qaddafi's best friend in the United States Senate, a charge everyone knows to be a lie.'' 'Dishonest' Advertising The 48-year-old Senator also accused Mr. Evans of running advertisements that ''are totally distorting my record - totally dishonest, in my view.'' Governor Evans, 61, said that as he and his advisers planned his campaign, on which he will spend about $2 million, they looked back at Mr. Symms's victory over Senator Frank Church in 1980 and saw ''the dirtiest campaign in the history of the state of Idaho.'' ''We saw really the crucifixion of a senator who had served the state very well for 24 years,'' the Governor said. Mr. Symms, who had served eight years in the United States House of Representatives, won in 1980 with a margin of 4,262 votes, less than 1 percent of the total. Mr. Evans accused Mr. Symms of ''telling outright lies about my campaign positions'' in saying that the Governor supported free choice on abortion. Anti-abortion sentiment is high in Idaho, where 40 percent of the electorate is Mormon, and Governor Evans, who grew up in the Mormon Church, says he favors abortion ''only to save the life of the mother.'' No estimates were available of the audience for the debate, telecast during the fifth game of the World Series. A Saturday editorial in The Lewiston Morning Tribune took note of the debate's competition, saying: ''Evans left a lot of issues stranded on base. Symms booted a couple of hot ones and Evans probably came out a run or two on top with the eventual outcome of the series still in doubt.'' Attacks on Effectiveness Senator Symms says Governor Evans flip-flops on issues and has been ineffective. But the Governor says Mr. Symms has lost effectiveness in the Senate, because he is ''allied with those on the conservative fringe.'' The Democrat attacks votes against cost-of-living increases in Social Security checks cast by Senator Symms, who has advertised his endorsement by the National Alliance of Senior Citizens. Governor Evans says that group wants to phase out Social Security. ''Do you support that program?'' Mr. Evans asked in the debate. Mr. Symms quickly said, ''No, that is not my plan,'' and moved to another subject. Governor Evans called himself a ''plugger'' and said, ''I'm not comfortable in fast company.'' Senator Symms's style of life in Washington has been criticized by some here as ''fast track.'' Senator Symms said, ''I will continue to work for limited government, for free enterprise, for a strong national defense, and to support the President.'' Videotapes of the debate will be rebroadcast over the weekend by commercial stations in Spokane, Wash., which cover northern Idaho, and here in Boise. Peter Hart of Washington, a consultant and poll taker for Governor Evans, said his results show the two almost exactly even. Ed DeBolt of Washington, who does polling for Mr. Symms, said his figures show the Senator leading but that the statistical margin of error in the small sample wipes out the lead. Effect of Gubernatorial Race Mr. Evans will probably be helped by the campaign of a popular Democrat, Cecil Andrus, who is expected to be re-elected Governor. He held the job from 1971 until he resigned in 1977 to become Secretary of Interior. Mr. Andrus is considered to have a substantial lead over David Leroy, the Republican nominee, and he and Mr. Evans have campaigned as a ticket. Even though the governorship has been in Democratic hands since 1971, Idaho has a Republican majority. There are 28 Republican and 14 Democratic State Senators. The House of Representatives has 67 Republicans to 17 Democrats. Also on the ballot next month is an effort to overturn Idaho's law that prohibits requiring employees to join a union. Supporters of organized labor plan an extensive canvassing effort on Election Day that is expected to bring out voters who will support Governor Evans. Both Senate candidates have avoided discussing that ballot issue, and another that would establish a state lottery, and never mentioned them in their debate. In 1984 President Reagan got 72.4 percent of the Idaho vote, topped here among Presidential candidates only by the 78.1 percent for William Jennings Bryan in 1896 when he spoke for free coinage of silver, a popular position in this silver-mining state. Bryan, the Democrat, lost to McKinley.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the New York Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/opinion/for-the-new-york-legislature.html,"New York voters will choose a new Legislature next Tuesday. Here are judgments on some close Senate and Assembly races. We also take note of some legislators who, while not pressed, warrant recognition as well as re-election. MANHATTAN Senators Roy Goodman, Republican-Liberal, 26th District; Manfred Ohrenstein, Democrat-Liberal, 27th District, and Franz Leichter (D-L), 28th District, are veterans who have served with distinction and deserve re-election. In Assembly races we favor, though seldom agree with, Jerrold Nadler (D-L), 67th District; and commend, among others, Alexander (Pete) Grannis (D-L), 65th District; Mark Siegel (D-L), 66th District, and John Brian Murtaugh (D-L), 72d District. BROOKLYN In the 23d Senate District, while we differ with the incumbent, Christopher Mega, Republican-Conservative, on issues like Medicaid funding for abortion, he is well and widely informed and a narrow choice over the challenger, Joseph Montalto (D-L). In the 48th Assembly District we favor the incumbent, Dov Hikind (D), a thoughtful full-time legislator, over the personable Andrew Yiannakos (R-C). In the 56th and 57th Districts we favor the more experienced incumbents, Albert Vann (D) and Roger Green (D), both running on the Liberal line after being ruled out of the Democratic primary. They are opposed by Robert Hunter (D) and Stanley Frere (D), respectively. Other distinguished Assembly members likely to win deserved re-election include Rhoda Jacobs (D-L), 42d District; Daniel Feldman (D), 45th District; Joseph Lentol (D), 50th District; Eileen Dugan (D-L), 52d District; and William Boyland (D-L), 55th District. QUEENS Senator Martin Knorr (R-C-Right to Life), 15th District, has served faithfully and continuously since 1969. We nevertheless favor a lively newcomer, Frank Sansivieri Jr. (D), a junior high school teacher who has twice run for local office in opposition to the Queens organization. In the 25th Assembly district we favor the incumbent, Douglas Prescott, (R-C-Right to Life), over his promising challenger, Douglas MacKay (D). Assemblyman Prescott offers experience in a legislator's role. We favor Morton Hillman (D), a dedicated community worker, in the 26th District, and Joseph Crowley (D), winner of a hotly contested Democratic primary, in the 30th District. In the 38th District we endorse John Imperiale (R-C), a bank vice president with long community service and constructive views on state government, over the incumbent, Frederick Schmidt (D-Right to Life). Other incumbents appear sure of re-election, among them such conscientious legislators as Alan Hevesi (D), 28th District. BRONX We favor incumbent Senators Olga Mendez (D-L), in the 30th District; Israel Ruiz Jr. (D-L), in the 32d; Abraham Bernstein (D-L), in the 33d, and Guy Velella (R-C-Right to Life) in the 34th. In the Assembly, incumbents who especially deserve to be returned to office include Jose Serrano (D-L) in the 73d District; Gloria Davis (D) in the 78th; George Friedman (D-L), in the 79th; and G. Oliver Koppell (D-L) in the 80th. STATEN ISLAND Senator John Marchi (R-D-L) seems certain to win richly deserved re-election in the 24th District. In the 60th Assembly District we favor Robert Straniere (R-C-Right to Life), an incumbent since 1981, over his environmentalist challenger, Dorothy Landau (D). NASSAU COUNTY In the ninth Senatorial District we prefer Dean Skelos (R-C) to Carol Berman (D-L), who seeks to regain the seat that Senator Skelos won from her in 1984. Ms. Berman has concentrated effectively on consumer and environmental issues, but Senator Skelos earns the test of another term. In the 15th Assembly District, incumbency favors Daniel Frisa (R-C), though Robert Zimmerman (D) offers bright promise. In the 16th we support Thomas DiNapoli (D-L) over Eric Engelhardt (R-C) for the seat just given up by the outstanding May Newberger. WESTCHESTER COUNTY In the 35th Senatorial District, in a close call, we favor Assemblyman Nicholas Spano (R-C), an experienced state legislator, over Andrew MacDonald (D), a lawyer who has served effectively on the Yonkers City Council.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO PRESSED FOR A DECISION ON TV DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/nyregion/cuomo-pressed-for-a-decision-on-tv-debate.html,"Governor Cuomo, pressed repeatedly yesterday for a decision, declined to commit himself to participating -or not participating - in the only television debate of the gubernatorial campaign, scheduled for Saturday. Two candidates - Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican, and Denis E. Dillon of the Right to Life Party -withdrew over the weekend from the debate to protest the inclusion of Dr. Lenora B. Fulani of the New Alliance Party, a group they accused of extremist views. Dr. Fulani had been invited on Friday at the request of Governor Cuomo's campaign. But shortly after her inclusion was announced, Jewish groups raised questions, pointing out that the New Alliance Party had endorsed several of the teachings of the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the Black Muslim minister whom the groups called anti-Semitic. Mr. Cuomo said yesterday that he had received a telegram from Dr. Fulani in which she said she did not endorse all the teachings of Mr. Farrakhan. The Governor said that, in response, his campaign had sent a telegram asking her if she joined him in condemning the minister ''on his anti-Semitism.'' 'Something I Will Not Do' Until he receives a reply, Mr. Cuomo said, he cannot make a decision on debating her. Dr. Fulani, reached for comment last night, said she had not yet drafted a reply. She added, however, that ''since the controversy began, I have been called upon to refute my support for Minister Farrakhan - something I will not do.'' Dr. Fulani said that ''Mr. Cuomo, who has differences with the Catholic church, is not asked to repudiate the Pope, even though many regard the church's position on abortion as anti-woman.'' Most of yesterday afternoon, the Governor's top political advisers met at the midtown law office of Mr. Cuomo's son, Andrew, to decide what to do about the politically difficult issue of the debate, which would include only the Governor and Dr. Fulani. If Mr. Cuomo goes ahead with it, he leaves himself open to criticism by Jewish groups. If he cancels, he will be rejecting the very candidate he had requested to be invited. Late yesterday, a solution politically acceptable to the Governor seemed at hand when, with the strong support of the Cuomo campaign, some officials of public television, the debate sponsor, proposed canceling the debate and scheduling instead individual interviews with all four candidates. But last evening, that proposal was rejected by David Hepp, the producer of the ''Inside Albany'' program that organized the debate.''The Governor is the one who has to make the decision, just as the other candidates made a decision,'' Mr. Hepp said. ''Does he want to debate Fulani or not?'' Mr. Hepp said he would agree to the interview format only if the Governor formally withdrew from a Fulani debate. Dr. Fuliani, a research psychologist, ran for Mayor last year as a candidate of the the New Alliance Party. Earlier yesterday, the American Jewish Committee, a human-rights group, issued a statement intended to discourage the Governor from debating Dr. Fulani. It urged ''major party figures to refrain from structuring their debates so that greater notoriety or attention comes to groups like the New Alliance Party,'' which it said advocated bigotry. Besides the public-broadcasting session, the only other debate of the gubernatorial campaign is scheduled for Thursday, at The New York Times. Dr. Fulani was not invited to attend because The Times invites only candidates of major parties that have permanent ballot spots as a result of having obtained at least 50,000 votes in the last election. Craig R. Whitney, an assistant managing editor of The Times, said television coverage would be permitted under a ''pool'' arrangement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KREMLIN RESUMES ISSUING KEY DATA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/world/kremlin-resumes-issuing-key-data.html,"After years of withholding data on child mortality, the Soviet Union has resumed publishing figures on this key social indicator. The Soviet Union is also again announcing the size of its grain harvests, after a five-year silence. These are among statistics that are again being released, either in the annual statistical yearbook or in newspapers, after years of silence. The new figures on infant mortality, published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta, show that the Soviet level has remained at more than twice the Western level. Publication of the data had ended in 1974, when the rate began to rise sharply. Soviet grain figures were last issued for 1980. Thereafter, they were omitted, apparently in an effort to conceal poor crops. The new figures prove to be within 1 percent of the estimates made for the Soviet harvests by the United States Department of Agriculture. Many statistics that used to be given, such as regional data for coal, oil, gas and steel output, remain secret. But the partial relaxation appears to be part of a policy of greater openness by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. Brezhnev Stagnation Pointed Up The renewed disclosure of some statistics may also be intended to reflect on the economic stagnation under Leonid I. Brezhnev in the late 1970's and early 1980's, and to illustrate gains made under Mr. Gorbachev. The statistical relaxation was pointed up this month in an interview that the newspaper Izvestia had with Mikhail A. Korolev, chief of the Central Statistical Administration. ''No matter how bitter the truth may be,'' Mr. Korolev said. ''it is, of course, better that half-truths that try to cut sensitive corners.'' In the interview, Izvestia referred to the Soviet habit of comparing current economic performance with 1913, the last peacetime year before World War I. The Government newspaper recalled a line from Arkadi Raikin, the Soviet satirist: ''I hear we're doing better than in 1913. That's pretty good.'' Some of the new statistics suggest results from Mr. Gorbachev's anti-alcoholism drive. The statistical yearbook for the first time gives data on the consumption of vodka and other hard liquors. It was 2.81 billion liters in 1984 and 2.38 billion in 1985, or roughly 8.5 liters per person. A liter is about a quart. Effect of Anti-Alcohol Drive The latest issue of Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said that since June 1985, when sales of vodka were reduced, deaths from accidents, poisoning and injuries fell by 24 percent. The paper also said that there had been 100,000 fewer deaths from blood-circulation disorders, a reduction attributed largely to the drive against drinking. Izvestia said recently that output of wines and spirits was down by 35 percent and that people had spent 8.5 billion rubles ($11.9 billion) less on alcohol in the first nine months of 1986 compared with the same period last year. On child mortality, the data show that 26 infants out of 1,000 died before their first birthday in 1985. The figures for 1983 and 1984 were 25.3 and 25.9. They showed some improvement over the previously reported figure of 27.9 for 1974. Rates in the West Are Lower The rate for the United States was 10.5 in 1985, and for Japan, 6. In developing countries, the rate ranges from 50 in China to 194 in Afghanistan. Child mortality rates are considered one of the barometers of a society's development and well-being. In the first 50 years of Soviet history they declined rapidly, reaching a low of 22.9 in 1971. But then they turned upward. The official Soviet explanation is that the increase reflected improved statistical reporting. But a 1980 study by two American experts, Christopher Davis and Murray Feshbach, found the Soviet explanation ''unconvincing'' and contended that the rise was more likely the result of factors such as alcoholism among women, a high abortion rate, pollution, influenza epidemics, housing shortages and the large proportion of Soviet women who work. In any case, the new figures indicate that the rate has remained high, suggesting that the factors causing the increase have not been eliminated. At the same time, Soviet figures have indicated a moderate success for a program in effect since 1983 to raise birth rates, centered on initiatives for mothers to have more than one child. High Differential in Births The incentive program reflects concern over a flagging birth rate in the European part of the country, although rates among the Moslem peoples of Central Asia have soared. The program provided benefits for additional children, increased maternity leaves and guaranteed apartments for couples with children. In 1983, the first year that the program was in effect, the birth rate rose to 19.8 per 1,000 residents from 18.3. It was 19.6 in 1984 and 19.4 in 1985, and according to the Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta, was at a similar level this year. By comparison, the birth rate in the United States has dropped steadily, and was at 15.7 in 1983. The grain harvest figures newly published by Moscow showed that the harvest last year was 191.7 million metric tons, a decent crop by the standards of recent years but short of the planned goal of an average annual crop of 238 million tons in 1981 to 1985. The figures were 172.6 million tons for 1984, 192.2 million for 1983, 186.8 million for 1982, and 158.2 million in 1981.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TALKING POLITICS; Religion and Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/us/talking-politics-religion-and-politics.html,"''Ever think about what's important to you? It's probably simple - a steady job, a healthy family and a personal relationship with Christ. That's the easy part.'' So begins a new radio commercial sponsored by the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. It is one of several targeted radio spots Republicans will air in effort to spur a heavy voter turnout among two of the party's key constituency groups, born-again Christians and young people. David Narsavage, a spokesman for the committee, said that contrary to the conventional political wisdom, many young voters were not turned off by the conservative social agenda of Republicans. The commercial continues: ''Every day decisions are made that affect your life - decisions that say, it's O.K. to sell pornography, but it's not O.K. to pray in public schools; decisions that seem to protect the criminals more than they help the victims of crime. Who makes those decisions? Why, everybody. This is the stuff of everyday politics, whether abortion should be subsidized by the Government, whether we are going to get serious about the people peddling drugs in our schools.'' Mr. Narsavage said the radio ad, which does not mention either political party, will begin running today on stations with Christian-oriented programming in Alabama, North Carolina and Florida, states where Republican senators face tough re-election battles. ''It's aimed primarily at younger voters,'' he said, ''but we like to spread out net a little wide, and hopefully, it will influence other voters as well.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHITE WINS BLACK SUPPORT IN DETROIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/29/us/white-wins-black-support-in-detroit.html,"On a recent Sunday, Mayor Coleman A. Young toured churches on Detroit's east side, trying to persuade their all-black congregations that they should vote for a white suburbanite for Governor rather than a black resident of the inner city. On the face of it, it would appear to be a hard task. But Mr. Young drew a chorus of ''amens'' at St. James Missionary Baptist Church and other churches when he denounced William Lucas, a Republican who is black, as the candidate of a party ''that wants to dismantle affirmative action and the Civil Rights Commission and favors apartheid in South Africa.'' And Gov. James J. Blanchard, a Democrat who is white, received a similarly favorable response when he declared, ''Government has a duty to be a force for good, to invest in schools, to make sure there is opportunity for all.'' Despite Mr. Lucas's appeal to ''make history'' by making him the nation's first black Governor, Mr. Blanchard is far ahead among both white and black voters, according to recent polls. Governor Has 30-Point Lead The most recent poll, commissioned by The Detroit News and conducted Oct. 15-18, showed 55 percent of the voters favoring the Governor and 25 percent supporting Mr. Lucas, with 17 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Polls commissioned by other news organizations in the state are reporting similar results. This is bad news for Mr. Lucas, the executive of Wayne County, which includes Detroit and some suburbs. His strategy was based on holding the normal Republican vote outside Detroit and drawing 30 to 40 percent of the usually solid Democratic black vote in the city. The black vote can be critical in a close election. In 1982, Mr. Blanchard lost the rest of the state but won by 205,000 votes on the strength of a 250,000-vote margin in Wayne County. Mr. Blanchard appears to be the beneficiary of the state's improved economy. Unemployment was close to 16 percent when he was elected to the governorship in 1982; now it is under 8 percent. Economic Development Stressed Mr. Blanchard has made economic development the centerpiece of his administration, and it appears to be paying off in a state that has painful memories of mass layoffs and plant closings in the recession of the early 1980's. Mr. Blanchard's embrace of economic development and his theme, ''working together for Michigan,'' appears to be attracting voters who would normally vote Republican while keeping his Democratic base intact. Some prominent businessmen in the state, including Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, have endorsed his re-election. The Governor wooed and won the assembly plant that Mazda, the Japanese auto maker, had decided to build in the United States. He has also encouraged Japanese auto parts suppliers to open operations in Michigan. Together with Mayor Young, Mr. Blanchard came up with enough money and inducements to persuade Chrysler to build a new assembly plant in Detroit near the old Jefferson Avenue plant, which is scheduled to be torn down. Chrylser's decision is expected to save the city several thousand jobs. Campaign in Search of a Focus Mr. Lucas maintains that the state's improved fortunes are a result of the national economic recovery led by President Reagan, but Governor Blanchard seems to have convinced a lot of people that actions by the state are responsible for the current relative prosperity. Mr. Lucas, largely deprived of the economic issue by Mr. Blanchard, has struggled to find a focus for his campaign. He has won the support of anti-abortion groups with his outright opposition to abortion but has made little headway with calls for lower taxes and a tougher stance on crime. Moreover, while black voters have often demonstrated their willingness to support white candidates, both nationwide and in Michigan, white voters have generally not reciprocated. Although few white voters outside of the Detroit area have talked openly about the issue, Mr. Lucas's race could be a factor in his poor showing in the polls. Mr. Lucas disputes the polls, particularly the one reporting on black attitudes. ''I'll get my votes in the privacy of the voting booth,'' he said recently, noting that he won more than 90 percent of the black votes in Detroit in previous elections. Young's Support Seen as Vital But Mayor Young is the most powerful political figure in Detroit. And while relations between him and the Governor have been cool, the Mayor's willingness to campaign with Mr. Blanchard apparently means the Democratic organization in Detroit will work enthusiastically for the statewide ticket, something that has not always happened in the past. people who follow Michigan politics closely say Mr. Lucas has been troubled from the outset by a disorganized, fractious campaign staff and the continuing need to raise money. Under Michigan law, candidates for Governor who accept public campaign funds are held to a spending limit of $1.2 million, so Mr. Lucas will not enjoy the financial advantage of many Republican candidates. Just how powerful a factor money can be was demonstrated in the Republican primary here Aug. 5, when Richard Chrysler, a wealthy businessman who is no relation to the automobile family, came close to defeating Mr. Lucas by spending $3 million of his own money on advertising. Mr. Lucas has received $750,000 in state funds but has been forced to take time from campaigning to raise the $450,000 in private contributions that the law permits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SENATE HOPEFULS USE TV TO POLISH THEIR IMAGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/29/nyregion/senate-hopefuls-use-tv-to-polish-their-images.html,"Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato released a new television commercial yesterday, a montage of him, set to music, appearing in different parts of the state, talking with people, playing football with his sons. Mr. D'Amato's advisers call it ''a feel-good spot.'' Mark Green, the Democratic challenger, also unveiled a new television commercial yesterday, a 30-second spot flashing newspaper headlines that highlight Mr. Green's repeated charges that Mr. D'Amato has tailored his Senate votes to please large contributors and has accepted campaign donations from people with ties to organized crime. Mr. Green's aides call it ''a hit-him-in-the-gut spot.'' With one week left in New York's Senate race, the incumbent Republican and his rival are polishing the images they think will win over the state's electorate. And they are focusing on television as a key way to get that image across. Summing Up The latest commercials reflect the strategies the candidates employed in their two debates and their general approach during this campaign: Mr. D'Amato reinforcing, through images, that he is the Senator who ''gets things done for New York,'' and Mr. Green challenging the incumbent's record and his ethics. Mr. D'Amato's commercial is the seventh the campaign has run and it is meant ''to sum up, in mood, the theme of the campaign,'' said Mr. D'Amato's campaign manager, Rick Nasti. The earlier commercials focused more specifically on Mr. D'Amato's activities. One showed him sitting with Clara Hale, a Harlem grandmother who cares for the children of drug addicts and who was honored by President Reagan for her efforts. One emphasized his work on the Helsinki Commission. Another, meant to capture the Democratic vote, showed a taxi driver, who said he did not vote for Mr. D'Amato in 1980, endorsing him this year. None of the commercials have mentioned Mr. Green or defended the Senator's record against the Democratic challenger's accusations. Citing Differences Mr. Green's staff has put together three commercials, only one of which does not mention Mr. D'Amato. The first spot that aired features Governor Cuomo speaking over still photographs of Mr. Green, calling Mr. Green a ''champion'' and urging his election. That spot is intended to underscore Mr. Cuomo's support of Mr. Green and to encourage the coattail effect of the popular Governor, according to a spokesman for Mr. Green, Randy Daniels. In the second commercial, Mr. Green looks into the camera and outlines the differences between him and the incumbent on several issues, including abortion and handgun control. But the newest commercial - which lays out, through the use of actual newspaper headlines, accusations that Mr. Green has made about contributors to Mr. D'Amato's campaign - demonstrates best the tactic Mr. Green believes will win the campaign for him. ''I call it a Paul Revere ad,'' Mr. Green said. ''I want to tell the public Al D'Amato is coming and I want to warn them about his record.'' 'Can I Catch Him?' Mr. D'Amato's advisers said they plan to continue the steady stream of advertising they have done since the primary. With a campaign fund of $2.24 million as of Oct. 15, Mr. D'Amato has had the luxury of buying air time consistently during the campaign and, his staff said, he will step up the pace only slightly in this last week. According to Mr. Nasti, Mr. D'Amato had planned to spend about $1 million on television advertising for the final two to three weeks of the race. Mr. Nasti would not specify exactly how much of that money would be spent in the last week, but he said the campaign committee had the resources to spend more than the $1 million if necessary. For Mr. Green, this last week will be a media blitz compared with the earlier part of the campaign. A recent infusion of $100,000 from the national Democratic Party, $50,000 from the state party and projected receipts from two benefit concerts this weekend will allow him to spend about $400,000 buying television time over the next week, Mr. Green said. ''I'm pouring it on at the end,'' Mr. Green said. ''The question is can I catch him at the wire.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Topics: Blasts; Pro-Death,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/opinion/topics-blasts-pro-death.html,"Whoever planted a bomb in a flower pot at the Eastern Women's Center, an abortion clinic on the East side of Manhattan, thereby renounced any respect for life. Fortunately, the blast in the clinic waiting room early yesterday caused only property damage and minor injuries to two pedestrians.

Those claiming responsibility say they wish to do away with abortion, yet their method offers far more aid to their opponents. Though shaken, employees of the Eastern Women's Center opened it for business as usual yesterday, while those who oppose abortion are left to explain why some of their number are apparently willing to jeopardize public safety for the sake of their beliefs.

"BOMB EXPLODES AT ABORTION CLINIC IN MIDTOWN, INJURING 2 PASSERS-BY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/nyregion/bomb-explodes-at-abortion-clinic-in-midtown-injuring-2-passers-by.html,"A bomb exploded in a midtown Manhattan abortion clinic early yesterday morning, but the center opened later in the day. The device was hidden in a planter and went off at 1:30 A.M., gouging out a small hole in the ceiling of the waiting room of the Eastern Women's Center, at 40 East 30th Street. No one was in the clinic, but there were several workers in other parts of the building. Two men passing by were hit by glass, the police said. They were treated at hospitals and released. The bombing caused about $10,000 in damage, officials said. No Claim of Responsibility The police said that several phone calls to the bomb squad had warned of the attack, but that no one had claimed responsibility. As investigators searched for clues later in the morning, it was business as usual at the clinic, where about 260 abortions are performed each week. More than 50 patients arrived for appointments, and two anti-abortion activists, carrying graphic pictures of abortions, protested outside. Officials said they believed the device had been placed in the clinic during business hours because there was no sign of forced entry. The center was open until 5:30 P.M. on Tuesday. ''We always have bomb threats and all kinds of telephone threats,'' said the clinic's director, Barbara Methvin. ''It is sad that this will continue to occur, that people will have to use this way of dealing with a law that don't agree with.'' Mayor Koch said yesterday that the city was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Robert Creighton, special agent in New York for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the bomb was small and unsophisticated. He said his agency had investigated 45 abortion clinic bombings nationwide since 1982. Twenty-seven cases have been solved, he said. Pro-abortion activists say there have been as many as 85 attacks nationwide this year alone. A blast last Dec. 10 damaged the Manhattan Women's Medical Center, at 115 East 23d Street, another clinic where abortions are performed. There was a small fire but no one was hurt. Mr. Creighton said there appeared to be no link to that explosion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO'S DEBATE WITH O'ROURKE TO ENLIVEN RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/nyregion/cuomo-s-debate-with-o-rourke-to-enliven-race.html,"Five days before the election, the campaign for governor is still so low key that Governor Cuomo has not yet scheduled any formal political campaigning. And his Republican opponent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, is spending much of his remaining time in normally Republican suburbs and upstate and in radio and television interviews that cost him nothing. In what will be their first and very likely their only encounter in one of the most lethargic campaigns in years, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. O'Rourke will meet a third candidate, Nassau County District Attorney Denis E. Dillon, the Right to Life Party candidate, in a debate at The New York Times today. A television debate scheduled for Saturday was canceled when the Governor asked that the New Alliance Party candidate, Dr. Lenora Fulani, be included and the other two candidates declined to join a candidate from a splinter party that they said promoted anti-Semitic and racist views. The Governor, through a spokesman, Gary Fryer, yesterday refused an invitation by WRGB-TV in the Albany area to debate Saturday night. Mr. Cuomo has chosen not to campaign formally or to debate until now, while Mr. O'Rourke has been handicapped by a lack of money and polls indicating from the start that the Governor has an overwhelming lead. Advertising Budgets The disparity in campaign funds is evident in the final week's television and radio advertising and mail and telephone operations. The Governor, who is letting his advertising do most of his campaigning, is spending at least twice as much as Mr. O'Rourke. The Cuomo advertising for the last week is costing about $200,000, according to Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son and campaign chairman. That is a modest expenditure at a time when such advertising can run as high as $400,000 a week but not so modest as Mr. O'Rourke's $100,000. The two candidates are each spending about $50,000 for radio, as is Mr. Dillon. The level of Mr. Cuomo's advertising is by choice since the campaign has at least $4 million available. The excess funds will presumably be used for a Presidential campaign or a future state campaign. Mr. O'Rourke, who has raised only about $1.2 million, has less than $200,000 available for his final week of campaigning. Mailing and Telephone Campaign The Cuomo campaign is also continuing a large statewide mailing and telephone campaign targeted to about 2,000 swing districts from the 14,000 election districts in the state. Mr. O'Rourke's mailing, financed by the Republican State Committee, is to five of the state's 34 congressional districts. The O'Rourke television campaign is using his original commercial, which features Mr. O'Rourke in effect debating the cardboard cutout of the Governor. His radio campaign emphasizes his own record and views. The Cuomo advertising emphasizes his record. A newcomer to the list is a 10-second commercial that is to run this weekend. It features the Governor urging New Yorkers to vote, a message that is designed to counter what many politicians believe may be a very low turnout next Tuesday. The Dillon campaign theme is that people should not waste their vote on Mr. O'Rourke because the Governor will win anyway, while support for Mr. Dillon at least expresses opposition to abortion. Other than today's debate, Mr. Cuomo is keeping up his schedule of ostensibly nonpolitical governmental appearances and speechs on behalf of a proposal on the ballot for a $1.45 billion environmental bond issue. Mr. Fryer said the Governor might make an overtly political trip to western New York on Monday and might campaign for State Senate candidates in the metropolitan area over the weekend. Senate Democrats attempting to win a majority of the upper house have been critical of the Governor, arguing that his noncampaign strategy may help him but not nonincumbent Democratic candidates for the State Senate who need all the exposure they can get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BITTER DIOGUARDI-ABZUG RACE: SPICE FOR A BLAND BALLOT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/nyregion/bitter-dioguardi-abzug-race-spice-for-a-bland-ballot.html,"As Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi and his Democratic challenger, Bella S. Abzug, settled themselves around the microphones at WFAS Radio in Hartsdale for their second debate of the day, the station's sound technician, with a look of fear on his face, asked them please not to shout, he had a headache. ''This is going to be a very cordial debate,'' said the moderator, Norman Weil, as if uttering a warning rather than a prediction. In the course of the debates they have held in their campaign for the 20th Congressional District seat in Westchester County, cordial is a word that has not frequently come up. Hostile, perhaps, but not cordial. ''Bella has some strong beliefs, and she's certainly not unwilling to project them,'' Mr. DioGuardi said. ''I'm not one to shrink from that.'' In their joint appearances, they have learned to play off each other's jokes, caught each other's colds and developed a reputation for sharp, often acrimonious exchanges that both seemed to savor. In a campaign season in which debates between statewide candidates have been as infrequent as Soviet-American summit talks, Mr. DioGuardi and Ms. Abzug, have met 11 times. Most races have been ''as boring as possible,'' Mr. DioGuardi said. ''Maybe we have provided some entertainment.'' Beyond a shared appreciation for a good fight, though, Mr. DioGuardi and Ms. Abzug have little in common. He is a conservative Republican who supports military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels known as contras and development of the ''Star Wars'' defense system; she is a liberal Democrat who says no on both counts. She favors legalized abortion and an Equal Rights Amendment; he favors neither. Both candidates have tried to make political hay of their differences by portraying the other as an extremist who is out of step with the district. Essentially, what they are fighting over is who can best articulate the concerns of Westchester, a county known for its untroubled affluence but that also has a large population of urban poor in cities such as Yonkers and New Rochelle. Ms. Abzug, a lawyer and former Representative who this year moved back to the county after many years in Manhattan, has called a lack of affordable housing the county's No. 1 problem and has charged Mr. DioGuardi with failing to represent the needs of the more vulnerable residents of the district. ''If you look at Joe on most of the programs that are needed in this district, in education, in housing, to protect the seniors, in family planning and in women's issues, then you have to understand he is out of sync,'' Ms. Abzug said. Mr. DioGuardi, who frequently interrupts to exclaim ''Distortion!'' during Ms. Abzug's remarks, has labeled Ms. Abzug's views more in tune ''with the West Village and West Hollywood, not Westchester.'' In contrast, he has described himself as ''your next-door neighbor,'' a man who ''jogs around the neighborhood every morning'' to see whether everything is in order. Mr. DioGuardi, an accountant and a resident of the county for almost three decades, has called drugs the county's top problem and has made one of the major issues of the campaign a bill that Ms. Abzug co-sponsored in 1973 that would have made possession of small amounts of marijuana a civil offense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CUOMO AND RIVALS IN LOW-KEY DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/nyregion/cuomo-and-rivals-in-low-key-debate.html,"After months of long-distance campaigning in which they impugned each other's character and ethics, Governor Cuomo and Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke took it all back yesterday. The Governor and Mr. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate for governor, appeared with District Attorney Denis E. Dillon of Nassau County, the Right to Life Party candidate, in their only debate of the campaign, a 90-minute session at The New York Times. The debate produced disagreement on some issues but less heat than their repeated arguments over whether and how to debate - an issue that has dominated the campaign. The exchange was a snapshot of the campaign as a whole - Mr. Cuomo not making commitments, Mr. O'Rourke failing to engage him - that went a long way toward explaining why Mr. Cuomo holds a lead of 50 percentage points in the polls. [ News analysis, page B5. ] Aides of both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. O'Rourke said they had urged their candidates to tone down the remarks so that Mr. Cuomo, a skilled debater, would not come across as the heavy or so that Mr. O'Rourke would not appear undignified. ''Everybody was on their best behavior,'' said the O'Rourke campaign communications director, Richard Behn. Mr. O'Rourke said later that although many might expect ''blood on the coliseum floor,'' his goal was ''to be helpful to the state, not to kill Mario Cuomo.'' Mr. Cuomo said that ''I respond as I am questioned.'' The tone was set from the start when the two major candidates declined, in response to questions, to offer evidence to substantiate implications they had made earlier in the campaign. Tax Returns and Law Clients Mr. Cuomo had implied that Mr. O'Rourke had something to hide in his income tax returns and his list of law clients. Mr. O'Rourke had implied that Mr. Cuomo, a Queens Democrat, was somehow linked to or should have known about suspected corruption among high-ranking Democrats in Queens or that the Governor's son, Andrew, was using his position to enhance his law practice. Mr. Cuomo, who only last week had said Mr. O'Rourke ''must have something to hide,'' said yesterday, ''I never suggested anything untoward about Mr. O'Rourke's conduct.'' Mr. O'Rourke said he would accept the Governor's word that he knew nothing of the Queens scandals and that it was newspapers, not he, who had raised questions about Andrew Cuomo's legal practice. Disclosure of Finances Despite the truce, Mr. Cuomo, while continuing to promote full disclosure of personal and professional finances by candidates, again refused to disclose honorariums he has received for speeches while he has been the Governor. He said he would do this after the election ''when it would be no longer useful as leverage.'' Mr. Dillon interjected that the question of ethics and integrity ''was a phony issue right from the start.'' ''Now, why shouldn't the public think we're crooks when we spend our campaigns calling each other crooks with no evidence?'' he added. The three candidates sat shoulder to shoulder, exchanging pleasantries and handshakes before and after the debate. Their subdued and even friendly demeanor reflected the widespread belief among politicians and poll takers that Mr. Cuomo holds such a huge lead in the race for governor that nothing is likely to change it in the final five days of campaigning. They disagreed on several subjects, but usually politely. There were none of the flare-ups that usually characterize political debates earlier in the election season, when the election outcome is more in doubt. Mr. Cuomo said he had considered but ruled out using for social welfare purposes some of the state tax reductions that are to be made to conform to Federal tax cuts. He pledged to return ''all the money to the taxpayers,'' although he would not commit himself to an across-the-board state tax cut in exactly the same proportion as the current state tax rates. Both Mr. Dillon and Mr. O'Rourke favored tax reductions proportionate to the amount paid by a taxpayer. State Aid to Localities All three candidates agreed that state spending and taxes should be cut beyond state tax reductions to conform with Federal tax changes. But the Governor brushed off Mr. O'Rourke's suggestion of a $2.4 billion tax reduction as ''good talk for a campaign.'' The Governor attributed a 42 percent jump in state spending at least partly to increased state aid to localities, while Mr, O'Rourke blamed state-mandated programs for a 50 percent increase in his county budget. Mr. Cuomo contended that two-thirds of the Westchester spending increase was not state-mandated but within the control of the County Executive. ''There's no question that the spending should be contained over the next four years,'' said Mr. Cuomo, who has proposed a state expenditure ceiling. ''Expenditure cap? We could have one today,'' Mr. O'Rourke responded. ''All we need is a governor that's going to say, 'I'll line-item veto.' '' Fiscal Problems Later, however, Mr. O'Rourke did not propose substantial spending cuts when Mr. Cuomo challenged him to do so. When Mr. Cuomo blamed Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller for much of the state's fiscal problems, Mr. O'Rourke said with a smile, ''I always thought there was a statute of limitations on dead politicians.'' Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Dillon said they favored abolition of grand juries for indictments, as Mr. Cuomo had proposed in 1982, but not for continuing investigations such as those into organized crime. ''There has not been a whole lot of movement in the Legislature on it,'' the Governor said. Mr. O'Rourke disagreed. ''I wouldn't monkey around with the grand jury system,'' he said. ''I think it works. Warts and all.'' Mr. Dillon touched off one of the few tense moments when he challenged the Governor on whether Mr. Cuomo favors notification of parents of a pregnant teen-ager before an abortion is allowed and whether Mr. Cuomo would help set up a test case of the state's Medicaid financing of abortion. The discussion was significant because all three candidates are practicing Roman Catholics educated almost entirely in Catholic schools, but they have taken a variety of political positions on abortion while personally opposing it. Mr. Dillon and Mr. O'Rourke oppose Medicaid funds for abortions, and Mr. Dillon also calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. Mr. Cuomo argues that abortions and use of Medicaid funds for them are legal and that he cannot impose his personal views. Parental Consent Mr. Dillon noted that the Governor had said he favored parental consent for the dispensing of contraceptives in public schools. ''Now it seems to me to be a contradiction if you favor somebody getting an abortion without the parents having to be notified but then you favor parental consent just to get the contraceptive device.'' Mr. Cuomo said that he supported notification of parents of a teen-ager about to have an abortion but that there was difficulty in writing a constitutional bill. ''Even notification bills have been struck down because they artifically limited the right of a young woman to have an abortion,'' he said. He also cited State Court of Appeals interpretations that the Governor said required the state to finance abortions - about 50,000 a year in New York State. Mr. O'Rourke suggested a law that would provide for a doctor to counsel a pregnant teen-ager to contact her parents. 'A Battle of Statistics' With fiscal matters dominating the debate, Mr. O'Rourke described as ''a battle of statistics'' Mr. Cuomo's contention that 935,000 new jobs were created in the state during his tenure as Governor and that the state was doing better than the national average. Mr. O'Rourke argued that New York was not doing as well as New Jersey and Connecticut. The two candidates also clashed over public-authority borrowing not directly controlled by the governor, which was up by 40 percent, or $10 billion, in the last four years. Mr. Cuomo said he was not overly concerned about this because of reassurances by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a Republican, among others. Mr. O'Rourke said the growing debt was ''worrisome'' and added that some state highway building should be financed by an earmarked tax, presumably on gasoline. A Spirited Exchange That touched off a spirited exchange in which Mr. Cuomo said he would have no part of a gasoline tax but then, in response to questions by the panel of three Times reporters, declined initially to rule out such a tax to finance mass transit. ''I'm not ruling out a gas tax for the M.T.A.,'' the Governor said, referring to the need for new revenues for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to finance transit borrowing if the current fares are maintained. A few seconds later, he said, ''I am opposed to a gas tax anywhere.'' Asked how he would pay for the transit capital program, he said: ''I don't know; I have no idea. That's what Felix Rohatyn is working on.'' Mr. Rohatyn is the co-chairman of his fiscal advisory panel. ''I'm sorry,'' the Governor said. ''I'm not going to recklessly invent a scenario because it's neat to write about.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE BY CANDIDATES FOR NEW YORK GOVERNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/nyregion/excerpts-from-debate-by-candidates-for-new-york-governor.html,"Following are excerpts from a debate yesterday at The New York Times among candidates in Tuesday's election for Governor of New York, Governor Cuomo, Democrat-Liberal; Andrew P. O'Rourke, Republican-Conservative, and Denis E. Dillon, Right to Life. Ethics Charges Q. We've heard a lot of charges and countercharges about each other's character, particularly the Governor and Mr. O'Rourke, so we thought maybe we'd clear the air to start this out. First with the Governor. Governor, do you have any facts - we know you've talked about disclosure and things like that, but do you have any facts that would indicate that Mr. O'Rourke, as a county legislator and a lawyer, was guilty of either conflict of interest or anything illegal? Either unethical or illegal? CUOMO: No, and as a matter of fact I insisted from the beginning of the campaign that people understand that when I made a request for disclosure it wasn't designed to suggest anything about Mr. O'Rourke or Mr. Dillon or any of us. I think disclosure is important for the people of this state. I think that we could have here established a new precedent - not only the debate and the fullest possible disclosure by all candidates. I think we've made some strides along those lines. The fact is, when Mr. O'Rourke agreed to show his income tax returns, and Mr. Dillon previously had done that, that was the first time to my knowledge in the history of the state that every candidate for major office -the first time in 200 years - that every candidate for major office had made that kind of disclosure. I would assume, given the tenacity and the long memory of the press, that you will insist that that be a precedent in 1990 and I think that's a good thing. But no, I never suggested anything untoward about Mr. O'Rourke's conduct. I was interested in disclosure for disclosure's sake. Q. In the spirit of disclosure, would you disclose the honoraria that you have received as Governor for speeches outside your office as Governor, considering that there is a potential conflict there, that you could be speaking before some group interested in legislation. CUOMO: I think it's not inaccurate to say that I've led the way in disclosure for 12 years. I drafted - helped draft - Hugh Carey's first disclosure order. I've disclosed everything for 12 years, far beyond what the law required. I have shown my tax returns and said here I would exchange tax returns with Andy O'Rourke, and the honoraria, the minute he agreed to do it. The reason I didn't give the honoraria is I had nothing else to leverage with. So, yes, I have no problem in making the same kind of frankly unprecedented disclosure that I have for 12 years. ... Q. Mr. O'Rourke, to ask the same kind of question, do you have any facts that would indicate that the Governor was in any way linked with the Queens corruption, or that Andrew Cuomo in any way acted illegally, or unethically, as an attorney? O'ROURKE: . . . What I've said about the Governor from the beginning was not that I charged him personally with any venality; I never had and I never will. What I said was, if he knew something he should have done something and if he didn't know anything then people have to take that into account, but from my own experience I found it very difficult to believe that you could live in the political arena and not hear something. But I would certainly accept the fact that if the Governor said if he didn't hear anything, or rumors or anything that that's what happened. As to Andrew, I never said a word about him other than I think somebody talked about client lists one day and I said, ''If you're really after client lists you ought to look at those people that have attachment to the Governor whose clients work with the state.''. . . Q. Why don't you release your client list and just end this subject once and for all? Clients that do business with the county, let's be more specific. O'ROURKE: I have said so many times, and the Governor knows this, to my knowledge. This is a breakthrough, ready? . . . I've gone back and asked my former partners to search their own memories about anyone who did business with the County of Westchester. And to the best of their knowledge, plus mine, there were no such cases. . . . Q. I don't mean to be rude here but I can't believe this is the same gubernatorial campaign we were in last week. This whole campaign has been based on charges flying back and forth. Governor, you said, ''I didn't mean to suggest he has done anything untoward,'' but the whole campaign has been based on suggesting something untoward. What's happened? CUOMO: Well, let's be precise. Can you show me one place, one statement I made -and if so I'll apologize to you - you show me a place where I suggested that Andy was doing something illegal or wrong. I said he was wrong - let's be precise - I said he was wrong for not revealing and I repeat it. ... I don't know anything about Andy O'Rourke that I would suggest would be an act of dishonesty. . . . Grand Jury Reform Q. In 1982, the Governor, running for governor, proposed to eliminate grand juries and replace them, in most felony cases, with a hearing before a judge. . . . Now, four years later, there's been no change in the grand jury system and, in fact, grand juries continue as, as Judge Wachtler put it, along in their way, indicting ham sandwiches. Could you, each of us, beginning with District Attorney Dillon, tell us your current position on this proposal to replace grand juries in most cases with a hearing before a judge? DILLON: Well, there's no question but that the grand jury in most cases doesn't perform the historical function it was designed to perform. It is sort of a pro forma body before which the prosecutor places his evidence. And the evidence is there and it's already been judged by the prosecutor, it's sufficient. They return an indictment. I think it's important, however, that we retain the grand jury for use in investigations. I think the grand jury has a very important role to play in terms of long-term investigations of organized crime and white-collar crime and that type of thing. . . . CUOMO: I think Denis's position is a good one. It's consistent with what I said in 1982. We have had discussions. There has not been a whole lot of movement in the Legislature on it, it has been busy with some other things like the state's RICO and other changes. But it's a subject that we should continue to pursue. I think the reform would be a worthwhile one. O'ROURKE: I wouldn't monkey around with the grand jury system. I think it works. Warts and all, I think it's part of the great system of criminal justice we inherited in this country and we made it even better over here. I think, though, that you have to take that into account when you look at the fact that last year, considering all of the people we had involved in drug cases in the state of New York - and we had special prosecutors in New York City, etc., etc. - there were only 236 drug cases actually tried. Apparently the cops are doing their job out there, making an awful lot of arrests. Something is happening in the court system. We aren't trying enough cases and part of the 20-point program that we put forth in this campaign - and while I'm sure that the Governor didn't take any of our positions, some of them happened afterwards like the appointment of more judges and things like that, I think you have to look at this criminal justice system very carefully and find out why we are spending so much money in this way, why it is that the results are so poor. ... Paying for Education Q. We've had a 40 percent increase in education spending in this state. Do you think we've gotten our money's worth? O'ROURKE: . . . We spend a tremendous amount on education in this state - second only, I believe, to California. Yet we are not getting the kind of response that we need. I remember a time when if you said you were a graduate of the New York school system it really meant something. And I don't believe it means that much anymore. We have apparently two million functional illiterates out there - forgetting whether they're computer-ready or not by the year 2000. We have to start training people in reading, writing and arithmetic. I believe in report cards for schools, letting us know where they stand on things. I think there should be an inspector general in the school system. I think the Governor should appoint the Regents. Q. What would the inspector general do, and what can a Governor generally do other than throwing money at the problem? O'ROURKE: You know, there's nothing wrong with that if the money is being well spent. It apparently is not being that well spent. I think an inspector general who reported back to the Governor and the Legislature and the people and was independent from the school system and just went out to look and see what's going on - find out how many computers never get out of the crates, how many teachers never turn up, how many temporary teachers can't pass exams, things like that. ... CUOMO: I'm a little confused. If we should stay out of it why should we appoint the Regents? You can't have it both ways, Andy. I think the Governor should, of course, be involved. How could you not be involved if you're the leader of this state and the subject of education which, as I've said, has to be the No. 1 priority. . . . On illiteracy, it's not enough to take a test. We know they can't read. We're spending $37 million in various programs; that's part of that heavy spending that this state is doing, a 42 percent increase; special teachers, special targeted programs, bilingual approaches to give them access to the English language, teaching people who are on welfare to be literate so that they can get the most - the simplest kind of jobs and get themselves off welfare; giving $95 million more to the teachers of this state so that they have the incentives to teach illiterate children - which is not an easy thing to do because some of them are in advanced grades. There's a lot we have to do, a lot the Governor can do. Now I did have a confrontation, if you will, with the Board of Regents and what I said was that we are spending 42 percent more money, I want to see some evidence that we're making progress. There is some, let's be candid. . . . There are problems in pockets in this state that are disproportionate, that are horrible in their inadequacy. It would be wrong to say we're not making some progress. It would be wrong, in my opinion, to say that we're making enough progress. It would be wrong to say that the Governor ought not to be involved. Should he command the whole education area? In some states they do. Are we ready for that? I think not. We have an established system of Regents for 200 years. I want to study how we can change it. ... DILLON: I'd just like to add something to that. The Governors Association, back in August, came out with a report. They had studied the school systems throughout the country. They suggested more of a role for government. They suggested that legislation be sought in the various states whereby the governor would have the authority to oversee the local school districts and then to identify those that seem to be falling behind or not really educating young people the way they should; try to give them as much help as could be, according to established norms, and then when a school district just can't see to make it, to be able to declare that school district bankrupt and come in and actually oversee education in the school district until it was at a plane that is acceptable. And I thought that was a very good plan. Q. Intellectually bankrupt or financially bankrupt? DILLON: Intellectually bankrupt, that was the term they used in the report. City Schools Q. Do you think that extraordinary measures should be taken by the state as far as New York City education; that New York City education is in such bad shape? O'ROURKE: I think that all of us would agree that the school system in New York has come upon very difficult times. . . . And to grasp that you just have to look at the dropout rate and the crime rate in the schools, the fact that up until a few years ago - and I think it is changing slightly - we were just pumping kids out of school whether they had any idea of what they were doing. And I think a massive effort is necessary in New York City. It has to be run in the main by the city. . . . CUOMO: Let me try to sharpen that focus just a little bit. First of all, again, we have school districts like 26 in Queens that are very successful, that are national leaders. So there are parts of the city education program that are working very well. There are other parts, in areas where there are special vulnerabilities, groups who are disoriented or for one reason or another in a particular kind of trouble. Do we need to do more there? Yes, of course. Just to get our perspective clear, remember we were bankrupt in '75. Remember '76 and '77. We were barely sure we'd have a city. We had to plead for enough money just to keep the place alive. We didn't make a whole lot of progress in our educational establishment in the 70's to the early 80's. We're just beginning, I think, to make a move in the city of New York. A lot of things have to be done. The best thing, I think, to do besides making the teachers stronger - that's what the excellence program and the scholarships of excellence program and the $95 million was for - is to get to these students, give them more motivation. ... I think that you have a lot of broken families, you have a lot of latchkey kids. We can make more of the school building as a facility in some especially weakened areas, deteriorated areas. Take the school building, open it earlier to pre-K - more money for pre-K kids, extend its use to the end of the day, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock at night. Keep the kids in the school, if the parents want them to remain. Give them special instruction, recreation, let them play basketball, in social services in that building. We're going to do that on a demonstration basis. I've agreed with the Regents on that proposal. . . . Q. Mr. O'Rourke, what do you think about the plan the Governor has seized on to expand the school day greatly - 8 or 9 o'clock in inner-city schools? O'ROURKE: For a gentleman who wants to keep his hands out of education, he apparently isn't. I don't think that it's something that I would take a position on without seeing and talking to some educators about it. . . . If it's a good idea, maybe it's worthwhile trying. State Spending Q. Governor, your administration has increased spending over 40 percent, more than twice the rate of inflation. Sometimes you've said that's a good thing. Other times you've said it's the Republicans. And no matter who's responsible isn't that an awfully large increase in state spending? CUOMO: State spending over the last four years is approximately a 42 percent increase, that's far above inflation. It's also the lowest in the Northeast. . . . Is it spending or is it wasteful? Is it for a ''social adventure?'' Let's tell you where the spending went and see if anybody argues with it here. Maybe somebody here will step forward, as the Republicans refused to at my invitation, to tell me where they thought the spending should be reduced. Here's where the spending goes. Over 61 percent of it goes to Andy and the local governments. Over 61 percent. About 20 percent goes to state operations. The increase in state operations was in criminal justice - for prisons, for prosecutors, for personnel. The second-largest increase was in road and bridges, the Rebuild New York bond issue. Because bridges were in danger of falling. We saved 200 lives, it's estimated, last year. . . . And, of course, the education budget, O.K.? Forty-two percent. . . . If you take out criminal-justice personnel that I had to add, I'd be down 2,400 over four years. . . . Now I wanted an expenditure cap. I think you have to contain spending. My budget, incidentally, as proposed, is lower than the spending. It was increased by the Legislature. I could theoretically have line-item vetoed; I have that power, the President does not. They would have overridden it, as they did Hugh Carey, so I didn't do that. But there's no question that the spending should now be contained over the next four years. We've done the roads and bridges, we've done the criminal justice. I've proposed an expenditure cap. Am I, on the other hand, embarrassed at the spending that we made? No, sir! Because no one has stepped forward and suggested to me: ''You shouldn't have spent that money on criminal justice. You shouldn't have spent more on the homeless, you shouldn't have spent it on education.'' . . . O'ROURKE: Well, of course the Governor says that we get a percentage of it back and I think he forgets that 100 percent comes from us in the beginning. CUOMO: That's true. O'ROURKE: And so we've lost 60 percent somehow, or 50 percent, in the process. As to the bond issue, I mean every time you go out and bond something - whether it's the Rebuild New York bond, which I supported; you and I stood on the same platform together and supported that, or the environmental bond issue - and let me say something nonpartisan. I hope whoever you vote for for Governor, you all support the environmental bond issue. That only proves that the State of New York hasn't done much in those areas over a period of time. . . . Expenditure cap? We could have one today. All we need is a Governor that's going to say, ''I'll line-item veto.'' We need a Governor who's not going to give in to the Legislature on member items. I mean, this is like the Praetorian Guard getting donatives from the Emperor every year. Everybody gets a little something around the State of New York. That would save $100 million probably, right there. Q. But, Mr. O'Rourke, you haven't fared any better in Westchester. The fact of the matter is the Westchester budget has gone up 50 percent, you've raised property taxes 20 percent. Why should you think you'd be better as a governor? O'ROURKE: One of the reasons why I decided to run for governor was I became convinced that this great engine of our economy is driven through Albany. Westchester County has 2,600 individual mandates on it from the state of New York. Last year, without even asking us they said, ''Well, you're going to pay another $3 million in M.T.A.'' So be it, we paid it. They told us: ''We're going to give you a veterans package, like it or lump it. But if you opt into it it's going to cost you money. We sign the bills up there and you pay the bill down in Westchester County.'' That's the reason why local government taxes go up. And I believe that everybody who serves in Albany should serve a while in local government. They'd find out who has to pay the bills. CUOMO: . . . But in the end it comes down to this, with all of this spending you have to make a decision. What is your government about? . . . Prisons happened, homeless happened, teen-age pregnancy programs happened, educating children happened. Now you have to make a judgment as a people. Are you for it or against it? Do you believe in a government that makes missiles and leaves everybody to their own devices? Or do you believe in a government that can help a little bit intelligently? O'ROURKE: Let's talk about what bonding is all about. We are paying for yesterday's sins with tomorrow's money, that's really what we're doing. ... And I believe the way you do that is to commit yourselves on a state basis to looking very carefully and not bonding anything except what is ultimately important, and every year putting more and more into the operating account so that part of this ultimately gets paid off out of operating money. Give you an example - let me finish this up, it'll just take a second. I supported the roads but we need a dedicated highway tax every year to keep the roads up, so you don't have to go back and borrow money sometime in the future. CUOMO: Please let me disassociate myself from that highway tax. Andy O'Rourke is telling the people of this state he wants a highway, which means a gas tax, I'm against it. . . . New Taxes Q. Governor, do you rule out a gas tax to pay for the M.T.A. capital program renewal? CUOMO: I'm not ruling out a gas tax for the M.T.A. I have put the whole --Q. You just said you were opposed to a gas tax. CUOMO: I'm opposed to a gas tax for a highway fund, I'm opposed to a gas tax anywhere in the region. I'm not ruling out or ruling in anything on the M.T.A. because I've assigned that whole matter to Felix Rohatyn . . . and I've asked them to put together a plan and to report to us in the Legislature when we come back. I don't want to start making decisions presumptuously after I asked them to do that for me. But yes, I am opposed to a gas tax. Q. How will you pay for the M.T.A. capital program? CUOMO: I don't know, I have no idea. That's what Felix Rohatyn is working on. Q. So, Governor, you're telling us here that you'll return the tax windfall but you won't tell us how; you're telling us there'll be a revenue increase to pay for the M.T.A. but you won't tell us where. CUOMO: Absolutely correct. Q. The rent stablization is being reviewed, you won't tell us -- CUOMO: No, no, let's go slowly. On the windfall, I've explained to you that even if I wanted to give the money back you wouldn't know until 1988. So I'm not refusing to tell you, I don't have a secret plan. . . . No. 2, as to the M.T.A. package, we have an objective: keep the fare until 1990, find a way to finance the M.T.A. No, I don't have a way to do it. I don't know even what they're going to suggest. We'll have to do it by the end of this year. . . . Rent stabilization. A report comes in in December of this year. I have said publicly on two occasions that I'll wait to read the report. I believe rent stabilization must be extended. Landlords are unhappy about that, I understand that. I would suspect it should be extended for more than two years. I've made that public statement three or four times. Q. Governor, isn't it incumbent on a man who wants to be Governor for a second term to tell the voters where he stands on such important things as taxes? CUOMO: I did tell you about taxes. I gave you the biggest tax cut in history. I said the windfall should go back. There are governors - go to California and ask the two candidates there what they're going to do with the windfall. There's been no answer yet. Are you going to keep it for social purposes? Are you going to spend it on your budget? I've told you, I was the first to tell you. Now you're asking me something I don't know. Warren Anderson doesn't know, Ned Regan doesn't know, Shearson Express doesn't know, Felix Rohatyn doesn't know how to do it. No, I'm sorry. And I'm not going to recklessly invent a scenario because it's neat to write about. In Summary Q. Would each of you sum up in two minutes, what you want people to recall as they go to the polls on Tuesday. DILLON: I indicated, when I declared my candidacy for this race, that I thought that abortion was the most important human-rights issue facing us in the country today. And I believe that the Governor of New York, despite what was said here today, could end public funding of abortions in this state. The Harris v. McRae case in the United States Supreme Court is very persuasive authority that public funding of abortions does not have to be. And I believe that any Governor who believes that abortion kills human life, or something so close to human life that it should not be disposed of casually, would set up a precise test case to see whether the killing of human life is necessary funded by our tax money in this state. And I would call upon the Governor to do that. I would also remind him that the Catholic Church does not teach what is human life. The Catholic Church teaches moral principles. Science tells us that human life begins at conception, human life is present at the womb. All the Catholic Church does is apply the moral principle, that once was universally accepted, accepted even by pagan societies, and that is that it's always wrong to deliberately kill human life. People who are pro-life, I ask them when they go to the polls on Tuesday, in this particular election, vote pro-life, vote an identifiable pro-life vote. . . . CUOMO: I think most of us would agree that the state has made progress over the last four years. I think the things that we dispute about are precisely what is the extent of that progress, how is it relative to the rest of the country, the rest of the region, who gets the credit for it and who is best equipped to continue the progress and to enhance it. I think the case for the progress being very strong, even relatively, is a good, solid one. The credit, the credit does not go to the Governor. It doesn't go to the Legislature. It goes to everybody together. This is a collective enterprise. The Governor is supposed to show some leadership. We've tried. We led this nation in the deductibility fight, we tried on 21-year-old purchase, we tried with initiatives. And I think I've done that job adequately. But obviously, the Legislature makes the budgets. The Legislature deserves credit for the tax cut, just as I do. Who can do it better? I've worked as hard as I could possibly work over the last four years. I've made some mistakes. I think I've done some things right. I think I'm stronger now than I was four years ago, better able, because of my experience of the last four years, to do a good job in the four years ahead and I think I'm the best equipped, of the three, to make futher progress. ... O'ROURKE: . . . My belief is there are two great imperatives that must be answered in this race for governor: one is the revitalization of the State of New York. We're in competition, not only with other states but with countries, for talent, for jobs, for opportunity. And I think it's very important that we get the government of this state going forward. And I don't think it has. The second great imperative is the control of crime. Because if society doesn't control crime, then it's done nothing. And so I hope the day will soon come when we make meaningful progress against the drug dealers, and against violent crime, and against political corruption, all throughout the state of New York. And I think we can do it. I pledge myself, if I am lucky enough to be governor of this state, to put in the same dedication, and energy and enthusiasm, and problem-solving ability that I've had as county executive and in the 22 years of my public service. But I'd like to take a moment to tell you that running for governor is an exhilarating experience, especially if you participate fully in the debates that go to make up the political process. And I think we've seen here today, that if we'd debated earlier, perhaps, it might've been better. We could've talked a lot about other issues. I know I've certainly learned a lot about the state of New York, a lot about its people and a lot about myself. . . .

"G.O.P. FIELDS STAR IN COLORADO, SEEKING ANY EDGE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/us/gop-fields-star-in-colorado-seeking-any-edge.html,"For several weeks, White House political operatives have been arguing that in the final days of this year's campaign, President Reagan would be able to add two or three percentage points to the vote for Republican candidates in close races, pulling them through and keeping control of the Senate in Republican hands. Today, in a speech at Colorado Springs, Mr. Reagan put that theory to perhaps its most important test, for the second time urging Coloradans to choose Representative Ken Kramer over his Democratic rival, Representative Timothy E. Wirth. They are in a nail-bitingly close race to succeed Senator Gary Hart, who is retiring to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988. If Mr. Reagan is going to do it anywhere, he ought to be able to it here, Republican officials concede. And there is no race anywhere more crucial to Republican hopes of holding the Democrats to a net gain of three Senate seats or less, which would perpetuate Republican control through the final two years of the Reagan Presidency. G.O.P. Seeks to Unseat 2 Most Republicans concede that the Democrats will pick up four or five seats that are Republican now, so the Republicans' chances probably depend on picking up at least two seats that the Democrats now hold. Going into the final weekend of the contest, former Gov. Christopher Bond leads for the seat of retiring Senator Thomas F. Eagleton in Missouri. But late polls indicate that the Republicans are likely to fall short of the gains they had hoped for in Louisiana and California. So as things now stand a great deal depends on Colorado, where Mr. Wirth and Mr. Kramer have been trading ill-tempered charges, in person and on television, since shortly after Labor Day. Each man has held narrow leads for a few days, only to lose it, according to The Denver Post's tracking poll. Mr. Reagan's arrival in the state today coincided with the emergence of a small, fragile trend to the Democratic candidate, nothing decisive, to be sure, but perhaps a straw in the crosswinds here. The Post poll, which produces new totals each day, showed a two-point Kramer lead on Monday, a one-point Wirth lead on Tuesday, a three-point Wirth lead on Wednesday, and a four-point Wirth lead today. The number of undecided voters has been falling steadily and stood at only 7 percent on Wednesday. About 600 likely voters are included in each sample, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. That makes any single day's findings this week inconclusive, but the trend could have real significance. Even Short Duration Mr. Reagan's first visit last month produced a small short-lived surge for Mr. Kramer. This time, such a surge would not have to be very big or, with Election Day so close, very long-lasting to decide the final outcome. In a tacit acknowledgement of Mr. Reagan's popularity here, Mr. Wirth took full-page newspaper ads this morning to list four major bills that Mr. Kramer voted against but Mr. Reagan signed. He concluded by telling Mr. Reagan, ''I truly look forward to working with you as a U.S. Senator.'' The tenor of the campaign was neatly summarized in an exchange in one of the candidates' debates. Mr. Wirth told Mr. Kramer: ''You talk about a spending freeze and making the courageous decisions. But you have never met a weapons system that you didn't like.'' Mr. Kramer replied: ''If I have never met a weapoms system I didn't like, then you have never met a deficit or an appropriations bill or a tax increase you didn't like.'' Running Mate Is Strong Representative Wirth is clearly the more articulate and the better-known of the two candidates. He has managed to spend almost as much money on television advertising as his opponent. He has the stronger gubernatorial running mate in Ray R. Romer, who appears to be well ahead of Ted L. Strickland, a Republican. And, unlike Mr. Kramer, he has achieved a national reputation; he was rated one of the 25 most influential House members by this year's Almanac of American Politics. But Mr. Wirth is a liberal and Mr. Kramer a conservative in a steadily more conservative state. Colorado gave Mr. Reagan 63 percent of its vote in 1984 and Senator William L. Armstrong, a conservative Republican, 64 percent in the same year. Mr. Hart won by fewer than 20,000 votes four years earlier. Mr. Kramer, moreover, has proved to be a much more dogged and less erratic candidate through most of the campaign than many expected. His television commercials hammer home the contention that Mr. Wirth is too big a spender; one currently on the air shows four unidentified voters saying things like ''I don't want Tim Wirth spending my money for me'' and ''Tim Wirth represents big government.'' Response to Main Theme The Republican's two biggest issues are his support for Mr. Reagan's missiles-in-space program and a constitutional amendment decreeing a balanced budget. In that sense, he is an ideal nominee for the President to help, because Mr. Reagan's main theme, as he traveled through the South last week and stumps in the West this week, is the need for a Republican Senate to restrain spending and give him the freedom to pursue the kind of national-security policies he defended in Iceland. With candidate spending relatively even, Mr. Kramer has benefited from radio and television commercials sponsored by a number of national organizations: the National Conservative Political Action Committee, the American Conservative Trust, the National Rifle Association, anti-abortion groups and the Realtors Political Action Committee, which has spent more than $300,000 in Colorado. But the Republican's ultraconservative backing has also backfired on occasion, ad it did on Wednesday, when State Senator Martha Ezzard, one of the Republican candidates whom Mr. Kramer defeated for his party's nomination, appeared at a Wirth fund-raisign luncheon and created a local sensation by attacking the activities of ''the radical far right'' and, by implication, those of Mr. Kramer. Issue of Missile Money Mr. Kramer himself gave Mr. Wirth the largest opening of the campaign on Oct. 15, when he said he would be willing to spend $1 trillion in the next 25 years on the program for missiles in space. That would amount to $40 billion a year, more than 10 times the amount Congress agreed to spend last year, but the Republican said the money could be found by making heavy cuts in offensive weapons. Mr. Wirth has pounced upon the issue, asserting that Mr. Kramer's plan would force the dismantling of most of the nation's offensive weapons systems, conventional as well as nuclear. Although Mr. Kramer later disavowed the $1 trillion figure, reporters for both Denver newspapers and several local television stations have said that they heard him do so, and the figure was widely reported on Oct. 16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SURVEY FINDS NO BIG COLLEGE SWING TO RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/us/survey-finds-no-big-college-swing-to-right.html,"The results of a new survey rebut the idea that college students have become politically more conservative. The study shows a move to the center and a continuation of liberal views on specific issues such as abortion, the environment and taxing the wealthy. The survey, made public today, shows that while the number of students who identify themselves as liberals today has shrunk by a third from the number in 1970, the total who describe themselves as conservatives has held relatively steady: 15 to 20 percent, with a net gain of 2.4 percentage points since 1970. The report, ''American Freshmen: 20-Year Trends,'' was prepared by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Council on Education. It records, from 1966 to last year, the educational achievements, attitudes and goals of freshmen at almost 600 colleges and universities around the country. The survey covered 300,000 freshmen last year. Center Identification Rises The number of freshmen describing themselves as political centrists has increased about 11 percentage points, from 45.4 percent in 1970 to 56.7 percent last year. The number of students describing themselves as liberal stands at 22.4 percent. But most students continue to support traditionally liberal political and social values. For instance, 60.5 percent of last year's freshmen supported national health insurance, 73.3 percent favored legal abortion and 78 percent approved of greater Government involvement in protecting the environment. In another area of concern, almost half the freshmen surveyed last year said they decided to attend college largely to improve their reading ability, despite an overall increase in high school grades over 20 years, according to the report. 'Underpreparation' Is Stressed ''The reality is there is a lot of underpreparation of students for college these days,'' said Prof. Alexander W. Astin at a news conference on the report this morning. Professor Astin, who teaches at the University of California at Los Angeles, is director of its Higher Education Research Institute. In the poll last year, 11 percent of freshmen said they would need tutoring in a specific subject, almost double the number in 1971, the first year this question was asked. Last year, 40.5 percent of the students said improving reading and study skills was an important reason for their attending college. In 1971, this figure was 22 percent. Professor Astin said that while most of these students were not illiterate, many were considered ''marginal'' in their ability to read and write. ''There's no way we can avoid assuming some responsibility for training these students,'' he said. 'Grade Inflation' Is Noted The report notes that electives such as band have pushed up high school grades at the same time that colleges have found a decrease in academic competence. ''Grade inflation,'' in which the number of ''A'' students in high schools is greater than the total of ''C'' students, the report says, ''is another symptom of declining academic skills. Evidence suggests that today's students are very reluctant to undertake courses of study in college that challenge their academic skills.'' Elaine El-Khawas, a vice president of the American Council on Education, suggested that colleges work with local high schools to move their curriculums away from ''soft'' subjects. Liberal arts disciplines, the report says, ''have witnessed what can only described as a bear market.'' ''Some individual fields showed especially sharp declines,'' the report said. ''Mathematics and statistics, for example, lost more than 80 percent of their students. English has also declined by nearly 80 percent over the past 20 years.'' More Majors in Business More students are passing up liberal arts degrees to major in business, with 25.7 percent of men and 23.8 percent of women surveyed last year planning a business career. In 1966, 17.3 percent of men and 10.9 percent of women planned to major in business. The choice of business and, to a lesser extent, computer science and engineering, is often based on a desire for higher pay, the report indicates. The surveys show that 70 percent of last year's freshmen considered being well-off financially important, as against 40 percent 10 years ago. And 70 percent said a major reason for attending college was to increase earning power, as against 50 percent in the early 1970's. Kenneth C. Green, associate director of the research institute, said college students' emphasis on money and status had developed from ''coming of age in a time of severe economic upheaval.'' ''This is not something they saw on the evening news,'' Mr. Green said. ''This is something they experienced first-hand.'' They have adopted the attitude, he said, that ''I'm not going to let this happen to me.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BIRTH ADVICE IN SCHOOLS CONDEMNED BY BENNETT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/nyregion/birth-advice-in-schools-condemned-by-bennett.html,"The United States Secretary of Education charged yesterday that the New York City Board of Education had made a ''bad decision'' in offering birth-control counseling in nine high school health clinics. The Secretary, William J. Bennett, told a luncheon audience in Manhattan that such programs encouraged sexual promiscuity among teen-agers and constituted an ''abdication of moral responsibility'' by adults. ''This sort of thing is a local matter, but my own feeling is that it is a mistake,'' he said. ''It undermines the efforts of others who are trying to send a different message to young people.'' The board president, Robert F. Wagner Jr., who had introduced Mr. Bennett, rose to defend the city's policy. He said the counseling was conducted as part of a comprehensive health-care program that emphasized ''the importance of abstinence and saying no.'' Clinics in 60 Schools This month a staff report by the board disclosed that clinics in nine schools had been providing abortion counseling and birth-control information. Two of the clinics distributed contraceptives to students who had their parents' consent to use the clinics. According to the Center for Population Options of Washington, a group that seeks to prevent unwanted pregnancies among teen-agers, more than 60 high schools around the nation have clinics providing comprehensive health care, and at least 10 of them dispense contraceptives. In the wake of the controversy, the Board of Education has banned the distribution of contraceptives but let the nine clinics to continue to operate for six months while the issue is debated. Mr. Wagner took issue with Mr. Bennett's assertion that education about birth control encouraged sexual activity. ''The best reviews that we know of,'' he said, ''show that with such programs not only does the number of pregnancies go down, but there is a significant delay in sexual activity.'' Plea for 'Moral Literacy' The exchange was at a luncheon of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, at the Harvard Club at 27 West 44th Street. It followed a 30-minute talk by Mr. Bennett urging schools across the country to emphasize not only academic subjects, but also ''moral literacy.'' ''Most Americans want their schools to help form the character of their children,'' Mr. Bennett declared. Moreover, he said, there is ''a good deal of consensus'' on such specific traits as thoughtfulness, fidelity, honesty, fairness, self-discipline and respect for law that the teaching should foster. The Secretary appealed to educators not to let the fear of controversy over such issues as nuclear war, abortion or creationism stand in the way of efforts to promote ''formation of character'' in their students. ''We should 'teach values' the same way we teach other things - one step at a time,'' he said. ''We do not argue against teaching physics because laser physics is difficult. Every field has its complexities and controversies. And every field has its basics. ''So the moral basics should be taught in school first. The tough issues can, if teachers and parents wish, be taken up later. And, I would add, a person who is morally literate will be immeasurably better equipped than a morally illiterate person to reach a reasoned and ethically defensible position on tough issues.'' Since becoming the country's top education official in February 1985, Mr. Bennett has frequently appealed for more attention to the teaching of values, including religious ones, in public schools. Because curriculums are under the control of state and local boards of education, Mr. Bennett has no authority over such matters. However, even critics concede that he has made effective use of the ''bully pulpit'' that he occupies to push educational policies consistent with the philosophy of the Reagan Administration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS GETS PERSONAL IN LOUISIANA'S 8th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/us/politics-gets-personal-in-louisiana-s-8th-congressional-district.html,"In the battered studio of radio station KCLF, a tiny AM channel in this little town on an old coil of the Mississippi River, Clyde Holloway, a conservative white nurseryman who is the Republican candidate for Louisiana's Eighth Congressional District, was taping an interview this afternoon to be broadcast to the 25,000 people who live within the reach of the station's signal. He was talking about sex, race, murder and patriotism or the lack of it. He was talking about his opponent, Faye Williams, a Democrat, a woman and a lawyer who stands a strong chance of becoming the first black person to be elected to the House of Representatives from Louisiana since Reconstruction. ''I don't say Faye is a Communist,'' Mr. Holloway said, . ''I don't even say she has a radical following. We just don't know.'' A Shooting in Los Angeles He had reached this point in the interview after discussing an event that occurred more than 15 years ago in Los Angeles, where Ms. Williams was then in graduate school. Her estranged husband, Stan Duke, a black television broadcaster from whom she had filed for divorce, had broken into her house, beaten her and shot to death the man she had been seeing, Averill Berman, a white college professor and prominent political activist. ''The part that worries me about her past is not the love affair,'' Mr. Holloway said. ''The part that concerns me is that the guy who was killed was a known Communist in the Los Angeles area. The old saying out in the street is that if you sleep with a dog, you get fleas.'' In Louisiana, politics gets personal. Two weeks ago The Alexandria Daily Town Talk - ''my hometown paper,'' Ms. Williams says drily - published an editorial that served up the facts of the shooting, along with the advice that a candidate's personal life ''relinquishes part of its shroud of privacy when one seeks public office.'' There had been no public mention of the incident in the long primary campaign, when Ms. Williams returned from law school and a job in Washington to face Mr. Holloway and four white men who are Democrats in an open primary election. Not until almost three weeks after Ms. Williams finished first in that primary did the newspaper publish what she had chosen not to mention. 'A Matter of Public Record' After all, Ms. Williams said, she was a victim of the crime, not a criminal. ''I didn't see it as having any relevance in the campaign,'' she added. ''All my friends knew about it. It was a matter of public record.'' Faced with a choice of talking publicly about the incident when she announced her candidacy or of letting it lie in the record until someone brought it up, she said, she chose the latter. Ms. Williams said her friends and advisers, knowing ''the way we play politics in Louisiana,'' were concerned about the incident. ''But I never knew anyone would make a racial appeal or an un-American appeal out of it,'' she said. She also said she was convinced that that was what raised the issue. ''Sure it was,'' she said. ''That was the whole intent of it.'' This is Mr. Holloway's third attempt at the Congressional seat. He lost once to Gillis Long, its veteran Demcoratic occupant, and then to Mr. Long's wife, Cathy, in a special election held last spring after Mr. Long's death. It is the first attempt for Ms. Williams, a native of Alexandria who has not lived there for 20 years but has maintained her legal residence there, her aides say. District Has a Liberal Cast ''I always wanted to run for public office,'' she said, but it was not until Mrs. Long's decision not to run again coincided with Ms. Williams's graduation from Howard Law School last year, at the age of 43, that she decided to run for the House. The Eighth Congressional District wanders down and across central and southern Louisiana, and its majority population of blacks and Cajuns, descendants of the Acadians who migrated here two centuries ago, give it a liberal Democratic cast. Ms. Williams, urban and elegant in manner, and Mr. Holloway, slow and neighborly in delivery, could hardly be more different. ''Dr. Berman,'' she said, referring to the victim of the shooting 15 years ago, was simply ''a dear, sweet friend who taught me a lot, and that's the way I'll always remember him.'' The facts the voters should be concerned with, she said, are that ''we have the highest unemployment rate, the highest illiteracy rate, the highest dropout rate, the highest welfare rate and the second-highest teen-age pregnancy rate in the nation.'' 'She Was Sent in Here' Mr. Holloway is suspicious. ''I just believe she was sent in here to run for Congress,'' he said. ''I don't know whether it was the Black Congressional Caucus who sent her to run, or the N.A.A.C.P.'' His newspaper ads call him ''conservative, pro-life,'' and ''endorsed by President Reagan.'' They describe her as ''ultraliberal, pro-abortion, for gay rights, for gun control.'' Mr. Holloway plucked his ''Communist'' label of Dr. Berman from a 1948 California State Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. If his use of that old episode backfires with the voters, he said: ''God help me. I'm going to buy a few acres of land in Australia. Maybe we can fight them off the coast.'' His pollster, Verne R. Kennedy of the Marketing Research Institute in Jackson, Miss., declined to release any information about voter support, saying it was too close to the election. But Ms. Williams, who has been publicly embraced by Mrs. Long, seems to be leading. Her pollster, Robert S. Miller of Miller & Associates, a market research firm in Baton Rouge, said nightly telephone surveys of 400 voters showed that Ms. Williams was the choice of 47 to 49 percent of those polled, while Mr. Holloway's support was ''in the low 30's.'' Forty-four percent of her supporters were for Ms. Williams even though they recalled the basic elements of the old murder, Mr. Miller added. But that event is not what is moving the district's voters, Mr. Miller continued. What is moving them is race. ''The biggest gain in Clyde Holloway's vote is among white Democratic voters who are just now finding out that Faye Williams is black,'' Mr. Miller said. She has the support of about 30 percent of the whites in the district, he said, and about ''99 percent of the blacks.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EDUCATION WATCH; TEACHING ABOUT SEX IN AN EXPLICIT SOCIETY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/weekinreview/education-watch-teaching-about-sex-in-an-explicit-society.html,"WHEN Frances Schaefer introduces her Brooklyn eighth graders to their sex education course, she asks them to write questions they have about themselves, their family, their friends. A common question, said Ms. Schaefer, a gently spoken 17-year veteran of the school system, is: ''How do you say no to your boyfriend without hurting his feelings?'' Such questions - to which she responds with notions of individual responsiblity and self-respect - give her the perfect chance, she said, to infuse moral values into the classroom. Sex education, a sensitive subject to teach at the best of times, has been the focus of much attention at the New York City Board of Education in the last several months. Beginning in the next school year, the board has ruled, it is to be taught in all grades from kindergarten through high school, although parents may keep their children out of classes. A few states, including New Jersey and Maryland, have mandatory sex education courses, but New York City's 301-page curriculum, officials say, is one of the most comprehensive in the country. A revamped version of a curriculum written in 1969, it contains detailed explanations of contraceptives and abortion, the stages of pregnancy, and, for junior high and high schools, information on AIDS. There is a section on other sexually transmitted diseases and one on sexual abuse of children. ''There is more information than just plumbing,'' said Charlotte Frank, director of the board's division of curriculum and instruction. ''The curriculum has to respond to a more explicit society.'' Ms. Frank said the central theme of the program, which was written at a time of steadily increasing teen-age pregnancies, is self-respect. She summed it up by a quote in the manual from the Rev. Jesse Jackson: ''You are not a man just because you made a baby. You are a man because you raise a baby and provide for a baby.'' An Early Start Written by a committee of teachers and doctors, the curriculum begins in pre-kindergarten classes with lessons identifying such emotional experiences as ''happy,'' ''sad,'' ''angry.'' In the early grades, one assignment asks children to discuss with family members their reasons for having a family. By grades 5 and 6, physical changes at puberty are outlined, and the human reproductive system described. It is in these grades that such terms as sperm, testes, penis, ovum, uterus, vagina, tampon and sanitary napkin are defined. In junior high school, the lesson plans deal with subjects that students see and hear every day on television and in films. Emotional and physical changes during puberty are described; different kinds of families, such as those headed by a single parent, are discussed, along with the responsibility for raising a child. For the first time, contraception and the options for an unplanned pregnancy are explored. By high school, under the rubric ''starting and maintaining a family involves responsibility,'' there are more detailed descriptions of birth control and abortion methods and the importance of the family in society. A recent class at West Side High School in Manhattan was largely devoted to the effectiveness of different kinds of contraceptives. A diaphragm was passed around the class as students wrote answers - the class is also intended to improve writing skills - to such questions as: ''Why is it important to know about contraception?'' Ms. Schaefer, who has a master's degree in psychology with a major in human sexuality, has unusually high qualifications for teaching the course. The majority of the teachers are health education or physical education instructors, who do not always feel as comfortable as Ms. Schaefer, although all of them undergo training organized by the Board of Education. Ms. Schaefer, who teaches at I.H.S. 293, in Boerum Hill, applies a sense of humor to the job. ''In class, I don't teach masturbation but discuss its existence,'' she said. ''I give scientific information and tell them no one ever died from not doing it.'' She can also be matter-of-fact: ''In class the other day, in the context of dating, we were talking about a person's right to control of one's body. One of the boys asked: 'What if she says she can't go any further, and you can't stop yourself? What is that?' I said, 'That is rape.' He looked at me as though it was not the answer he expected.'' Jerry Stoopack, the assistant principal for health and physical education at Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side, said: ''It's easy to teach the biology. It's hard to teach about making choices.'' He added, ''Anyone who says this is what you should or shouldn't do loses a lot of kids.'' Mr. Stoopack must also consider the differing cultural traditions of his students. At Seward Park, there are many newly arrived Asians. ''When you're talking about the elements of mature behavior,'' he said, ''a kid may point out that even though she is in this country, her parents are going to choose who she will be with.'' While the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has expressed its disapproval of the sex education curriculum, Ms. Schaefer, who is Catholic, says she has no qualms. ''I have no intention of fighting the cardinal,'' she said. ''But the Cardinal never said children should be denied information. What he said was: Knowledge without a moral context is a dangerous thing.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABOUT MEN; The Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/magazine/about-men-the-clinic.html,"THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO suggest that this is, in any way, a man's place. Though we men have been equal partners in the act itself, though the throbbing, nearly-human thing whose life is about to be prematurely expunged is of our own blood, nothing suggests that we have had anything at all to do with this choice. The waiting room is filled almost entirely with women - women alone, women with other women, women attendants, doctors, nurses and counselors who float in and out of the room, occasionally calling out for a ''Miss Brownstein'' or a ''Miss Doyle'' and then accompanying the named client down a corridor to what The Clinic's literature calls ''the procedure.'' I have been here before. Not to this particular clinic, but to one just like it, in Washington, some six years ago. I remember - not with pride, but with shame and humility - how I behaved then, how in a masculine haze of anger and self-involvement, terrified of my own neediness, overwhelmed by my own fears, I failed to offer emotional support to a woman who deeply needed me. This time, I resolved, it will be different. I tried, from the moment the words ''It's positive'' first issued from my friend's lips, to share in this ritual with her as she dealt with the vicissitudes of nausea, depression, anger and (I assume) loneliness that must accompany an unwanted pregnancy. Offering to accompany her to the interview that precedes the procedure and then to the procedure itself, I am politely turned down. ''Why don't you just wait here, sir,'' I am told. ''Someone will be down after it's over to let you know how she's doing.'' My friend, too, suggests that this is what she prefers, and so I sit here reading a copy of Boston Business, which, I notice, not without a trace of irony, seems to be the only magazine The Clinic subscribes to. As I contemplate the glaring contrast between my original complicity and my present extraneousness, I feel a wave of anger well up. But there is also a certain relief: it is, after all, not my body into which, perhaps at this very moment, a vacuum hose is being inserted and the power turned on. It is some 37 years now since my biological parents - in a time long before there were openly such places as The Clinic, long before ''the procedure'' was a legal alternative - must have contemplated taking a similar measure. Myself the product of an unwanted pregnancy, it is impossible for me, however ardently I may support legally available abortion, to be emotionally neutral on the subject. I cannot - nor should I, it seems to me - react with equanimity when a life that might have been my own, a child that might have been mine, is sucked from the walls of a woman's womb, no matter in whose or in what's name. No matter how clear to me it may be that the choice ought, indeed must, be a woman's to make (for it is her body that is endangered, hers and the child's futures that are most clearly jeopardized), it is also clear to me that there is something of mine here that is dying too, some pain and complicity of my own that must be dealt with. Very much like the women I know, primarily those in their early and late 30's who have not yet had children, I too hear a clock ticking, though its digits are neither as clearly defined nor as biologically intractable as are a woman's. Adopted by parents who were well into their 40's when I was born, having occasionally resented my father for his advanced age and ill health while I was growing up, I have little desire to inflict a similar fate on my own sons or daughters. I, too, feel yet another opportunity gone by as I imagine the power surging through the vacuum hose and into my friend's womb. I am suddenly roused from these reflections by the reappearance of The Clinic's attendant who informs me: ''Your friend is doing fine. She'll be down in a few minutes.'' Unseen by me, untouched by me, the act is done. What might have been is not. Who might have spoken is forever still. The life I might have passed on remains entirely my own. My friend enters the waiting room and walks over to me. ''How'd it go?'' I ask. ''Fine,'' she answers. ''But I'm starving.'' We stop on the way home at the International House of Pancakes, conveniently situated near The Clinic. She orders blueberry pancakes. I order French toast. The bill comes to $7.35. Back in Cambridge, we walk into my apartment, and my friend heads right for the sofa to pick up her flute and book bag. ''I think I'll go practice awhile before my lesson,'' she says, heading toward the door. ''Well . . . would you like to come back here and take a nap later? You might feel a little weak.'' ''No, thanks,'' she answers. ''I think I'll just go back to my room.'' ''Well . . . can I call you later?'' ''No,'' she says, ''I think I just want to sleep for a while.'' She opens the door, walks out into the bright, breezy Massachusetts morning and is gone. Somewhere in the bushes outside my window, I hear a pair of nesting cardinals singing to each other. A terrible sadness sweeps over me, like a cold wind. It is my 37th year. I am learning, I say to myself, something of what it means to be a man.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICKING GOES HIGH-TECH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/magazine/politicking-goes-high-tech.html,"WHEN THE SEN-ate race in Missouri entered the homestretch early last month, campaign strategists for Republican Christopher S. (Kit) Bond began to take nightly readings of the voters' mood. As soon as they learned that the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Iceland had collapsed on Sunday, Oct. 12, they inserted three new questions into their polls. On Monday night, the President spoke to the nation about the meeting; by Tuesday night, Don Sipple, Mr. Bond's media adviser, sensed he was onto something big. What he read in the polls astounded him: Missouri voters were backing the President by margins of 6 and 7 to 1. Mr. Bond was already running a television commercial that stressed his support for the Strategic Defense Initiative (the President's space-based missile shield) and attacked the arms-control policy of his Democratic opponent, Harriett Woods. Mr. Sipple decided to recast the spot to take advantage of the talks. By Wednesday morning, the consultant had sent Mr. Bond a new introduction, emphasizing that the President had been able to negotiate in Iceland from a ''position of strength.'' By Friday, the revised commercial was on the air. With the use of increasingly sophisticated polling methods, videotape machines and satellite technology, political consultants like Don Sipple can now monitor the public mood on an hour-by-hour, day-to-day basis, searching for a cresting emotion that might sway a bloc of marginal voters. Today's media whiz then tries to capture, and manipulate, that emotion in a new television commercial that can be put on the air overnight. ''It used to take two or three weeks for information to reach the voters,'' says the pollster Harrison Hickman, ''but now it's film at 11. Clearly, we've pushed the edge of the envelope on this stuff.'' During the current battle for control of the Senate, this high-tech, high-stakes struggle by consultants and pollsters for the hearts and minds of the voting public has reached a new level of importance and visibility. When voters cast their ballots in Missouri and other states on Tuesday, they will be making choices based largely on impressions created by these media consultants. Marshall McLuhan was right: the medium is the message. In American politics today, the medium is television, and that medium is dominated by an elite of highly paid but unelected consultants. The democratic ideal, of a candidate talking directly to the voters and appealing for support, has been profoundly distorted. These electronic contests sometimes resemble a new form of television game show - one could call them ''Spot Wars'' - and the cost is staggering. Kit Bond and Harriett Woods will each spend about $4 million on their campaigns, with 60 percent going toward buying television time. The Missouri Senate race has attracted national interest for a number of reasons. Both of the contestants are tough, seasoned campaigners. Kit Bond, a 47-year-old lawyer, is a moderate conservative who won his first statewide race for auditor at age 31 and has served two terms as Governor. Harriett Woods, who is 59 and a journalist by profession, peppers her liberal stance with populist swipes at the big banks and corporations that have contributed heavily to her rival. She lost a close Senate race in 1982 to John C. Danforth, but was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1984. Moreover, both parties feel that the larger battle for con-hinges on a handful of key races. And Missouri, where the retirement of Democrat Thomas F. Eagleton gives the Republicans a chance to pick up a vacant seat, is one of them. Not surprisingly, the race attracted the top guns in the consulting business and promised to be the Super Bowl of media advisers. Mr. Bond's man, Don Sipple, is a partner in the Washington firm of Bailey, Deardourff, Sipple, which has a superb track record in selling Republicans. The Woods team at the outset was led by the hottest name on the Democratic side, Robert Squier, who is also based in Washington. Top guns do not come cheap. Mr. Squier, for example, charges a $60,000 fee plus 15 percent of the ''media buy,'' or another $350,000, in a state like Missouri. CONSULTANTS, OF COURSE, also work in gubernatorial and House campaigns, but those races do not usually involve the sort of media warfare that dominates the major Senate contests; there is much less money available for the candidates since many national contributors are more interested in senatorial campaigns. The cost of television advertising, however, has grown so rapidly that today, Senate campaigns design most of their tactics for one of three purposes, and sometimes all three: generating free television and radio coverage; raising money to finance paid commercials, and energizing supporters to go out and raise more money. In Missouri, one 30-second spot on the popular evening game show ''Wheel of Fortune'' costs about $3,000, and as the race moved into the final hectic month, both candidates were spending about $250,000 a week apiece on television alone. The financial pressures have grown so great that candidates can spend up to half their time appealing for funds, often on the phone with individual donors. ''The price of running for the Senate today,'' says Harriett Woods, ''is spending more time than you'd like to spend asking people for more money than they'd like to give.'' The Woods campaign actually started organizing its fund-raising effort in March 1985. ''Without money,'' explained Jody Newman, the campaign manager, ''we couldn't be on TV, and without TV, we couldn't win.'' Fund raising in any senatorial campaign takes place on both the local and national levels. Within the home state, the techniques have remained standard: breakfasts and lunches, pool parties and cocktail parties that charge anywhere from $10 to $500 a head. The pitch is generally about local issues, because the contributors are more interested in what the candidates will do for the state than in the way they will affect policy in Washington. No Senate candidate, however, can raise enough at home these days to finance a campaign. So, while the elections are generally decided by local issues, the money used to publicize those issues must be raised in Los Angeles and Detroit, Chicago and Houston and, above all, in New York and Washington. During their campaigns, both Kit Bond and Harriett Woods have made regular trips to New York City in search of money. While the Republican mainly worked the Wall Street crowd, the Democrat concentrated on the city's large liberal community, and Harriett Woods was continually running into other candidates in Manhattan. ''We follow one another through the same art galleries and restaurants and living rooms,'' she said. But no city is more important in the fund-raising game than Washington, and few Senate campaigns this year are without a new breed of Washington consultant, who does nothing but pry money out of the political action committees, or PAC's. There are now more than 4,000 PAC's, providing almost one-quarter of all contributions to Senate campaigns. When Mrs. Woods scheduled a party for PAC representatives in September, her Washington fund-raiser, Sara G. Garland, was up at 5 A.M. for several days, addressing the invitations by hand. Ms. Garland also asked the Democratic Senators who signed the invitation to call special friends in the PAC's and urge them to buy tickets. As one veteran fund-raiser put it, ''In Washington, nothing happens until the fifth phone call.'' The evening garnered $130,000, enough for perhaps four days of commercials, and Mrs. Woods was back again in October for a final dip into the Washington money pool. Ms. Garland also organized a series of smaller meetings between Mrs. Woods and groups of PAC's devoted to specific subjects. For example, at one breakfast meeting last July, the guest list included PAC's related to health, a major Woods concern. The hosts for the event were Representative Henry A. Waxman of California and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, senior Democrats on the committees handling health issues. One PAC official resisted all appeals until Ms. Garland said, ''This is an opportunity for you. I promise you a seat next to the Senator.'' The response was immediate: ''I'm coming.'' These days, Republicans enjoy an obvious fund-raising advantage. Ronald Reagan's farm and trade policies might not be popular in Missouri, but the President raised $450,000 for Mr. Bond at one luncheon in St. Louis. Some PAC's hedge their bets and back both candidates, but most choose sides, and the competition is fierce. For example, Mr. Bond received help from John Danforth, who, as chairman of the influential Senate Commerce Committee, has ''closed a few doors for us,'' according to Ms. Garland. ''A lot of PAC's are going to support Bond because Danforth talked to the C.E.O. or made a call to the vice president for government relations,'' she said. Once their fund-raising efforts were in gear, both camps started exploring campaign themes. In the fall of 1985, Don Sipple organized ''focus groups'' around the state - small gatherings of about a dozen voters. ''Focus groups give you a feel you can't get from any polling,'' said Mr. Sipple, who once served on Mr. Bond's staff in the Missouri Statehouse. What Mr. Sipple discovered was that voters saw Mr. Bond as a ''good guy, a good Governor,'' but not as an inspiring leader. Accordingly, Mr. Sipple reasoned, the Bond campaign should play to the candidate's strength by emphasizing the ''comfort level'' he had achieved with many voters. The focus groups told Mr. Sipple that there were some ''very clear differences'' between the two candidates on a range of issues, particularly budget and fiscal matters, and the strategist thought he could label Mrs. Woods a ''tax and spend'' Democrat. The groups also indicated that Mrs. Woods was coming across as ''too harsh'' and ''too liberal,'' but that information had to be handled delicately. ''It was infinitely easier for us to work on the liberal thing than on the harsh thing,'' Mr. Sipple explained. ''When you engage in attacks on personal qualities, that can be very dangerous.'' Meanwhile, Mrs. Woods had hired Harrison Hickman and Paul Maslin, two poll-takers based in Washington, who took a survey for her in February. Mrs. Woods was the preference of 47 percent of those polled, as opposed to 44 percent for Mr. Bond. But that early in a campaign, political experts are more interested in what they call ''internals,'' answers to specific questions that reveal a candidate's particular strengths and weaknesses. One of the key findings was that Mrs. Woods rated high on questions of personal character. The poll revealed a major Bond weakness: his image as a wealthy ''country-club Republican.'' But Messrs. Hickman and Maslin also uncovered evidence of Mr. Bond's strength. On the question of who has the ''experience and qualifications a Senator needs,'' Mr. Bond led 2 to 1. B OB SQUIER IS A Washington celebrity, widely quoted in the press and seen at the best parties, a charming self-promoter with a good record in close races. In 1984, he worked for Paul Simon of Illinois, one of only two Democrats to oust an incumbent Republican Senator. Mr. Squier actively sought the Missouri assignment, because it promised to be one of the top races of the year, and Mrs. Woods and her staff were flattered by his attention. He would give them instant credibility in Washington and leverage with the PAC's. He had a seasoned organization that offered a full range of services, from debate preparation and research to a music composer and editing facility. By contrast, Joe Slade White, who had worked for Mrs. Woods in her previous campaigns, was practically a one-man operation, with little experience in major Senate races. In explaining the choice of Bob Squier over Joe White, Jody Newman, Mrs. Woods's campaign manager, said: ''What often happens in races like this is that you have a fight over the airwaves. One candidate puts on a message, and the other has to decide how to respond. At times you have to rely on experience and instinct, and you have to have the capability of getting on the air instantly.'' Nonetheless, while they wanted Mr. Squier's contacts and his organization, Mrs. Woods and her close-knit core of advisers were not prepared to take his advice. Ms. Newman has devoted much of her professional life to promoting Mrs. Woods, and she approached the campaign with a simple, heartfelt premise: ''If people really knew Harriett, they would vote for her.'' But Mr. Squier and the poll-takers had looked at the numbers. They knew their client's weaknesses as well as her strengths, and they were not ready to canonize her. During one planning meeting with the Woods staff, Bob Squier turned to Harrison Hickman and muttered, ''All they have to do is pin wings on her and she'll fly to the Senate.'' One key question in any Senate campaign is: Which side goes on the air first with paid commercials? The Woods team agreed to let Mr. Bond take the lead. He had more money, so the shorter the campaign, the better for Mrs. Woods. A longer campaign was also likely to tarnish Mrs. Woods's ''halo effect,'' as Mr. Hickman put it. ''She would look more and more like a politician.'' Don Sipple was reading the situation in the same way, and decided to begin Mr. Bond's media campaign in May. ''We wanted to draw her out,'' he said. ''We wanted to make her spend more money than she wanted to before the primary in August.'' The initial Bond spots were low-key. In one, he wandered through a field, talking to a farmer about agricultural issues, and casually mentioned that ladybugs help control aphids in a field of alfalfa. ''That comment just said so much,'' said Mr. Sipple. ''In a highly charged political environment, when the farm issue will be a political football, let's find out who knows about agriculture.'' A second aim of the ads, added Mr. Sipple, was to ''tighten up'' his candidate's elitist image. Mr. Bond attended prep school at Deerfield, Mass., college at Princeton and law school at the University of Virginia -not exactly a man of the people. So the television spots invariably showed him in a checked sports shirt, speaking directly to ordinary voters, who nodded sympathetically. During a trip to a state fair, where Mr. Bond was going to film some commercials, the candidate doffed his lawyer's shirt and tie in the car and put on one of his made-for-television plaids - with the price tag still on it. Don Sipple also prepared a second package of spots that focused on Missouri's troubled economy, taking care to separate Kit Bond from the Administration on such issues as trade policy. The White House offered to provide the Bond campaign with a videotape of President Reagan meeting with the Republican, but ''we passed,'' said the consultant, ''much to the consternation of the White House.'' T HE BOND MEDIA campaign was functioning smoothly, so well in fact that a Woods poll in early June showed that the Democrat had lost 11 points and was behind, 48 to 40. More importantly, there was a marked decline in her advantage on character questions, the strongest element of her appeal. The original strategy had been to run a series of positive spots after Mr. Bond's initial wave, but the poll results forced a re-evaluation. It was time for something dramatic. The Woods camp had received a juicy piece of information: Kit Bond sat on the board of an insurance company, Mutual Benefit Life, that held farm loans in Missouri and had foreclosed on local farmers. After a Kansas City paper ran a story on one of the families, David and Marilyn Peterson of Maysville, Mr. Squier took a film crew to their house for an interview. During the filming, David Peterson broke into sobs while talking about his lost dairy herd. The Woods campaign, in Harrison Hickman's words, thought they had found a ''silver bullet.'' Mr. Squier edited the material into a three-part series that ended with an attack on Kit Bond for opposing a moratorium on farm foreclosures. The consultants recommended skipping the original positive spots and coming straight out with the negative ''crying farmer'' spots. Mrs. Woods and her staff agreed. The first two in the series began running in mid-June. The third spot, with Mr. Peterson's outburst and the attack on Mr. Bond, followed. That night, a group of Bond staff members gathered in Kansas City to watch the commercial. Katie Boyle, Mr. Bond's press secretary, felt as if someone had punched her. Warren Erdman, Mr. Bond's campaign manager, immediately called Don Sipple. The two men decided to hold their fire and try to determine how the ad was affecting voters. Mr. Erdman traveled to his hometown of Higginsville and showed the commercials to a focus group. ''As they watched the third spot, I watched their eyes. I wanted to see their expressions,'' said Mr. Erdman. When the citizens of Higginsville expressed distaste for the attack on Kit Bond, Mr. Erdman breathed easily for the first time in days. A strategy was then formulated. Katie Boyle would express sympathy for the Petersons, but would denounce the Woods campaign for ''gutter'' politics. The Bond camp also encouraged critical stories in the news media about the Woods spot. With a tip from Katie Boyle, Mike Reilly, a reporter for The Columbia Daily Tribune, tracked down the Petersons and, after a lengthy interview with Marilyn Peterson, wrote a story quoting her as saying, ''I kinda felt like we had been used'' by the Woods campaign. Miss Boyle rushed copies of the article to the Kansas City television stations and two of them used it on the air that night. Within days, the outcry against the spot had reached a crescendo around the state. It was, Bob Squier later conceded, a masterful job of using the news media. The Woods camp was reeling. Jody Newman was on the phone with Bob Squier, saying that supporters were upset about the negative tone of the ad. The candidate herself was complaining about how she looked. Messrs. Hickman and Maslin took a quick poll and found decidedly mixed results. In the St. Louis area, Mr. Bond had actually increased his overall lead to 10 points. But many voters who said their income was dependent on agriculture liked the spots and shifted in favor of Mrs. Woods. In a private memo accompanying the poll, Messrs. Hickman and Maslin said it would be a ''tragic error'' for the Woods campaign to back away from the attack. Bob Squier told Mrs. Woods and her other advisers that negative ads always cause a critical reaction at first, but are effective in the long run. ''The voting public is like an organism,'' said Mr. Squier. ''It tries to reject information that is unpleasant.'' In fact, the consultant had assumed that Mr. Bond would attack the commercials as dirty politics, and he had a follow-up spot ready to go, pointing out that Mr. Bond had received $26,000 for serving on the insurance company board and had failed to report the income on his Senate ethics report. (Mr. Bond later said the omission was valid because the fee went directly to his law firm.) But Jody Newman, in a fury, told the consultants, ''We've spent eight years building up Harriett Woods's image, and you've ruined it in a month.'' When Mr. Squier insisted that the campaign stick to the game plan, he was dismissed. (It is a sign of the times that the dumping of Bob Squier made front-page news, and Mrs. Woods complained that reporters were more interested in his status than in her speeches.) Messrs. Hickman and Maslin, who agreed with Bob Squier, resigned a few days later. Ms. Newman hurriedly contacted the man who had worked on Mrs. Woods's earlier campaigns, Joe White, at his vacation house on Long Island and asked him to replace Mr. Squier. Mr. White was in St. Louis the next day, and within a few days a new series of Woods spots were on the air. This time, the candidate took center stage. Against a soundtrack vaguely evocative of ''Chariots of Fire,'' a voice praised her ''character and courage.'' Mrs. Woods was delighted with the spots. ''Joe White has always made me look good,'' she said. The Washington hotshots were gone and the campaign staff in St. Louis was in charge again. ''In our judgment,'' said Ms. Newman, ''Joe White would do things the way we wanted to do them.'' B UT THE ''SPOT Wars'' were just heating up. After Joe White's first ads went on the air, Don Sipple saw an opening for a counterattack. He flew into St. Louis late one evening, and by the next morning he had produced a new spot, featuring the negative news clippings about the Woods commercial - clippings the Bond campaign had helped generate. That night it was on the air. By using the (Continued on Page 50) newspaper clips to make the point, and not Mr. Bond himself, Mr. Sipple got others to do the campaign's dirty work. One of the articles quoted in Mr. Sipple's spot had called Mrs. Woods's tactics ''sleazy and shallow,'' and Mr. White, in turn, thought he saw a target of opportunity. He put together another commercial, saying that Mr. Bond ''couldn't take the truth'' about his ties to the insurance company. At that point, in mid-August, both camps lapsed into an exhausted silence. But as Labor Day approached, Joe White knew he had a big problem. Mrs. Woods was trailing Mr. Bond by 8 points in most polls. There was only one thing to do: Go negative. Mr. White decided to attack Mr. Bond's strongest point, his reputation for sound fiscal management. Mr. Bond's own commercials boasted that, as Governor, he had taken a budget deficit and turned it into a surplus. In his commercial for Mrs. Woods, Mr. White used the first 10 seconds of the Bond spot, with its claim of financial wizardry, and froze the frame. A somber voice came on saying, ''That's what Kit Bond says. What he doesn't say is the truth.'' The truth, the commercial concluded, was that Mr. Bond actually inherited a surplus as Governor and had to raise taxes to keep the state afloat. (The facts lie somewhere in between, and depend on the accounting method used.) ''All candidates overreact to negatives,'' noted Mr. White. ''They tend to believe the voters will turn against them. So a negative ad throws an opponent off guard. It also gives them the problem of how to respond, and that occupies their time and resources.'' The morning in early September that the spot was first televised, Kit Bond was being interviewed at a Kansas City television station, and a reporter asked for his reaction. Mr. Bond made a quick comment and privately told Katie Boyle he wanted to talk to Don Sipple. But Mr. Sipple had already called Mr. Bond at the station, leaving a number in Illinois where he was working on another campaign. Mr. Bond was late for an appearance in St. Joseph, but once on the highway, his van pulled over at a convenience store, where two adjoining phone booths were unoccupied. On one phone, Mr. Bond called headquarters and talked to his campaign manager, Warren Erdman, who was negotiating with the Woods forces over future debates. On the other phone, his press secretary, Katie Boyle, reached Mr. Sipple in Illinois and discussed the Woods ad. At one point, as some local farmers looked on in amazement, Mr. Bond had a phone in each ear, talking to both advisers at once. While Mr. White succeeded in initially rattling his opponents, the Bond team, after sniffing the bait, decided not to take it. Demanding that Woods withdraw her commercial would sound like a ''lawyer's trick,'' said Mr. Sipple, and would admit that the ad had ''drawn blood.'' Instead, Miss Boyle made a statement rebutting the charges in the commercial. Mr. White also made seven other spots, detailing Mrs. Woods's views on such issues as drugs in the schools. Mr. White argued that since the baby-boom generation was now having kids, issues relating to children would play well. Some of the spots were only 10 seconds long, with Mrs. Woods talking directly into the camera. Because short spots are half the cost of 30-second ads, the campaign flooded the airwaves with them, hoping to show that Harriett Woods was knowledgeable on many subjects. The Bond camp had been caught napping. Mrs. Woods was outspending them 2 and 3 to 1 on television time, and the attack on the Republican's fiscal record ''softened up'' his support with marginal voters, said Mr. Sipple. ''She just kind of drowned us out.'' By purchasing so much air time in early September, the Woods camp hoped to influence the next round of polls. The strategy worked. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat showed Mrs. Woods pulling even with Mr. Bond at 40 percent apiece, with 20 percent undecided. Even before the poll was published, Ms. Garland was on the phone in Washington, using the results to encourage PAC's to contribute to Mrs. Woods. She raised $15,000 in one day. Within days, Kit Bond was fighting back. One commercial showed ordinary voters - most of them women - attacking Mrs. Woods's ''sneaky, rotten campaign tactics.'' Another ad said Mrs. Woods was rewriting the history of Mr. Bond's Governorship. Both commercials ran on a heavy schedule for eight days and, by the end, said Mr. Sipple, ''we had pretty much stopped her move.'' New polls at the end of September showed Mr. Bond back in front by 7 points. Mr. White acknowledged that Bob Squier had been right last spring in saying that Mrs. Woods could win only by undermining Mr. Bond's solid image of reliability. So for the final weeks of the campaign he produced a series of negative ads, capped by a renewed attack on the Republican's connection to the insurance industry. The point was simple: to identify Mr. Bond with ''big money, out-of-state bad guys.'' Joe White also took a gamble, producing a spot in which Mrs. Woods talked frankly about her support for a woman's right to have an abortion. The point was to stress the character issue, her concern for average people. Don Sipple entered the final weeks with a similar strategy. Stress Mr. Bond's strength with spots that highlight his deep roots in Missouri and attack Mrs. Woods's weak points by having him identify with President Reagan's tough stance in Iceland. But that ad - by saying that Mrs. Woods favored a test ban without verification - also triggered a controversy. The Democrat fired back with her own spot, accusing Mr. Bond of telling ''an outright lie.'' In the last 10 days of the campaign, Mr. Bond tried to capitalize on the President's post-summit popularity by appearing in a rally with him in Springfield, and running a new spot with a Presidential endorsement. At that point, Kit Bond held a 9-point lead in two polls, but the Woods camp argued that the gap was closing. In ''Spot Wars,'' the television audience at home gets to pick the winner, and they will do that on Tuesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WESTCHESTER OPINION; THE OLD-FASHIONED BUMPER STICKER IS STILL HOLDING UP ITS END,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/nyregion/westchester-opinion-the-old-fashioned-bumper-sticker-is-still-holding-up-its-end.html,"MY favorite bumper sticker of all time was mounted on the back of an aging Ford pickup, traveling south on a highway near Knoxville, Tenn. A rifle was visible in the rear window. The bumper sticker proclaimed: ''God, Guns and Grits Made America Great.'' If it's true that bumper stickers offer some insight into the concerns and attitudes of people traveling the roads these days, then my recent survey in and around Westchester might offer some surprises. For example, an issue that commands hours of network news and acres of newsprint -the racial battle in South Africa -has not attracted an inch of space on automobile bumpers. Instead, people voice concern about the even more imposing issue of nuclear weapons. A few samples seen on the road recently: ''One Nuclear Bomb Can Ruin Your Whole Day.'' ''Arms Are for Hugging.'' ''If We Can Risk Nuclear Arms, We Can Risk Disarmament.'' ''No Nukes Is Good Nukes.'' ''If You Want Peace, Work for Justice.'' A topic that's conspicuously absent from rear bumpers these days is politics. In a year when New Yorkers are electing a senator, a governor, a slate of Representatives and who knows what else, there's scarcely a political bumper sticker to be seen on the highways and byways of Westchester. Neither has the controversial issue of abortion spawned a family of stickers. I've seen only one lone plea recently, in Katonah: ''Everyone Deserves a Birthday: BAN ABORTION.'' On the religion front, I noticed a ''Praise the Lord'' in Pleasantville, and a sticker on the Saw Mill River Parkway that read: ''God Has Already Made My Day.'' But apart from these, God seems to barely exist on the roads today. People are obviously more concerned with earthly matters, such as how to stay alive, rather than how to get into heaven. The classic, ''Schools's Open - Drive Carefully,'' is still around. But drinking-and-driving poses the pressing danger today, as shown by these warnings: ''Friends DON'T Let Friends Drive Drunk.'' ''Arrive Alive. Don't Drink and Drive.'' ''Safe Rides. 238-5314.'' ''If You Must Drink and Drive, Drink Pepsi.'' Of course, there are always contrarians, such as the fellow who declared: ''I Brake for Beer.'' That was one of those yellow signs bobbing in the back window. I don't happen to think they're particularly useful or clever, and I much prefer the old-fashioned stickers. They are more permanent, and always have an edge, whether carrying an educational message, such as ''Fight Prime Time - Read a Book,'' or fall to crass commercialism, such as ''Love at First Bite - Rocky's Millwood Deli.'' For whatever reason, some drivers use their bumpers to make deprecating remarks about their vehicles. Here's one I saw on the Hutchinson River Parkway: ''If This Car Were a Horse, We'd Have to Shoot It.'' A person on the Sprain Brook had a rather pugnacious plan to get rich: ''Go Ahead and Hit Me - I Need the Money.'' But most motorists just seem to want to make a complaint about their general financial state: ''My Take Home Pay Won't Take Me Home.'' ''I Owe. I Owe. So Off to Work I Go.'' ''No Condo. No M.B.A. No BMW.'' Others are searching for less-materialistic pleasures. One woman driver in Mount Kisco confessed: ''Lead Me Not Into Temptation - I Can Do It Myself.'' While another in Yonkers teased: ''Ask Me. I Might.'' If all this seems a bit bemusing to those who have never festooned their cars with mottos or sayings, then maybe they'll appreciate the absurdity of some bumper stickers that can only be described as ridiculous, perhaps poking fun at the whole phenomenon. One pleaded: ''Beam Me Up Scotty. There's No Intelligent Life Down Here.'' Another offered the advice: ''Surf Nude.'' Perhaps the lighter side of bumper-sticker philosophy was best expressed on a car seen in Chappaqua. I didn't notice the exact make, but it ran closer to the lines of a Mercedes than an old Ford pickup truck. The parting words: ''When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Go Shopping.'' And who would want to argue with that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HETERODOXY WAS HIS DOXY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/books/heterodoxy-was-his-doxy.html,"VOLTAIRE By A. J. Ayer. 182 pp. New York: Random House. $19.95. SO much has been and is still being written about Voltaire that his own works are probably less often read than are the books discussing them. Lytton Strachey, whom A. J. Ayer is fond of quoting, remarked about Voltaire more than 80 years ago: ''Everyone, it is true, has heard of him; but who has read him? It is by his name that ye shall know him, and not by his works.'' It would therefore be unreasonable to expect that this rather short essay by a nonspecialist, and intended for a nonspecialized audience, should add much to what has already been said many times about Voltaire and his works. Nor can the book claim much originality for having been written by an Englishman, since Voltaire's well-known indebtedness to England has been more than amply repaid by England's disproportionately large contribution to Voltaire scholarship. Much more is yet to come. The Voltaire Foundation of Oxford University - where Sir Alfred was educated and where he long occupied a distinguished chair of philosophy -is sponsoring the gigantic endeavor of bringing out a new edition of the ''Complete Works of Voltaire,'' the first such in more than a century. What is remarkable, however, about this book is that its author, after having for half a century published numerous highly respected philosophical volumes, decided during the seventh decade of his life to read Voltaire's chief works and to reflect on what they still have to say to us more than two centuries after they were written. The contact of two great minds separated by time and culture brings into play the often unpredictable but usually instructive turns and twists of relevance. For example, when Voltaire scoffs in his ''Philosophical Dictionary'' at the dogma of original sin and ridicules the notion that God should have to wait until the sixth week after conception to endow the fetus with an immortal - and damned - soul (Voltaire wrote, ''What do six weeks matter more or less?''), Sir Alfred observes, with true Voltairean irony: ''It is amusing to note that nowadays the opponents of abortion are more likely to believe in original sin than its advocates and that it is its advocates who believe that the six weeks do matter.'' Being himself a professional philosopher -which is more than one could say of the author of the ''Philosophical Letters'' and the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' - and observing quite rightly that Voltaire ''attached less importance to philosophy than to theology,'' Sir Alfred devotes fewer pages to literary issues than he does to ideas and values, especially those bridging the gap between philosophy and religion. This is all the more understandable because he finds himself in general agreement with Voltaire's heterodox views on such matters. To wit: ''I hope that by now it can be taken for granted that the accounts of creation and the origin of man which appear in the Book of Genesis are not only inconsistent but independently ridiculous, that the whole of the Pentateuch is riddled with absurdities, and that the best that can be said for the remainder of the Canon is that much of it, like the Song of Solomon and the Book of Ecclesiastes, is outstanding for its literary merit.'' Aside from the lucid and personal discussion he offers, for instance, of the addition to the ''Philosophical Letters,'' in which Voltaire attempted a systematic demolition of Pascal's ''Pensees,'' and of much of the ''Philosophical Dictionary,'' Sir Alfred is at his best when he attempts a nigh-revisionist re-evaluation of Voltaire's huge production as a historian - of Charles XII of Sweden, of Peter the Great of Russia, of Louis XIV of France and of world civilization in general - or when he summarizes in a lively and well-informed manner what is currently known of what he terms Voltaire's ''Life and Character.'' Conversely, his remarks about the plays and especially about the tales are disappointingly conventional, and he has practically nothing to say about the poetry. While this selective and somewhat skewed approach is logical on the part of a writer who insists throughout his book that what he admires most about Voltaire is his ''moral courage,'' it fails to provide a clue to what made Voltaire the widely known, symbolic figure he still is today, as evidenced, for example, by the title given by Will and Ariel Durant to one of their volumes: ''The Age of Voltaire.'' Saying that ''the most important factor . . . and the one that chiefly accounts for his survival as a symbol is that he was fundamentally a man of action'' does little more than beg the question, for it fails to indicate that the key to Voltaire's effectiveness as a man of action was his reputation (deserved or not) as the greatest man of letters of his age. Even if the 10 cantos of his epic poem, ''La Henriade,'' are no more often read today than his 40-odd plays are performed, it was because of the fame brought to Voltaire by his now neglected belles-lettres that he was able to publicize and remedy some of the most scandalous miscarriages of justice of his time, and that he succeeded in creating his own legend - of the frail old man whose pen proved mightier than the weapons wielded by the all-powerful Church and State. SIR ALFRED may be quite correct when he states, with understandable British pride: ''The most effective counter to the superstitions of Christianity came from the discoveries of the nineteenth century. In this matter we owe a smaller debt to Voltaire than to such men as Lyell, Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin.'' Nevertheless, this glosses over the fact that theirs was a more restricted audience than the one drawn to Voltaire by his reputation as one of the great writers of his time. There is on the other hand no disagreement with Sir Alfred's final sentence. After having cast his eye on the world around him, rife with glaring instances of intolerance, fanaticism and bigotry, he claims: ''We must surely conclude that we can still profit by the example of the lucidity, the acumen, the intellectual honesty and the moral courage of Voltaire.'' A. J. Ayer deserves our gratitude. He will certainly bring more readers to Voltaire, thus perhaps making our world a little better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEHT HENLEY WRITES A 'REAL, REAL PERSONAL' MOVIE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/movies/beht-henley-writes-a-real-real-personal-movie.html,"A touring Shakespearean troupe arrives in a small town at the start of ''Nobody's Fool,'' the new film written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Beth Henley. The play they perform is ''The Tempest,'' a choice that adroitly alludes to the theme of the movie itself. ''The Tempest,'' Shakespeare's final play, was his valedictory to the world of theater, his tribute to the power of what he deprecatingly called ''this insubstantial pageant'' to elevate the human soul. The Prospero of ''Nobody's Fool'' is the theater's set designer, Riley, who, like his Shakespearean counterpart, manipulates his world - by the mastery of lights, booms, stagecraft. And the film's Ariel is Cassie, who is ultimately liberated by her Prospero. In the hands of Eric Roberts and Rosanna Arquette, Riley and Cassie also stand in for Ferdinand and Miranda, the young lovers in ''The Tempest,'' for ''Nobody's Fool'' equates romance with theater in its ability to deliver people from the monotony of limited lives. However film critics may judge ''Nobody's Fool,'' which opens Friday at the New York Twin, 84th Street Six and 34th Street Showplace, it seems certain to stir sentiment in anyone who ever has felt the magical pull of the stage, much as Bertrand Tavernier's recent '' 'Round Midnight'' sweetly reminds every jazz fan of the first time he walked into the smoke and the sound of a basement club. The elegiac and autobiographical mood of ''Nobody's Fool'' separates it from the wackier voice and third-person stance of Ms. Henley's two Broadway plays, ''Crimes of the Heart'' and ''The Wake of Jamey Foster.'' The difference derives in part from timing - Ms. Henley began writing the screenplay in 1977, before any of her plays - and in part from how closely Cassie corresponds to her creator. '' 'Nobody's Fool' was real, real personal to me,'' Ms. Henley said, sitting for an interview in a Manhattan hotel but looking the fetching country ingenue in a polka dot dress and ankle socks. ''It's about someone who's in despair and is looking for meanings and has made mistakes and is looking for salvation. Theater is a world that understands magic and imagination. Also, there's the sense in theater of the family, an immediate sense of belonging. But a belonging where you can be different.'' Or as Cassie puts it when she explains why she wants to take an acting class: ''Watching that Shakespeare show got me thinking how good it would be to be someone other than me. Even if it was for an hour or a half hour.'' Ms. Henley grew up in Jackson, Miss., her childhood dominated by severe asthma and her teen-age years spent as an outsider in a high school big on ''drill team and cheerleaders.'' She joined no clubs, took part in no activities and was dateless on prom night. When she left to attend Southern Methodist University in Dallas, she carried a copy of ''The Power of Positive Thinking.'' ''I was real zoned out,'' Ms. Henley, who is 34 years old, remembered of her childhood. ''I really lived in my own world. I used to come home from school every day - this is so pathetic - and go to my closet. See, I had moved out of the bedroom I shared with my sister and into this closet. ''And I would sit there and cut pictures out of magazines and put them into this book. Sometimes I liked the picture and sometimes I just wanted a kind of shape that would look nice in my book. And I would listen to records - 'Porgy and Bess,' and some Chopin record my mother had and the soundtrack of [ Zeffirelli's ] 'Romeo and Juliet.' ''I used to collect rocks and bottles, too. I wasn't a good collector because I felt sorry for rocks and bottles that weren't pretty, so I'd keep them. I'd keep dead flowers, because I thought just because flowers are dead you shouldn't throw them out. I kept a goldfish that died once. Just left it in the water with my other goldfish that was alive. Course, eventually it killed that one.'' Ms. Henley not only had the wild imaginative life of a loner, but she loved listening to the stories family and friends told, unknowingly gathering the grist for her adult writings. ''My mother said I was the quietest child,'' she recalled. ''I would just sit on her lap or lay down on the couch and listen to her talk to her friends. They'd always whisper, 'Oh that's all right, she won't know what we're talking about.' And sometimes I'd pretend to sleep just so they'd keep talking.'' From early on, theater figured in Ms. Henley's life, and her story will be beautifully familiar to the thousands of aspiring actors who flock to New York each year from the hinterlands: At age 12, Ms. Henley visited Manhattan with her parents, and she saw ''Funny Girl,'' ''Hello, Dolly'' and ''After the Fall.'' Ms. Henley's mother acted in an amateur theater in Jackson, and as a senior in high school the future playwright began to study acting there. She pursued acting rather than writing at Southern Methodist, and during graduate school at the University of Illinois she spent one summer playing in the Abraham Lincoln docudrama at a state park, an experience that directly fed ''Nobody's Fool.'' ''I loved theater,'' Ms. Henley said. ''I loved to go to rehearsals with my mother and watch everything. It just killed me that these grown-up people were putting on costumes and had made-up sets just so people could come sit in the dark and watch a story.'' Magic gave way to misery, however, when Ms. Henley tried to turn her avocation into her vocation. She began writing ''Nobody's Fool'' (then entitled ''The Moonwatchers'') when she was just another unemployed actress debilitated by the hope-audition-rejection cycle. The initial draft reflected her anger, and Ms. Henley believes that the screenplay profited by not having been made in its original incarnation. In the intervening years, she turned to writing, won the Pulitzer Prize for ''Crimes of the Heart'' and enjoyed extensive regional theater productions of ''The Wake of Jamey Foster'' and ''The Miss Firecracker Contest.'' This fall, her career has reached its most active point. She co-wrote the screenplay of David Byrne's acclaimed ''True Stories'' and also the film adaptation of ''Crimes,'' which opens Dec. 12. Her new play, ''The Lucky Spot,'' will bow on April 9, 1987, at the Manhattan Theater Club, and another new work, ''The Debutante Ball,'' is expected to premiere at the same theater next season. All this success served to soften the raw edges of ''Nobody's Fool.'' ''I just got bored of reading the script where Cassie's bitching and moaning,'' Ms. Henley said. ''I thought, 'God, get out of it.' So I switched the focus from Cassie wallowing in misery to how hard she's trying to get out of it. It got more forgiving.'' In the final version of the script, as directed by Evelyn Purcell, Cassie emerged as a classic Henley heroine. Carnelle Scott of ''The Miss Firecracker Contest'' wanted to win that small-town beauty pageant to bury the bad reputation that had earned her only the colloquial title ''Miss Hot Tamale.'' Cassie, too, has earned scorn, for both her eccentricity -Miss Arquette's costumes suggest ''Annie Hall''-meets-''The Grapes of Wrath'' - and her sexual entanglements. After her longtime boyfriend impregnates her, he backs out on a promise to marry her and she decides to give up the baby for adoption. As soberly as the film conveys Cassie's isolation, it also gives her and the supporting characters the hilarious, grotesque touches that can now fairly be called Henleyisms. When Cassie's boyfriend offers her half the money for an abortion instead of a wedding vow, she stabs him in the cheek with a fork. Later that night, she tries to hang herself; the rope breaks and she falls into a dumpster. ''Nobody's Fool'' also includes a mother with warts on her back, a mentally disturbed girl who craves plastic straws and an albino woman's wedding ceremony (with Ms. Henley in a cameo as a bridesmaid). While the film is set in the Southwestern town of Buckeye Basin (actually Prescott, Ariz.), the idiosyncracies clearly mark it as part of Ms. Henley's native Mississippi, the setting for all her plays. Critics have called her style ''gothic'' and ''bizarre,'' but to Ms. Henley it is plain old kitchen-sink naturalism. ''It seems real to me,'' she said. ''I wouldn't find it interesting to be sitting around, making everything up. So many of my stories are from people I've known and tales I've heard.'' As much as Ms. Henley has made audiences laugh at comas, hangings, exploding pigs and other disasters, she has always written with an enormous empathy. In a way that recalls Douglas Unger's novel ''Leaving the Land'' or Joni Mitchell's ''Song for Sharon,'' she has balanced both affection for and rejection of small-town life. And she has never relied on easy targets for laughs. ''It was hard growing up for me,'' she said, ''but I still love the place I came from. I love the people and the way they tell stories. I love the romance and the smell of the air.'' She paused. ''I guess it's like the way I looked at rocks and bottles. It's life and I hate for people to judge things. I don't like sarcasm and putting people down. Everyone is foolish in their own way.'' She drew her legs up under her and smiled. ''I mean, this hotel. They say, 'Bonjour.' Like because they speak French it's better. We're not even in France. That's as foolish as anything people do in a small town.'' Ms. Henley's warmth for ordinary life makes her seem an odd collaborator for Mr. Byrne on ''True Stories.'' Even her musical taste ran more toward the early jazzmen Fletcher Henderson, Louis Armstrong and Jimmy Noone than rock-and-roll. As the main songwriter for Talking Heads, by comparison, Mr. Byrne has spoken most compellingly through the characters of psychotics, paranoids and the odd religious zealot here and there. His take on everyday America, delivered in a song entitled ''The Big Country,'' was ''I wouldn't live there if you paid me.'' The playwright and songwriter met through Jonathan Demme, when he directed Ms. Henley's teleplay ''Survival Guides'' for PBS and cast Mr. Byrne as the spiteful brother-in-law of a new bride. (The teleplay, which also featured Rosanna Arquette, has yet to be broadcast.) Mr. Byrne showed Ms. Henley the photographs that were part of his then inchoate screenplay - a little girl walking along a country road, a fat woman lip-synching. Then she and Stephen Tobolowsky, who has directed most of her plays, helped the first-time film director shape the disparate visions into a tour of fictional Virgil, Tex., during its sesquicentennial. ''I wrote kind of the Fellini version of the script,'' Ms. Henley said, ''and he spent the next year paring it down and shaping it to his songs. I see David's stuff and feel mine is so gaudy and overstated and his is so spare.'' Along the way, the woman who knew Armstrong's ''Potato Head Blues'' learned such Byrne standards as ''Crosseyed and Painless.'' ''I love Talking Heads now,'' Ms. Henley said, more excited than at any point in the interview. But the bargain seems fair. A number of critics, keeping in mind Mr. Byrne's beginnings in the ever-so-cynical downtown scene, remarked on the suprisingly accepting spirit of ''True Stories.'' While few made this point, and Ms. Henley herself tends to dismiss it, the relative tenderness of ''True Stories'' might indicate that Ms. Henley and Mr. Tobolowsky exerted a tempering effect on Mr. Byrne. ''Nobody's Fool,'' like virtually all of Ms. Henley's work, brands her as an optimist. Which is not to say her viewpoint is at all saccharine. When Cassie leaves with Riley for Los Angeles at the film's end, there is a final echo of ''The Tempest.'' ''Our revels now are ended,'' Prospero declares in the play. And as the lovers are united, the shipwrecked are saved, and his own usurped dukedom is restored, the magician at last frees the enslaved spirit Ariel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE REGION; Cuomo, O'Rourke Cross Swords But Shed No Blood",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/weekinreview/the-region-cuomo-o-rourke-cross-swords-but-shed-no-blood.html,"It was boring, as political debates go, but then that was what made it interesting. After months of implying dreadful things about each other, Governor Cuomo and his chief challenger, Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, said they really had not meant to. ''I never suggested anything untoward about Mr. O'Rourke's conduct,'' said Mr. Cuomo, who had insisted only the week before that Mr. O'Rourke had declined to list his law clients publicly because he ''must have something to hide.'' Mr. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate, who had tried to link the Governor with scandals involving fellow Democrats in his home borough of Queens, backed off just as far: ''What I've said about the Governor from the beginning was not that I charged him personally with any venality,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''I never had, and I never will.'' It was left to the third debater, District Attorney Denis E. Dillon of Nassau County, the Right to Life candidate, to point out that ethics had been ''a phony issue right from the start.'' ''Now,'' Mr. Dillon interjected. ''Why shouldn't the public think we're crooks when we spend our campaigns calling each other crooks with no evidence?'' Aides of Mr. Cuomo and Mr. O'Rourke said they had urged their candidates to remain on their best behavior. During the 90-minute session at The New York Times, Mr. Cuomo also declined to commit himself as to his plans for adjusting state taxes or revising rent guidelines. Mr. O'Rourke said he would like to see an inspector general at work in the school system, to ''find out how many computers never get out of the crates, how many teachers never turn up, how many temporary teachers can't pass exams, things like that.'' And Mr. Dillon said he thought the Governor should ''end public funding of abortions in this state.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MEESE, THE LAWMAN, CALLS FOR ANARCHY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/opinion/meese-the-lawman-calls-for-anarchy.html,"Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d asserted last week that legislatures and government officials are not bound by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution. They may contradict the Court and follow their own interpretations when enacting laws or adopting policies, he said. Although Mr. Meese's position is untenable, the reasons are more complicated than appear at first glance. Mr. Meese correctly observed that Congress and government officials, no less than courts, are obligated to decide constitutional questions. Before Congress enacts a law, for example, it should make sure that the measure does not violate the Bill of Rights or separation of powers. But this is a far cry from saying that Congress can overturn a decision already made by the Supreme Court. Although each branch must interpret the Constitution as best it can, the Constitution does not indicate who, if anyone, has the final word. For this, we must rely on two centuries of tradition and on what makes sense pragmatically. Our tradition is unequivocal in ceding the last word to the Court - subject, of course, to constitutional amendment. Although Mr. Meese accurately cites Madison and Lincoln as saying that each branch may interpret the Constitution for itself, no President or Congress since the Civil War has refused to abide by the Court's decisions. Our tradition of judicial supremacy arises from the fact that the so-called political branches have not developed trustworthy procedures for assessing the constitutionality of their enactments. On the contrary, the Constitution has been a nuisance to politicians who want to show voters their dedication to eradicating drugs, pornography and the budget deficit. Indeed, the pages of the Congressional Record are full of statements relegating constitutional questions to the courts. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law is the most recent example of the political branches' abdication of constitutional responsibilities. Congress hastily enacted the deficit-reduction bill and President Reagan immediately signed it, each ignoring constitutional defects that everyone knew the law contained. It required the Court, which did not have to grandstand to the electorate, to hold that the law transgressed the separation of powers. None of this is surprising. There is a familiar maxim that no person should be the judge in his own cause. It is almost impossible for the proponent of a policy to evaluate its constitutionality with detachment. Courts are comparatively impartial simply because they have not sponsored the laws they are required to review. Of course, traditions are not immutable. But it takes more than the Attorney General's assertion to change something so fundamental as the authority to make binding constitutional decisions. Before Congress and the executive could even consider contradicting the Court's interpretations, they would have to establish and observe nonpartisan, deliberative procedures for assessing the constitutionality of their own products. If the notion that the political branches could ever treat constitutional issues with judicial detachment seems implausible, this only shows how far Mr. Meese's proposition lies from the real world. Under any circumstances, the power to contradict the Supreme Court's decisions could be exercised only by the Court's two equals: Congress and the President. Our Federal system plainly denies such power to the states; the years of massive resistance to the 1954 school desegregation decision are a grim reminder of why this must be so. And within the Federal Government, anarchy would prevail if every official and agency were free to disregard the Court's rulings. Our tradition of according the judicial branch the last word on constitutional questions reflects our dedication to the rule of law. One might therefore wonder why, at this of all times, an Attorney General committed to ''law and order'' would propose a policy so likely to encourage disrespect for the courts. Would he have made the same speech if a majority of the Supreme Court supported the Administration's views on issues such as abortion and school prayer? The transparent political motives underlying Mr. Meese's radical proposal demonstrate why at least the Attorney General ought not be entrusted with the power to contradict judicial decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TERRIFIED AND FASCINATED BY HIS OWN LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/books/terrified-and-fascinated-by-his-own-life.html,"HIS WAY The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra. By Kitty Kelley. Illustrated. 575 pp. New York: Bantam Books. $21.95. HERE is Ava Gardner, bless her heart: ''Deep down, I'm pretty superficial.'' It's not every day you come across a sentence like that. Kitty Kelley, who hasn't got what you'd call a major sense of humor, solemnly reiterates Miss Gardner's remark without telling us whether Francis Albert Sinatra's second wife understood she was being funny when she gave utterance to this delicious sentence. That's too bad; and that's Ms. Kelley all over: all those facts - how she loves them! - and we still don't know what anyone's like. . . . Yes, we do know that Mr. Sinatra is no cream puff sweetie pie goody-two-shoes. We didn't, however, need Ms. Kelley to tell us that which we already surmised. Ms. Kelley is an evangelical writer, her vocation being to pen unauthorized biographies of people she has little affection and no empathy for, precisely those people who wish least to be written about and who have the power to exact silence from those who know and love -or fear - them best. Jacqueline Onassis (''Jackie Oh!'') and Elizabeth Taylor (''Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star'') were Ms. Kelley's previous marks. She scribbles with what can only be called a sense of retributive get-all-the-damning-facts-and-print-'em mission. I have enormous respect for facts. Do facts make up a life? Of course not. They don't even make up a story of a life. Facts, unsupported and uncolored by nuance, wrenched out of context, uninformed by lively wit, intelligence (or love), constitute, at best, a story about a story - in this case, a story about the story of an icon. Unless one believes Frank Sinatra Jr., Mia Farrow (Frank Sinatra's third wife) and Elizabeth Taylor (one of his lovers) - all of whom have made public statements attributing to the author inaccuracy or cupidity - Ms. Kelley is a good reporter. A good reporter can tell us a lot about Angola, inside trading on Wall Street, the new fall fashions; a good reporter, unless she is capable of an imaginative leap into someone else's consciousness, does not have access to the human heart (one cannot apply to the Justice Department for access thereto). Ms. Kelley is no leaper. Even if one were to suppose that facts are in and of themselves truth, could one then say that Ms. Kelley has command of the facts of Mr. Sinatra's life? No. Any one fact is dependent for its weight and significance on the facts that surround it. And for every one person Ms. Kelley interviewed - a host of scorned lovers, cast-aside friends and disgruntled former hangers-on - we may safely assume there are scores she did not. Some of them might have had even uglier stories to tell about Mr. Sinatra than those in ''His Way.'' On the other hand, it is possible that some people who chose silence or who had silence imposed on them by Mr. Sinatra - who sued to keep this book from being published - might have had something good to say about him (or something in healing contradiction to what is contradictory reporting by Ms. Kelley). We might then have been able to breathe. As it is, reading this recitation of one man's sins is as refreshing as inhaling carbon monoxide. Not a direct word is heard from any of Mr. Sinatra's four wives (according to the publisher, Miss Gardner spoke to an associate of Ms. Kelley's in London; the other former wives and Mr. Sinatra's present wife refused to talk to the author); not a word from two of his three children - indeed, scarcely a word is heard about one of them, Tina (under the theory, I suppose, that what Government committees investigating Mr. Sinatra's mob ties had to say to and about him is more revealing than anything that could be said by or about her). Kirk Douglas, Gregory Peck, Johnny Carson -all are listed as friends and none is heard from. Nor do we hear from such loyal-unto-death friends as the radio broadcaster William B. Williams. Remarkably few words are heard from the actors with whom Mr. Sinatra made more than 50 movies. Little enough is heard from musicians in general, and nothing is heard from black jazz musicians. How is it possible to write about Frank Sinatra in a manner that suggests his music is in some way extrinsic to him? We're not, after all, talking about some guy with a freak voice box that emits pleasant sounds. We're talking about a man whose music is -there's no other way to put this - wise; what he doesn't know about memory and desire, yearning and hard loving, tenderness and betrayal isn't worth knowing. That is what his voice tells us. How is it possible for Mr. Sinatra's life to tell us something entirely different? Everything he sings sounds autobiographical . . . and everything he sings, he sings to me. How can a man I love, a man my daughter loves, a man my father loved (we're talking about three generations here; by extension, we're talking about millions of people and we're talking silk and polyester because Frank Sinatra's appeal is not class-based) - how can this man hang out with mobsters, have his bodyguards beat up hapless fans and discarded women, ''pimp'' (as Peter Lawford unlovingly put it) for one President and grovel to another? How? Why? Can the Freedom of Information Act (which Ms. Kelley employed extensively) tell me why Mr. Sinatra is given, on the one hand, to vicious King-Kong tantrums and, on the other, to sweet family feeling and acts of fabulous generosity? It cannot. Ms. Kelley may be able to convince me that Mr. Sinatra associated with Chicago mobsters and that he - along with Eddie Fisher, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin - performed at a mob-owned nightclub without a fee in order to bring in the high rollers. She never tells me why (if they were so cozy) none of these wiseguys, so powerful, could or did come to Mr. Sinatra's aid when his career was on the skids in the late 1940's and early 50's and even his agent thought he was as good as dead. Ms. Kelley can't, in fact, tell me why Mr. Sinatra did anything. What are his demons? What terrible fear caused him to lose his voice (he opened his mouth and nothing came out) during the bad years and sometimes during the good years? Why did he have to conquer every attractive woman on the M-G-M lot? Ms. Kelley tells us that his mother sometimes dressed him in girl's clothes. He had more money and toys than the other kids on the block. And he was beaten and abused by his buddies when he was a teen-ager because of his success with women. So are we to assume that the answers all lie in his childhood? Are we meant to connect the dots? Ms. Kelley makes that difficult because her grasp of Italian immigrant life in Hoboken, N.J. (''where the air smelled of . . . garlic''), is, to put it kindly, unsure. Mr. Sinatra's mother, Dolly (to whom he was intensely loyal), was, Ms. Kelley alleges, an abortionist as well as a big mouth and a power in local New Jersey politics. What conclusions are we meant to draw from this? What did Dolly Sinatra's one son draw from this? What does Ms. Kelley make of this? (Does Ms. Kelley not approve of abortion? Or does she not approve of abortion when Mr. Sinatra's mother is the abortionist?) Ms. Kelley, because of her ignorance of immigrant life, fails to place Dolly Sinatra in context. She was profane! She swore! She called some of her son's women whores! So, exactly, what? Southern Italian immigrants of Dolly Sinatra's generation lived dangerously; the surrounding society gave them little choice. Their cursing was often a measure of their affection: ''Okay, you bastards. Into the kitchen. I've made some linguine.'' Very crude and unladylike of Dolly Sinatra. But ladies did not, as a rule, migrate to Hoboken. Ms. Kelley makes the assumption that quiet Martin Sinatra, Frank Sinatra's father, was ''emasculated'' by his wife. In Italian-American families, tough, noisy women are often the rule. And it is almost impossible for an outsider to locate the source of power in these families - the whole canny point being to deceive the outside world. IF I were to venture a guess about Frank Sinatra's demons, I'd say that he grew up dangerously - and in danger - and when, without time to shift psychic gears, he found himself elevated to an almost-unheard-of-celebrity, he continued to live dangerously, having become addicted to danger. Only, as our icon, the boy who was once clubbed became the man who clubbed; pity. Humphrey Bogart (whose wife, Lauren Bacall, had an affair with Mr. Sinatra while Mr. Bogart was dying of cancer - nobody in Hollywood seems to be able to control him or herself for more than five minutes) appears to have come close to understanding Mr. Sinatra: ''He's kind of a Don Quixote, tilting at windmills, fighting people who don't want to fight. He's a cop-hater. If he doesn't know who you are and you ask him a question, he thinks you're a cop.'' I'd say he is both terrified and fascinated by his own life, from which he draws insufficient joy: ''I was,'' Mr. Sinatra once said about his early career, ''I was everything. Happy, I don't know. It was the darnedest thing, wasn't it?'' There is every chance in the world that I am wrong. I'd like to be given an inspired explanation, an evocation or an inventive exploration of Mr. Sinatra's life. As I listen to him elegantly sing ''There used to be a ball park,'' - a song that raises nostalgia to an art - I ask myself whether his life springs from one set of impulses and needs and his work from another, or whether the same impulses and needs are acted out differently in his life and in his work - so radically differently as to give rise to the awful notion that Francis Albert Sinatra - a man bruised and bruising - is so divided as to be crazy. To try, in print, to reconcile irreconcilable differences is noble work; it is part of what biography is about, and it is labor to be proud of. Ms. Kelley undertook to write a biography of a man she justly calls one of the most fascinating men in the world; instead, she compiled facts. The facts break my heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
POLITICS; LOCAL ISSUES WILL DECIDE OUTCOMES ON ELECTION DAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/nyregion/politics-local-issues-will-decide-outcomes-on-election-day.html,"THE ballot for Tuesday's election will be a busy one, with contests for the House of Representatives and county and local offices and two public questions dealing with hazardous waste, but the outcomes of the races will generally be decided on local issues. There is no statewide election and no issue that cuts across the boundaries of the state's 14 Congressional districts. In fact, contests for County Executive in Essex and Bergen Counties, the state's two largest, are attracting as much interest as any of the races for the House of Representatives. Because of the lack of a statewide contest, turnouts across the state will vary, depending on the ability of the candidates to generate interest. Over all, state election officials estimate that fewer than half of the state's 3.7 million registered voters will participate. The polls will be open from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M. The public questions ask voters to approve raising $200 million through a bond issue to help finance a $1.6 billion, five-year toxic-waste cleanup program and to authorize spending $100 million from a 1981 bond issue for the same program. The political future of Peter Shapiro is on the line in his bid for a third term as the Essex County Executive. Mr. ShapiroC the unsuccessful Democratic challenger to Governor Kean's re-election last year, faces his second difficult race as a result of widespread discontent over rising county taxes. His opponent, Nicholas R. Amato, the County Surrogate, was a Democrat until he was dropped from the county ticket earlier this year and has switched to the Republican Party. The Republican State Committee, which believes Mr. Shapiro is vulnerable because of the tax issue, has put more than $100,000 into the Amato campaign. Voters in neighboring Bergen County will elect their first County Executive, and the victorious party will have control of the patronage that goes with the powerful new office. The Republican candidate is William D. McDowell, the county sheriff, and the Democrat is State Senator Matthew Feldman of the 37th District (part of Bergen County). Mr. McDowell, whose party controls the county's present Board of Chosen Freeholders, said that, if he won, he would oversee gradual changes in the operation of the county government. Mr. Feldman said he would initiate rapid and sweeping changes. The issues in the challenges to the state's eight Democrats and six Republicans in the House delegation are varied, but generally the challengers picture the incumbents as out of step with their constituents' concerns or pursuing a national agenda and paying little attention to their districts' needs in areas such as transportation and environmental cleanup. One incumbent, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., Democrat of the 10th District (parts of Essex and Union Counties), has no major party opponent. Elvin K. Terry, the Republican nominee, took his name off the ballot, saying he did not think he had a chance. Mr. Rodino's only opponent is Chris Brandlon, the Socialist Workers Party candidate. In addition to the major party candidates, the contests in several districts include independent and minor party candidates. The candidates, with the incumbent listed first, are: First District (Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties): James J. Florio, Democrat; Fred A. Busch, Republican, and Jerry Zeldin, Libertarian Party. Second District (Atlantic, Cape May, Cumnberland, Gloucester and Salem): William J. Hughes, Democrat; Alfred J. Bennington Jr., Republican, and Len Smith, Pro-Life, Anti-Abortion. Third District (Monmouth and Ocean): James J. Howard, Democrat, and Brian T. Kennedy, Republican. Fourth District (Burlington, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean): Christopher H. Smith, Republican; Jeffrey Laurenti, Democrat, and Earl G. Dickey, Stop Financing Communism. Fifth District (Bergen, Passaic and Sussex): Marge S. Roukema, Republican, and H. Vernon Jolley, Democrat. Sixth District (Middlesex, Monmouth and Union): Bernard J. Dwyer, Democrat; John D. Scalamonti, Republican, and Rose (Zeidwerg) Monyek, ''Inflation Fighting Housewife.'' Seventh District (Essex, Middlesex, Somerset and Union): Matthew J. Rinaldo, Republican, and June S. Fischer, Democrat. Eighth District (Bergen, Essex, Morris and Passaic): Robert A. Roe, Democrat, and Thomas P. Zampino, Republican. Ninth District (Bergen and Hudson): Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat, and Arthur F. Jones, Republican. Eleventh District (Essex, Morris, Sussex and Warren): Dean A. Gallo, Republican, and Frank Askin, Democrat. Twelfth District (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset, Sussex and Warren): James A. Courter, Republican, and David B. Crabiel, Democrat. Thirteenth District (Burlington, Camden and Ocean): H. James Saxton, Republican, and John Wydra, Democrat. Fourteenth District (Hudson): Frank J. Guarini, Democrat; Albio Sires, Republican; William Link, ''Let Freedom Ring,'' and Herbert H. Shaw, Port Authority Crooks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NATIONAL ROLE IS SEEN FOR ARIZONA NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/us/national-role-is-seen-for-arizona-nominee.html,"After a run of horrendously bad luck, Representative John McCain has been blessed with good fortune of an extraordinary kind, and he now seems poised to emerge as a significant figure in national politics, as a member of the United States Senate. Mr. McCain was born to a Navy career; his grandfather commanded aircraft carriers under Adm. William F. Halsey in World War II, and his father served as Commander in Chief, Pacific, in the Vietnam war. Mr. McCain himself, a naval aviator, seemed sure to become the family's third admiral. But even though he survived a terrible fire aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise in the Gulf of Tonkin, it was not to be. On Oct. 27, 1967, his A-4 Skyhawk was hit by enemy fire over North Vietnam. He ejected, breaking bones in both arms and one leg and falling into a lake in central Hanoi. His captors called him ''the crown prince,'' smashed one of his shoulders and kept him in solitary confinement for much of the next five and a half years. When he was let out, according to fellow captives, he was the very model of obstinacy. After the war, Mr. McCain, his hair turned silver by his ordeal and his body racked by arthritis, returned to active duty for a time, serving as a liaison officer in the Senate, where he made friends with a cross-section of its members, including William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, and Gary Hart, Democrat of Colorado. But his injuries ultimately forced his retirement. He and his young wife, Cindy, the daughter of a prosperous Phoenix beer distributor, decided to move to Arizona to start a new life. Mr. McCain had ''a general interest in politics,'' he said the other day, ''but no specific plans.'' New Luck in New Life Then the lucky breaks started. Representative John J. Rhodes, then the House minority leader, decided to retire in 1982. After a close four-way primary, Mr. McCain was elected to succeed him. He was also elected ''president'' of the freshman class in the House, made friends across the aisle with such Democrats as Morris K. Udall of Arizona and Paul Simon of Illinois, and was marked down as a ''comer.'' Then, some months ago, Senator Barry Goldwater, a symbol of the new conservatism since 1952, the Republican Presidential nominee in 1964, a much-beloved figure here and in Washington even among those who hated his ideology, announced his retirement, opening the way for Mr. McCain to win, the Republican senatorial nomination almost by acclamation. And then Gov. Bruce E. Babbitt, a popular conservative Democrat, decided that he could better pursue his Presidential ambitions free of the burdens of office than in the Senate. Suddenly, five years after arriving in the state, Mr. McCain had a clear path to a seat in the Senate. Despite a few stumbles - his hand-picked candidate for Governor was beaten in the primary by the man Mr. McCain describes as ''the Harold Stassen of Arizona politics,'' Evan Mecham - Mr. McCain has had little trouble with his Democratic opponent, Richard Kimball. Mr. Kimball has repeatedly attacked Mr. McCain as the captive of military contractors and as unfriendly to the elderly, but he has made no headway. A trio of recent opinion polls show the Republican with a lead ranging from 19 to 28 percentage points. Reputation in the House Mr. McCain, who is 50 years old, developed a reputation in his early days in the House as a ''Tip-baiter'': that is, as a member of the group of pugnacious Republicans, also including Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who often clashed with the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts. They disagreed most sharply on aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, which Mr. McCain backs, although equally vociferously, reflecting his Vietnam experience, he opposes the idea of sending American troops to Central America. He also opposed sending the Marines to Lebanon. In recent years, however, he has taken a much more moderate stand, particularly on social issues. He has worked hard on Indian affairs, he applauds Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York not so much for his economic philosophy but because ''he's the one man in our party who consistently voices concern for blacks and other people who are underprivileged.'' Mr. McCain has backed sanctions against South Africa and he has voted with the environmentalists on a number of issues affecting Arizona. Mr. McCain says he admires Mr. Goldwater's ''integrity and honor,'' but he makes it clear that he has no intention of becoming the new ''Mr. Conservative.'' At a campaign rally in nearby Mesa on Sunday night, for example, Mr. McCain told of a recent conversation with the Senator. ''He assured me that if he had won in 1964,'' Mr. McCain said, ''I would never have been in a Vietnamese prison camp.'' ''I guess that's right,'' he said he answered, alluding to Mr. Goldwater's reputation for foreign policy bellicosity, ''it would have been a Chinese prison camp.'' On domestic matters, Mr. McCain said he tried to bear in mind the changes that have transformed Arizona since Mr. Goldwater wrote ''The Conscience of a Conservative'' 30 years ago. In 1950, Phoenix had 106,000 residents; now the metropolitan area is approaching a population of two million. ''Many of those people came from California and the Midwest,'' he said, ''and they don't care very deeply about school prayer and abortion. They're in favor of one and opposed to the other, and so am I, but what they are really concerned about is better education, clean air, ample water supplies and so on. They aren't ideologues at all.'' If elected, Mr. McCain expects to devote much of his time to foreign policy. He says he does not want to spend his energies ''just counting warheads'' but wants to address larger strategic questions ''defining what our national interests are much more carefully, so we can spend our national defense dollars more intelligently.'' People in both parties here and in Washington expect him to make a big impact. Robert E. B. Allen, Mr. Babbitt's closest political associate, said: ''Because of his background, John will be able to take tough stands that others might be penalized for. I think he's going to be an outstanding Senator.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SESTINAS AND WISECRACKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/books/sestinas-and-wisecracks.html,"ANAGRAMS By Lorrie Moore. 225 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $15.95. IN Lorrie Moore's ''Anagrams,'' there's a fierce, hot eye that makes you wonder whether you're going to be stranded in the familiar desert of the modern imagination. But the book has a saving grace: Benna Carpenter - who is either a poet, teacher, nightclub singer, aerobics instructor or all of these - is appealing as the heroine of this extraordinary and often hilarious first novel. She sees the irony of her situation, describing her meetings with her imaginary friend, Eleanor, as ''The Great White Wine'' - ''whiney white people getting together over white wine and whining.'' Benna's closest real friend is a musician, Gerard Maines. Their apartments share a thin wall, and Gerard sits one night, dopey with love, fully dressed in his dry bathtub, waiting for Benna to return, yearning only for the sound of her toilet flushing. Gerard loves Benna, and she kind of likes him. This is their first attempt to make love: ''We ended up in my bed together, sort of, spastic and looped, doomed for failure, like two senile inventors in an upstairs room, lonely as spoons. The whole business finally seemed less an expres-sion of mutual attraction than a soft, noodly act of existentialism.'' Benna and Gerard eventually do become lovers, and she sits in a rinky-dink cocktail lounge where he sings and plays piano and dreams of becoming an opera star. Then Benna gets pregnant, the imaginary Eleanor sleeps with Gerard, and Benna has an abortion. Miraculously, the relationship between Benna and Gerard not only survives these events but becomes a deep, close friendship. Throughout all of this we are treated to Benna's reflections, which often take the form of quirky, fond musings on words: '' 'Have fun in Tunis,' I'd say as he disappeared off to rehearsals. I liked to say Tunis. It sounded obscene, like a rarely glimpsed body part.'' Words roll around in Benna's mind like Life Savers on a tongue. Beneath the sweet pleasure of play, however, we sense her need for something else, some deeper articulation that will exorcise distance, bring her love and keep her from death. Watching a flock of birds, she muses: ''From four blocks away I could see that the flock had a kind of group-life, a recognizable intelligence; no doubt in its random flutters there were patterns, but alone any one of those black birds would not have known what was up. Alone, as people live, they would crash their heads against walls.'' To avoid hitting the wall, Benna falls in love with Darrel, a black Vietnam veteran who is taking her poetry class. Race is something Benna tries to avoid through her almost magical belief that whatever separates us can be overcome if we find the right words. She assigns sestinas to her poetry class, writing on the blackboard the end words ''race, white, erotic, lost, need, love, leave.'' Darrel raises his hand and says that's seven words, not six. Benna erases ''love,'' then changes her mind and erases ''white.'' It is a loss in the novel that this particular relationship is not developed further. It's unfortunate too that the changes of place and point of view in the beginning chapters interrupt and confuse us, so that we move away from the story. Some of the early chapters read almost as if they were independent entities, and it may be that Ms. Moore's talents as a short-story writer, revealed in her collection, ''Self-Help,'' tempted her in that direction. These opening chapters are like a magnificent engine alone on its track. We watch, waiting for the hookup, which we get only in the last section of the book. Here we meet a wondrous 6-year-old, Georgianne Michelle Carpenter, who is Benna's imaginary daughter. And it is here that so much of the power and impact of the novel begin to make themselves felt. George and Benna have a very good time: a sweet happiness flows between them as they watch the news, take showers together on Saturday mornings to the tunes of Broadway shows, dust the living room and revel in the intimacy of sickroom caresses and goodnight kisses. Benna loves Georgianne intensely, and in this love, which is sustained only by words, we discover how much this novel is about language, about the power of sounds to slice through the darkness, and through meaning to join us. It is a tribute to Lorrie Moore's talent that the reader believes in Georgianne. UNEXPECTEDLY, Gerard dies, a brutal blow to Benna, who makes one last, painful effort to connect by visiting her lost, hapless brother, Louis. When she and Louis wind up watching a sitcom about a dog on Christmas day in a dreary Queens apartment, Benna's humor erupts in a swift, savage swipe: ''Her mind wandered. She thought of pets growing tired and committing suicide, what notes they would leave: 'Dear Benna: It's all a crazy game. Farewell, Max, Your Schnauzer.' '' We think Benna may now have lost her real connections in the world. But we're wrong. There are stronger ties still. There are Benna's gifts, imagination and language - and there is the child, Georgianne. Benna's love for this child - like ''Anagrams'' itself - is a powerful example of how imagination can save us with temporary pleasures. In a Constant State of Surprise When Lorrie Moore's characters want to behave in unconventional ways, she gives in to their whims. ''When you write a novel, you are supposed to keep characters on a linear path. But in 'Anagrams' my characters wanted to do mutually exclusive things and since it was my novel, I decided they could do anything they wanted to do,'' said the 29-year-old author in a telephone interview from her home in Madison, where she teaches fiction workshops at the University of Wisconsin. She insisted that her characters and situations are completely fictional. But like her main character, Benna, she is intrigued by the power of imagination and language. ''Overall, the novel is about the enterprise of making fictions,'' she said. ''I was inspired by the idea of an anagram, which is the rearrangement of characters to make a new word. What I did was rearrange characters to make new worlds.'' While this may sound playful, she admitted that the novel has some serious concerns. ''I think of it as a novel about solitude, imagination, hysteria and childlessness. In each of the sections the characters confront childlessness in different ways.'' Ms. Moore seemed detached from the praise for her first book, ''Self-Help,'' a collection of short stories originally written as a master's thesis. Even so, she confesses that the whole process of publishing is ''overwhelming.'' ''I was surprised mostly when Knopf bought my first book - since then I've been in a constant state of surprise. You're so alone when you write that you tend to be unaffected by reviews. You only wonder whether you can write something again you can believe in.'' - Barbara Lovenheim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GOVERNOR'S RACE TAKES TO STREETS IN THE CAMPAIGN'S LAST WEEKEND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/nyregion/governor-s-race-takes-to-streets-in-the-campaign-s-last-weekend.html,"Only three days before the election, New York's gubernatorial race finally turned to some old-fashioned street campaigning yesterday. Governor Cuomo urged a rally of a thousand Brooklynites to help him by electing Democratic legislators, while his Republican opponent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, went to Queens to say that a vote for Republicans was a vote for honesty. The full day of politicking was unusual in a race in which Mr. Cuomo has declined to campaign, choosing instead to appear as gubernatorial as possible, and Mr. O'Rourke, strapped for money and hampered by the Governor's strategy, has had trouble getting his message to the voters. Record Margins Sought In addition to the governor, New York voters will select a United States senator and other statewide officials Tuesday in an election where the major question appears to be not the outcome, but how large the victory margins will be. Mr. Cuomo and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican challenged by Mark Green, are seeking record margins of victory. The polls will be open from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. Connecticut voters will choose their governor, senator, six members of the House of Representatives, and both houses of the General Assembly. Polls there will be open from 6 A.M. to 8 P.M. New Jersey voters will elect the state's 14 members of the House of Representatives, executives in Bergen and Essex Counties, and will vote on a $200 million bond issue for toxic waste cleanup. Polls will open from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M. In New York, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. D'Amato are favored by polls and politicians to win re-election handily. Most incumbents are also expected to win re-election to the House of Representatives, the State Senate, the State Assembly, county offices and judgeships from the State Supreme Court to district courts. ''It will be the year of the incumbent,'' said the Conservative Party chairman, Serphin R. Maltese, echoing politicians of all parties. However, four Republican Representatives - Bill Green in Manhattan, Joseph J. DioGuardi in Westchester and Fred J. Eckert and George C. Wortley in central New York - face stiff challenges. Mr. DioGuardi's opponent is Bella S. Abzug, who once represented the West Side of Manhattan and was considered one of the most outspoken and colorful members of the House. In three of the state's 34 House districts there is no incumbent. In addition to the four House races, Democrats hope that the trend favoring incumbents can be broken by candidates for the State Senate. The party thinks Mr. Cuomo's political appeal may help it win control of the Senate, giving the Democrats control of both the legislative and executive branches. The Senate has been controlled by Republicans for decades and party leaders expressed confidence that they would survive a Cuomo tide. The Assembly has been a Democratic preserve since the 1960's and even the most optimistic Republican leaders do not expect that to change. The scandals and corruption indictments that have rocked the Koch administration and the Democratic Party in the Bronx and Queens are apparently having almost no effect, although Mr. O'Rourke, who has fluctuated in his use of the issue, made reference to it yesterday in street campaigning in Queens. Targets of Inquiry Three Bronx Democrats who are targets of separate investigations are among the incumbents expected to win: State Senator Joseph L. Galiber, currently on trial on corruption charges; Representative Mario Biaggi, under investigation by Federal prosecutors, and Surrogate Bertram Gelfand, under investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct for more than a year over sexual harassment allegations. A key legislative race is the effort of Democratic Assemblyman Albert Vann to win re-election on the Liberal Party line. He had lost the Democratic nomination beause of faulty petitions. Last year he ran unsuccessfully for Brooklyn borough president and played a leading role in the unsuccesful effort to defeat Mayor Koch. More than eight million voters, about half of them Democrats, are eligible to vote in New York. In the last three elections for governor, about five million New Yorkers voted - from 71 to 75 percent of those registered. New Jersey election officials say 48 percent of the state's 3.7 million registered voters are expected to vote. The turnout is expected to be highest in the two largest counties, where there are races for county executive. In Essex County, the incumbent, Peter Shapiro, a Democrat, faces Nicholas R. Amato, the Couty Surrogate, who switched to the Republican party for the election. Bergen County is electing its first executive. Voters will chose between William D. McDowell, the county sheriff and a Republican, and Senator Matthew Feldman, Democrat of Teaneck. Heading the ticket for Conneticut's 1.67 million eligible voters is the governor's race, pitting the incumbent, William A. O'Neill, against State Representative Julie D. Belaga of Westport. United States Senator Christoper J. Dodd, a Democrat, is being challenged for a second term by Roger W. Eddy, the state's Republican National Committeeman. In New York, Cuomo campaign strategists acknowledge that their goal is to win with at least 58.5 percent of the vote, the record for a contest for governor, set by Grover Cleveland 104 years ago. Four years ago, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan established the record for a Senate candidate in the state with a 65 percent victory. Those are the numbers both the Governor and Mr. D'Amato are reaching for. The key to such a large victory for Mr. Cuomo will be Republican voters, just as defecting Democrats are even more critical for Mr. D'Amato in a state where Republicans comprise about one third of the registration. Eye on White House The Governor has said he is not a candidate for President but his closest aides do not discourage the belief of other politicians that he will start running for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination sometime next year. Another potential Presidential candidate, Representative Jack F. Kemp, a Republican, is on the ballot in western New York, seeking his eighth term in the House. He is favored to win easily. The Governor is trying to keep Republicans in his camp with a television commercial that began airing this weekend and that asks voters of all parties to support Mr. Cuomo. It includes a past statement by Senator D'Amato that Mr. Cuomo is ''a strong Governor.'' Mr. Cuomo is spending about $250,000 on his last week of commercials, more than twice what Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Green are spending. Mr. D'Amato is spending $600,000 for television in the last week. At the same time, Mr. O'Rourke is trying to shore up his Republican vote and head off a possible rout. He campaigned in Republican areas of Queens yesterday and has arranged appearances in every major city in normally Republican upstate today and tomorrow. A second new Cuomo commercial features the Governor appealing for voters to cast their ballots even if not for him. Cuomo aides fear that a small turnout could tarnish his anticipated victory or at the very least reduce his popular vote plurality. Politicians generally fear that the vote will be low because of the widespread perception that there are no real contests at the top of the ticket. In the Democratic primary in September to choose Mr. D'Amato's opponent, only 13 percent of the Democratic electorate turned out, a record low for a statewide primary. Also strongly favored to win are Representative Stanley N. Lundine, Mr. Cuomo's choice for lieutenant governor, who has been an almost invisible campaigner, and another Democrat, Attorney General Robert Abrams. Their Republican opponents are Ulster County District Attorney Michael Kavanagh and Nassau County Comptroller Peter T. King, respectively. The only Republican among the state officials, the Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, is also favored for re-election. However, he has not been quite as strong in the polls as the other incumbents and his Democratic opponent, Herman Badillo, is hoping for what he calls ''the sandwich effect'' - that Democrats voting for the Governor and Mr. Abrams on either side of Mr. Badillo on the ballot will stay on the Democratic or Liberal Party line to support him. Problem for Minor Parties A significant contest involves the gubernatorial vote of the three minor parties - the Conservative Party, which is supporting Mr. O'Rourke; the Liberal Party, which endorsed the Governor, and the Right to Life Party, which ran its own candidate for governor, Nassau County District Attorney Denis E. Dillon, a Democrat. Polls by candidates and a newspaper have indicated a Dillon vote of three to six percent or 150,000 to 300,000 votes. Four years ago, the party polled 52,000 votes for governor and dropped from fourth to fifth place in party ranking on the voting machine, a position that is established by the gubernatorial vote. Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader, expressed concern about the Right to Life Party showing and urged voters who are for abortion rights to express their views by voting the Liberal line. New York voters will also decide on a proposed $1.45 billion bond issue to clean up hundreds of toxic waste dumps in the state. Both the governor and Mr. O'Rourke support the bond issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An Incredible Endorsement for the Senate; What Is He Delivering?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/03/opinion/l-an-incredible-endorsement-for-the-senate-what-is-he-delivering-911286.html,"To the Editor: Your arguments against Mark Green for Senator are ironic at best. You criticize him for not demonstrating support among Democrats, yet he resoundingly won the Democratic primary - a stunning upset in a race in which he was outspent six to one. Mr. Green has also won the endorsements of key officeholders, party figures and policy makers, including that of his former opponent John Dyson. You condemn him for not having ''broad'' support after the press displayed a near blackout on the senatorial campaign. You purport to measure his qualifications but don't address, much less criticize, his record or positions, except to praise him for advocating ''sensible deregulation'' and for not being ''a doctrinaire liberal.'' You acknowledge Alfonse D'Amato's acquiescence in corruption as Town of Hempstead Presiding Supervisor and his role as sole character witness for an organized-crime figure. But you quickly dismiss these infractions by confusing the issue with Mr. D'Amato's euphemistic slogan, ''He delivers.'' When the Senator obtains Federal aid for New York after voting to have it cut, how much can he be congratulated? What is he delivering when he votes to cut Social Security, Medicare, and aid and loans for New York students? Whom is he representing when he is a sponsor of a bill to make all abortions a capital offense, as he did early in his term? How much of a ''clear appreciation of public outrage over drugs'' does he have when he votes to cut millions of dollars from antidrug programs for New York? By voting consistently in correlation with his contributions from special interests (totaling $1.3 million) like the handgun lobby, defense contractors and oil companies (as documented in The Wall Street Journal), Senator D'Amato, not Mark Green, provokes ''inevitable questions about his capacity to represent all of New York.''

GREEN CROSSES THE STATE IN A CLOSING-DAY WHIRL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/nyregion/green-crosses-the-state-in-a-closing-day-whirl.html,"While Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato took a respite from the campaign trail today, apparently comfortable with his lead in the polls, his Democratic challenger, Mark Green, was making a hectic, last-day whirl around the state. He flew into Long Island from Albany, drove to Manhattan, flew to Buffalo, then drove by van to Rochester and on to Syracuse. ''I'll campaign as long as it's purposeful,'' he said, as the roadsides of upstate New York zipped by. At every stop, on the steps of the State Supreme Court in Mineola, L.I., flanked by Governor Cuomo and 15 children at the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Head Start Program on East 70th Street, outside the Erie County Hall and the Rochester City Hall and inside a hotel in Syracuse, he trumpeted the same theme, that he is a family Democrat committed to supporting programs and laws that benefit women and children. ''I want a policy that's pro-family, not unwittingly anti-family,'' Mr. Green said at the Head Start Program. He then listed a few of his opponent's positions, saying that Mr. D'Amato was against a woman's right to have an abortion, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment and pay equity for women. ''I would support all of those,'' he said. Governor Cuomo urged Mr. Green's election. ''Mark Green, I predict, is going to shock you tomorrow with the results,'' Mr. Cuomo said. But though he was surrounded by giggling, singing children - and the Governor - in Manhattan, Mr. Green faced only a brisk wind and two television reporters in Buffalo. ''This is the 19th time I've come to Buffalo,'' he said, with his wife, Deni Frand, and their 7-year-old daughter, Jenya, beside him. ''If I come here anymore, I'll have to pay property taxes.'' 'It's a Strategy' Once in Rochester, he stood among a handful of supporters outside City Hall. ''I joked at first that my goal was to peak at the wire,'' he told them. ''It's no longer a joke. It's a strategy.'' Once in Syracuse, he again stressed his daily theme of the family. Then he reminded the 100 or so supporters and local politicians assembled that he had just visited Syracuse on Saturday, and he ticked off a list of seven cities he had visited in the last 24 hours. ''I may be a senator who'll wear you out, but I'll never be a senator who'll let you down,'' he said, then headed for his flight back to New York City and Election Day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURT UPHOLDS FUNDS FOR FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/court-upholds-funds-for-family-planning-clinic.html,"The Supreme Court ruled today that states may not deny family planning grants to private groups merely because they use money from other sources to offer abortions and abortion counseling. The 5-to-3 decision was issued without an opinion and without full briefing or oral arguments. It affirmed a Federal appellate decision striking down a 1980 Arizona provision barring grants of state money that year to any groups that ''offer abortions, abortion procedures, counseling for abortion procedures or abortion referrals.'' The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Constitution bars states from denying state money to a group providing state-approved family planning services merely because that group also provides abortion services and abortion counseling, a form of free speech. This was the ruling the Supreme Court affirmed. Direct Financing Ban Upheld On the other hand, the appellate court upheld a related provision of the Arizona law, which barred use of state money to pay directly for abortions, counseling or other abortion-related services. The Supreme Court did not rule directly on the constitutionality of that provision. Today's action left intact previous Court decisions upholding Federal and state laws that bar direct use of public money to pay for abortions. The Court has previously indicated that those decisions did not necessarily mean that states may penalize groups providing abortion-related services by cutting off state financing for other services approved by the state. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Associate Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia, dissenting from today's action, said the Court should have ordered full briefing and oral arguments in the case. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor disqualified herself. She did not offer a reason. In the past, members of her family have worked in behalf of Planned Parenthood, one of the parties in the case, creating a possible conflict of interest. Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and John Paul Stevens, the only members of the Court who have consistently supported broad abortion rights, voted to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision. Narrow Interpretation Expected While today's ruling theoretically set a precedent binding on all lower courts, such ''summary affirmances'' without opinions are read narrowly, as governing only situations virtually identical to the one resolved by the Court's ruling. Somewhat similar state laws in Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana and North Dakota have previously been struck down by lower courts. While anti-abortion groups denounced the decision, Babbitt v. Planned Parenthood, No. 86-369, some abortion rights activists said they were not pleased either. ''These five Supreme Court Justices in effect told the State of Arizona, 'We five know we favor abortion, so don't bother us with legal arguments,' '' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion group. Janet Benshoof of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the lawyers for the two Arizona chapters of Planned Parenthood that were involved in the case, said, ''It's not going to have much value as a precedent.'' She said it was ''disturbing'' that today's action had not been unanimous. 'A Free Speech Issue' ''This was a free speech issue, whether the state can penalize organizations that engage in speech about abortion by denying them state funding,'' Ms. Benshoof asserted. She said she had hoped that even the Justices who oppose abortion rights would agree that the Arizona law violated the First Amendment right of free speech because it penalized groups that offer abortion counseling. The state had argued in its appeal that the only way to make sure state money for family-planning programs would not be used for abortion and abortion-related services was to cut off the financing of the two Planned Parenthood chapters that provide such services in the state. The appellate court rejected this argument, on the ground that the state could monitor Planned Parenthood's use of state money to make sure it was spent on services unrelated to abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VERMONT GOVERNOR MAY FAIL TO GET MAJORITY SHE NEEDS TO WIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/vermont-governor-may-fail-to-get-majority-she-needs-to-win.html,"Political experts in Vermont say Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, a Democrat, may win the largest number of votes Tuesday, but fall short of the 50 percent majority required for election by the Vermont State Constitution. That would throw the contest into the hands of the Legislature. ''It really looks like Madeleine will win a plurality but not a majority,'' said James Welch, the executive editor of The Burlington Free Press. ''So it will go to the Legislature, where anything can happen.'' Under the Vermont Constitution, a candidate for statewide office must receive at least one vote more than 50 percent, or have the outcome determined by a joint vote of the two houses of the Legislature. The situation is complicated by the requirement that the vote be held by the legislators who will be elected Tuesday. Democrats and Republicans now hold an equal number of seats in the state House and Senate. She Says She Is 'Confident' Mrs. Kunin, a 53 year-old Swiss-born liberal Democrat, said today: ''I am confident I can still make the 50 percent majority, though it will be close.'' Two polls conducted at the end of October for The Burlington Free Press and The Rutland Herald gave her 43 to 46 percent of likely voters. Her Republican challenger, Lieut. Gov. Peter P. Smith, got 31 to 32 percent, and Bernard Sanders, the Socialist Mayor of Burlington, who is running as an independent, received 11 to 12 percent. The polls each surveyed 500 likely voters. The margin of sampling error is four percentage points either way. It is Mr. Sanders's presence in the race that has hurt Mrs. Kunin the most, political analysts here agree, because he draws votes away from her on Vermont's increasingly active left. If the election is thrown into the Legislature, Mrs. Kunin insists she will still win, since ''it would disenfranchise the people of Vermont'' if the legislators voted for a candidate who did not receive the most votes. Three Times It Did Otherwise But the Legislature has three times not elected the person with the most votes. And in 1976 a Republican-dominated legislature chose T. Garry Buckley, a Republican, over John Alden, a Democrat, for lieutenant governor, though Mr. Alden won a plurality in the popular election. Mrs. Kunin, praised for strengthening Vermont's already stringent environmental laws, erasing a large budget deficit and increasing state aid to education, has been hurt by the energy thrown into two other elections here this fall. These are the Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, Patrick J. Leahy, and former Gov. Richard A. Snelling, the Republican nominee, and a referendum question for Vermont to adopt the equal rights amendment in its state Constitution. ''An awful lot of people who supported Madeleine in 1984 have gone off to work for Leahy or the E.R.A.,'' said Garrison Nelson, a professor of political science at the University of Vermont. ''Her campaign hasn't generated much excitement this time, and she has lost a lot of her volunteers. Some liberals are trying to send her a message.'' Senator Leahy appears a strong favorite for re-election against Mr. Snelling, a popular four-term former governor whom the Reagan White House urged to enter the race. Reagan Cancels Plan to Visit The two polls taken last week gave Senator Leahy 58 to 60 percent of the likely voters, with only 30 to 34 percent for Mr. Snelling. Mr. Snelling's showing has been so disappointing that Mr. Reagan backed out of a campaign stop in Vermont. Mr. Nelson attributed Senator Leahy's success in part to ''a superb campaign organization, the best we've ever seen in Vermont.'' Mary Beth Cahill, Senator Leahy's campaign director, also pointed to Vermont's tradition of not turning out incumbent senators and the negative tone of Mr. Snelling's campaign, ''which people in Vermont resent.'' At the advice of the Washington political consulting concern of Black, Manafort & Stone, Mr. Snelling has attacked Senator Leahy as a big spender and as failing to attend meetings of the Senate Agriculture Committee, of which he is a member. Emotional Campaign on E.R.A. The most emotional contest has been the state equal rights question. Although the proposed amendment died as a national cause when the time for passing a Federal constitutional amendment ran out in 1982, three states short of the two-thirds needed for ratification, it is still alive in some states. Five attempts to add an equal rights amendment to a state constitution have been defeated in the last nine years, most recently in Maine, where supporters were given an unexpected lashing in 1984. Nicholas Monsarrat, managing editor of The Rutland Herald, said he expected the amendment to win in Vermont next week, but by a very narrow vote. One reason is that nearly all the major candidates have voiced support for it. Another is that in recent years Vermont has become increasingly liberal, with an influx of people from Boston and New York who brought their political activism to the Green Mountains. Increase in Immigration According to the Census Bureau, the number of Vermont's 535,000 residents born out of state increased to more than a third in 1980 from a fifth in 1960. The pro-equal rights amendment forces in Vermont have also been well-organized to counter widespread negative ads, some of which say that passage of the amendment would lead to more abortions and homosexual marriages. If Mrs. Kunin is re-elected, it is possible Vermont could become the first state in the country to have women as both governor and lieutenant governor. Susan Auld, a moderate Republican who is the majority leader in the state House of Representatives, is locked in a close race for the lieutenant governor's spot. Mrs. Kunin's running mate, who must be elected separately, is Howard Dean of Burlington, a Democratic member of the Vermont House.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURT WON'T HEAR 2 BUSING APPEALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/court-won-t-hear-2-busing-appeals.html,"The Supreme Court declined today to resolve an apparent conflict among Federal appellate courts on how to deal with efforts by school boards to dismantle court-ordered desegregation plans, which could be the most important desegregation issue of the next decade. To the surprise of some legal experts, the Court declined to review both a ruling that allowed Norfolk, Va., to end its court-ordered busing of elementary children and a seemingly conflicting ruling against the school board in Oklahoma City. In another case, the Court decided in a 5-to-3 ruling that states may not deny family planning grants to otherwise eligible private groups merely because they use money from other sources to offer abortions and abortion counseling. [ Page A27. ] In brief orders denying review in the desegregation case, only Associate Justice Byron R. White said he wanted to hear the cases, which the Court has been mulling for several weeks. None of the Court's members wrote opinions to explain their votes. Speculation on Decision There was speculation among Court observers that some Justices concluded it would be better to leave lower courts with broad discretion for the moment, even at the risk of inconsistencies, than to lay down a national rule specifying legal standards for ending court-ordered desegregation plans. Some civil rights lawyers privately indicated concern that, by declining to prevent Norfolk from dismantling its court-ordereded busing plan, the Court might have given encouragement to other cities considering similar steps. Rex E. Lee, a Washington lawyer who was Solicitor General of the United States from 1981 to 1985 and who represented the Oklahoma City school board in one case, said that ''in my opinion this is the most important unresolved issue in the school desegregation area.'' Mr. Lee, while expressing surprise at the Court's action, noted that ''many times the Court feels more comfortable waiting for a time before it tackles the real blockbuster issues.'' The Norfolk plan, in ending busing, assigned nearly 40 percent of black students from kindergarten through sixth grade to 10 virtually all-black schools near virtually all-black public housing complexes. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld this plan on the basis of a 1975 ruling by a Federal district judge that the school system had achieved ''unitary'' status, or desegregation, by successfully using busing and other means to end official segregation of schools there. It held that this finding freed the school board to end busing and assign students to the schools nearest their homes, as long as its purpose was not racial discrimination. It said the plan had the legitimate purpose of producing enough schools with a majority of white students to end ''white flight,'' which the courts found had been caused by busing, and to attract whites back to the city's schools. Appeal by Black Parents ''This is a case of enormous and sweeping impact,'' lawyers for black parents said in their Supreme Court appeal, Riddick v School Board, No. 85-1962. ''The rule of law announced by the courts below would - if followed generally - permit a very general resegregation of the public schools of the South.'' The Reagan Administration has applauded the Norfolk plan, adopted in 1983 and put into effect when schools opened Sept. 2, as a model for other communities seeking to end court-ordered busing. The Supreme Court cleared the way in June for the Norfolk plan to go into effect this fall by refusing a request by black parents for an interim order to continue the 15-year-old busing plan while their appeal was pending. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit issued a decision in June in the Oklahoma case that conflicted with at least part of the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in the Norfolk case. The 10th Circuit court held that a school district seeking to dismantle a court-ordered busing plan must meet a heavy burden of justification, regardless of its status as a ''unitary'' system. The 10th Circuit court ordered further court proceedings on a challenge by black parents to the Oklahoma City school board's decision to end busing of students in grades 1 through 4 and place them in neighborhood schools. The school board's appeal, which the Supreme Court turned down today, was Board of Education v Dowell, No. 86-326.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN; FROM GAMBLING TO ECOLOGY, VOTERS IN 43 STATES TAKE UP BALLOT ISSUES TODAY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/political-campaign-gambling-ecology-voters-43-states-take-up-ballot-issues-today.html,"Voters in several states where moral opposition to gambling has been strong in the past must decide Tuesday whether to turn to it as a way to offset declining tax revenue. Although government-sponsored lotteries and other gambling have become common in many places, particularly in the Northeast, as an easy means of helping to finance education or other public services, most inland states have held out. Now, however, states whose economies are dependent on agriculture and natural resources, or on manufacturing hurt by foreign imports, have found themselves squeezed between rising demands for services and loss of tax money. Largely because of this, Kansas, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oregon, Missouri and Florida have gambling propositions on the ballot in the general election. #226 Statewide Issues Face Voters The proposals have sparked controversy. ''A strong Montana society is built on hard work, patience and sustained effort,'' says the leader of the opposition to a Montana lottery referendum, the Rev. George Harper, a Methodist. ''Lotteries sell fantasy values and take advantage of human weaknesses.'' The ballot propositions on gambling are among 226 statewide initiatives, those originated by citizen petition, and referendums, those proposed by legislatures or other government bodies, before voters in 43 states. And most, like the ones on gambling, deal with tough, emotional issues that many citizens as well as the elected representative bodies of government prefer to take directly to the electorate for a decision. They include abortion, toxic waste disposal, tax limitation, criminal punishment and educational reforms, among others. In addition to statewide ballot propositions, hundreds of similar proposals will be decided by voters in counties or cities. Increasing Use of Ballot Use of the popular vote to bypass elected officials or to relieve them of the responsibility of dealing with difficult issues, has been high for close to a decade. Though used often in the past, the ballot proposition increased in popularity in the late 1970's, according to those who have been observing the development, who cite a growing distrust in elected officials. Its use increased rapidly when California voters put a ceiling on property taxes in 1978, resulting in a vast reduction of local governments' revenue and causing a shift to the state of many services. The movement reached its peak in 1982, according to David Schmidt, the director of the Initiative Resource Center, a private research group based in Washington, and has remained at that level since. But the process seems to be more intense this year, according to Kristin R. Blair, associate editor of Initiative and Referendum Report, a monthly periodical published in Washington, because of the emotional nature of the issues and the fact that interest groups promoting these direct votes are better organized. The process has become institutionalized in many states. ''There are two party systems in Massachusetts - the Democratic Party and the referendum party,'' says a Democratic state legislator, Jack Flood, noting the weakness of the Republican Party there. ''When the Democratic Party doesn't respond, the referendum party takes matters in its hands. They did it in 1980 with Proposition 2 1/2,'' a measure that cut local property taxes to a maximum of 2.5 percent of the market value of a community's real estate. ''And now they're doing it with tax caps,'' he said, referring to an effort to limit growth in state tax revenue to the level of growth in residents' wages and salaries. Gambling Five of the six states considering lotteries - Kansas, Idaho, Montana, North and South Dakota - have serious budget problems and have been experiencing difficulty raising taxes to pay for services. In South Dakota, Secretary of State Alice Kundert said the lottery proposal was closely tied to the slumping farm economy and may well pass for that reason, despite strong opposition. She pointed out that a vast majority in the Legislature signed the bill that placed the referendum on the ballot and said the need for new revenue was the primary reason. The same motives were said to be behind parimutuel wagering propositions on ballots in Missouri and Kansas and to some extent the proposed legalization of charity raffles in Oregon, where private contributions are of increasing importance in a number of depressed communities. In Florida, where there is relative prosperity but strong opposition to new taxes, there are propositions for both a lottery, estimated to bring the state as much as $300 million a year, and for allowing counties to permit gambling casinos in hotels, which proponents say would help the state's tourist industry. Casino gambling has been defeated by Florida voters in the past and Gov. Bob Graham is among those organizing opposition to it this year, but the lottery has the support of a number of state officials who hope to use new revenue for education. Abortion The long-divisive issue of abortion is on the ballot in only four states - Arkansas, Massachusetts, Oregon and Rhode Island - but both sides are waging major campaigns in those states because of what the outcome may portend. The immediate effect, if the propositions pass, would be to restrict the spending of state tax money for abortions, but the measures in Arkansas and Rhode Island would make abortions constitutionally illegal if and when the Supreme Court reverses its landmark 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade, establishing a woman's right to have an abortion. Reversal of that decision is a prime goal of the ''right to life'' movement, and the opportunity for President Reagan, who opposes abortion, to appoint justices has spurred the movement's leaders to prepare for the time when the states would again decide the legality of abortions. The National Abortion Rights Action League, which supports a woman's freedom to decide about abortion, says such a reversal is ''a grim possibility given the newly constituted Court'' and has poured much of its resources into campaigns opposing the propositions. On the other side, a spokesman for proponents of the measure in Rhode Island said approval by the voters would ''send the Supreme Court a message.'' Hazardous Waste The overriding issue in Washington state is the possibility that the Federal Government may pick a site within its borders as the prime dump for nuclear waste. The Department of Energy picked sites in Washington, Nevada and Texas as the three finalists for disposal, and the Legislature at Olympia reacted with a hastily drawn referendum that, if approved, would attempt to veto any decision favoring the Washington site. The issue became immediately involved in the political campaigns. Dan Ashburn, chairman of the Washington Waste Site Study Group, termed the referendum ''a purely political move on the part of the Democratic Governor and Legislature to put an emotional issue on the ballot to get out the Democratic vote in November.'' Legal experts say the chances of a veto of a Federal decision by a state or its voters is at best dubious, but Gov. Booth Gardner, the leading advocate of the measure, said the referendum is the best possible weapon to show that the Federal site-selection process is a ''travesty.'' There are proposals on the ballots of five other states concerning waste disposal: A New York proposal would allow the state to issue $1.45 billion in bonds for cleaning up waste sites and closing landfills; in New Jersey a similar measure would authorize $200 million in bonds as the first stage in a $600 million cleanup program over five years. A Massachusetts proposition would mandate a timetable for cleanup; a California initiative would require greater efforts to keep toxic chemicals out of drinking water; and a proposal in Oregon would stop the operation of nuclear power plants in that state until a site for disposal of the wastes is decided. Taxes Howard Jarvis, who inspired Proposition 13 in California eight years ago, died last August, but his legacy of citizens' rising up against taxes lives on in tax-curtailment propositions in five states. One is Proposition 62 in California, which would require a two-thirds vote of a local governing body and a majority vote of the people to approve any tax increase. The most stringent of the measures is in Montana, where anti-tax forces are seeking a contitutional amendment that would abolish all property taxes and require a majority public vote for approving sales or other taxes as a substitute. The Massachusetts proposal, in addition to the limit on tax growth, would repeal a surcharge of 7.5 percent on the state income tax. A Colorado initiative would require public approval of any new tax or tax increase. And Oregon has separate initiatives on the ballot to both reduce and increase taxes. There are minor proposals concerning taxes in a number of other states, but the ''tax revolt'' of earlier years appears to have lost most of its force. There is strong opposition to the more stringent ones and many states have recently been raising rather than lowering taxes. Other Issues There are a broad range of other issues on the ballots this year. Idaho, for example, has become a battleground over a referendum to strengthen its law that which bars making union membership a prerequisite for employment; it is the first time in a number of years that this hard-fought issue has been on the ballot in the United States. In California, supporters of the conspiracy theorist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. have placed a proposition on the ballot that would require that anyone suffering from AIDS be placed under quarantine. Public opinion polls have indicated that the measure has little chance of passage. California voters will also decide whether to make English the state's official language; Vermont voters will weigh an amendment to the State Constitution guaranteeing equal rights for women; Oregon voters vote on whether to legalize growing of marijuana in backyards, and Kansans will consider removing restrictions on the sale of liquor by the drink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON TALK; Tactical Alliances And the A.C.L.U.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/us/washington-talk-tactical-alliances-and-the-aclu.html,"The American Civil Liberties Union has sometimes been portrayed by its critics as a left-wing lobby that is soft on law and order and many other causes favored by conservatives. But increasingly in the last two years it has formed strategic alliances with groups from the conservative side of the political spectrum. Such coalitions, with people ranging from bankers to gun enthusiasts, have become almost essential for liberals who want to survive and remain influential in a conservative era. Moreover, they illustrate a tactic that lobbyists of all political stripes have refined to a high art as Congress feels increasing pressure to slash Federal spending and eliminate tax subsidies. The civil liberties union helped form a coalition that included many companies from the electronics industry, and together they lobbied successfully for a law to protect the privacy of communciations transmitted by computers and other new forms of technology. It joined tobacco companies and producers of alcoholic beverages in resisting efforts to ban the advertising of their products. It joined conservatives, including Justice Department officials, and some moderate Republicans in opposing legislation that would have prevented former top officials like Michael K. Deaver, the former deputy chief of staff at the White House, from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. With Bankers, Too The civil liberties union worked closely with the American Bankers Association to protect the privacy rights of bank customers in a new law designed to combat money laundering. It worked with the National Rifle Association to prevent the Justice Department from putting raw, unverified investigative data into a national computer information network. The A.C.L.U. has long opposed such computerized intelligence files. The rifle association argued that such data would be used improperly to deny its members permits to buy or carry firearms. And the civil liberties union joined the National Conservative Political Action Committee in fighting a bill known as the Clean Campaign Act, which would have required broadcasters to give free air time to candidates who wanted to respond to ''negative advertising'' broadcast by independent political committees. Morton H. Halperin, director of the Washington office of the civil liberties union, says the group has not become more conservative than it was in the 1970's, when it was in the forefront of efforts to regulate the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. But, he added, the union is ''perhaps more willing'' to enter into coalitions with groups from across the political spectrum. ''When Strom Thurmond is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,'' he explained, ''it is hard to enact legislation that promotes civil liberties unless we have new allies and coalitions.'' Mr. Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican, has staunchly supported most of the conservative positions taken by the Reagan Administration on criminal justice and civil rights. Not-So-Strange Bedfellows Jerry J. Berman, chief legislative counsel for the civil liberties union, said its new allies might seem like ''strange bedfellows'' to people who had a stereotyped view of the A.C.L.U. as ''a left-wing organization.'' In fact, he said, ''we do not choose our clients on the basis of their political beliefs.'' John J. Byrne, assistant counsel of the American Bankers Association, described Mr. Berman as ''one of the best lobbyists in town.'' He said their alliance, in opposition to the disclosure of bank customers' records without a subpoena or a court order, had ''worked out very well.'' Some lawmakers who ''wouldn't listen to the banks'' were open to persuasion by lobbyists from the A.C.L.U., he said. The civil liberties union has also formed some novel alliances on immigration proposals. It joined farm organizations and conservatives such as Senator James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho, in lobbying for a requirement that immigration officers get a search warrant before entering a farm to question a person believed to be an alien. Congress adopted this requirement over strenuous objections from Reagan Administration officials, who said it would cripple enforcement of the immigration law in rural areas. The civil liberties union also joined conservative Republican Senators such as Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to prevent the return to the Soviet Union of a Ukrainian seaman who jumped ship in October last year. Wade J. Henderson, associate director of the Washington office of the A.C.L.U., said the treatment of the seaman, Miroslav Medved, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service was ''an all-too-typical violation of the spirit and letter of the Refugee Act of 1980,'' which established the standard for granting asylum. The civil liberties group also joined the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and several other business groups in opposing a central element of the comprehensive immigration bill passed by Congress last month: penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens. To be sure, their motives were somewhat different. Whereas businesses objected to the burden of having to verify the citizenship status of job applicants, the A.C.L.U. feared the bill would encourage discrimination against Hispanic people and other minority groups. But they often worked together. 'A Central Role' Michael F. Cavanagh, executive director of the Electronic Mail Association, a trade group, said the A.C.L.U. had ''played a central role'' in assembling the coalition that won approval for the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The law updates Federal wiretap statutes to protect the privacy of cellular telephone calls, computer data communications and satellite television transmissions. The civil liberties union has long argued that women should have access to abortions. But it has vigorously opposed the use of the Federal racketeering law to bring civil suits against anti-abortion groups that demonstrate peacefully outside abortion clinics. Increasingly, Mr. Halperin said, the racketeering law has been used against political groups exercising their First Amendment rights. In seeking to change the law, the civil liberties union has worked with a coalition of businesses, which say the law has been misused to harass legitimate companies in common commerical disputes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ELECTIONS: Changes in Jersey; Continuity in Connecticut; Dodd Lives Up to Role of Favorite By Thrashing Eddy in Senate Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/nyregion/elections-changes-jersey-continuity-connecticut-dodd-lives-up-role-favorite.html,"Christopher J. Dodd, a heavy favorite throughout the Senate race in Connecticut, won re-election easily yesterday. With 284 of 770 precincts reporting, Mr. Dodd, a Democrat, had 66 percent of the vote, while his Republican challenger, Roger W. Eddy, had 34 percent. ''This is a great night for the Democrats,'' said Mr. Dodd, referring to the party regaining control of the United States Senate. In Connecticut's Congressional races, five incumbents won relatively easy victories, and a sixth was favored to be re-elected. During the Senate race, the 42-year-old Mr. Dodd had sharply criticized the policies of President Reagan, especially in Latin America. Mr Eddy, a 66-year-old farmer, inventor and novelist from Newington, and the Republican National Committeeman for Connecticut, fought an uphill battle to establish name recognition with the electorate. 'I Didn't Tell a Lie' In his concession speech, Mr. Eddy said he was outspent by Mr. Dodd by a ratio of 5 to 1. ''I did everything I had to do with limited finances,'' he said. ''I didn't tell a lie. I didn't do anything I'm ashamed of.'' Mr. Dodd of East Haddam, a three-time Congressman and the son of the late Thomas J. Dodd, the former Senator, bears one of the state's most prominent names. Mr. Eddy, who acknowledged that Mr. Dodd had been seen as having one of the ''safest'' seats in the Senate, conceded that he had resorted to some unusual campaign tactics, such as a $10,000 drawing, to gain attention for his candidacy. He also characterized Mr. Dodd as the ''Communist Senator from Connecticut'' for his opposition to aid to the rebels in Nicaragua and for opposing the Reagan Administration ''every step of the way.'' Supported Hart in '84 But Mr. Eddy himself differed with the President on many issues. And Mr. Dodd and Mr. Eddy were united in opposing the tax reform bill and prayer in public schools, and in supporting a woman's right to an abortion. Mr. Dodd was one of the first Democrats to support the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction bill. In 1984, Mr. Dodd broke ranks with most other Connecticut Democratic leaders who were backing Vice President Walter F. Mondale to support the presidential candidacy of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado. A member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Dodd was chosen by Democratic leaders in 1983 to give their party's response to President Reagan's address on Central American policy to a joint session of Congress. In the only close Congressional race, Representative Stewart B. McKinney, a Republican from the 4th District, was leading Christine M. Neidermeier, a Democrat, by 53 percent to 47 percent with 70 percent of the vote counted. Kennelly Re-Elected In the First District, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, a Democrat, was defeating Hershel Klein, the Republican, by 74 percent to 26 percent, with 77 percent of the vote reported. In the Second District, Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat, was defeating Francis Mullen, a Republican, by 68 percent to 32 percent, with 87 percent of the vote counted. In the Third District, Representative Bruce A. Morrison, a Democrat, was leading Ernest Diette Jr., a Republican, by 70 percent to 35 percent, with 85 percent of the vote counted. In the Fifth Congressional District, Representative John G. Rowland, a Republican, led his Democratic challenger, James Cohen, by 60 percent to 40 percent, with 80 percent of the votes counted. In the Sixth District, Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican, was defeating Paul Amenta, a Democrat, 64 percent to 36 percent, with 84 percent of the vote counted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ELECTIONS: OUT WITH THE OLD; THE VOTERS PLUCK SOME NEW FACES FROM THE POLITICAL CROWD: GOVERNORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/us/elections-with-old-voters-pluck-some-new-faces-political-crowd-governors.html,"Guy Hunt/Alabama, Republican The voters of Alabama had not given the Governor's mansion to a Republican since 1874, but they did it resoundingly on Tuesday. Mr. Hunt, a 53-year-old Amway distributor and lay Baptist preacher, rolled over Lieut. Gov. Bill Baxley by a margin of 56 percent to 43 percent. Although he ran for Governor in 1978, winning only three counties, he had no statewide recognition to speak of when he entered this year's race. So how did he win? He called his election a repudiation of the poisonous competition between Mr. Baxley and Attorney General Charles Graddick, the rivals for the Democratic nomination. ''The people of Alabama want a clean campaign on the issues and not a campaign of mud-slinging,'' Mr. Hunt said in his victory speech. Kay Orr/Nebraska, Republican Kay Orr was elected Governor of Nebraska in a historic race. For the first time, two gubernatorial candidates from major parties were women. But the race was in no way a feminist crusade. Mrs. Orr and her opponent, Helen Boosalis, both oppose abortion. Mrs. Orr is also against an equal rights amendment to the Constitution because, she says, ''although I don't differ with its goals, I just feel it can be achieved without a constitutional amendment.'' She attended the University of Iowa, where she met her husband, William T. Orr, now an insurance executive. In the early 1960's they moved to Lincoln, where she began her career in politics working on the 1964 Presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater. Bob Martinez/Florida, Republican Mr. Martinez in many ways seems the embodiment of the political and demographic changes taking place in Florida. He is the first Hispanic American to be elected Governor in his state, and much has already been made of that. But it is also significant that he switched from the Democratic Party to Republican in 1983 - because, he says, he felt more comfortable with the Reagan philosophy - and that he is only the second Republican to win the office in this century. A practical disadvantage was his lack of exposure. He had been Mayor of Tampa for two terms, but he faced what he called ''the longest trip'' to win statewide recognition. Robert P. Casey/Pennsylvania, Democrat Mr. Casey went against the Republican tide in gubernatorial races, conducting a tough campaign - some said too tough - to defeat William W. Scranton 3d. He sought to portray his opponent as the privileged son of a former Governor and Presidential candidate. But there were lighter touches, too: Mr. Casey called himself ''the real Bob Casey,'' a reference to a race he had lost because another candidate with the same name was on the ballot. Indeed, he lost three contests for Governor before this year. Mr. Casey, 54, is a classic Eastern liberal on most issues, but opposes abortion. He attended Holy Cross College on a basketball scholarship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FOR WOMEN OF MEXICO, A NEW POLITICAL BEACON",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/garden/for-women-of-mexico-a-new-political-beacon.html,"IT seems an unwritten rule the world over that candidates for elected office are expected to kiss babies, shake hands and sometimes sacrifice their dignity. But when Beatriz Paredes Rangel, who at the age of 33 is soon to become the second woman to serve as Governor of a Mexican state, was asked recently during the election campaign to stand inside a giant clay Mexican cooking pot called a cazuela, she politely demurred. Ms. Paredes encountered the cazuela among a display of dozens of smaller pots at a campaign meeting of native artists from throughout the state of Tlaxcala that she had organized here. One of the elders of the village where the pots are made stood in the cazuela and rocked back and forth, demonstrating how strong it was. Then he stepped out and beckoned the Governor-to-be to climb into the pot and see for herself. Certainly any male Mexican gubernatorial candidate would have hopped right in and happily rocked to and fro, winning votes and fostering his image as one of the boys. For a fleeting moment, Ms. Paredes seemed about to raise her skirt and climb in, too. But she abruptly changed her mind, diverted attention with a question and the moment passed. Had she stood in the pot, Mexico's small contingent of activist feminists as well as socially aware women in general would have been disappointed. To many, Ms. Paredes' candidacy in a country where women were not allowed to vote until 1953 is a symbol of how life for Mexican women is slowly changing for the better and how it might change even more. ''Beatriz is a special phenomenon,'' said Elena Urrutia, coordinator of an interdisciplinary women's studies program at the Colegio de Mexico here and one of the founders of ''Fem.,'' Mexico's feminist magazine. ''Her accomplishments are very important to us because she is so young and rose from humble origins.'' Her origins make Ms. Paredes special for many women. Her father, now 86, is a campesino, or poor farmer, in Tlaxcala, where Ms. Paredes was born in 1953. Although she lacks the substantial family connections that usually are necessary for political success in Mexico, Ms. Paredes has risen to a position of power in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Her admirers, colleagues and critics all agree she has done it on her own. Ms. Paredes, who is not married, describes herself as a natural leader, an assessment with which her colleagues agree. As a schoolgirl in a poor Tlaxcalan village, she showed flair as an orator, organizer and general spark plug in school life. She naturally gravitated to politics. ''We Tlaxcalans like to talk,'' she recalled. ''It all came very naturally to me.'' As a teen-ager she became deeply involved in the problems of the campesino organizations and the affairs of the ruling political party, known from its initials as the P.R.I. By the time she was 21, she was a member of the Tlaxcala State Legislature. Since then she has earned a college degree as a sociologist, served as a member of the Federal Chamber of Deputies, was a subminister in the Ministry of Agrarian Reform, and is a power in national campesino affairs. Ms. Paredes has token opposition from the candidates of three other parties in the election Nov. 16. But because the P.R.I. dominates Mexican political affairs, her designation last summer as the party's candidate for Governor of Tlaxcala assured that she would assume the post. Ms. Paredes avoids answering when asked if she is a feminist. Clearly, she is a politician first and foremost. To say she is not a feminist would look wrong to activist women who identify with her. To declare herself a feminist would risk alienation of powerful, traditionalist male politicians upon whose support she must depend as she moves up the political ladder. Instead, she is quick to stress her interest in improving the lives of all people. She is, however, what Mrs. Urrutia calls a ''sensitized'' woman, aware of women's problems. ''There are many women who come to positions of power and forget that 99 per cent of women are not in such positions,'' said Mrs. Urrutia. She cited a conference for women that Ms. Paredes held recently in Tlaxcala: ''She arranged child care for the women attending. Such a thought would never have occurred to a man.'' When Mexico's fledgling feminist movement began to emerge in the 1970's, it was class conscious. Its proponents were of the upper and middle classes. Their concern was focused on abortion, which is illegal in Mexico, rape, pornography and lesbianism. Unnoticed was the plight of the women of the lower classes, particularly of the campesino families, who struggle daily with a lack of drinkable water, inadequate housing and sanitary facilities, poor access to education for their children, unavailability of birth control information and a social order in which Latin machismo is still a dominant force. At the same time a steady deterioration of the Mexican economy that began in the 1970's and has been accelerating rapidly since the Mexican debt crisis emerged in 1982 has had a profound effect on the women of Mexico. Women who were traditionally housewives now must seek work outside the home to help their families survive. Although figures vary, sociologists and labor experts believe that in the last 10 to 15 years the proportion of women in the national work force has doubled, to about 30 percent from 15 percent. More than 80 percent of all women who study a profession in school are believed to enter the work force. As a result, the Mexican woman's role in society is shifting rapidly and the nature of Mexican feminism has broadened to embrace the changes. But despite rapid social changes, Mexico remains a rigidly patriarchal society. Politics is still a male dominion, particularly in an essentially one-party system where results at the ballot box have less meaning than do deals cut at party offices. Ms. Paredes knows she cannot sound too preoccupied with women's issues, too strident about the need for change. She chooses her words carefully. ''The country is living in a transition period in the ways that women participate in society,'' she said. ''There is a whole society that has established roles and, at the same time, there is a new presence of professional women, of working women. Roles are changing. Government policies must recognize this.'' She cites Government programs created in recent years to provide child care centers for working mothers as an example. Discussing politics, she is careful not to use the word discrimination, speaking of a ''series of areas where it is considered that women have less experience and less aptitude.'' There are male politicians, she said, who are very determined to push women forward and respect the participation of women in political matters, but there are other men who have reservations. ''But if you consider that we barely have 12 to 15 per cent representation in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, you can see that we do not have all the favorable conditions that are required,'' she said. But slowly, the situation is changing, both socially and politically. ''It is in transformation because of the economic situation in the country, and because of the large number of young women who went to school and are demanding that they participate in the productive plant, in public life,'' Ms. Paredes said. The first woman to serve as Governor of a Mexican state was Griselda Alvarez, who became Governor of Colima on the Pacific coast in 1979. Her great grandfather had been Colima's first Governor and her father had served as Governor, too. ''She was eminently qualified to be Governor,'' said one feminist here, who asked not to be identified. ''But she became Governor because the men in power looked around and said, 'It's time Mexico had a woman Governor.' They were filling a quota.'' State governors serve a single six-year term. When Mrs. Alvarez took office she was in her 60's. When Ms. Paredes leaves office, she will be only 39. ''Her youth means dynamism, initiative, projection,'' said Mrs. Alvarez. ''Her youth means many things, a permanent state of revolution.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ELECTIONS: THE STORY IN SOME KEY STATES; DEUKMEJIAN AND CRANSTON WIN AS 3 JUDGES ARE OUSTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/us/elections-story-some-key-states-deukmejian-cranston-win-3-judges-are-ousted.html,"Gov. George Deukmejian won not only a landslide re-election victory on Tuesday but also an opportunity to replace three justices of the California Supreme Court. The three were removed by voters in an emotion-charged rebellion against their refusal to uphold the death sentences of scores of convicted murderers. In a tight race that was not decided until early this morning, Senator Alan Cranston, a Democrat, won a fourth term by defeating Representative Ed Zschau, a Republican who had the support of much of the state's business community. According to a preliminary analysis of voting patterns, opposition to Mr. Zschau by certain Christian evangelical groups and political conservatives in southern California, who contended that he was too moderate on social issues, may have been a pivotal factor in Mr. Cranston's narrow victory. Rose Elizabeth Bird, the 49-year-old Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, was removed from the bench by a margin of 2 to 1. Associate Justices Joseph Grodin and Cruz Reynoso, the court's first Hispanic member, drew more votes than Chief Justice Bird, but not enough to give them the majority needed to keep their jobs. Their Last Day Is Jan. 5 All will leave the bench Jan. 5, when Mr. Deukmejian, a conservative whose views on social issues closely parallel those of President Reagan, can seat three new justices on the highest court in the nation's most populous state. His nominations are subject to affirmation by a panel of legal experts and voter confirmation in 1988. The most likely candidate expected to succeed Chief Justice Bird is Associate Justice Malcom Lucas, a former law partner of Mr. Deukmejian who is also a conservative. The three justices were the first ever removed from the court by voters since Californians amended their Constitution in 1934 to require appointed appellate judges to be reconfirmed periodically by voters. Their defeat was the climax of a tumultuous campaign in which supporters of the justices denounced what they called a right-wing effort to ''politicize'' the court while opponents of the justices contended that they were merely applying the state constitutional requirement that justices be held accountable to voters. Coalition Led Drive Chief Justice Bird, who had voted to overturn lower courts' death sentences in all 61 capital cases that had come before her since she joined the court in 1977, was the principal target of the campaign against the court. The campaign was led by a coalition of political conservatives, county prosecutors and relatives of murder victims. They said the court had refused to uphold death sentences because of personal opposition to capital punishment. Opinion polls had long indicated that Chief Justice Bird was unlikely to be confirmed for a new 12-year term. But it had been less clear that Justices Grodin and Reynoso, who had voted to sustain a handful of death sentences, would be turned out of office. Pollsters said they believed that an unusually widespread and deep-seated antipathy toward Chief Justice Bird among many voters had apparently been transferred to her colleagues in the final weeks of the campaign. They said all three justices suffered from the lingering unpopularity of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., who appointed them to the bench, and from the effectiveness of television commercials in which the parents of slain children assailed the court for setting aside the death sentences of their children's killers. In conceding defeat Tuesday night, Chief Justice Bird urged voters to resist what she predicted would be efforts to turn the court into a ''house of death'' because of ''the insatiable appetite of ambitious politicians.'' Races for Governor and Senate In the race for governor, Mr. Deukmejian overpowered Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles by a much wider margin than many experts had expected, attracting 60.5 percent of the vote as against 37.5 percent for Mr. Bradley. In the Senate race, according to virtually complete returns, Mr. Cranston received 3,575,436 votes, or 49.4 percent of the total, and Mr. Zschau received 3,458,814 votes, or 47.8 percent. Mr. Cranston's victory margin of less than 120,000 votes led to speculation today that the effort by evangelical groups to defeat Mr. Zschau because of his acceptance of abortion, support for the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and his stand on other issues might have had an important effect on the race. In the final weeks of the campaign, a political action group called Christian Voice and other evangelical groups urged religious fundamentalists not to vote for Mr. Zschau and to vote instead for Ed Vallen, a candidate for the conservative American Independent Party, or for the 72-year-old Mr. Cranston, who they predicted might not live to complete a new six-year term. Although the impact of the appeal has not been measured precisely, Mr. Vallen received more than 106,000 votes Tuesday, while candidates for the conservative Peace and Freedom Party and Libertarian parties received a combined total of more than 100,000 votes. Californians Tuesday also voted overwhelmingly to establish English as the state's official language, approved a sweeping new measure regarding disposal of toxic wastes, and soundly defeated a proposal by the conspiracy theorist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. that would have, under some conditions, allowed the quarantining of victims of AIDS. Voters in Los Angeles and in San Francisco approved zoning laws designed to sharply limit construction of new high-rise buildings in designated areas of the two cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE ELECTIONS: DEALING WITH THE ISSUES; PROPOSITIONS: TAX CURBS, YES: ABORTION LIMITS, NO",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/us/elections-dealing-with-issues-propositions-tax-curbs-yes-abortion-limits-no.html,"In hundreds of ballot proposals decided around the nation Tuesday, voters put new but moderate restraints on the ability of states and local governments to raise taxes, and expanded the use of gambling to help pay the cost of public services. At the same time, they apparently turned back, at least temporarily, efforts to write anti-abortion measures into state law; enacted strong environmental measures in several states and localities, and dealt another defeat to the women's movement. Feminist leaders hoped to establish a beachhead in liberal Vermont with an equal rights amendment to the state Constitution. Rather than passing easily as expected, however, the proposal to prohibit sexual discrimination was defeated, 52 percent to 48 percent. Over all, voters tended to reject extreme measures and steer a moderate course in writing directly into law a range of propositions to change policies, reduce or increase taxes and to approve or reject bond issues. Oregon voters, for example, defeated a plan to permit residents to raise marijuana for their personal use, and Californians defeated a plan that could have led to a quarantine of AIDS victims. One of the clearest trends was in the expansion of lotteries and other forms of state-endorsed gambling to help pay for public services. This comes at a time when many state and local governments have found themselves pinched between resistance to new taxes and faltering economies that no longer bring in the revenue needed to sustain basic services. Voters in Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Montana and South Dakota approved lotteries. Only in North Dakota was a lottery defeated, with strong opposition by religious and political leaders. Florida, however, defeated a proposal for casino gambling in hotels, as it has repeatedly in the past. Kansas, on the other hand, approved a plan for parimutuel betting on horse and dog races. Lotteries in Majority of States The affirmative votes on lotteries mean that a majority of states now sponsor or permit them to raise revenue for public services such as education. The approval of lotteries has been spreading rapidly since 1980, when only a handful of states permitted them. In addition to the five approved Tuesday, Indiana, Lousiana, Oklahoma and Wisconsin are now considering lottery proposals. The anti-abortion movement has made repeated efforts at measures to ban the use of state funds for abortion or declare the practice illegal in anticipation of the Supreme Court reversing its landmark Roe v. Wade decision of 1973, which legalized abortions. Virtually all of those proposals, however, have been defeated in recent years. Tuesday, anti-abortion proposals were defeated in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Oregon. The vote on a fourth proposal, in Arkansas, was so close that the outcome was still in doubt yesterday. On taxes, the following results provide a sample of the voting: * California made local taxes in some cities subject to voter approval, and defeated a ceiling on salaries of state employes. * Colorado rejected a plan to make every state tax increase subject to voter approval. * Massachusetts approved a measure that would limit an increase in state taxes to the same ratio of increase in salaries and wages. * Montana approved a proposal to freeze property taxes but defeated a more stringent measure to abolish property taxes outright. * Oregon voters rejected both a drastic reduction in local property taxes and a proposed 5 percent sales tax. Several states took steps to clean up toxic wastes and protect natural resources. California approved a measure that would prohibit companies from tainting public water supplies. In Idaho, there was an overwhelming vote to continue the state's law barring union membership as a requirement in employment. It was the first time the issue has been on a statewide ballot in several years and labor unions had spent considerable resources in an effort to repeal the law. A referendum that would have moved toward creating a new city from the predominantly black sections of Boston was resoundingly defeated by black voters and by white voters in surrounding areas. The proposal would have created a 12.5-square-mile municipality that proponents said would have included more than 90 percent of the minority population of Boston. The new city, which was to have been called Mandela, after the black leader in South Africa, would have been about 84 percent minority, proponents said. The measure was on the ballot in 10 of Boston's 19 state legislative districts, an area with approximately 120,000 registered voters, a little less than half the city's total. The unofficial vote total was 33,609 opposed and 12,349 in favor, according to John F. Donovan, chief registrar of voters. Mr. Donovan added that the measure had been decisively beaten in all precincts, although it had lost most heavily in some predominantly black areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AROUND THE NATION; 35 Catholics Seek Archbishop's Return,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/around-the-nation-35-catholics-seek-archbishop-s-return.html,"Thirty-five local Roman Catholics, most of them priests and nuns, have asked that Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen be given back all responsibilities taken away by the Vatican in a dispute over Church teachings. The appeal was made in a letter to the 293 bishops scheduled to attend the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Nov. 9-13 in Washington. ''We believe that he is a competent Bishop,'' the group said. ''This is attested to by the life and vigor of the church in Seattle, by the fiscal solvency of our archdiocese, by the ecumenical support the Archbishop enjoys and by his loyalty to the Holy See.'' The Vatican announced in September it was turning over many of the Archbishop's duties to Auxiliary Bishop Donald Wuerl. The move followed a two-year investigation by the Vatican, which said Archbishop Hunthausen had tolerated unorthodox practices. Conservative Catholics had objected to the Archbishop's antinuclear activism and said, among other things, that he let a homosexual group use a church for mass and that he would not condemn abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON TALK; . . . Capitol Hill's Day After,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/washington-talk-capitol-hill-s-day-after.html,"Alice Hooker describes herself as a faithful Democrat who for six years has been an ''exile'' from Capitol Hill. Today, resume in hand, she returned, seeking a staff job with the Senate Judiciary Committee. For seven years, Ms. Hooker was a top aide to Al Ullman, when he was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But she lost her job in 1980 when the ''Reagan Revolution'' swept Democrats from control of the Senate and Mr. Ullman, an Oregonian now deceased, from his House seat. ''Being a Democrat in a Republican town, I felt outraged,'' Ms. Hooker said. ''We were pushed out of positions of any responsibility. It's as if people have been waiting in the wings for six years.'' Ms. Hooker is one of scores of Democrats who are expected to take advantage of the new political landscape here, with the Democrats back in control of the Senate after six years and in an even stronger majority in the House. For one result of Tuesday's election will be at least 700 new jobs for Democrats, all at the expense of Republicans. The turnover among elected officials in Congress is nothing compared to the hirings and firings of Congressional staff members that are expected in forthcoming months. ''The avalanche of resumes may bury Capitol Hill,'' said Richard Mintz, who works for a lobby group that supports abortion rights. In addition to the Democrats who will be seeking Congressional jobs, the Republicans who now have those jobs are also cranking out resumes. Many want to latch onto Presidential campaigns or find jobs with Republican-connected interest groups. Those in the best position are Democrats who already have high-level jobs on committee staffs. They say they look forward to gaining more influence; they also stand to gain perquisites like plusher offices. ''The major benefit of being in the majority is that you can define the agenda, you can craft the legislation,'' said W. Donald Campbell, Democratic staff director for the Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee. ''It's been very frustrating -we've hardly had any banking legislation passed in the last six years.'' For Republicans, there is little joy. ''This is something that we have to accept on the Hill: When you get hired here, they let you know you could lose their job,'' said Mary Kinzer, a Republican staff assistant on the Senate Agriculture Committee. Although Ms. Kinzer is not certain she will lose her job as Republicans lose control of that committee, she said she was actively seeking work on other committees just in case. Both Ms. Kinzer and Ms. Hooker wasted no time today in stopping for job interviews at the Senate Placement Office, which channels job seekers to Senate office. Ms. Hooker started her own legal practice after she lost her Congressional job. She had not thought of returning to Capitol Hill until Wednesday morning, when she overheard some United States attorneys in the District of Columbia Superior Court talking about going after jobs on the soon-to-be-reconstituted Judiciary Committee. The obvious new slots for Democrats will be on personal staffs of newly elected members. The Democrats picked up eight new Senate seats, while the Republicans lost eight. Most senators have about 40 people on their personal staffs. In the House, where the personal staffs are somewhat smaller, the Democrats won at least five additional seats. More significant, however, are the 19 Senate committees, which will now be controlled by the Democrats. The dominant party in the Senate controls two-thirds of each committee's budget, out of which staff salaries are paid. As of last spring, there were 1,180 staff members on the Senate committees: 663 were Republican appointments, 330 were Democratic and 187 were not designated by party. Now the Democrats can double the size of their committee staffs, at Republican expense. Those are figures that the Republicans do not like to hear. Before 1980, they had not controlled the Senate since 1956. But in the last six years, they have grown accustomed to being in charge. Although Congressional offices were largely quiet this week, the Senate Placement Office has been busier than ever. ''We're exhausted,'' said Marianne Farnsworth, assistant manager of the office. ''Democrats are coming from all over - law firms, everywhere. One girl came from Arkansas. One guy came from Boston just for this. A lot of people want to work for committees, some want to work for senators, and a lot of them don't care. They just want to get in.'' Miss Farnsworth said the most anxious prospective applicants were recent college graduates who ''come in here and think this might be their big chance'' for a Congressional job. One who fits that category is Temple D. Brown, a recent University of Virginia graduate, who came by the placement office today. Unlike many other applicants, he wants to work for a Republican, which makes his pursuit much tougher. ''I'm going to stick it out. Keep my name in front of them. Keep giving out resumes,'' said the 23-year-old Mr. Brown, who arrived in Washington in September from his hometown of Memphis and has worked two temporary jobs on Capitol Hill since then. ''Right now I'm at the point where I'm willing to open mail at the Capitol or run the elevators up there,'' he said. ''I'm one of those people that's just looking for the Washington experience.'' One who has had the Washington experience, Elinor B. Bachrach, who was a former special assitant to Senator William Proxmire until the Republican takeover in 1980 and is now deputy state comptroller for New York City, offered some advice for Republicans who will be getting pink slips in the next several weeks: ''It's personally wrenching, but at least you're out of a job through no fault of your own and, in fact, no fault of anyone working very close to you.'' Daniel F. Rinzel, Republican staff director for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, is one Republican who is not letting the Democratic takeover get to him. ''You serve at the pleasure of the chairman,'' he said. ''And you don't have any job security up on the Hill anyway.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE ELECTIONS: ISSUES AND INTEREST GROUPS; DEMOCRAT WINS A CLOSE CONTEST FOR HOUSE SEAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/elections-issues-interest-groups-democrat-wins-close-contest-for-house-seat.html,"A Democrat was declared the winner of one of the most closely contested races for the House of Representatives today, but Republicans apparently won three others. That makes the probable House lineup for the 100th Congress, which convenes in January, 258 Democrats and 177 Republicans, representing a gain of 5 seats for the Democrats. It was one of the smallest shifts in history, but in the 1962 election the net change was one seat. Both parties claimed victory this time, the Republicans because they held Democratic gains well below the average for the sixth year of a Presidency, the Democrats because they padded an already big margin. ''The President's popularity saved the Republicans from really taking a drubbing, as they would have with an unpopular President and tough economic times,'' said Thomas Mann, executive director of the American Political Science Association. ''In that sense, it's a victory for the Republicans. But the fact that the Democrats picked up some extra seats puts them in pretty good shape in the face of the vaunted Reagan political machine.'' Off the Defensive Now Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, said his party's control of the Senate meant House Democrats could put forward an agenda with some hope of passing measures and getting them before President Reagan instead of ''playing defensive baseball.'' But a member of the Democratic leadership who asked not to be identified said it would be a serious mistake for his party to push too many programs, risking once again Republican charges of ''tax and tax, spend and spend.'' The Democrat who finally emerged victorious almost 48 hours after the polls closed was Tom McMillen, a 6-foot-11-inch-tall former professional basketball player. He narrowly defeated Robert Neall, the Republican minority leader in the State House of Delegates, in the Fourth District of Maryland, which includes Annapolis and parts of the Baltimore and Washington suburbs. The seat is now held by a Republican, Representative Marjorie S. Holt, who is retiring, so Mr. McMillen's victory constituted a pickup for the Democrats. Among Republicans who seem to have won are Representative Howard Coble in the Sixth District of North Carolina, Representative Arlan Stangeland in the Seventh District of Minnesota, and Representative John Hiler in the Third District of Indiana. Mr. Hiler's Democratic opponent, Thomas Ward, was declared the winner late Tuesday night, but an error was discovered today in the count in St. Joseph County, which includes South Bend. The new totals gave Mr. Hiler 1,890 more votes and a lead of 166. Recounts are possible in all three races, especially in North Carolina. Robin Britt, a Democrat there, stressed the loss of jobs in the district because of cheap imported textiles. Mr. Britt, who lost to Mr. Coble in a close race in 1984, is trailing him this time by 82 votes. In North Carolina's 11th District, where imports were also an issue, Representative William M. Hendon, a Republican, lost to James McC. Clarke, a Democrat. The two have clashed in three straight elections, Mr. Clarke winning in 1982 and this year, Mr. Hendon winning in 1984. #2 Hurt by Unrest on Farms Mr. Stangeland was one of two Minnesota incumbents damaged by unrest on the state's farms. Representative Vin Weber, one of the most vocal of the young Republican right-wingers, survived, but only by 4,000 votes. Mr. Stangeland, one of the authors of the locally unpopular Farm Act of 1985, has a lead of only 211 votes. Incumbency was once again a powerful weapon for most members of Congress. A total of 392 Representatives sought re-election, and only 6 lost - 5 Republicans and a Democrat - for a success rate of 98.5 percent. The Republican losers were Mr. Hendon and William Cobey in North Carolina, Webb Franklin in Mississippi, Fred J. Eckert in Rochester and Mike Strang in Colorado. The only Democratic loser was Robert A. Young, who represented a St. Louis suburban district. John Buechner, the Republican who beat him, almost won in 1984. Farm Discontent and a Gain Incumbency apparently saved a group of freshmen Republicans the Democrats had selected for defeat. It apparently saved Farm Belt Republicans, including Mr. Weber, Mr. Stangeland and colleagues in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas. Only in an open seat in Iowa could the Democrats make a gain as a result of farm discontent. Incumbency apparently saved 81-year-old Representative Melvin Price of Illinois, whom many Democrats had expected would lose. And it apparently saved three members involved in ethical or financial controversies, Representatives Fernand J. St Germain of Rhode Island, Robert Carr of Michigan and Kenneth J. Gray of Illinois. Four women were elected as new members of the House. Four others will retire next year. The winners were Constance A. Morella, a Republican, in the Eighth District of Maryland; Louise Slaughter, a Democrat, in Rochester, N.Y.; Patricia Saiki, in the First District of Hawaii, who will be her state's first Republican member of the House, and Elizabeth Patterson, a Democrat and daughter of the late Senator Olin D. Johnston, in the Fourth District of South Carolina. There will be 22 blacks in the House, an increase of 2, for a new record. John Lewis, who had been active for civil rights, will succeed Representative Wyche Fowler Jr., who was elected to the Senate, for the Atlanta district, and Mike Espy will replace Mr. Franklin in the seat that covers most of the Mississippi Delta. Two other new black members replace departing ones: Floyd Flake of Queens and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland. All the new black members are Democrats. Among Democratic newcomers given a chance to become political stars are David E. Price, a Duke University political scientist who beat Mr. Cobey in North Carolina; Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who is a Cheyenne, and David E. Skaggs, both from Colorado, and Jim Jontz of Indiana, who stressed jobs and trade issues to beat James Butcher, a crusader against abortion and pornography. Republicans are expecting a lot from Mr. Buechner, among others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABORTION RULE FOR UNDER-18's UPSET BY JUDGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/08/us/abortion-rule-for-under-18-s-upset-by-judge.html,"A Federal district judge in Minnesota today held unconstitutional a state law requiring women under 18 years old either to notify both parents or to obtain judicial approval before getting abortions. The judge, Donald D. Alsop, said his ruling was apparently the first examination by any court as to how such a law had worked ''in actual operation.'' He suggested the evidence contradicted the Supreme Court's ''assumption'' that such laws could foster helpful consultation between pregnant teen-agers and their parents. The Supreme Court has cited what it sees as the benefits of such consultation in upholding laws somewhat similar to Minnesota's, but it has not yet been presented with a case involving testimony about how such a parental notification law has worked in practice. After a five-week trial, the judge said the law had traumatized teen-agers without serving any legitimate purpose. He said he could find no factual basis for holding that the Minnesota law ''on the whole furthers in any meaningful way the state's interest in protecting pregnant minors or assuring family integrity.'' He cited testimony by minors, single parents, abortion providers, counselors, psychiatrists and state judges who hear minors' requests for approval of abortions without parental notification. The decision was dated Thursday and was made public today. Law in Effect Since 1981 The Minnesota law had been in effect since 1981. The judge stressed evidence of the ''emotional trauma'' it had forced pregnant teen-agers to endure and the danger that in troubled families the father, if notified of a daughter's plan to have an abortion, might react violently. Judge Alsop noted, however, that he was bound by Supreme Court decisions upholding some laws that require parental notification as an alternative to judicial approval of individual abortions, and had therefore based his decision to strike down the Minnesota law on a relatively narrow ground. The law was rendered unconstitutional even under the Supreme Court's precedents, he said, by its requirement that minors who do not want to go to a judge for approval notify not just one but both parents, even in cases involving broken families or parents ''likely to react with psychological, sexual or physical violence.'' ''Particularly in these cases,'' he said, ''notification of an abusive, or even a disinterested, absent parent has the effect of reintroducing that parent's disruptive or unhelpful participation into the family at a time of acute stress. ''Similarly, the two-parent notification requirement places a significant obstacle in the path of minors in two-parent homes who voluntarily have consulted with one parent but not with the other out of fear of psychological, sexual, or physical abuse toward either the minor or the notified parent.'' 'A Traumatic Distraction' ''In either case,'' Judge Alsop added, ''the alternative of going to court to seek authorization to proceed without notifying the second parent introduces a traumatic distraction into her relationship with the parent whom the minor has notified.'' He stressed that state court judges who handled such requests had testified that they had approved almost all of them but felt they were serving a ''rubber-stamp'' function that served no useful purpose, while producing ''fear and tension in many minors.'' The state served notice that it would appeal. Janet Benshoof, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing abortion providers, minors and others who sued to strike down the law, said, ''The case is a vindication of the rights of minors who have been needlessly suffering under a system designed to make political points at the expense of young women's constitutional rights.'' Ms. Benshoof said today that 22 states had some form of law promoting parental notification or consent for minors seeking abortions. More than half of them are not being enforced, she said, either because they are in litigation or because they are clearly contrary to the Supreme Court's requirement that a ''judicial bypass'' be available. The 22 states do not include New York, New Jersey or Connecticut. Judge Alsop, who was appointed in 1975 by President Ford, also held unconstitutional the law's requirement that minors seeking abortions must ordinarily wait at least 48 hours after their parents have been notified in writing by the abortion provider. He indicated he might have been forced by Supreme Court precedent to uphold the law if it had required notification of only one parent in broken family situations, as an alternative to judicial approval, and had imposed a shorter waiting period after parental notification. Court to Hear Illinois Case But his opinion strongly suggested the Supreme Court should reconsider its assumption that such parental notification laws could ever produce the kinds of benefits to the minor or the family that the Court had envisioned in the abstract. The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear a case involving a somewhat similar Illinois law requiring women under 18 years old either to wait 24 hours after the doctor has told their parents of their plans or to obtain a judicial exemption from the notification requirement. The Court has ruled in the past that states may not require all minors seeking abortions, without exception, to obtain parental consent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"INCUMBENCY, TURNOUT AND OTHER RECORDS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/09/weekinreview/incumbency-turnout-and-other-records.html,"PARSING THE NUMBERS. In the elections of 1986, incumbency was once again a powerful weapon. So was money. Of the 392 members of the House running for re-election only 6 lost, 5 of them Republicans. A total of $342 million was reportedly spent on races for House and Senate, $80 million more than in 1984. But money had its limits. Six of the top twelve Senate fund-raisers lost their races -though not necessarily by much. Republicans noted that a switch by a little more than 30,000 voters in five states would have enabled their party to retain control of the Senate. Turnout fell again, to 37.3 percent of eligible voters by one estimate; 41.1 percent went to the polls in 1984. Many analysts saw a negative reaction to the rise in campaign spending, most of which went for television advertising, much of that negative. A record number of women running did not yield a record number of women winning. With losses counterbalancing victories, there will still be 2 women in the Senate and 23 in the House. Of the eight women trying for governorships, the only victor was in the first all-female contest, bringing the number of statehouses held by women to three. Two blacks were running for governorships; they lost. The number of blacks in the House increased by 2, to a record 22. VOTING THE ISSUES. The fact that few national issues - and not so many local ones - were aired in campaigns was widely deplored. But in 23 states, voters got the chance to express their views on difficult questions. The outcome on money matters among the 226 statewide ballot proposals was new restraints on taxing and the expanded use of gambling to pay for services. Four out of four anti-abortion proposals were defeated; five out of six environmental bond issues passed. Idaho's ''right-to-work'' law stood. In Vermont, the equal rights amendment failed. SNAPSHOTS. There were more cliffhangers than startling results. But there was the usual portion of notable miscellany. Among it was the election, despite President Reagan's vigorous campaigning this year against his opponent six years ago, of three members of Jimmy Carter's Cabinet to high office in Mr. Reagan's stronghold, the West.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDY URGES FIGHT FOR STATES' POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/09/us/study-urges-fight-for-states-power.html,"An Administration report charges that the Supreme Court has systematically undermined state sovereignty for more than 50 years and proposes a strategy to correct what it calls an ''erroneous judicial reading'' of the Constitution. The confidential report concludes, after a 15-month study, that the Court has improperly pre-empted and invalidated the states' legitimate exercise of their sovereign powers, leaving them to act only as ''satrapies'' or ''administrative units'' of a ''virtually omnipotent national government.'' Setting the Agenda The 90-page document, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, says the Supreme Court showed ''indifference'' to the principle of federalism in 1973 when it guaranteed women access to abortion and limited the states' power to regulate abortion. Moreover, it says court rulings on the reapportionment of state legislatures since 1962 represent ''an unprecedented intrusion'' into state affairs. White House officials said the report, prepared for the Cabinet by a special interagency panel, would set the agenda for domestic policy in the next two years. The report particularly criticizes the Court's broad interpretation of the Federal power to regulate interstate commerce, and calls for litigation aimed at overturning some judicial decisions. It says Congress itself should halt ''the practice of conditioning eligibility for Federal grants on compliance with regulations having little or no relationship to the program being funded.'' ''Grants for highway construction, for example, have been used to require that states regulate billboard advertising, hide junkyards along the road, survey all their roads to identify and correct hazards, impose Hatch Act prohibitions on the political activity of state employees, adopt a 21-year-old drinking age and comply with the now infamous 55-mile-per-hour speed limit,'' it continued. The report was submitted this week to the Domestic Policy Council, a Cabinet-level advisory body, by its Working Group on Federalism, composed of officials from nine agencies. Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper, who headed the group, said in an interview that ''the national government has been behaving without legitimate constitutional warrant'' in usurping state authority. The report asserts that the Supreme Court has struck down state laws in cases where no actual conflict with Federal law and no evidence that Congress intended to pre-empt state law existed. For example, it said Federal judges had invalidated state divorce laws, state noise regulations, state utility regulations and state usury laws. Congress Given Broad 'License' By its expansive interpretation of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce, the report says, the Supreme Court has given the Federal Government a virtual ''license to prescribe uniform public policies in an almost limitless range of areas traditionally within the province of state governments.'' ''Only once during the last 50 years has the Supreme Court invalidated a Federal statute as an impermissible encroachment'' on the sovereignty of state and local governments, the report said. Even that decision, involving the wages and hours of local government employees, was overruled by the Court last year, the report noted. Several Specific Proposals The report, ''The Status of Federalism in America,'' makes these proposals: * Before passing any bill, Congress should assess its effects on federalism. Congress should amend its rules to permit lawmakers to raise a point of order against bills that violate ''the sovereign prerogatives of the states.'' * States should be allowed to consolidate numerous Federal grants into one lump sum, with few Federal restrictions on use of the money; all grants for ''human service programs'' might be thus combined. * Federal agencies should not be able to pre-empt state laws by issuing regulations. Federal laws should not be construed as pre-empting state laws unless Congress explicitly declared its desire to do so. * The Justice Department or the Office of Management and Budget should review all proposed Federal rules to assess their effects on federalism. No Mention of Reagan Criticism The report does not mention any of the Reagan Administration's own proposals that have been criticized as contrary to the spirit of federalism. In April, for example, the Administration proposed to establish national standards of product liability, superseding state laws. And the Justice Department has tried to prevent state and local governments from using numerical goals to increase employment of blacks, women and Hispanic people.

It is the nature of authority: the pope's, as the head of the church; theirs, as teachers with him of Catholic doctrine, and that of the American Catholic Church. The bishops will also ponder the claims to authority of theologians, particularly those like the Rev. David Tracy of the University of Chicago who roam the intellectual frontiers of their discipline, often returning with new interpretations of old teachings. The bishops are concerned about the way in which their flocks are reflecting the theologians' departures from traditional Catholic teachings on, among other questions, the acceptability of artificial birth control, abortion, homosexuality and divorce. The bishops are also wary of the manner in which Vatican curial officials have reasserted control over the day-to-day business of the church after an interlude of modified powers following the end of the Second Vatican Council in 1965. ''Pope John Paul II,'' reports a bishop just back from Rome, ''spends a great deal of time on foreign affairs and on the careful preparation of his many talks.'' The bishop goes on to explain that although the Pope, who faces an extraordinarily diverse congregation of nearly a billion, desires unity of expression in the church, curial officials have become the definers and arbiters of that unity in matters of doctrine and discipline. The American bishops' concerns have been heightened by two recent events. The first was the stripping of his license to teach theology at a Vatican-chartered university from the Rev. Charles E. Curran at the Catholic University of America in Washington. The second was the removal of the authority of Seattle's Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen over five key areas of administration, including the liturgy, marriage and theology courses for priests. Both men were reportedly censured for their dissent from the Vatican's views on issues of sexual morality. While some powerful American prelates, notably Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston and Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, have urged their confreres to stand up and be counted with the Pope on these issues, large numbers of bishops, one of their leaders says, ''feel demoralized because they are caught between statements from Rome and responses, both liberal and conservative, of their own priests and people.'' They wonder if their ability to exercise their individual authority, as well as that of their episcopal body, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, has been seriously compromised. The Hunthausen case, which the bishops will review in executive session at their meeting, is perceived by many as symbolic of the Vatican's readiness to ignore collegial process in dealing with the American church in order to reduce the influence of its bishops' conference. ''The problem is authority,'' says Father Tracy, the University of Chicago theologian and author (box, page 25) who is widely recognized as one of the most creative of American Catholic scholars. ''But these Vatican officials,'' he adds, ''seem unable to understand authority except as authoritarianism exercised by them to protect the bureaucratic power of the institution. This is not the same as vindicating the claims of orthodoxy. Hunthausen and Curran understand authority in its essential Catholic sense, rooted in the central compassionate vision of the Catholic tradition. Pope John XXIII exercised effective authority because he did not try to coerce the world's will but appealed to its imagination. It is because not enough church officials understand the Catholic meaning of authority as Pope John did that the church is in trouble today.'' In 1968, Tracy was among 22 faculty members, including Father Curran, brought to a two-month trial before the Catholic University senate by that school's president on charges that they had abandoned their Catholicity by dissenting from the theological argument against artificial birth control in Pope Paul VI's encyclical Humanae Vitae, issued earlier that year. Today Tracy says that ''birth control is neuralgic, as a source of continuing, intractable pain for Catholics, combining a reluctance on the part of authorities to let go of a certain narrow view of human sexuality. The church once taught that usury was intrinsically evil but changed its stance on that. It once tolerated slavery. There is no reason that it cannot change on birth control.'' Although little known outside academic circles, the bearded, 47-year-old Tracy - a priestly Mr. Chips, according to his students - symbolizes the confidence and creativity of his generation of theologians, even as the shadows of Vatican investigators fall across their work. Tracy, who insists that the prism of theological investigation necessarily refracts ambiguity and pluralism, dismisses the curial desire to eliminate these qualities in their formulations of the truths of faith. ''It is easy to get uniformity in religion,'' he says. ''All you have to do is to remove the mystery. But if you remove the mystery, you destroy religion at the same time.'' Sounding major themes of his theological work, Tracy observes that ''everyone recognizes Archbishop Hunthausen'' - who led protests against nuclear submarine facilities and withheld portions of his income tax to protest Federal spending on nuclear arms - ''as a classically religious person. There is a real theological and religious issue here because his actions in working for peace and in being a pastor to forgotten ones, including the divorced and homosexuals, are in keeping with the central insight that God is love. Hunthausen has risked his life on the vision Catholicism holds up to the world, and he is being dealt with in the manner of Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor: what would happen to the institution if we allowed this to continue? The American Catholic Church needs its bishops to reflect on this situation religiously and theologically, and to speak out about it without fear. The vigor of their authority depends on their being believable in defending this believable man. At the same time, one of our great Catholic universities should offer Charles Curran a professorship.'' Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee, the most outspoken defender of American Catholicism against Vatican critics, underscores the significance of thinkers like Tracy. ''The temptation for theology today,'' he says, ''is to condemn everything of the present confused age and to look backward to safer theories and models. Creative theology discerns what is true in the midst of the present explosion of knowledge, integrates it with Christian revelation and thus makes sense out of our lives and helps construct the future.'' Tracy and other progressive American theologians are not without strong critics in the American Catholic community. Msgr. George A. Kelly, research professor at St. John's University in New York and president of the Fellowship of Catholic Scholars, says that ''Tracy isn't developing doctrine, he's denying it. The issue is really Christ, and Pope John Paul II speaks for Him. That is fundamental. I think some of these theologians have lost the faith. If I followed David Tracy and others, the end would be that I wouldn't be a Catholic. In fact, I wouldn't be anything.'' Tracy's influence is not immediately political but will be in the long term, according to the prominent Lutheran scholar and religious historian Martin Marty, because he is ''the most original of today's Catholic theologians, and the one with whom other theologians, Catholic and Protestant, have to reckon.'' His ideas are widely disseminated in lectures at home and abroad, through articles appearing in periodicals and through his books. ''Tracy reaches beyond theology into the cognate sciences,'' adds the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, chairman of the department of theology at the University of Notre Dame, ''and returns to theology with new questions as well as new answers. He is very creative because, more than any other theologian, he really does understand modern philosophy, literature and language, and he can see connections nobody has seen before.'' ''A whole new configuration of decision making is developing in the church,'' McBrien adds. ''In the future, theologians will function freer of institutional domination. Tracy is way ahead of the bishops on this. By the time they understand his influence, it will be too late.'' According to Archbishop Weakland, although Tracy has not spoken to that broad public that once listened to Paul Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr, ''he has taken theology into the current academic world of the United States and made it again respectable as an intellectual discipline.'' OR TRACY, religious faith remains essentially too powerful and mysterious to be controlled or completely contained by administrators. ''Religion's closest cousin,'' he says, ''is not rigid logic but art.'' As such, religion speaks to all the layers of human personality and is best understood in its classic embodiments. For Catholicism, these ''classics,'' as Tracy terms them, include the person of Jesus, the Gospels, the lives of the saints and the traditional symbols and doctrines of Catholicism. Tracy is not interested in ridding the Catholic Church of its past but in refreshing its memory about the basic sources of its inspiration and spiritual energy. With this emphasis on the ''classic'' origins of Catholicism, Tracy insists that he is closer and truer to the basic tenets of Catholicism than many who style themselves defenders of the faith. His claim sends shudders through Vatican officials, who identify their institution with orthodoxy. By affirming that theology, like great art, reveals life's meaning not by offering easy certainties but by prompting an awareness of its complexities, that it has to do with the finally undefinable mysteries of existence rather than their solution, Tracy has not only enlarged Catholic theology's universe of interest but also lent legitimacy to new approaches in the field. Avery Dulles, a Jesuit and professor of theology at Catholic University, once criticized Tracy for seeming to emphasize earthly existence over an afterlife but now defends him. As he points out, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome, ''is a well-trained theologian who has himself been critical of neo-scholasticism as the only method available to theologians. He has himself emphasized the need for mystery, as David Tracy does, in the church. Theologians function in dialogue with the pope and the bishops, educating them, and this is a long, slow process.'' The Rev. Timothy E. O'Connell, associate professor of theology and director of the Institute of Pastoral Studies at Loyola University of Chicago, points out that Tracy is part of a long tradition marked by ambiguity and pluralism: ''The church that contains such opposite theologians as the positive, humanistic St. Irenaeus and the dour, somber St. Augustine has never been as monolithic as some people suppose.'' In addition to being a Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago, where he has taught since 1969, Tracy was the first theologian of any denomination to be invited to sit on that university's prestigious Committee on the Analysis of Ideas and Methods. He is also one of the few theologian members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The overlapping universes of his activity find him at home not only with Catholic theologians such as the Swiss Hans Kung, the Dutch Edward Schillebeeckx and the South American liberation theologians Gustavo Gutierrez and Leonardo Boff on the board of the international theological journal Concilium, but with de-constructionists and literary critics as well as with physicists in exploring the implications of the new cosmologies. He also finds time for ongoing dialogues with Jewish, Buddhist and Moslem scholars, for editing with Protestant associates an ecumenical theology book for American seminaries and for applying theology to political issues, as in his paper on human rights delivered in 1983 at a conference at Emory University. Tracy is also one of the few thinkers offering a theological rather than a political or intuitively liberal refutation of the literalist claims made by the powerful American fundamentalist churches. ''Real religion,'' he says, ''does not give final answers; it makes us ask better questions.'' OVER THE LAST SEVERAL months, I have had many conversations with Father Tracy in various settings. Now, as we enter the medieval city of the University of Chicago campus, the theologian turns to me and says, ''A great temptation is to say that there is only one way to practice any religion. That may sound benign,'' he says, ''because it simplifies things, but it really leads to ban the books, change the faculties in the seminaries and universities and, at the limit, mount a crusade.'' In response to a question, Tracy says: ''I've been told that I have a thick file in Rome, but I haven't experienced any interference with my work.'' Some observers suggest that his theology is too subtle to be censored easily. He seems unthreatened even by the possibility. He smiles. ''You know that, despite everything, the only people who are not afraid of the Catholic Church are Catholics.'' When asked about terms that hover mistily over his conversation, Tracy says that ''ambiguity is the difficulty we experience cognitively in naming the true and the false. Do we read the book of Genesis as literal or as poetic truth? It is also the ambiguity we experience morally in naming the good and the evil. The cross, for example, is a holy symbol of salvation for Christians but was for medieval Jews a demonic signal of terror in the pogroms.'' The urban inflections of Tracy's New York upbringing echo in a vaulted cloister walkway as he offers a definition of the work of a creative theologian: ''To spend your entire life reflecting on the most important questions people can ask, the 'limit questions' concerning those experiences at the boundaries of the ordinary that hint at something beyond. Such questions are provoked by the reality of our death and, therefore, that sense of how unpredictable all other things, in fact, are.'' A sunlit quadrangle opens before us. ''These questions,'' he continues, ''make you pause in your assumptions and wonder if something else may not be the case.'' He lists the signals of everyday mystery: ''The riddles of suffering, of the sudden feelings that interrupt life's continuities and challenge our seeming security, and of the boredom which can erupt into pervasive anxiety, even terror, in the face of some other, which seems to bear down upon us at certain moments. ''Think of our attempts to live responsibly when we cannot prove why we should be ethical at all, or of why we believe in a fundamental order in reality which allows scientific inquiry. Or of the nature of the universe open to us by the new astronomies and cosmologies, stranger than we imagine and stranger than we can imagine. And how do we understand the oppression endured by so many of the living? What is the meaning in the profound love and joy we experience?'' RACY'S EYES gleam beneath his prominent brow as he reflects on his motivation for becoming a theologian. ''I always loved cultural criticism, and I received great encouragement from my mother and father. Our home was filled with literary stimulation. My father'' - a union organizer - ''read to us, writers like Dickens and Henry Adams. My parents were always bringing us to visit places like the Adams home near Boston. ''New York had all the resources needed for cultural criticism but my religious sensibility seemed not to be a part of that critical world. I wanted to think about religion and culture, and about these subjects in relationship to each other. Theology is what we call this attempt to think on religion culturally and on culture religiously. So I moved toward this in a natural way.'' After completing his doctoral work in theology at Rome's Gregorian University, Tracy taught at Catholic University. There, he stood trial on his beliefs about birth control, which he holds is not intrinsically evil. He and his co-defendants, including Father Curran, were vindicated and allowed to continue to teach after demonstrating that theologians could dissent from certain papal pronouncements and still remain good Catholics. After Curran's recent censure on related accusations, the norms developed following his group's faculty trial for tolerable dissent among Catholics were abrogated by the university chancellor, Archbishop James Hickey. Tracy has strongly defended Curran, composing with other former presidents of the Catholic Theological Society of America two letters of protest, one to Cardinal Ratzinger at the Vatican, and a later one, which attracted several hundred theologians' signatures, for release to the press. As we enter the 1920's foyer of his apartment building near Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, Tracy observes that ''most cultural critics don't think about religion in culture; a theologian does think about religion and its resources in culture. In our country, writers must usually ask these theological questions because the rest of society, including the clergy, often does not know how to.'' ''No one,'' he says as we walk down the thickly carpeted ninth-floor hallway, ''is better than Saul Bellow on the role of the intellectual in our society - the endless search, but the difficulty of finding commitment in actions while maintaining the integrity of the self. And at the end of 'Mr. Sammler's Planet,' that remarkable phrase, 'For that is the truth of it - that we all know, God, that we know, that we know, we know, we know.' ''Joan Didion communicates what it would mean if we had lost a sense of the past or the future and had only the present and, in most cases in her novels, without healing. This is a terrifying vision of the abyss that can underlie ordinary life. All genuine writers always ask theological questions.'' Tracy's broad-based intellectual curiosity is reflected in the decoration of his apartment. A Fellini hat sits near a Spanish pilgrimage Madonna and the tables and shelves sag under journals, periodicals and books of every kind. Hunching behind his desk, under an old-fashioned bell-shaped clock that is running three hours late, Tracy explains the ''classics'' to which unanswered theological questions lead him. ''You need a word for those epochal persons, events and texts that, as received in the Catholic and other religious traditions, have an excess and permanence of meaning and do not yield to once-and-for-all explanations. They resist literal oversimplified interpretation. That is why they retain their mystery and power.'' As examples of classic persons, Tracy cites Abraham, Jesus and Buddha. Classic texts include the Bible and the Koran. And among great religious events, he identifies the Exodus and the Crucifixion, and those events that are classic for a culture: the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Great Depression. He also includes all the great works of the human imagination - by ''any artist who truly touches the human spirit.'' Tracy fluffs his gray-flecked beard with one hand as he continues: ''I explore the classics through the mode of an intellectual discourse I call conversation.'' This technique, strongly influenced by the contemporary German philosopher and scholar of interpretation, Hans-Georg Gadamer, does not deliver easy grace. ''It demands,'' Tracy emphasizes, ''a dialogue rather than an argument with other scholars who do not push an ideology or a political point but instead talk and wonder about the same profound questions. You look at it this way, then that, observe the play of light, and the multidimensional, reliable, astoundingly alive core truth of the classics will re-emerge.'' When asked for an example of a classic revisited, Tracy responds easily. ''The Exodus is one of the most powerful Old Testament myths, the great myth, then and now, of liberation and oppression. It is so, of course, for Jews, Christians and for many secular radical groups, as Michael Walzer'' - who teaches moral philosophy at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. - ''and others have pointed out. It is at the same time the major motif for the Latin American theologians of liberation and for every African nation striving for freedom. ''Still, it is ambiguous, because the Afrikaners identify with it as well, saying that they completed the myth and took the land from the blacks, whom they perceive as the Canaanites. We know from their spirituals and their blues that the black slaves in our own country had a correct reading for Exodus. But a century ago the interpretation that the blacks were the Canaanites was being given in seminaries and preached from pulpits in the South. ''As with all classics, you cannot get fully behind its epochal event; even in the Bible, Exodus is filled with ambiguity: Who were the 'murmurers' who railed against Moses because of the length of their stay in the desert, and who said to kill them, God or Moses? Exodus retains this ambiguous and pluralistic character and cannot be summed up easily because to read it without an appreciation of its complexity is to misread it. Genuine religious experience brings you into this kind of tension in relation to mystery.'' ''Essentially,'' Tracy says, ''a church is a community that keeps alive the dangerous memories of its classics. The memory of Jesus, for example, disconcerts all present reality, including that of the church, because He essentially afflicts the comfortable and comforts the afflicted. So theology makes religious institutions aware of their true spiritual resources and of their explicitly religious character. And it makes the wider culture aware of the religious dimensions of life by seeking better ways to ask the religious questions. This is a dangerous occupation . . . .'' Tracy tackles his writing well after completing his day's teaching. Besides offering traditional courses on such subjects as God and Christology, he emphasizes his commitment to conversation through team teaching. He offers a course annually with the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur on such subjects as foundations of ethics, and on Greek tragedy and Herodotus with David Grene, a classicist, and Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, a religious historian. ''I can get along fine,'' Tracy says, ''as long as I know that I will be able to get to my work by 8 P.M. I work through the night until 3 or 4 in the morning before retiring.'' His major books include ''Blessed Rage for Order,'' ''The Analogical Imagination,'' and his new book, ''Plurality and Ambiguity: Hermeneutics, Religion, Hope,'' to be published in April. Does America, I ask, recognize the role of a theologian as it did when Niebuhr and Tillich uttered prophecies that commanded the culture's attention? ''Those men,'' Tracy responds quickly, ''spoke to a more unified Protestant culture that had just emerged from two world wars and the Depression. Since the 60's, our culture has been richer and more pluralistic. Martin Luther King Jr. showed that it needn't be just a white male Protestant who spoke for or to America. King used the resources of the culture, the Declaration of Independence, for example, to which he referred with that haunting phrase, 'I read somewhere . . . .' What we have had is a cross-fertilization of tradition beneath the very gaze of our once-separate religious establishments. ''What this has led to is a communal, rather than individual, prophetic voice. Its dangerous ethical voice, inspired by the classic texts of the Scriptures, rises from the synagogues and churches on the great moral issues of our time: civil rights, peace, the environment, the morality of nuclear arms. It is frightening to think what some members of our Government would feel free to do, say in Central America, or in dealing with the poor, if this voice, which cuts across denominations and depends on the common religious impulse, did not speak. This voice threatens those in the establishment who want religion to endorse comfortable, white, middle-class values. That is also a factor working against one person's assuming a truly prophetic role in our culture.'' T RACY SITS IN THE FIRST row of the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel at the side of Mircea Eliade's widow, Christinel. He had kept vigil at the hospital bedside of the historian of religion, who, Tracy says, ''profoundly broadened my sense of religious pluralism. ''It is quite clear,'' Tracy says, ''that Catholicism is going through the greatest change since its passage from a Jewish sect to a Greco-Roman religion. The ways of being a Catholic will necessarily multiply and the church will be more diverse; pluralism in religious expression will increase, not decrease.'' At the reception afterward, Martin Marty, the Lutheran scholar, appraises Tracy thoughtfully. ''He is shaping the future of theological inquiry and of Catholicism because as a thinker of the first order he influences not only the seminary professors who teach tomorrow's priests but also professors at secular colleges. Students are being affected by his vision of theology everywhere.'' Peter Berger, however, a Boston University sociologist and writer on religion, objects to Tracy's emphasis on secular over ecclesiastical culture. And some Latin American liberation theologians, including Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay, see his work as too North American in its optimism and too academic in its settings and concerns. ''These men must know,'' Tracy says, revealing the ghost of a classic Irish temper, ''that these are serious misinterpretations of work that is totally consistent with the traditional Catholic sacramental view of the universe.'' As he leaves the reception, Tracy comments, ''People are really beginning to understand that the heart of the matter is mystery in any religion. The Law is there for the Jew to intensify that sense of mystery, not to replace it. The Church is there for the Catholic to do the same. The great religions draw closer and closer as they sense freshly the mystery in mystery.'' The solemn events of the day have evoked the classic religious theme that is at the core of Tracy's theology. ''The religious event described in the First Letter of John asks the question: What is the nature of ultimate reality? And the answer is: God. And, more explicitly, God is love. That is an extraordinary thought, that ultimate reality is love. ''It is also a terrifying thought. The various portraits we get of Jesus in the Gospels are the ways in which Christians try to understand this central metaphor that God is love. There is something contradictory here, for we see Jesus as sometimes terrifying and as sometimes comforting. Love, concretely in life, tends to be like that.'' Tracy, in a soft and wondering way, says, ''To think that reality is this, is extraordinary. ''If we look at the candidates for classic lives in our century, we recognize Pope John XXIII as a saint. He intuitively understood, as Gandhi did, that love is at the heart of everything. When he died, people of other faiths went into mourning, referring to him as 'their' Pope. That shows what a man with his sense of what a pope could be was able to accomplish as a symbol of unity.'' The reflective priest in Tracy can be heard as he concludes: ''The religious imagination of people is touched and comes to life in these classic lives, events and texts. They make us aware of this great mystery - that love is the basic reality. And that is what my work is all about.'' IN THE WORDS OF DAVID TRACY IS NOT THE GOD OF the Jewish and Christian scriptures a God profoundly involved in humanity's struggle to the point where God not merely affects but is affected by the struggle? Is Bonhoeffer's famous cry [ referring to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Protestant theologian killed by Hitler ] that only a suffering God can help merely a rhetorical flourish . . . ? Can the God of Jesus Christ really be simply changeless, omnipotent, omniscient, unaffected by our anguish and our achievements? Was the magnificent move of classical patristic and medieval Catholic Christianity from . . . the scriptural interest in God's relationship to humanity to . . . the patristic and medieval interest in God-in-himself a fully positive move? Or did its impressive intellectual achievements conceal certain inherent religious and conceptual difficulties? My own suspicion is that all authentic Christians live and pray and speak as if God were really affected by their action. They live as if . . . God really were Pure Unbounded Love struggling, suffering, achieving with humanity. Yet the question recurs: Christians may live and say this, but can they mean it. . . . Can Christians mean the most fundamental religious affirmation of Christian self-understanding if they simultaneously affirm the usual understanding of classical Christianity that God is the self-subsistent, changeless, omniscient, all-powerful one who is not really . . . but only notionally . . . affected by human actions? - FROM ''BLESSED RAGE FOR ORDER: THE NEW PLURALISM IN THEOLOGY,'' COPYRIGHT c 1975 BY SEABURY PRESS INC. EINSTEIN ONCE RE-marked that with the arrival of the atomic age everything had changed, except our thinking. Unfortunately the remark is true. Perhaps contemporary reflections on interpretation with their emphasis on plurality and ambiguity are one more stumbling start, across the disciplines, to try to change our usual ways of thinking. It is true that the point is not to interpret the world but to change it. But we will change too little, and that probably too late, if we do not at the same time change our understanding of what we mean when we so easily claim to interpret the world. Our Western dreams of domination, mastery, and certainty are over. The hope that interpretation will show us a way to resist is a fragile hope in a nuclear age. It may be less than we deserve, but it may also be more than we usually allow oursleves to envision, much less act upon. As for the rest, there is no release for any of us from the conflict of interpretations if we would understand at all. The alternative is not an escape into the transient pleasures of irony, or a flight into despair and cynicism. The alternative is not a new kind of innocence or a passivity masking apathy. Whoever fights for hope, fights on behalf of us all. Whoever acts on that hope, acts in a manner worthy of a human being. And whoever so acts, I believe, acts in a manner faintly suggestive of the reality and power of that God in whose image human beings were formed to resist, to think, and to act. The rest is prayer, observance, discipline, conversation, and actions of solidarity-in-hope. Or the rest is silence. - FROM ''PLURALITY AND AMBIGUITY: HERMENEUTICS, RELIGION, HOPE,'' TO BE PUBLISHED IN APRIL 1987. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION OF HARPER & ROW PUBLISHERS INC. WE CAN CON-tinue to give ourselves over to the great hope of Western reason. But that hope is now a more modest one as a result of the discovery of the plurality of both language and knowledge and the ambiguities of all histories, including the history of reason itself. And yet that hope of reason . . . still lives through any honest fidelity to the classic Socratic imperative: ''The unreflective life is not worth living.'' We can continue to give ourselves over to the hopes alive in all the great religions: a trust in Ultimate Reality, a hope for the ability to resist what must be resisted, a hope in hope itself, a hope which fights against our exhausted notions of what hope might be. For most religious believers that hope arises from the belief that Ultimate Reality is grace-ful. For non-believing interpreters . . . that hope may be glimpsed in the religious classics by sensing some enlightenment, however tentative, and some utopian possibility of emancipation, however modest. The hope proclaimed by all religious ways is well expressed by the classic Buddhist apothegm: ''The unlived life is not worth reflecting upon.'' - FROM ''PLURALITY AND AMBIGUITY: HERMENEUTICS, RELIGION, HOPE.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WEST SIDE HIGH: LAST CHANCE TO LEARN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/10/nyregion/west-side-high-last-chance-to-learn.html,"Edward A. Reynolds - ''Ed'' to his students - does not look or act much like a normal high school principal. Wearing a T-shirt, blue jeans and sturdy hiking shoes and carrying a walkie-talkie, he roams the halls of West Side High School like a friendly commando, coaxing students into class - ''Carol, go to class'' - and urging them to obey the rules - ''Ms. Luciano, put that cigarette out.'' Mr. Reynolds uses non-authoritarian and unorthodox techniques in one of 11 alternative high schools in New York City, a place that tries to recapture teen-agers who have dropped out of - or been suspended from -the city's larger, more impersonal high schools. Almost a third of the 271 girls at West Side are mothers, some as young as 15. Most of the 600 students have previously been chronicially truant; many have attended more than three high schools. ''Very few start out here fresh,'' said the 42-year-old Mr. Reynolds, who uses his walkie-talkie to keep in touch with the school's security officers. ''Usually you don't come here unless you've had trouble somewhere.'' Sprouted in 1960's Alternative high schools sprouted in New York City in the late 1960's to serve the large numbers of teen-agers, alienated from school, who stayed on the streets. In Brooklyn, the High School of Redirection grew out of a state youth grant intended to deal with students involved in summer rioting. The Lower East Side Prep School in Manhattan started from an Urban League storefront. West Side, which opened in 1972 and is now housed in a former elementary school at 140 West 102d Street, evolved from concern among local community activists. They thought neighborhood teen-agers needed an alternative to the overcrowded Louis D. Brandeis High School at 145 West 84th Street. Six of the 11 alternative high schools, including West Side, have nurseries where students can leave their babies while they attend class. An important course at the school is one that teaches mothers fundamental facts about child development. So far fathers have declined to participate in the class. Under Mr. Reynolds, who has been the principal for 12 years, the underlying premise of West Side is that the myriad and sometimes overwhelming family and social problems of the students have to be confronted before education can begin. Only six students in the school - 1 percent - live with both of their natural parents. The school employs a juvenile-justice co-ordinator to help students with their court cases -about 50 of the male students have spent time on ''the rock,'' as they refer to the Rikers Island jail - and an employment counselor finds students jobs. Mr. Reynolds keeps in touch with a Harlem landlord who can be counted on in a crunch to find apartments for students. A morning rarely goes by without a 7 A.M. phone call from a student with a crisis. The other day a 16-year-old student telephoned Mr. Reynolds, saying: ''Hi, Dad.'' The student's mother, ''was back on the drink,'' Mr. Reynolds said, and was beating the girl's 4-year-old twin sisters. Mr. Reynolds found the father of the twins and persuaded him to take them. He found the student's stepfather, who had left the house, and persuaded him to return. Later in the day, a 15-year-old applicant to the school walked in. Mr. Reynolds learned that her parents, both 32, were addicted to cocaine, and she was working from 4 P.M. to 11 P.M. to support them and her 3-year-old brother. The girl, along with almost anyone else who wants to attend the school, was accepted. A social worker was assigned to help the student's mother find a job, and the new student has been encouraged to work fewer hours. ''When the kids come here I tell them they have to do four things -come every day, come on time every day, stay the full number of periods, and do all the work assigned to the best of their ability, whether they feel like it or not,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''We say the key difference between a child and an adult is that an adult is capable of doing what is their own best interest.'' Contractions in Class The students' problems can often be overwhelming, and school staff, in the absence of parents, fill the breach. Marie Bronshvag, who teaches the class on child care, noticed in a recent class that one of the girls, pregnant with her second child, was complaining about stomach pains. It soon became clear that she was complaining every three minutes. Ms. Bronshvag rushed the girl into a taxi and took her to a nearby hospital, which diagnosed her as being well into labor. But the hospital was too full to take her, and the teacher and student were put in a jitney to a second hospital. Some eight hours later, the student gave birth to a 6-pound, 12-ounce baby. ''I went to see her in the hospital later,'' Ms. Bronshvag said. ''The baby's father is heavily into crack. I don't know if anyone else had been to see her.'' The girl, who lives in a welfare hotel, wanted to get a job as well as attend school, Ms. Bronshvag said. ''I explained she just had to come to school to keep her head above water for a while,'' the teacher said. ''How could she have a job when she is coming to school with a stroller, holding a toddler's hand and loaded down with books and diapers?'' Teacher Is Noticed Ms. Bronshvag, who is to receive an award as teacher of the year at a Board of Education ceremony today, tries to teach the mothers in her classes the financial realities of living on welfare. She writes on the blackboard what benefits a mother and child receiving welfare are entitled to. Then she asks the students to figure out their needs - housing, food, transportation and utilities. The students usually find the results unappealing. ''I'm not going to be seeing too many places,'' was one girl's reaction, Ms. Bronshvag said. Another commented: ''My clothes are going to be on lay-a-way for so long, they'll be out of sytle.'' Homework and Confidence Although many school traditions are absent at West Side, traditional learning flourishes in many classes. Rochelle Shereff, an English teacher, assigns and grades homework every night. ''The more they write, the more confident they become,'' she said. ''I am traditional. I don't see anything wrong with learning skills. And I don't see them complaining.'' In one of her recent classes, Ms. Shereff gave the class of 12 students the start of a composition to be completed for homework. '' 'Are you sure that's what you want?' she asked,'' was the opening line the students were to develop into a story. In a discussion of the story's possible twists and turns, the students personal concerns were reflected in the themes suggested: the break up of a romance, a discussion between a doctor and a girl over an abortion, someone leaving home. The school day at West Side begins with what is called ''family group,'' any other school's version of home room. The same students - normally about 12 to 15 - meet with the same teacher, eat breakfast brought in from the cafeteria and discuss whatever is on their minds. In the same way, the teaching staff is divided into ''family groups,'' for regular meetings that allow the faculty members to solve common problems collectively. Teacher morale appears high: last month attendance among the faculty was 98.4 percent, very high for the city. ''Ed gives us latitude,'' said Jim Murphy, a drug counselor who takes his students on wilderness trips to Maine. ''We don't have department heads breathing down our necks.'' Student Success Stories West Side can point to success stories, students who have been able to break the cycles of disfunction they brought with them. One of them is Ernie Ortiz, now 20, who was 12 when he was pushed out of home by his family. The youngest of nine children brought up on welfare, he lived in a group home and attended Seward Park High School for a while but dropped out, he said, because he was too ''shy'' to cope with such a large school. At 15, he enrolled at West Side with the skills of a fifth grader, his adviser, Ann Lipson, says. The school found him a job at a nearby video rental store; the store owner rented him a room in her house while he went to school. Last week, Mr. Ortiz graduated -after passing algebra and regularly using a thesaurus as a companion in his English classes - and plans to join the Navy. ''In other schools, the principals sit in their office in suits and with a cigar,'' Mr. Ortiz said. ''Here, Ed knows every student by name and I had an adviser who was a very sweet, intelligent woman who pushed me. The staff makes it work but the kids have to meet them half way.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HAMBURG VOTERS DEAL BLOW TO SOCIALITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/10/world/hamburg-voters-deal-blow-to-socialits.html,"In a stunning reverse three months before national elections, the Social Democratic Party lost its clear majority of parliamentary seats and its position as the biggest party in the city-state of Hamburg. In the last state election before the national parliamentary balloting on Jan. 25, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats emerged for the first time since World War II as the biggest party in Hamburg, traditionally a bastion of the Social Democrats. Scoring their biggest percentage ever in a state election, the anti-establishment Green Party won an unexpected 10.4 percent of the popular vote with a slate of candidates composed entirely of women. The Greens had campaigned for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy in the northern port state and for a cleanup of the polluted Elbe River. By running an all-female ticket the Greens sought to underscore their commitment to women's rights and their opposition to Christian Democratic efforts to weaken West Germany's abortion statute. Kohl Party Gets 1-Seat Edge The liberal Free Democratic Party, the junior coalition partner in Bonn, improved on its showing of 1982, when state elections last were held in Hamburg. But with 4.8 percent of the vote, the party failed to reach the 5 percent standard for representation in the Hamburg parliament. The post-election division of seats in the Hamburg parliament will be 54 for the Christian Democrats, 53 for the Social Democrats and 13 for the Greens. The Hamburg outcome, widely described as a ''sensation'' by commentators and politicians accustomed to much smaller vote swings, was a another demoralizing blow for the Social Democrats as they try to gear up for the national election campaign. Last month the party had its worst postwar result in state elections in Bavaria. The Social Democrats' rout was partly attributed to a widening scandal involving a housing conglomerate owned by a close political ally, the German Labor Federation, which has its headquarters in Hamburg. The union federation sold the mismanaged, debt-ridden Neue Heimat concern, which owns about 190,000 homes in West Germany, for a token one mark. Socialists' Return Drops 10% The Social Democrats, who saw their share of the vote tumble from 51.3 percent four years ago to 40.9 percent, were also apparently punished because of Hamburg's high level of unemployment and eroding industrial base. With 41.9 percent of the vote, the Christian Democrats emerged as the biggest party, but without a majority to form a government. Klaus von Dohnanyi, the Social Democratic premier in Hamburg, tonight firmly rejected a coalition with the Greens; he had an unhappy earlier experience running a minority government half-heartedly supported by the Greens. It seemed possible that the two big parties might eventually move toward a grand coalition in Hamburg. The dismal showing in Hamburg further eroded the credibility of the Social Democrats' proclaimed goal of attaining a clear majority in the Parliament in January. Most opinion polls put the party at about 40 percent of the national vote. Appearing with other national party leaders on television tonight, Chancellor Kohl said the Social Democrats' ''dream'' of winning a clear majority in Bonn ''has been shown to be what it always was - a dream.'' 'Heavy Defeat,' Brandt Says Willy Brandt, the Social Democrats' chairman, conceded that Hamburg had been ''a heavy defeat'' and, questioned by reporters, avoided restating the goal of a clear majority. Instead, he said his party's aim was to prevent the Christian Democrats from winning such a majority - something that has only happened once in West Germany. Johannes Rau, the Social Democrats' standard-bearer for the national election, has ruled out a coalition with the Greens to form a government in Bonn. The poor showing of his party today seemed likely to revive discussion over the possibility of a national coalition with the Greens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SMOKING POLICY DEBATED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/11/arts/smoking-policy-debated.html,"IT has been two decades since the Surgeon General alerted the nation to the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, leading to health warnings on cigarette packs and in advertisements. But the question of what more, if anything, should be done to discourage smoking remains cloudy. There are calls for prohibition, for a ban on advertising, for much higher taxes on cigarettes, for suits against their makers. Such proposals are the subject of tonight's episode of ''Managing Our Miracles: Health Care in America,'' on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock. After a slightly silly start, owing to a tendency on the part of the moderator, Prof. Charles R. Nesson of the Harvard Law School, to confuse Socratic dialogue with amateur theatrics, the issues are sensibly joined by a generally articulate panel, drawn mostly from government, journalism, the law and medicine. The only all-out defender of cigarettes is John L. Strauch, an attorney for R. J. Reynolds. He speaks of the ''claimed'' risks of smoking and emphasizes the lack of laboratory proof that cigarettes cause cancer or anything else bad. His case is dismissed by Dr. Willard Gaylin, a psychiatrist, as ''patent baloney.'' Their co-panelists, including the Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, agree emphatically that cigarettes are a proven hazard but differ over what ought to be done about it. Egged on by Professor Nesson, most of the panelists express special distaste for advertisements that feature good-looking, fun-loving young people with cigarettes at the ready. Joseph A. Califano Jr., former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, says the ads are directed at inducing youngsters to light up and not, as an advertising executive maintains, just at getting smokers to switch brands. The Surgeon General says he'd like $3 billion a year, a sum comparable to what the tobacco companies spend on advertising, to campaign against cigarettes. But Representative Henry A. Waxman of California finds little support for his proposal to ban cigarette advertising. The case against his proposal is put most energetically by Eugene Patterson, chairman of the St. Petersburg Times in Florida; he argues that as long as cigarettes are legal, the right to advertise is protected by the First Amendment. ''What are you going to tell me we can't print next?'' he asks. He wonders about advertisements for alcohol, for handguns, for pornography, for abortion clinics. With such exchanges, the program, produced by Betsy Miller and Martha Elliott, holds one's interest as it jumps from point to point. Using law-school techniques, Professor Nesson leads or drives the panelists into a lively discussion of whether a heavy-smoking victim of emphysema has a legal case against the maker of his favorite brand. Here, Mr. Strauch seems on more solid ground as he maintains that if people continue to smoke despite all the warnings, that's their own responsibility in a free country. My award for the evening's most provocative observation goes to Dr. William B. Schwartz of Tufts University's School of Medicine. He takes exception to the argument that a much higher tax on cigarettes is justified by the cost to society of smoking-related illnesses. That reasoning would apply to a number of other products, he observes. And he adds, cogently if a little cold-bloodedly, that the social costs of relatively quick, early deaths due to smoking are lower than the costs of prolonged old age with its degenerative ills. Credit ''The Smoking Dilemma'' with demonstrating that public policy even in an apparently simple case is more complicated than advocates on both sides care to concede.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VATICAN II HELPED TRANSFORM CLERIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/12/us/vatican-ii-helped-transform-cleric.html,"Two months after Raymond G. Hunthausen was appointed a Bishop, Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council. The council, which lasted from 1962 to 1965, not only transformed a firmly traditional Roman Catholic Church as no other event for centuries, but it also transformed the Bishop. ''Vatican II called us back to the primacy of love in our lives,'' he told an interviewer in 1983, eight years after becoming Archbishop. ''We had become overly reliant on the power of law and discipline, and had put aside the very principle that undergirds the church's existence. The council and the Gospels tell each one of us to be responsible, to discern as we can in the spirit of love just what God is asking us to do.'' Now Archbishop Hunthausen, the primate of the Archdiocese of Seattle, may be paying the price for the Vatican's conviction that the American church has extended the council's ideas about freedom of conscience too far at the expense of discipline. His authority in several areas was superseded by his Auxiliary Bishop after the Vatican found shortcomings in the archdiocese's liturgy and marriage annulment procedures and in its conduct toward former priests and homosexual groups. The Vatican said the Archbishop lacked the ''firmness'' necessary to govern. Deeply Upset and Baffled The prelate at the center of this storm is a reflective man who intimates say is deeply upset and baffled by what has happened, particularly the suggestion that he disrespects Pope John Paul II. ''I don't know of anybody who is more respectful of the Holy Father,'' said Bishop Nicholas E. Walsh, the retired Bishop of Yakima, Wash., who has known Archbishop Hunthausen for more than 40 years. ''I think it's the most painful period of his life.'' Critics like Erven Park, a salesman of heavy equipment who heads a conservative group, Roman Catholic Laity for Truth, that has spearheaded the attacks on the Archbishop, disagree with such assessments. ''He carries a double agenda,'' Mr. Park said in an interview yesterday. ''He will make certain statements on orthodoxy and support for unity and the Holy See. But in fact he totally supports those of his lieutenants who are in open rebellion with the Holy See.'' The Archbishop first stepped into the national spotlight with his fight for nuclear disarmament early in this decade. Saying that ''the ultimate evil is that as a nation we are willing to destroy life to protect our life style,'' he refused to pay the share of his taxes that went toward military expenditures. Friends say that reverence for life is also evident in his deep love of woods and mountains. The Archbishop regularly leads fellow Northwest bishops on weeklong backpacking expeditions in the Montana wilderness, where they sleep under the stars and pray in the stillness of that locale's vast spaces. Accomplished Skier A short, sturdily built man of 65 years, the Archbishop is an accomplished skier who has schussed the slopes of Aspen and Sun Valley. He rides a five-speed bicycle, shoots 18 holes of golf in the middle-to-high 80's and is, according to Bishop Walsh, ''an impatient fisherman.'' Raymond Gerhardt Hunthausen, known from childhood as Dutch, was born Aug. 21, 1921, in Anaconda, Mont. His parents were German immigrants. His father was a grocer selling goods to the mineworkers and his mother's family ran a brewery. Archbishop Hunthausen, the oldest of seven children, remembers gatherings that bubbled with life. ''Those were noisy, happy times,'' he said. ''We recall them with such delight that my brothers and sisters and I will throw a family reunion at the drop of a hat.'' The family sent the children to parochial schools, and young Raymond was often chosen by the Ursuline nuns to give a speech whenever the Bishop of Helena visited. ''It killed me,'' he said, ''but I did it out of duty and respect. Now I realize it's important to have been pushed. I still feel a sense of pressure about everything.'' He went to Carroll College, a small men's school in Helena, where the Rev. Bernard Topel, later the Bishop of Spokane, gently steered him toward the priesthood. ''Humanly speaking, I didn't want to be a priest,'' he said. ''I was attracted to marriage and family life and I wanted to fly airplanes.'' At St. Edwards Seminary he was known as deeply spiritual, although not pious, yet his vocational doubts persisted until his ordination in 1946. ''At the moment of ordination, when I heard myself promising a life of prayer and celibacy, all my doubts were resolved, even though other choices were finally cut off,'' he recalled. In Athletic Hall of Fame He taught chemistry at Carroll College but earned a larger reputation coaching the football, basketball, baseball and track teams. The teams won eight conference championships, and the Archbishop may be the only member of the American hierarchy in the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. He served as president of Carroll for five years until 1962, when he was appointed Bishop of Helena. Armed with the pluralistic message of Vatican II, whose sessions he attended, the new Bishop gave priests and lay people a freer reign in their own parishes. That attitude continued when he moved to Seattle in 1975 to take over a diocese that covers the western third of Washington, although some priests complain that his loose style of management has permitted staff members to pursue their own liberal goals. In 1983, the members of the archdiocese's Respect Life Committee resigned out of frustration with the efforts of the Chancery staff to combat abortions. But supporters are pleased that the Archbishop has made overtures to people who had often felt excluded by the church: divorced Catholics, women, illegal aliens, homosexuals. ''They are Catholics,'' he said of a 1983 cathedral mass celebrated for the homosexual group Dignity. ''How could I deny them a church?''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AFTER WARNING, BOMB IS FOUND IN QUEENS CLINIC",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/12/nyregion/after-warning-bomb-is-found-in-queens-clinic.html,"A dynamite bomb was found yesterday in a Queens medical clinic where abortions are performed after the police responded to an anonymous telephone caller. The bomb - three sticks of dynamite wired to a an alarm clock, blasting cap and battery - was defused by members of the police bomb squad at the site, the Queens Women's Medical Office at 83-06 Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst. The bomb was found under a cushion of a couch at 8:30 A.M., after an employee of the clinic arrived to let the officers in, a police official said. The official, Assistant Chief John Holmes, said the officers had gone to the clinic after the police received a call from an unidentified male at about 6:45 A.M. ''He said it would be under a cushion on a couch in the waiting room,'' the chief told reporters as traffic began to flow again on rainswept Queens Boulevard. Part of Boulevard Closed The boulevard, a major thoroughfare, was closed to traffic in both directions for several blocks near the office until about noon, snarling traffic in the area, while the explosive device was dismantled and removed. The bomb was timed to go off at 2 P.M., the chief said. An explosives specialist who asked not to be identified said that if it had detonated, it would have done heavy damage and ''anyone in that room would be blown up.'' There was no indication when the device had been placed and investigators said they did not know whether the clinic had been previously threatened. The operator of the clinic, Dr. Farzan Shirazi, last night disputed descriptions of his office as an ''abortion clinic.'' ''We do abortions, but only 10 to 15 percent of our patients have them,'' he said. ''We specialize in obstetrics and gynecology and family planning.'' Early on Oct. 29, a bomb went off at the Eastern Women's Center, an abortion clinic on East 30th Street in Manhattan, doing about $10,000 worth of damage and slightly injuring two passers-by. Nobody has been charged with that crime and investigators were looking to see if there was a connection between yesterday's incident and the earlier one, officials said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WASHINGTON TALK; A Turning Point On the Abortion Issue?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/13/us/washington-talk-a-turning-point-on-the-abortion-issue.html,"After long years on the defensive, advocates of abortion rights are cheering the results of last week's elections. They say that the victory of pro-choice candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as the defeat of several anti-abortion measures on state ballots, strengthens their movement not only to resist further erosion, but to regain the initiative on such issues as public financing of abortions for poor women. For their part, anti-abortion leaders concede they have received a frustrating setback. They criticize the Reagan Administration for playing down the abortion issue, along with the rest of the conservative social agenda, and thereby failing to motivate committed anti-abortion voters to come out and vote. ''These issues got a lot of Republicans and conservative Democrats elected in the first place,'' said Jack P. Fowler, director of the Washington office of the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life, an anti-abortion lobbying group. ''But for some reason the Administration and the candidates wanted to stay away from abortion this year.'' He called the strategy ''a misjudgment,'' adding: ''It smacks of stupidity.'' Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, says the pro-choice side picked up at least three seats in the Senate and five in the House, while no pro-choice incumbent was defeated for any Federal office. The three Senate seats, all won by Democrats, are in Georgia, with the substitution of Wyche Fowler Jr. for an anti-abortion Republican freshman, Mack Mattingly; South Dakota, where Representative Tom Daschle defeated James Abdnor; and North Carolina, where the Senate seat was held by one of the chamber's most committed abortion foes, John P. East, until his suicide last summer. Mr. East's interim replacement, Representative James T. Broyhill, who had a generally anti-abortion voting record, was defeated last week by a strong pro-choice candidate, Terry Sanford. In addition, although Bob Graham, the Senate winner in Florida, is not firmly on the pro-choice side, he is viewed as more liberal on abortion than the Republican he defeated, Paula Hawkins. In the House, four of the six defeated incumbents had anti-abortion records and will be replaced by pro-choice challengers who received money from the abortion rights league's political action committee. The newcomers, all Democrats, are Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, who defeated Mike Strang; Mike Espy of Mississippi, defeating Webb Franklin; Louise Slaughter of upstate New York, defeating Fred J. Eckert; and David Price of North Carolina, who defeated Bill Cobey Jr. The league counts a second victorious North Carolina Democrat, James McC. Clarke, as an improvement over the incumbent, Bill Hendon, although it did not give him money. 'A Shot in the Arm' Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, thinks the most important result of the election may be ''to make candidates believe that being pro-choice isn't death.'' For the last decade, she says, the conventional wisdom has been that an anti-abortion stand was the only safe one for a politician, leading a number of pro-choice officials to duck the issue or to hide their real beliefs. ''This election will be a shot in the arm for people to vote their principles,'' Ms. Benshoof added. The only Senate candidate to run on an overtly pro-choice platform, Harriet Woods of Missouri, was narrowly defeated by Christopher Bond, who is a strong opponent of abortion, as was Senator Thomas F. Eagleton, whose retirement created the vacancy. Richard Mintz, spokesman for the National Abortion Rights Action League, said Ms. Woods had been trailing in the polls and improved her standing, albeit insufficiently, after running television spots in which she described abortion as a private matter that should be decided by each individual and not by the Government. Despite the inroads last week, the House retains a lopsided anti-abortion majority, by as many as 25 votes. Two anti-abortion leaders of the House, Bob Dornan of California and Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey, both Republicans, were targeted by the abortion rights league but easily won re-election. But the newly constituted Senate, if not affirmatively pro-choice, is probably now too close to call on the abortion question. ''We can work with the Senate now,'' Ms. Michelman said. ''We lost a lot in the past, but now the momentum is shifting our way and we're planning to go forward and take the offensive.'' The abortion rights movement's top legislative priority is to restore Federal funding, through the Medicaid program, for abortions for poor women. Congress has barred Federal funding for the last 10 years, although 14 states, including New York, have continued on their own to subsidize abortions for poor women. ''They're suffering delusions of grandeur,'' Kay James, public affairs director of the National Right to Life Committee, said of the abortion rights leaders' plan to push for public funding. But she added that, given the losses in the Senate, ''we have our work cut out for us.'' Ballot Initiatives Defeated The sharpest losses for the anti-abortion movement came with the defeat of ballot initiatives in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Oregon that would have restricted access to abortion. The Massachusetts and Rhode Island measures would have given the states sweeping powers to ban abortion if the Supreme Court were to overturn its 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade, that made abortion a constitutional right. The voters in Rhode Island, the most heavily Roman Catholic state in the country, defeated the measure by a 2-to-1 ratio. A similar proposal in Arkansas apparently lost by a few hundred votes, but state officials there will not certify the results until next week. The measure had been winning by as much as 40 percent in pre-election polls until Planned Parenthood began running a television commercial that depicted a 14-year-old rape victim, pregnant and unable to get an abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VATICAN AIDES SAY BISHOPS' TALKS IN U.S. MAY MARK TURNING POINT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/13/us/vatican-aides-say-bishops-talks-in-us-may-mark-turning-point.html,"Senior Vatican officials said today that the American bishops' conference might be a turning point in the difficult relations between the Holy See and important elements of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. Officials in several Vatican offices, assessing the bishops' meeting in Washington this week, said they were not surprised by either the divisions between liberal and conservative bishops or by the resentment toward Rome felt by some American prelates. The officials emphasized, however, that the issues were now more clearly defined and that the road had been opened for efforts to heal the rift, probably including a meeting between Pope John Paul II and representatives of the American hierarchy. The Vatican has not issued any statements about the bishops' meeting, said Joaquin Navarro Valls, the Pope's chief spokesman, because it wants to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the meeting. Vatican officials generally discussed the meeting cautiously and asked not to be identified. A Focus on 'Allegiance' A senior aide to the Pope said: ''In the past the difficulties have been posed in terms of disagreements on several different moral issues like abortion and contraception. Now everyone seems to realize that something much more fundamental is involved: the structure of the church and in particular the bishops' allegiance to the Pope.'' Another aide said: ''This could be a turning point. Even though the divisions will not go away overnight, the bishops are now focusing on their relationship with Rome and perhaps realizing that disagreements can only go so far.'' The American bishops, while acknowledging the ''dismay and confusion'' caused by the Vatican's decision to discipline Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen of Seattle, issued a statement today reaffirming their ''loyalty to and unity with the Holy Father.'' Archbishop Hunthausen was censured in September for what was called divergence from church teachings. Senior Vatican officials said the Pope was well aware that his authority faced a vocal challenge from a large segment of the church in the United States. ''The degree of dissent, even among the bishops, is well-known here,'' one said. ''So is the fact that much of that dissent is aimed at Rome.'' The problems of the church in the United States have become the focus of increasing concern as the Vatican begins planning the Pope's eight-day visit to the United States in September. ''There is every realization that this is going to be a difficult and important trip,'' one aide said. Bishop James W. Malone, who is stepping down as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, suggested on Monday that American bishops meet with the Pope before the trip to work out their difficulties. Several Vatican officials noted that in the past the Pope used special meetings with national hierarchies to ease tensions and to encourage obedience. Thus he might meet with the Americans. Commenting on the lack of official Vatican statements on the American bishops' meeting, the officials said the Pope had made his intentions clear in a message read at the opening session. ''You are, and must always be, in full communion with the Successor of Peter,'' the Pope said, referring to himself with the papacy's most potent source of authority in its direct link to Jesus Christ. Some officials here viewed the Pope's message as extraordinary because most of it was taken up with reminding the bishops of the papacy's functions and purpose, saying for instance that a Pope is ''the first servant of the church's unity and universality.'' Two cases in which John Paul met with members of a national hierarchy to contend with dissent were in January 1980, when the bishops of the Netherlands spent three weeks in Rome, and last March, when the Pope met with representatives of Brazil's hierarchy. The meeting with the Dutch prelates was called by the Pope to halt a move toward open schism between liberal and conservative Dutch Catholics and to enforce orthodoxy on such basic issues as priestly celibacy. The meeting was generally considered a success. The other meeting was to help mediate differences in Brazil over the degree to which the church should be involved in political action on behalf of the poor. The differences were not resolved, but Vatican officials said relations between the bishops and Rome were notably improved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U.S. REPORT ASSERTS ADMINISTRATION HALTED LIBERAL 'ANTI-FAMILY AGENDA',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/14/us/us-report-asserts-administration-halted-liberal-anti-family-agenda.html,"A report issued today by a Reagan Administration panel on the family asserts that ''two liberal decades'' frayed the fabric of American family life, bringing increased crime, illegitimate birth, drug use, teen-age pregnancy, divorce, sexually transmitted disease and poverty. A result of a seven-month study by the 22-member interdepartmental group, the report maintains that the Reagan Administration brought to a ''crashing halt'' the ''anti-family agenda'' of preceding years, initiating a ''defense of the family'' that has since become ''fashionable.'' According to Gary Bauer, Under Secretary of Education, who headed the panel, the report has been sent to the White House Domestic Policy Council, which will forward it to President Reagan after study and potential revision. The 64-page report, which Mr. Bauer discussed at a news conference today, is more descriptive than prescriptive and hews closely to conservative thinking on issues from abortion to welfare. Role of Welfare Discussed It hails self-sacrifice, self-sufficiency, discipline and religion. Urging less Government involvement in family life, it encourages greater awareness of the possible ramifications for families of government action. It also maintains ''welfare contributes to the failure to form the family in the first place,'' and says the ''easy availability of welfare in all of its forms has become a powerful force for destruction of family life through perpetuation of the welfare culture.'' Among its key recommendations, the report says Mr. Reagan should require all agencies and departments to write a ''family fairness statement'' on the impact of any new legislation or regulation on families. And it advises the Treasury Department to consider increasing the personal exemption for dependents to ease the tax burden for families with children. The starting point for the Government in dealing with the family should be the central tenet of the Hippocratic oath, ''First of all, do no harm,'' the study says. With that goal in mind, it explains that the ''family fairness statement'' it seeks to have the President carry out should require agencies and departments to consider any new actions against eight criteria. These include an examination of whether the action would lessen earned household income, whether it would reinforce ''the marital commitment that holds the home together,'' and whether it could be carried out by a lower level of government or by the private sector. The report drew criticism from several who said the findings had been shaped to fit a right-wing political agenda. ''The document is less a policy paper than a tantrum,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who is an expert on welfare policy. ''Worse, it is an embarrassment. They're not writing from facts. This is just ideology.'' Mr. Moynihan, whose book on family problems, ''Family and Nation,'' was published this year, attacked the group's statement that benefits under Aid to Families With Dependent Children were ''indexed'' to provide regular increases to accommodate the cost of living. Drop in Welfare Payments ''If you know one thing about A.F.D.C. it's that it is not indexed and was bashed by the inflation of the 70's,'' Mr. Moynihan said. ''Welfare payments declined sharply during this period, so it is also illogical to suggest that welfare dependency has increased owing to increasing payments. Payments have gone down because they were not indexed.'' Mr. Bauer conceded the error, saying it had been caught Wednesday night, too late to make any corrections. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, termed the report ''a smokescreen for failure.'' Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research organization, said: ''As a study, the report is not objective or dispassionate. But some of the recommendations are worthy of consideration.'' In particular, Mr. Greenstein, who worked in the Carter Administration, praised the report for suggesting that earned income tax credits for working poor families with children might be increased with the number of children. ''That would make the benefits of working more competitive with benefits of public assistance,'' he said. Patrick Fagan, executive vice president of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative social policy organization, said, ''We like very much what Mr. Bauer is saying.'' The American Public Welfare Association, a bipartisan association concerned with social welfare policy, applauded the report's goal of strengthening the family. But its director, A. Sidney Johnson 3d, added: ''While we agree with Secretary Bauer's statement that public policies should 'do no harm' to America's families, that certainly should not mean, do nothing.'' In the press conference, Mr. Bauer said the working group had used as its definition of ''family'' those related by blood, marriage, or adoption. He denied suggestions that the tone of the report was critical of mothers who worked, couples who decided not to have children and those who divorced. The report says: ''Intact families are good. Families who choose to have children are making a desirable decision. Mothers and fathers who then decide to spend a good deal of time raising those children themselves rather than leaving it to others are demonstrably doing a good thing for those children. ''Public policy and the culture in general must support and reaffirm these decisions - not undermine and be hostile to them or send a message that we are neutral.'' The report says single mothers who are under 21 should not be given subsidized housing if they decide to live apart from their parents. It says Aid to Families With Dependent Children ''could be restructured in a similar way.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IN THE NATION; A Good Man Going,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/opinion/in-the-nation-a-good-man-going.html,"One recent afternoon, not long after most members of the 99th Congress had departed to campaign or to rest, Senator Charles McC. Mathias, Republican of Maryland, was in his office pondering such details as sans-serif type and boldface caps for a redesigned Congressional Record. Changes in that venerable publication could cause an uproar on tradition-conscious Capitol Hill. But Mac Mathias, as chairman of the Senate's housekeeping Rules Committee, could pick and choose without concern. After 26 years in Congress, eight in the House and the last 18 in the Senate, he had decided to go home - in his case, just to the Washington suburbs. Any senator's departure might ordinarily be less earthshaking than a revamped Congressional Record; but the Mathias retirement opened his seat to the Democrats in a year when the Republicans needed to hold every one they could. Barbara Mikulski, a Baltimore Democrat, won it by a smashing 61 percent - which only emphasizes how remarkable it was that Mac Mathias could win three Senate terms in one of the most Democratic states in the nation. He did it not only by being reasonably liberal - Ronald Reagan, before he began to need Senate votes, accused him of not being a true Republican - but because he was fair, flexible, concerned, able to rise above partisanship but not above responsibility. His reward from his party was to be euchred out of the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee when seniority should have brought it to him in 1981; instead, conservatives persuaded ancient Strom Thurmond of South Carolina to jump from the Armed Services Committee to block him. But Mac Mathias is not a bitter man. He chooses to remember happier events - improving, for instance, the pension of a Confederate veteran's widow who for years had never received the cost-of-living increases she was due - and larger satisfactions, like the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park that runs through Maryland. In the House in 1961, Mac Mathias introduced the legislation establishing the park; then he saw action completed in the Senate in 1969. ''When I put that bill in,'' he recalled, ''old Clarence Brown [ an Ohio Congressman ] said 'Whoever heard of a national park 20 miles wide?' I told him 'Yes, but it's 180 miles long.' Now I like to drive along the canal and see the people out there enjoying themselves.'' It's not well enough remembered that when President Kennedy - who was elected the year Mac Mathias went to the House - failed to submit a promised civil rights bill during his first Congress, three Republicans introduced one in January 1963, before Mr. Kennedy sent up what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They were John Lindsay of New York, William McCullough of Ohio and Mac Mathias. ''Ours wasn't as extensive as the final bill,'' Mr. Mathias conceded, ''but it was the clear forerunner and had a lot to do with Republican support in the House.'' After 18 years, he still admires the Senate as an institution in which only ''collective strength'' - often bipartisan - makes positive action possible; but one, too, in which only one member, if he or she ''has the desire to do it, can really slow down a freight train'' - for example, proposals that may threaten civil liberties or constitutional rights but have the backing of a majority motivated by momentary passions. But he sees the Senate functioning poorly in recent years, owing to complex new problems (energy, the environment, foreign trade), the substitution of ''a single omnibus bill no one understands'' for the traditional authorization-appropriations procedure, a ''less felicitous atmosphere'' among more ideological senators, and contentious issues, such as acid rain and abortion. Which senators, among all those he served with, had he most respected? Without hesitation, he named ''Fulbright, Javits, John Sherman Cooper, Cliff Case, Phil Hart, Mike Mansfield, George Aiken.'' Why? ''Individual responsibility. Each one of those people would take an issue on his own responsibility. They wouldn't have to have the cover of some ideology. They'd simply come to the conclusion that this was the right thing for the country.'' Such ''individual responsibility,'' in his own career, surely is another reason Democratic Maryland kept Republican Mac Mathias in the Senate as long as he'd stay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Edwin Meese's Agenda,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/magazine/l-edwin-meese-s-agenda-388186.html,"Attorney General Meese prides himself on ''providing law enforcement that is not just vigorous but compassionate.'' He also believes that the ''biggest victory'' of the Supreme Court's 1985-86 term was its upholding of the Georgia antisodomy law - a law that provides prison sentences for certain acts of private, consentual lovemaking. ''Protecting the average man from crime'' is a priority of Mr. Meese's Justice Department. Mr. Meese's priorities are difficult to reconcile. To Edwin Meese, the ''preservation of constitutional values'' means leaving all social issues, including abortion and school prayer, up to the states. Mr. Meese's conviction that the Supreme Court ''should not supersede its judgment for the judgment of the states'' defies the Constitution and the American ideal of protecting individual rights. The Attorney General assures us that the Justice Department ''will be fiercely independent in upholding the law.'' To assure our freedom, we need a Supreme Court that will be fiercely independent in upholding the Constitution. P.

MEESE AIDE ASSAILS THE PRESS AND LAW SCHOOLS ON COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/us/meese-aide-assails-the-press-and-law-schools-on-courts.html,"A top Justice Department official today denounced what he called liberal media and elite law schools as propagating an ''overblown myth'' that courts should engage in ''liberal social reform'' in the name of constitutional interpretation. The official, Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, asserted that the ''elites who advocate and celebrate judicial supremacy,'' viewed the Constitution only as ''what can be found in the most recent collection of Supreme Court opinions that further their liberal agenda.'' His remarks were in a speech prepared for delivery in Chicago tonight to the Federalist Society, a national group of conservative law students and lawyers. A fervent conservative, Mr. Reynolds heads the department's civil rights division and is one of the most trusted aides to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d. While echoing many of Mr. Meese's criticisms of liberal judicial activism, Mr. Reynolds aimed most of his fire at what he called a ''lack of any real appreciation'' for the Constitution and its history on the part of major news organizations and law schools. Charges Ignorance of Law ''Many of the nation's top editorial writers and news analysts, neither very learned in the law nor at all intimidated by that shortcoming, have misused their media access to foster public misconceptions about our Constitution and the proper role of the courts under it,'' he said. In addition, he said, ''The overwhelming majority of tenured professors in our law schools today are aligned philosophically with the liberal left, and they view their mission much less in terms of teaching 'first principles' than in terms of cultivating new recruits to advance their social reform agendas.'' Mr. Reynolds said, it was in part to combat this bias in news organizations and law schools that Mr. Meese had set out to ''to help educate the public about our constitutional heritage during the Bicentennial celebration.'' ''For too long in this country,'' he said, ''we have suffered silently too many judicial 'emperors' with no constitutional clothes. These appointees erroneously regard their pronouncements from the bench as the supreme law of the land. ''Law professors by and large - with a few notable exceptions - 'teach' their students that this decisional law is supreme. And certainly a misguided, and largely untutored, cabal of liberal journalists and commentators share and assiduously promote this view.'' Cites Outcry on Meese Talk In particular, Mr. Reynolds assailed what he called ''the petulant outcry from the liberal left in response to the Attorney General's speech at Tulane University.'' His reference was to an Oct. 21 speech in which Mr. Meese said a Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution, while binding on the immediate parties to the case and any officials who must enforce the ruling, was not on a par with the Constitution itself. Such a ruling does not ''establish a 'supreme law of the land' that is binding on all persons and parts of government, henceforth and forevermore,'' he said. Mr. Meese's speech was denounced by some civil libertarians, liberal legal scholars and editorialists. They said it seemed to encourage lawlessness and defiance of the Court akin to the ''massive resistance'' by Southern states to the 1954 decision striking down school segregation. Asserting, as has Mr. Meese, that nothing in the Tulane speech could fairly be read as calling for such defiance, Mr. Reynolds said today: ''His remarks were not an attack on the Court. They were, instead, a useful and much-needed explanation of the judicial process.'' ''For many of these elites in journalism, the law schools, and academe,'' he continued, ''no death penalty may intrude upon their world, even though the framers of the Constitution found such punishment to be neither cruel nor unusual. ''Yet, they would freely permit a death sentence to be pronounced by way of abortion on the most innocent and fragile among us. Their attention is riveted on rights of the accused to a degree that is a logical absurdity.'' He said a result was that ''victims of crime are largely left to fend for themselves.'' Criticizes Law School Courses Mr. Reynolds said most law schools ''have largely abdicated their responsibility to educate the future members of our profession on the Constitution,'' partly because courses on constitutional law focus ''almost exclusively on specific rulings of the Supreme Court,'' neglecting the Constitution's text and history and ''the intent of the Framers.'' ''Regrettably,'' he added, ''it has become the accepted understanding of generations of law students that the 'Constitution is what the judges say it is.' '' He said most lawyers ''are largely indifferent to such cosmic issues that have no relevance to their more mundane (but infinitely more lucrative) client issues.'' Meanwhile, many activist law graduates, ''reinforced by a liberal media,'' were appointed to the bench by previous Administrations and have ''gone on to work their special brand of judicial activism.'' ''Possessed of a thinly disguised intellectual arrogance that not infrequently takes cover behind the 'spirit' of the Constitution as found in its so-called penumbra,'' Mr. Reynolds said, ''they roam widely across the legal landscape, content not only to proscribe public policy, but intent on prescribing it as well.'' He said these judges ''have undertaken to reshape American society to their moral liking,'' and ''have created new rights where none existed in the Constitution.'' He said they had pursued a ''philosophy of radical egalitarianism,'' which Mr. Reynolds ascribed in a speech last month to Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS & TRENDS; ARE FETAL RIGHTS EQUAL TO INFANTS'?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/weekinreview/ideas-trends-are-fetal-rights-equal-to-infants.html,"THE question of whether a fetus is a person, with all the legal and civil rights that status entails, is at the heart of a growing debate on the responsibilities women have to their unborn children. A pregnant woman who decides not to have an abortion is obliged to care for her child; that much is probably not controversial. But should the state intervene if the woman fails to meet her obligation? This knottier question underlies a number of recent cases in which judges have taken steps to protect the lives of fetuses. In Colorado, Illinois and Georgia, for example, women have been ordered to undergo Caesarean sections after doctors testified that fetuses were in danger. (The women had objected to Caesareans on religious grounds or because they were afraid.) In other cases judges have ordered that brain-damaged pregnant women be kept on life-support systems - in some instances over the objection of family members - so fetuses could survive. Fetuses have also implicitly been granted personhood by ''feticide'' laws that permit prosecution for homicide when a fetus is killed in a criminal attack on the mother. Sixteen states have adopted such laws, which have been championed by the right-to-life movement. But nowhere have the twinned issues of fetal rights and maternal responsibilities been raised as pointedly as in the case of 27-year-old Pamela Rae Stewart Monson. Mrs. Monson, who lives with her husband in a trailer park in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, is one of the few women in the United States to face criminal charges for the conduct of her pregnancy. Last November Mrs. Monson gave birth to a brain-dead son. According to the El Cajon police, she had suffered during her pregnancy from placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta may separate from the uterine wall, depriving the fetus of oxygen and nutrients. A doctor had warned Mrs. Monson that drugs or sexual intercourse could trigger the onset of the condition and had told her to seek immediate medical attention if she started to hemorrhage. In the ninth month of her pregnancy, according to the charges filed against her, Mrs. Monson ignored these warnings. When her son was born, physicians found amphetamines and barbituates in his blood. Most important, Mrs. Monson had failed to get to the hospital for more than six hours after she began bleeding heavily. For that failure she is scheduled to stand trial next year in San Diego. Charged with a criminal misdemeanor, she faces a year in prison if convicted. A 'Troubling' Prosecution Harry Elias, chief of the child abuse unit of the San Diego District Attorney's office, chose to prosecute Mrs. Monson under a 1926 California statute that makes it a crime for a parent to ''willfully omit, without lawful excuse,'' necessary ''medical attendants'' for a child. The purpose of the statute was to secure support payments for children, including unborn ones. Michael Shapiro, a professor of legal and medical ethics at the University of Southern California, said the California law might well apply to Mrs. Monson if Mr. Elias could establish a clear medical connection between her failure to follow her doctor's instructions and the death of her son. But he called the issue ''troubling on all sides,'' adding: ''I am concerned about the attitude of disrespect for the fetus. I am just as concerned about intruding on a woman's private life.'' Other ethicists argued that cases like the one involving Mrs. Monson do not belong in the criminal justice system. ''There are a number of options besides criminal prosecution,'' said Arthur Caplan of the Hastings Center, an ethics institute in New York. ''I don't think we want to pass laws about not getting to the hospital on time.'' When and how the state may legitimately intervene in the relationship between mother and fetus is a question that seems likely to arise again and again. The Monson case is significant, said Mr. Caplan, because ''there is a large group of mothers - addicts, alcoholics and others with various drug abuses - who are producing a fair number of severely ill infants.'' Yet as Professor Shapiro put it, the police cannot be ''dropping in on pregnant women every six weeks, or executing search warrants to see if there is heroin or alcohol in the house.'' What can the state do? The real issue underlying the Monson case, according to Alexander Capron of the University of Southern California, is the quality of prenatal care available to poor women. ''Most mothers who are poor want to take care of their babies,'' he said, ''but are stopped by financial problems and a lack of good prenatal care.'' Mrs. Monson, for example, did not receive medical care until her seventh month of pregnancy. Moreover, said Richard Boesen, Mrs. Monson's attorney, the prosecution of a supposedly negligent mother may discourage some women from seeking prenatal care. Boesen said he had received calls from pregnant drug-users who are avoiding seeing a doctor out of fear they may be subject to criminal action.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE TO CLOSE THE AGENDA GAP,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/weekinreview/new-congressional-leaders-hope-to-close-the-agenda-gap.html,"SENATOR J. BENNETT JOHNSTON was direct in announcing that he was withdrawing from the race for Senate majority leader. ''I do not believe I have the votes,'' the Louisiana Democrat said. With his statement, the high leadership of the 100th Congress became set. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the minority leader for the last six years, is assured of winning the majority leaderhip again in elections this week. In the House, Representative Jim Wright of Texas will be anointed Speaker on Dec. 8, succeeding Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts. But while Senator Johnston, withdrawing gracefully, appealed for party unity, he also warned his colleagues that ''the dangers are great'' in the Congress that convenes in January. Indeed, many Republicans seem distinctly relieved that the Federal deficit, for one, is now the responsibility of the Democrats. ''I don't sense that there's much consensus on their agenda for governing the country,'' said Senator John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican. As the Republicans found out last week, there is not much consensus in either party. Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who two years ago declined the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to continue as chairman of Agriculture, told his colleagues that he now wants the top Republican position on Foreign Relations. Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the outgoing Foreign Relations chairman, also wants to be ranking Republican, and says he will not move over for Mr. Helms, who has seniority. The Republican members of the committee will have to choose between them in elections soon, and the choice illuminates a deep fissure in Republican ranks. Mr. Helms represents the hard right wing of the party, which identifies with anti-Communist movements from Angola to Afghanistan. Mr. Lugar, a more pragmatic conservative, believes the United States must support nationalist movements in such countries as South Africa and the Philippines. A Helms victory would signify that Senate Republicans are ready for confrontation with the Democrats. Mr. Byrd also faces divisions among his troops. Liberals are dusting off proposals for social welfare programs such as public financing for abortions. More centrist legislators, such as Mr. Johnston, are arguing that the Democrats cannot ''play this game of being all things to all people.'' Roping in the Mavericks One theory holds that the Democrats' large margin in the Senate, 55 to 45, will cause difficulties for both parties. ''The Senate works best when it is closely divided,'' said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ''The mavericks in both parties are under more internal pressure to stay in check.'' Mr. Johnston's bid for the Democratic leadership had less to do with such considerations than with the concerns that prompted the unsuccessful challenge by Senator Lawton C. Chiles of Florida to Mr. Byrd in 1984 - a belief that Mr. Byrd had not propounded a coherent party strategy and communicated its message to the public. Mr. Johnston based his campaign on the argument that he would present a ''better face.'' Mr. Byrd's reply was that as minority leader he had little power to set the agenda or command public attention. Leading the majority requires a ''different style,'' Mr. Byrd said, adding that while he is not a ''pretty face'' on television, he would not cringe from the camera. Other Democratic senators said Mr. Byrd had solidified his support by promising to step down as leader in 1988. The landscape of the House has also been altered. During Mr. O'Neill's last six years as Speaker, he was the most visible Democrat in the capital, often serving as the party's chief spokesman. With the Senate returned to the Democrats, Mr. Wright will have to share the limelight. For the last 50 years, the Democratic leadership in the House has oscillated along an ''Austin to Boston axis.'' Liberal Northeasterners have alternated with moderate Southwesterners in an unspoken but powerful tradition that prevents either region or philosophy from dominating the party. As Mr. O'Neill put it recently, Mr. Wright, whose aspirations to the leadership Mr. O'Neill supported, would have to start focusing more broadly. ''We're all parochial,'' he said, ''but he will have to understand that he just can't talk to the oil people or the agriculture people.'' The Texas lawmaker is known for tub-thumping oratory, a style that does not always play well on the home screen. Many House Democrats are hoping that the new Speaker will follow Senator Byrd's lead and hire a good television consultant. The first fight facing the Democrats under Mr. Wright is the party whip contest. Tony Coelho of California, who has won many friends and made a few enemies with his stewardship of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is running, as is Charles B. Rangel of New York, who has strong support among liberals and would be the first black to win a leadership post. Mr. Wright will then have to start working with Senate Democrats forging party positions on such contentious issues as trade with Asia and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. These early tests will help indicate how effective a counterweight the new leadership will provide to the master politician who still has two years in the White House.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THESE PIONEERS WANT CABLE TV,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/books/these-pioneers-want-cable-tv.html,"THE NEW HEARTLAND America's Flight Beyond the Suburbs and How It Is Changing Our Future. By John Herbers. 228 pp. New York: Times Books. $19.95. FORT COLLINS, Coeur d'Alene and Mountain Home may not yet be household words. However, these communities - in Colorado, Idaho and Arkansas, respectively - and others like them are among the fastest-growing in the United States. While most large cities continue to decline and many suburbs are marking time, small towns and rural areas are in fact attracting people. Perhaps this was bound to happen. After all, surveys have consistently shown that almost half of all Americans say they would like to live in such settings. And, as John Herbers shows in ''The New Heartland,'' growing numbers are now able to realize that wish. Indeed, he points out in this engrossing and probing book, ''a large proportion of Americans have never felt comfortable with the structure of the modern metropolitan area.'' They find the suburbs sterile, and cities - well, they're not even nice places to visit anymore. Nor do all young professionals aspire to fast-track careers. More and more people with college degrees are opting for ''simplicity of life and rural atmosphere.'' Moreover, this trend has political implications, notably in a fundamentalism that has an agenda for the nation as a whole. Mr. Herbers, a national correspondent for The New York Times, has visited the several dozen places he depicts in his book. He also deals deftly with census figures, using them to pinpoint subtle shifts in preferences and values. Recent years, he writes, have seen ''a massive decentralization of industry,'' with companies looking for ''low-wage areas with a ready supply of female labor.'' Between 1970 and 1980, Fort Collins, once a secluded college town, grew by 50 percent after Kodak, Hewlett-Packard and NCR decided to set up plants there. Not the least of its attractions was that less than 4 percent of the local work force was unionized, compared with 15 percent elsewhere in the state. Increasingly, insurance companies are moving their regional offices to small communities because they have a good supply of wives willing to work for supplemental salaries. Even USX (formerly United States Steel) plans to build its new plants in semirural settings, which is what Japanese firms in the United States are already doing. And as towns and counties grow, they hang out ''Help Wanted'' signs. More than half of Coeur d'Alene's police officers are alumni of the Los Angeles force. If newcomers settle for smaller salaries, the cost of living is lower and they seem to maintain a comfortable life. Mr. Herbers found a ''well-stocked wine and cheese store,'' along with a ''New York-style deli,'' in most smaller shopping centers. Mr. Herbers was raised in a small Tennessee town, and has a good understanding of what the new heartlanders want. These men and women, he says, represent ''a return to the philosophy of an earlier America formed before we became an urbanized nation.'' Their philosophy may have deep roots, but they want a frontier stocked with urban amenities. None of the people we meet show any interest in agriculture, or even fellow feeling for it. Those with homes next to farms complain about the smell of fertilizer and the noise made by tractors. In a chapter entitled ''The High Cost of Spreading Out,'' Mr. Herbers shows how the tab for living in the new heartland rises as more people move in. Thus when the terrain cannot take more wells or more septic tanks, waterlines and sewers must be installed. And with satellite signals being scrambled, we hear demands for cable television. Despite all talk of self-reliance, a heartland tailored to modern tastes will require subsidies. APART from being blandly middle-class and enjoying the out-of-doors, the people Mr. Herbers describes seem to lack distinctive traits or qualities. Whatever ethnic backgrounds they have appear to have faded, especially as distance weakens family ties. This helps explain their ''self-centered individualism,'' with its strong moral tone. Thus they select communities that are overwhelmingly white or, in the South or Southwest, areas where only whites are moving in. All the places he visited voted more heavily Republican than did the rest of those states. Perhaps the most important catalyst has been the activism of evangelical churches, which have made a point of welcoming heartland newcomers and providing them with a ready-made community. The result has been to renew and broaden the fundamentalist constituency, a development closely watched by the current Administration. By no means do all evangelical congregations go in for faith healing or frenzied confessions. Many have communicants with sophisticated tastes. What they provide is the feeling that the way of life their adherents have chosen is morally and politically right. Having found that path, Mr. Herbers goes on to suggest, they wish to see those values embraced by the nation as a whole. For Americans who wish to understand attacks on textbooks, antipathy to abortion and the defeat of the equal rights amendment, ''The New Heartland'' offers some of the best insights I have seen on the energies that fuel these campaigns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Politics by TV, Money Does All the Talking; What's in a Label?",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/opinion/l-in-politics-by-tv-money-does-all-the-talking-what-s-in-a-label-316586.html,"To the Editor: If political designations are to have any meaning, it is time that they were redefined in the context of today's world. President Reagan's use of the word liberal ''with a capital L'' -referring to Representative Timothy E. Wirth, Representative Ken Kramer's opponent in the race for senator from Colorado (news story, Oct. 31) - to mean the pejorative antithesis of progressive makes one wonder what the difference is between the two, and why it is bad to favor generosity and advancement, which constitute the basic meanings of both terms. While we are at it, we should examine the significance of such designations as ''radical,'' ''conservative'' and ''reactionary.'' The same day you report, ''The results of a new survey rebut the idea that college students have become politically more conservative.'' The support, you say, of such positions as abortion at will, national health insurance and protecting the environment represent a traditional liberal political and social stance. Since we already have such programs to a large extent, would not these areas represent conservative or nonchanging opinions? As for ''taxing the wealthy,'' given as another evidence of liberal leanings, why would singling out a small minority, the rich, for additional burdens be considered liberal? It seems that when one has determined one's favorite designation, whatever position one chooses to take on any issue becomes part of that designation. No wonder the average voter is confused. RENA G.

WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Bring On the Makeup,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/17/us/washington-talk-briefing-bring-on-the-makeup.html,"Senator Edward M. Kennedy's decision to choose the chairmanship of the Labor and Human Resources Committee rather than the Judiciary Committee next year may provide a significant political assist, after all, for Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, who is considering a run for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988. A study by Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution indicated earlier this year that Judiciary attracts more national television coverage than any other committee except Foreign Relations. A new study by Mr. Hess of coverage by local television stations shows the Judiciary Committee receiving nearly twice as much attention as its nearest rival, the Labor Committee. One of the most serious problems confronting Senator Biden's national political ambitions is that he is not well known outside his small home state. He had originally entertained some concern that the judiciary chairmanship might spotlight him unduely on controversial issues, but that reluctance may pass. Mr. Hess believes the Judiciary Committee has attracted considerable television interest because it deals with proposed Constitutional amendments on controversial issues like abortion, school prayer and budget balancing, not because of its oversight of Presidential judicial appointments. The Brookings fellow's findings on coverage of Congress by local television, which has expanded considerably in recent years, will be included in his forthcoming book, ''The Main Street Senate.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HEALTH CLINICS EXPAND INTO INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/18/nyregion/health-clinics-expand-into-intermediate-schools.html,"With complaints ranging from sore throats to thoughts of suicide, students at Intermediate School 52 in the Inwood section of Manhattan have been flocking for the last month to a new suite of pink-walled cubicles in the school - a modern medical clinic that contrasts with the dingy hallways and classrooms. It is the only health care that many of them receive. Some 80 percent of the school's 1,000 students are from the Dominican Republic, many of them newly arrived immigrants from rural areas where medical care is minimal. The free clinic at 650 Academy Street and Broadway is described as the first comprehensive intermediate-school health-care clinic in New York City. A second such clinic is to open today at I.S. 164 at 401 West 164th Street, near St. Nicholas Avenue, in Washington Heights. They reflect a nationwide trend toward school-based health services for teen-agers - most of them so far in high schools, according to Judith Jones, an associate clinical professor of public health at Columbia University who developed the two programs. ''They are a response to community need in disadvantaged areas,'' she said, ''and I think they are an idea whose time has come.'' The clinics in New York high schools were a subject of controversy this fall when it was disclosed that nine of them provided abortion counseling and birth-control information, and two distributed contraceptives to students. The Board of Education last month banned the distribution. But contraception, Ms. Jones said, is not a major concern at the pre-high school level. Any students seeking birth-control devices at the clinic would be referred elsewhere, she said. With foundation and state and Federal financing of $1.8 million for five years, the two uptown clinics represent a partnership of Columbia's Center for Population and Family Health, Presbyterian Hospital and community organizations, Ms. Jones said. Working full time at each clinic, under a pediatrician who oversees both clinics, are a nurse practitioner who can write prescriptions, a social worker and a ''health advocate'' whose job includes counseling. ''The kids have a lot of problems of adjustment into a new environment,'' Ms. Jones said, ''so there is a tremendous need for counseling.'' Volunteers including medical students and members of the community are being recruited as tutors. Students need signed parental consent to use the clinic, whose services include complete physicals, sex education and information on drug and alcohol abuse. ''We hope to reduce risk-taking behavior,'' Ms. Jones said. ''We think high school is late for preventive health care.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON TALK: POLITICS; Back Aboard the 1988 Presidential Express,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/18/us/washington-talk-politics-back-aboard-the-1988-presidential-express.html,"The 1988 Presidential campaign, interrupted for a few months by the 1986 elections, is back on track, and the likely contestants are once again fair game for those who set early expectations, handicap the aspirants and write the scenario for choosing the next President. Despite some evidence of public ennui, given the relatively early stage of the contest, the process nevertheless goes forward for the Presidential hopefuls and their strategists. What are they up to now? First, the Democrats: GARY HART - Leaving the Senate after two terms, the Coloradan is joining the Denver law firm of Davis, Graham & Stubbs and plans to lecture part-time at the University of Florida School of Law. In the months ahead he will be honing his campaign message, recharging his network of supporters in key states and trying to erase the $2 million debt he still owes from his 1984 Presidential bid. Without the Senate as a forum, Mr. Hart will try to make the most of his position as the widely acknowledged Democratic front-runner by pressing his rivals to begin the political debate in 1987. MARIO CUOMO - Running second only to Mr. Hart in Democratic preference polls, the Governor of New York continues to give mixed signals about his intentions. Stung by critics in his re-election campaign who said, among other things, that he was too arrogant in refusing to debate his opponent for much of the campaign, Mr. Cuomo accused New York reporters of being biased and threatened to restrict their access to him. After the election, Mr. Cuomo was on the telephone trying to convince some prominent opinion-makers outside the state that much of the criticism was a bum rap. His re-election landslide intensified interest in both a Cuomo candidacy and his political character. JOSEPH R. BIDEN Jr. - The Senator from Delaware is in line to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which is likely to be a high-profile position the last two years of the Reagan Presidency. Mr. Biden scorns ideological politics, but he could find it difficult to avoid ideological conflict as the man Democrats will be counting on to lead the examination of President Reagan's nomination of conservative judges. Some political experts view Mr. Biden as the Democrat most likely to clash with the Rev. Jesse Jackson over the direction of their party. BRUCE BABBITT - The Governor of Arizona, whose term ends in January, already has seven major policy speeches scheduled between now and the end of the year keyed to children's issues, trade, welfare revision and United States relations with Mexico. Mr. Babbitt, who is known for his intellect and willingness to challenge party orthodoxy, is intensifying his organizing efforts in Iowa and New Hampshire and cozying up to Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who could be a key player in 1988 as a power broker in the South. The Gephardt Campaign RICHARD A. GEPHARDT - The Congressman from Missouri expects to hold his position as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, a leadership perch he can use to shape the Democrats' legislative agenda. Mr. Gephardt, who officially formed a Presidential exploratory committee today, hopes, if he runs, to finish at least third in the Iowa caucuses, second in the New Hampshire primary and go for a breakthrough in the South, where he has been making allies as a leader of the Democratic Leadership Council. A new recruit to his campaign is Richard Moe, a former adviser to Walter F. Mondale. JESSE JACKSON - He is hoping his candidacy and agenda will be a refuge not only for blacks but also for leftist activists who have become disenchanted with the party's drift toward the political center. Mr. Jackson could have his greatest impact in the 11 Southern primaries in the second week of March, if he won enough states in a crowded field to prevent any rival from wrapping up the nomination early. On the Republican side: VICE PRESIDENT BUSH - Far ahead of his rivals in the polls, political organization and money, Mr. Bush will come under increasing pressure to define himself and his message in terms that go beyond just defending the Reagan record. His loyalty to Mr. Reagan is seen as a plus in his bid for the nomination, but it could be a handicap in the general election campaign, especially if the last two years of the Reagan Presidency are marked by economic uncertainty and foreign policy turmoil. BOB DOLE - The Kansas Republican has lost his platform as Senate majority leader, but his advisers say he will now be free to spend more time on the campaign trail and to develop his own political agenda. Dole partisans contend that he has already gained considerable political advantage from the leadership post, establishing himself as an effective lawmaker and earning points with the party's conservative wing. JACK KEMP - His strategists believe the upstate New Yorker gains the most from Mr. Dole's demotion to Senate minority leader. The 1986 election outcome left the party's conservative activists complaining that Republicans, including the President, had avoided issues that could have sharpened their ideological differences with the Democrats. Mr. Kemp, who has identified himself closely with the Reagan agenda, hopes to benefit from the yearning among many rightists to center the 1988 campaign on conservative issues. PAUL LAXALT - His Presidential hopes appear to have been dampened by the defeat of Jim Santini, a former Nevada Democrat whom Mr. Laxalt had annointed as his successor in the Senate. Some of his closest associates say they will be surprised if he makes the race, but Mr. Laxalt says the main consideration will be whether he gets sufficient financial and political commitments. HOWARD H. BAKER Jr. - Mr. Baker will meet in Tennessee on Dec. 1 with his closest advisers to consider whether to crank up his Presidential campaign. One potential obstacle is his wife's ill health. But one Baker adviser said Mrs. Baker's health was much improved, making it more likely that the former Senate majority leader would run. The First to Announce PIERRE S. du PONT 4th - The first in either party to announce his candidacy, the former Governor of Delaware is running a longshot campaign that combines a cheerleading role for Mr. Reagan's economic policies with his own provocative proposals. Mr. du Pont recently proposed a plan to augment the Social Security System, a political issue on which Republicans keep getting burned. PAT ROBERTSON - Political professionals say that the television evangelist cannot win the nomination but that he could be a factor in the Republican primary battle, particularly in the South. He will need a solid base of conservative Christians, but Election Day surveys of people who voted showed members of this group splitting their votes between the two major parties and concerned less with abortion and prayer in public school than with pocketbook issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 Political Words That Dare Not Speak Their Name,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/19/opinion/10-political-words-that-dare-not-speak-their-name.html,"Back in the early 1970's, the comedian George Carlin titillated adolescents with a racy monologue about ''The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television.'' Working as issues director in a recent, unsuccessful Congressional campaign, I discovered that politics has its own forbidden lexicon. While TV taboos relate predictably to sex, most (but not all) political taboos hark to the discredited doctrine of liberalism. To spare future campaign workers my painful lesson, I submit a handy guide to ''The 10 Words You Can't Say in Politics.'' First comes the word ''liberal'' itself, as in ''I am a liberal.'' Given the aversion this word inspires in Democratic candidates, future civilizations sifting through the rubble may well conclude that ''liberal'' was a euphemism for ''pederast'' or ''serial killer.'' It didn't help our campaign that most members of the press suspected my candidate of being a liberal. Our opponent made the most of this by sending out a direct-mail letter calling my candidate a liberal, highlighting the L-word in bold type. In fact, my candidate was not a traditional liberal but leaned toward being what I would call a ''neo-liberal.'' However, my candidate found the connotations of ''neo-liberal'' too half-hearted and technocratic. Even Charles Peters, editor of the Washington Monthly, who spearheaded the movement and coined the term, concedes that ''neo-liberalism is a terrible name.'' My candidate, who had a sly sense of humor, suggested the spicier term ''nuevo liberal.'' But when reporters asked, ''Are you a liberal,'' it was simplest to say, ''I don't think labels mean very much.'' ''Regulate'' is beyond the pale. Writing a position paper on the environment, I needed to express the importance of making sure real estate development did not endanger shoreline ecosystems. I got around the problem by writing about the need to make sure that development ''is harmonious with environmental concerns.'' Everyone favors this. No one is in favor of ''regulating'' development, which is the same thing. A similar problem is posed by ''class.'' Opportunities abound for politicians of all ideological stripes to play on class resentment to score points. But the rules do not allow use of ''class.'' Instead, evoke images -of greedy, incompetent chief executive officers (if you're a Democrat) or of smug, overpaid new-class Government workers (if Republican). ''Abortion'' and ''contras'' occupy a unique niche. While most voters favor legalized abortion and oppose funding the contras, what they feel far more deeply is resentment about having to think about these troubling issues at all. So try not to bring them up. If forced to discuss them, demonstrate anguish. (Note: this anguish must be sincere. I take my cue from the National Abortion Rights Action League, which in its pamphlet ''Winning With Choice'' admonishes pro-choice candidates to express personal opposition to abortion only if that's what they really believe.) Filling out a questionnaire from the League of Women Voters, I made the mistake of calling for ''wage restraint'' from both labor and management in smokestack industries. This got me in trouble. Instead, talk about the need to save our manufacturing base. Protectionist insinuations never hurt. If the particular industry is beyond all hope, invoke national defense. ''Fairness'' has been getting bad press. Voters are said to now associate it with affirmative action and other controversial policies aimed at equality. (''Equality,'' of course, falls into the category of Don't Even Think About It.) But the popularity of tax reform may have helped rehabilitate the word ''fairness.'' We sneaked it in here and there, and it didn't seem to hurt. Polls show that most citizens favor some form of compulsory national service. I'd like to meet these people. Eager to back up inspiring rhetoric about the need for greater sacrifice and participation from all citizens in the common life of the nation, my candidate called for a ''draft.'' We never knew what hit us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MEESE AND THE SUPREME COURT: HE DEALS WITH CRITICS BY SOFTENING HIS REMARKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/19/us/meese-and-the-supreme-court-he-deals-with-critics-by-softening-his-remarks.html,"Amid the furor that often follows Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's critiques of the Supreme Court, a pattern has emerged: Critics denounce what they consider the radical implications of his remarks. Aides say the critics misconstrued his real meaning. And Mr. Meese clarifies his remarks in ways that seem to remove some of their initial sting. The most recent example is Mr. Meese's speech Oct. 21 at Tulane University. He asserted that while a Supreme Court decision was binding on the immediate parties and on officials responsible for enforcement, it ''does not establish a 'supreme law of the land' that is binding on all persons and parts of government, henceforth and forevermore.'' A storm of protest ensued, from critics who accused Mr. Meese of stirring up defiance to Supreme Court precedents, even inviting legal chaos. Then, last Thursday, Mr. Meese issued a detailed response, in an Op-Ed Page article in The Washington Post, specifically rebutting a critical editorial. Contrary to what critics had said he meant, Mr. Meese wrote, it was his view that Supreme Court decisions ''do indeed have general applicability and deserve the greatest respect from all Americans,'' including officials, and that ''it would be highly irresponsible for them not to conform their behavior to precedent.'' The point of the speech, Mr. Meese said, was to stress that the Constitution itself ''stands on a higher plane'' than the Court's decisions, that those decisions could be wrong, and that it was proper to criticize them and urge reconsideration. He said this point should be self-evident but had been overlooked or denied by devotees of judicial supremacy. Brown Case Is Cited Mr. Meese's article also qualified his denunciation in the Tulane speech of the Court's statement in a 1958 case that its 1954 decision striking down segregation of schools was ''the supreme law of the land,'' and thus binding on all states. The 1958 ruling, Cooper v. Aaron, was designed to quell massive resistance in Little Rock, Ark., and elsewhere in the South to the mandate of the 1954 decision, Brown v. Board of Education, that school segregation be dismantled. In the Tulane speech, Mr. Meese said, ''The logic of Cooper v. Aaron was, and is, at war with the Constitution, at war with the basic principles of democratic government, and at war with the very meaning of the rule of law.'' In Thursday's article, on the other hand, without mentioning Cooper v. Aaron, Mr. Meese said: ''The general principle laid down in Brown v. Board of Education governed not only Kansas, whence the case arose, but all other states that had segregated schools. ''Or to use an example of a decision with which I do not agree, Roe v. Wade struck down Texas abortion law, but also contained a principle that officials in other states were obliged to apply.'' Terry Eastland, Mr. Meese's chief spokesman and sometime speechwriter, said in an interview that, fairly read, the Tulane speech was perfectly consistent with Mr. Meese's subsequent article. Critics and Critiques He said some of Mr. Meese's critics were quick to caricature his true meaning and score rhetorical points, rather than ''engaging the issues that Meese raises'' in reasoned intellectual debate. On the other hand, some of Mr. Meese's critics say his more provocative critiques of current legal doctrines have far-reaching implications that give a truer insight into his thinking than the subsequent clarifications, qualifications and amplifications. Whatever the reasons, the recent controversy was not the first time that Mr. Meese found it necessary to quiet concerns raised by what he and his aides have suggested were misinterpretations of his public remarks. In the written text of a July 1985 speech to the American Bar Association, for example, Mr. Meese criticized the Supreme Court's doctrine that most provisions of the Bill of Rights, originally applicable only to the national government, were ''incorporated'' by the Fourteenth Amendment and thus applied against the states. Implication of His Speech He said the doctrine rested on an ''intellectually shaky foundation'' and that ''nowhere else has the principle of federalism been dealt so politically violent and constitutionally suspect a blow as by the theory of incorporation.'' But for the long-established incorporation doctrine, states might in theory be free to abrogate separation of church and state, curtail freedom of speech, seize private property for public use without compensation and search the homes and tap the phones of citizens without warrants. But when he delivered the speech, Mr. Meese omitted his criticism of the incorporation doctrine. And minutes after leaving the platform, when asked by a reporter whether he thought the Court had gone too far in applying the Bill of Rights to the states, he said: ''No. I think this is something that's been done in 1925 and I do not have any particular quarrel at this stage of the game with what the Court has done in the intervening 60 years.'' A few months later, Mr. Meese said that while he questioned the historical basis for the incorporation doctrine, ''because precedent, stability and predictability are important, I don't think it would be either prudent or necessary to roll back the clock.'' On Guilt of Suspects Almost nothing has been heard from Mr. Meese about the incorporation doctrine since then. But his original written attack on the incorporation doctrine drew more attention than his subsequent remarks, Another of Mr. Meese's controversial remarks about the Constitution came in an October 1985 interview with U.S. News & World Report explaining his opposition to the Court's curbs on interrogation of criminal defendants. ''The thing is, you don't have many suspects who are innocent of a crime,'' Mr. Meese said then. ''That's contradictory. If a person is innocent of a crime, then he is not a suspect.'' Critics accused Mr. Meese of suggesting that all criminal suspects were guilty and repudiating the traditional presumption of innocence. In a subsequent news conference, Mr. Meese said, ''I think it's important to clarify, in case there are any doubts in anybody's mind, that I do not believe that simply because a suspect is being questioned or even arrested he or she is necessarily guilty. That certainly is not the case, and any misinterpretations of my remarks should be corrected.'' In response to further questions, he acknowledged that any ''misinterpretations'' might have been prompted by ''a bad choice of words on my part.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WASHINGTON TALK; A STAMP FOR ELMS? OR MILLER?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/19/us/washington-talk-a-stamp-for-elms-or-miller.html,"Glenn Miller and Elvis Presley, their fans will tell you quickly, have little in common musically. But years after their deaths, they are together, nominated again in a long-standing effort to get postage stamps issued in their honor. They are what Donald M. McDowell, a Postal Service official, calls perennial favorites who are nominated by individual citizens and various groups and organizations year after year but, for whatever reason, do not get enough support. The names of the band leader and the popular singer will come up again Friday, Mr. McDowell said, when the Citizens Postage Stamp Advisory Committee meets again to go through the hundreds of nominations. Any nomination approved by a majority of the committee will be forwarded to the Postmaster General, Preston R. Tisch, who has the final say. Besides the perennials, there are many people and other ideas for stamps that will be going before the committee for the first time. Here are some that Mr. McDowell listed: * Hiram Havley, founder of New Mexico State University. * Ruth St. Denis, the dancer. * The 50th anniversary of the construction of the Alaska Highway. * The American elm. * The loon. * Professional Secretaries Week. * Tennesseans Against Crime. * Eddie Cantor. * The 200th anniverary of Haitian independence, to be celebrated in year 2004. (This is a problem, Mr. McDowell said, because the United States normally does not commemorate foreign events on its stamps, but the Haitians are bound to get points for planning so far ahead.) * The police patrol wagon, as part of a series on transportation. * Harry Hopkins, confidant of Franklin D. Roosevelt and head of the Works Progress Administration. * All ethnic groups that have made contributions to the American dream. * Those who visit the elderly and the sick. The last is used by Mr. McDowell to make the point that many of the nominations were touching and that every submission had some degree of merit. All are considered by the panel, he said, and the committee will always reconsider a rejected nomination if it is reproposed. Here are some of the other perennials that no doubt will be on the list along with Miller and Presley: * Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of ''The Little House on the Prairie.'' * Emma Lazarus, author of the poem now on the base of the Statue of Liberty. * Gen. Henry Martyn Robert, a military engineer best known for Robert's Rules of Order. * Snowshoe Thompson, who carried mail pouches across the High Sierra in the late 19th century. * Drunken driving. * Peace. * Poultry. * Volunteer firefighters. * Jackie Robinson, who broke the color line in major league baseball. * Alzheimer's disease. * Rabbits. * The anti-abortion movement. * The pro-choice movement. Mr. McDowell agreed that the committee would keep its distance from the last two, having once got into a dispute when a stamp on family planning was approved. The committee meets six times a year, and it has been confronted in recent months with many requests that a postage stamp commemorate the astronauts killed in the Challenger space shuttle in January. Thus it will surely be pressed to waive its rule barring commemoration of people until at least 10 years after death. Those seeking the stamp will point out, Mr. McDowell said, that the 10-year rule is routinely waived for Presidents. The following are the members of the citizens advisory panel, most of whom are also stamp collectors: Belmont Faries, chairman, former philatelic editor of The Washington Star. Clinton T. Andrews Jr., editor of the editorial page of The Anchorage Times. Federal Judge Edward A. Beard, retired. Wilbur J. Cohen, former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. William D. Dunlap, advertising executive. John E. Foxworth Jr., executive at General Motors, past president of the American Philatelic Society. Ann DeWitt Harvey, artist and graphic designer.

BUENOS AIRES JOURNAL; DEMOCRACY CALLING: IT'S WOMEN'S NEW SELLING JOB,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/20/world/buenos-aires-journal-democracy-calling-it-s-women-s-new-selling-job.html,"When democracy returned three years ago, many people worried that it might become just another of the pendulum swings that have marked Argentina's political life for half a century. Believing that one reason for the country's political misfortunes has been the absence of grass-roots civic activity, a fledgling women's group called Conciencia, or Conscience, set out to change things. Literally with Constitution in hand, members have established a network of women throughout Argentina who undertook first to learn the laws of the land, then began projects ranging from campaigns against red tape to debates on the hottest, and sometimes the dullest, issues facing Congress. Maria Rosa Segura de Martini, the national president of Conciencia, said she and other leaders were trying to combat the notion, both here and abroad, that participatory democracy might simply be against the Latin American grain. 'It's the System' ''It's true that we are Latins and we are individualists and all that,'' she said, ''but it seems to me, for example, that if immigrants to the United States from all kinds of cultures can so quickly adapt to civic life there, then we ought to be able to make the system work here.'' ''It's not a question of the people, it's the system,'' she added. Mrs. Martini and the other founders are primarily affluent women from the fashionable neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, with children and successful husbands. Most had had little salaried work experience but had backgrounds and skills in community or charity fund raising. ''Maria Rosa's brother suggested that what we needed to do was to sell democracy like cosmetics,'' recalled Lucrecia Bello de Royere, another of the national leaders. Mrs. Martini said the idea the group got from her brother, who had been involved in introducing both Avon and Mary Kay Cosmetics into Argentina, was to work through small gatherings of no more than 10 women to gradually build Conciencia. Spreading the Word ''It is aimed at a multiplying effect,'' she said. ''From one group you get others who hold similar meetings. Those motivated to know more go into a higher course.'' Those who give the courses are called divulgadoras, meaning people who spread the word. The religious connotation was not completely wrong, she said, because ''sometimes you think you are a missionary.'' Since its beginning in August 1980, Conciencia has expanded to include chapters throughout the Argentine provinces and in many suburbs and neighboods of Buenos Aires, rich, poor and middle class. With three membership categories, the group has 311 ''actives,'' who organize and lead conferences and other activities, 8,000 members who receive the literature and are invited to functions and 200 in ''transition'' between the two categories. Conciencia calls itself a nonpartisan civic movement, and Mrs. Martini said the leaders decided at the outset to avoid anything that might make it look like a pressure group. ''We said that the only issues on which we would take direct action would be those involving a better quality of life,'' she said, ''such as community cleanups, health and so forth, things that no one could be against. We do, of course, deal with controversial issues, such as divorce and abortion, but then we organize panels or debates with people pro and con. In those cases, we want people to make up their own minds. What we provide is information.'' Background for Congress Among those who receive the information they have put together on various issues are members of the Argentine Congress. In a country struggling with a $50 billion foreign debt, congressional staffs are too small to provide members with all the background they need to make decisions. Conciencia is trying to undertake both national and local projects, with neighborhood leaders deciding what to do in their own areas. One local project, about to begin in the Buenos Aires suburb of Avellaneda, will take up the work habits and manners of bureaucrats, who are infamous throughout Latin America. Here in Argentina they are the special object of scorn, mocked in plays and movies, for example, for their seeming affinity for work slowdowns, tea breaks, paper shuffling and, above all, indecision. Susana Llado, president of the chapter in Avellaneda, said her group was seeking ''to stop the common bureaucratic practice of 'elevese,' or passing something to the next higher up.'' ''Here,'' she continued, ''it has always been easier to say, 'No se puede hacer' - 'It can't be done' - rather than risk making a decision.'' Officials Are Receptive Perhaps surprisingly, she said, municipal officials have been receptive to Conciencia's proposed training program. Avellaneda is a middle-class suburb of more than 300,000 people but it is an industrial town with an identity separate from that of Buenos Aires. In the 19th century, before refrigerated ships, it flourished as a center for plants where meat was salted down for export. Later, it became a center for wool processing and other industry, but for the last 25 years it has been gradually losing both jobs and people. The handful of women who organized Conciencia in Avellaneda did not have a solution for industrial decline, but they thought they could make a contribution by helping their neighbors mobilize to do, and demand, things for the community. ''The first thing we set out to do was to understand the municipal government,'' said Alicia Festa, the secretary of the chapter. It was not easy, she said, noting that the government of Avellaneda had such a history of mismanagement that under the previous military-run national Government, the military-named officials in Avellaneda were removed by their colleagues. When the women went to city hall in search of information on how officialdom was organized they were given a stack of computer printouts that they claimed were several feet high. They eventually turned it into an eight-page organizational chart, which is intended primarily as an instruction tool for their course on municipal government and which they describe as ''our pride.'' They knew they had made a breakthrough when they next visited a municipal official and he had a copy of their chart on his desk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overlooked U.S. Votes Against Parochial Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/opinion/l-overlooked-us-votes-against-parochial-aid-601586.html,"To the Editor: Though media coverage of the election was generally rather good, somehow Massachusetts' 70-to-30 landslide defeat of a proposed constitutional amendment to authorize state support of sectarian private schools was overlooked. In the last 19 years, then, tax aid for sectarian private schools has been defeated, usually resoundingly, in 15 separate statewide referendums. The only break in this remarkable chain of referendum victories for church-state separation was the Nov. 4 South Dakota vote in favor of lending textbooks to parochial schools. Massachusetts' overwhelming defeat of parochiaid, when coupled with the defeats of anti-abortion amendments by 58 to 42 in Massachusetts, by an astonishing 65 to 35 in predominantly Catholic Rhode Island, by 54 to 46 in Oregon, and by a slim margin in Arkansas, clearly shows that the American people reject the voucher/ tuition tax credit and anti-abortion planks in the platforms of the Reagan Administration and the Religious Right, new and old.

PRIEST PROTESTS UNIVERSITY ACTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/us/priest-protests-university-action.html,"The Rev. Charles E. Curran, who was disciplined this summer by the Vatican for his views on sexual issues, said today that his name had been removed from class schedules at the Catholic University of America and charged that the omission amounted to an improper suspension. A spokesman for the school said listing Father Curran's usual classes without naming a teacher was simply a matter of ''keeping the options open for everybody.'' Father Curran has not been suspended, but the university's chancellor retains the right to take that action, she said. Father Curran, a Roman Catholic priest, is fighting efforts by church officials to remove him from his theology professorship because of his views, deemed too liberal by the Vatican, on such matters as birth control, abortion, divorce and homosexuality. He said in a telephone interview that he has expected to return from a sabbatical leave to his usual teaching schedule in January while a formal faculty investigation of his case continues. But he said school officials had ''unilaterally removed my name'' from the newly published class schedule for next semester. ''I see this as a de facto suspension kind of thing totally outside the legal process,'' Father Curran said. ''This is an unheard of kind of thing.'' Vatican officials told him this summer that his authorization to teach as a Catholic theologian was being revoked, an action church officials say would make it impossible for him to continue as a professor of moral theology at Catholic University. However, Father Curran contends he is protected by his contract as a tenured professor, and he has also set in motion the faculty investigation process. Anne Smith, the university's director of public affairs, said school officials thought the indefinite scheduling was the ''most prudent'' action in light of uncertainties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ONE MAN, ONE VOTE: DECADES OF COURT DECISIONS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/nyregion/one-man-one-vote-decades-of-court-decisions.html,"''People, not land or trees or pastures vote,'' former Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in 1964 in one of a series of cases that created the principle of one man, one vote. The principle was applied again Wednesday, when a Federal District Court in Brooklyn ruled that the structure of the New York City Board of Estimate was unconstitutional. It was unfair, the court found, that the boroughs, with their widely disparate populations, should have the same representation on the powerful board. The one-man, one-vote concept - refined in numerous court decisions -has been regarded as an important civil liberties issue, aiding blacks generally and people in urban areas and, as populations shifted, assuring representation for those living in the suburbs. Through all its interpretations, the plainly articulated position of Chief Justice Warren about land, trees and pastures still seems incontrovertible. One of 3 Most Important Rulings ''Here is a set of decisions that has been completely accepted, there has been almost no resistence,'' said Henry P. Monaghan, the Thomas M. Macioce Professor of Law at Columbia University. ''One person, one vote is a difficult premise to argue with.'' Professor Monaghan ranked the one-man, one-vote decision with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which mandated school desegregation, and Roe v. Wade in 1973, which legalized abortions, as the three most important civil liberties decisions of the Warren Court. By far, he said, the one-man, one-vote decision has proved the least controversial. Until 1962, the Supreme Court declined to tackle the issue of political representation and population. In Colegrove v. Green in 1946, the court said that the issue was of a ''peculiarly political nature'' and advised that the courts not enter this ''political thicket.'' But in Baker v. Carr in 1962, the Court found that people living in cities in Tennessee had been seriously underrepresented in the state legislature. 'Good-Faith Effort' The one-man, one-vote language was first used in a 1964 case, Wesberry v. Sanders. It extended the principle to Congressional elections. ''As nearly as practicable,'' the Court ruled, ''one man's vote in a Congressional election is to be worth as much as another's.'' Later that year, in Reynolds v. Sims, the Court applied the principle to state legislatures and Chief Justice Warren spoke of land, trees and pastures. In subsequent cases, the Court acknowledged that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve an exact equality for all voters, but required the states to make ''a good-faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality.'' In 1983, the Court ruled that the New Jersey Legislature had not made such an effort and threw out its Congressional district lines. In general, the Court has required more exact standards for Federal districts than for state and local districts, allowing as much as 20 percent deviations from the standard for the states. Court decisions over the last 35 years have certainly brought the country a long way from the situation in Maryland that H. L. Mencken once described. ''The vote of a malarious peasant on the lower Eastern Shore,'' Mencken said, ''counts as much as the votes of 12 Baltimoreans.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEWS ANALYSIS; Cuomo and the Press: Time of Tension,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/22/nyregion/news-analysis-cuomo-and-the-press-time-of-tension.html,"Governor Cuomo's press relations have grown increasingly tense over the last four weeks, according to both journalists and administration officials, as Mr. Cuomo has accused some reporters of intentionally distorting the truth to make him look bad. In angry telephone calls morning and night to reporters and editors, the Governor has called reporters names (''spoiled,'' ''ingrates,'' ''incompetent'') and they, in turn, have accused him of going beyond the bounds of acceptable criticism, with some of them labeling his accusations as insults. Mr. Cuomo's action is born not from a calculated strategy, according to his aides, but from anger over what he sees as inaccurate and unfairly harsh articles during and after his campaign for re-election. His behavior has upset some of his advisers, who fear that, at a time when Mr. Cuomo is considering running for President, it might intensify questions already being raised in national political circles about his temperament and his ability to withstand the sometimes contentious press coverage of a race for the White House. But other advisers and some independent political analysts disagree. 'There Were No Other Issues' David Garth, the political media consultant who talks with the Governor from time to time, argues that Mr. Cuomo's complaints are warranted, that the press, not finding any substantive governmental flaws to write about, seized on the Cuomo campaign strategy, unfairly criticizing it as aloof and heavy-handed. ''I think the papers were tough on him because there were no other issues,'' Mr. Garth said. Some top Cuomo aides think the Governor's actions could, in the end, prove to be a plus. They argue that the only group the public dislikes even more than politicians is journalists. And they believe Mr. Cuomo might be perceived by the public as courageous, following his principles and taking on the press even though conventional political wisdom says it is dangerous to do so. In the past, the Governor has successfully defused other politically sensitive disputes - including a battle with John Cardinal O'Connor over the responsibilities of Roman Catholics in government to oppose abortion - usually by confronting them head on in a speech. And that is is exactly what he plans to do in Manhattan next Tuesday night on the press issue. But whether the strategy will work in the press dispute, which has started off on a lower, name-calling level than the previous ones, remains to be seen. So sensitive is the issue - and so strong are the Governor's emotions about it - that top Cuomo advisers who usually lobby reporters daily, such as Meyer S. Frucher, the head of the Battery Park City Authority, are refusing to comment on it. The Albany press corps is particularly assertive, even some of its members acknowledge, although they argue it is necessary because Mr. Cuomo is sometimes difficult to pin down on specific points. For his part, the Governor - a former trial lawyer, who admits that his style can be combative - tends to argue with reporters, not simply answer their questions. But the relationship began to worsen this summer, according to Cuomo aides, after articles, columns and editorials were critical of Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son and his top adviser. The articles, which the Governor thought were unfair, questioned whether Andrew Cuomo's law firm was profiting indirectly - and inappropriately - because his father was Governor. ''When you talk to Cuomo about family in a negative light, he acts irrationally,'' Jeannie Cross, who covers the Governor for The Albany-Times Union, said this week on the ''Inside Albany'' television program, broadcast statewide. Filling a Political Void Although the Governor's re-election was endorsed by virtually all the state's major newspapers, many of the same editorials raised questions about his personality, accusing him of being aloof and of not dealing fairly with his Republican opponent, Andrew P. O'Rourke, by debating him only once. He was also criticized for mobilizing his aides to knock Abraham Hirschfeld off the Democratic primary ballot for lieutenant governor. In addition, some reporters acknowledge that, during the campaign, they were particularly aggressive with the Governor, trying to fill the void left by a lethargic O'Rourke campaign and force an airing of the issues. All that came as Mr. Cuomo was headed toward a record-breaking landslide victory. Aides said the Governor became convinced that the press was out of synch with the way the state as a whole viewed him. Although he had often had run-ins with individual reporters, he now began to criticize half a dozen journalists at a time, sometimes bitterly, even accusing some of them of conspiring against him. When reporters resented it, he called them ''thin-skinned'' and said the press could not take criticism. 'You Set Out to Hurt Me' Reporters argue that it is not the criticism, it is the way the Governor criticizes that is inappropriate. They say they resent his angry phone calls and his allegations that they would intentionally distort the truth. They say that if errors have been made - and not all journalists agree they have -they were honest mistakes. In the last four weeks, Mr. Cuomo has accused reporters of The New York Times, The Daily News and The New York Post of collusion against him on particular issues - a ''cabal,'' Daily News reporters quoted him as calling it. The Governor said an editor of The Daily News - later identified as Arthur Browne, the city editor - had ''set me up'' by printing comments that Mr. Cuomo thought had been made in private conversation. ''They'll never get another call from me,'' the Governor was quoted by The Associated Press as having said of The News. ''They can call me from a burning building and say, 'You're the captain of the Fire Department,' and they'll have to learn how to fly.'' One evening last week, Mr. Cuomo called a New York Times reporter at home, saying about an article: ''You set out to hurt me and you succeeded. I hope you sleep well.'' The next morning, the 54-year-old Governor called back to apologize, asking forgiveness for ''an old man with a bad back.'' 'You Made Me Look Bad' The comment was apparently made in jest; Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly denied speculation that he was irritable because of chronic back pain, which doctors said yesterday was caused by a pinched nerve. In a meeting two weeks ago with reporters and editors of Rochester newspapers, at which he was criticized for making himself ''look bad'' by the conduct of his campaign, Mr. Cuomo said: ''Let's get it clear - I didn't make me look bad. You made me look bad.'' His Rochester comments were widely reported as being aimed at reporters for other papers as well, which the Governor later said was not his intention. He also rejected the assessment that he was saying some reporters were biased against him. Last month, the Governor's press secretary, Martin J. Steadman, wrote to the editor of The Albany Times-Union and The Kickerbocker News, accusing the papers of ''a campaign to punish the Governor'' because he had refused an invitation to debate there during the gubernatorial race. Reducing Reporters' Access Of the Gannett newspaper chain, Mr. Cuomo told a group of reporters, ''Gannett is killing me.'' And in a speech last week to newspaper executives in Manhattan, he defended press freedoms, but added that if news organizations did not curb their abuses, ''the Supreme Court will get you in the end.'' Mr. Cuomo threatened to reduce reporters' access to him by directing them to his aides. In the process, he appeared to criticize those aides, saying, ''It's about time the press office did some work.'' The Governor has directed his criticism of reporters almost exclusively to those at newspapers. Radio and television reporters tend to press him less on the issues and their reports tend to be made up primarily of the Governor himself speaking. In his television comments on the press dispute, Mr. Cuomo has avoided the strident, angry tone he used privately with print reporters. Top administration officials said yesterday that they thought the Governor's comments were merely ''blips'' in what they described as, overall, a ''favorable'' relationship with the press. They stressed that they wanted normal relations to resume, adding that they were aware what is now a story about press relations had the potential to evolve into a story about personality. ''It feeds the impression of this prickly sensibility that keeps revealing itself,'' said William Marshall, policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council, a Washington-based organization of elected officials, most of them moderate Southern and Western Democrats. Echoing comments made by other national Democratic political strategists, Mr. Marshall added, ''It reflects what is in the back of people's minds: Is he too thin-skinned?''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AUSTRALIA SAYS IT HAS SEIZED MAN WHO SOUGHT TO KILL POPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/25/world/australia-says-it-has-seized-man-who-sought-to-kill-pope.html,"A man carrying five firebombs was arrested today several hours before Pope John Paul II's arrival here and said later that he intended to assassinate the Pope, the police said. The 24-year-old man from Sydney was recently released from a mental institution, the police said. He was not identified because charges had not been filed. The police said they spotted the man acting suspiciously during a routine security check of City Hall this morning, seven hours before the Pope was due to arrive there to bless Brisbane. The man was holding a cardboard box that contained five bottles filled with gasoline and fitted with cloth wicks, said the assistant police commissioner of Brisbane, Ron Redmond. Under questioning, the man said that he wanted to kill the Pope because ''the Pope has too much money'' and that he had been ''looking for an elevated position from which he could throw the gasoline bombs at the Pope,'' Mr. Redmond said. The arrest occurred on the first full day of the Pope's six-and-a-half-day tour of Australia. So far, the Pope's message has been one of praise mixed with a bit of prodding. Welcoming the Pope on Monday at an air base outside Canberra, Prime Minister Bob Hawke described his trip as a ''great expedition.'' The Pope, who arrived from New Zealand, was greeted by an honor guard at attention and a 21-gun salute. A group of schoolgirls chanted ''John Paul II, we love you!'' as if they were cheering their favorite rugby team. Of Australia's 15.6 million people, 26 percent are Roman Catholics. ''Dear people of Australia,'' the Pope told the crowd, ''I have come here to your land to bear witness also to the greatness of your nation and to your immense capacity for good.'' But John Paul also laid down a challenge, saying, ''From this land of yours, so blessed by God, you must lift up your eyes and see again and again the need of people everywhere.'' Like the United States, Australia is a nation of immigrants that is trying to determine just how open to leave its doors. Until recently, the doors have been very open, but now the more than 100,000 refugees from Indochina outnumber the aboriginal people. John Paul's gentle approach to Australia's troubles was evident when he dealt with the immigration issue in an address to political leaders in Parliament on Monday night in Canberra. Australia's ''openness to the needs of others has been, is and always will be worthy of high commendation,'' he said. And later the Pope added: ''I take the liberty of asking you, who have received so much from God, something more than a generous response to the crises that afflict other people.'' Thoughts on Church's Role The Pope's speech in Parliament also included thoughts on the church's role in a democratic society. The abortion issue in particular has generated a debate in Australia over the role the church's moral teaching should play in guiding decisions by Roman Catholic politicians and voters. The Pope said Catholics ''wish to make use of the opportunity'' offered by a democratic society in order ''to proclaim insistently those values which are bound up with the dignity and life of every human being.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/26/books/books-of-the-times-626186.html,"BACKSTORY. Interviews With Screenwriters of Hollywood's Golden Age. By Pat McGilligan. Illustrated. 382 pages. University of California. $27.50. IN the days of silent pictures, screenwriters did not exist; instead, an assorted gaggle of gag-writers, continuity writers, adaptors and titlists helped get pictures on the screen. It was only after the introduction of sound in 1926 that Hollywood began importing ''talk experts'' from the East, and in the late 20's, writers of every sort - novelists, playwrights, journalists, poets, copywriters and press agents -began making their way out west. Though the pay frequently was excellent, they found they held little clout in a community dominated by stars, directors and producers. ''Scenarists were banished from the sets of the movies they had written,'' writes Pat McGilligan in the introduction to his book. ''Impersonal or hackneyed genre assignments were doled out as a form of punishment. Unbeknownst to one another, writers worked on multiple or alternative versions of the same script. Credits were withheld out of pique, jealousy, or bizarre ulterior motives. Credits were summarily awarded to in-laws or mistresses. Marathon working hours were requisite. Writers punched in on a time clock at some studios, as if they were assembling gizmos on a conveyor belt.'' Certainly many writers - including the likes of Faulkner and Fitzgerald - couldn't stand the constraints, and they left (or died), disillusioned and disgusted. Others, however, managed to turn screenwriting into a substantial career - sometimes taking pleasure in the work itself, sometimes using it to finance other projects. And it's their story that Pat McGilligan proposes to tell in this volume. Included are interviews with Charles Bennett, who wrote or co-wrote seven early Hitchcock films (including ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' ''The Thirty-Nine Steps,'' ''The Secret Agent'' and ''Sabotage''); the novelist W. R. Burnett (''Little Caesar,'' ''High Sierra,'' ''Yellow Sky,'' ''The Asphalt Jungle''); Philip Dunne, who adapted such works as ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' and ''How Green Was My Valley,'' and Norman Krasna, who worked on ''Hands Across the Table'' and ''Bachelor Mother.'' According to the author, ''Backstory'' ''is not meant to be a scholarly or historical work, a purely factual study, or even a complete representation of the profession,'' and the volume reads like an eclectic, almost random collection of interviews determined largely by the availability of the subjects. Such well-known writers as Nunnally Johnson, Billy Wilder and Joseph Mankiewicz are missing, as are less famous but equally respected figures like Ernest Lehman, Charles Lederer and Howard Koch. But while little effort seems to have been made to determine the veracity of various stories - two thoroughly irreconcilable versions of the writing of ''Casablanca'' appear - ''Backstory'' stands as a lively oral history, both charming and informal. One of the things that strikes the reader is just how productive writers employed in the studio factories used to be. The husband-and-wife team Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett recall finishing ''The Thin Man'' in three weeks (it was then reportedly shot in 12 days), and Julius J. Epstein - who collaborated with his brother Philip on such adaptations as ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' and ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' - remembers having at least three pictures made a year by Warner Brothers. And that, he adds, didn't even count ''the pictures that weren't made. They used to go on the principle of three scripts written for every one that was made.'' Although there are discussions of writing technique in this volume, these passages are not nearly as focused or detailed as those in John Brady's recent book ''The Craft of the Screenwriter.'' What the writers here do talk about is circumventing the censors - in ''Ten North Frederick,'' an abortion is turned into a miscarriage; in ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' Cary Grant's line ''Darling, I'm a bastard!'' becomes ''Darling, I'm the son of a sea-cook!'' - and tailoring scripts to suit certain stars. ''The difference was entirely in the dialogue,'' says Lenore Coffee, explaining how she would alter a story for Joan Crawford or Bette Davis. ''Bette spits out her words, Joan doesn't. I gave Bette short sentences, short speeches.'' Charles Bennett recalls having to simplify conversations for Gary Cooper, and Niven Busch speaks of having to tailor lines to James Cagney's specifications -translating his ''obscene dialogue'' into ''some kind of passable English.'' In listening to these writers reminisce about the paths that brought them to Hollywood - and the adventures they had there - we also become privy to a lot of amusing stories. We hear how Philip Dunne wrote the screenplay to ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' without even reading the novel, and how he worked up a script for ''Demetrius and the Gladiators'' from sets, costumes and characters left over from ''The Robe.'' We hear how Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett developed the idea for ''It's a Wonderful Life'' from a Christmas card. And we hear Richard Maibaum explain a lesson he learned from Alfred Hitchcock. As he recalls it, Hitchcock told him, ''If I have 13 bumps in a picture, I think I've got a picture.'' ''A bump,'' he explains, ''is something like someone says, 'I'm looking for a man who has a short index finger,' and a totally unexpected guy says 'You mean like this?' That's in 'The 39 Steps.' '' After writing ''Dr. No'' in 1963, Mr. Maibaum, who went on to write 10 more James Bond pictures, decided to use Hitchcock's observation as a rule of thumb - except, he adds, he decided he wasn't ''going to be satisfied with 13 bumps in a Bond story''; he wanted 39. In themselves, such anecdotes may seem trivial, but as stitched together by Mr. McGilligan, they provide a montage-like picture of Hollywood under the studio system, as well as an intimate glimpse of the anomalous craft of screenwriting - its frustrations and intermittent pleasures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KEAN AIDE TO PRESS FOR CLINICS IN SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/nyregion/kean-aide-to-press-for-clinics-in-schools.html,"BECAUSE the state should help troubled adolescents cut through the social services bureaucracy by offering health care in high schools, says the Commissioner of Human Services, school-based clinics will be a priority for his administration. ''Our fragmented, scattered, very narrow categorical programs, with a different agency for every problem, have not done a good job of reaching troubled teen-agers,'' said the Commissioner, Dr. Drew Altman, in a recent interview in his office here. ''Schools represent the place where you can reach the majority of teen-agers, but not all of them. So the strategy is one of supporting community-based organizations and asking the schools to provide space and become part of the program.'' According to Dr. Altman, services offered by health-care clinics outside New Jersey depend on community needs and include drug and alcohol counseling, family planning, day care, psychological, academic and vocational counseling and job placement. Typically, such clinics - there are none in New Jersey - provide referrals, with parental consent, to health and social-service agencies for pregnancy testing and contraception. More than 60 high schools around the country have clinics that provide comprehensive health care and at least 10 dispense contraceptives, according to the Center for Population Options in Washington, a group that seeks to prevent unwanted pregnancies among teen-agers. (In New York City, nine high school clinics provide abortion counseling and birth-control information and, until October, two distributed contraceptives.) A bill introduced Oct. 27 by Assemblyman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, Republican of the 25th District (part of Morris County), would allocate $2 million for a minimum of six clinics to help adolescents and those who have dropped out of school. Most of the clinics would be in urban areas, in or near schools, according to Mr. Frelinghuysen. Dr. Saul Cooperman, the state's Commissioner of Education, said it would be ''premature'' to comment on Assemblyman Frelinghuysen's proposal. He and Dr. Altman are expected to discuss the clinics in coming weeks, according to state education officials. Dr. Altman said he could not expect his plan to succeed without the cooperation of the Commissioners of Education and Health. And, he added, community support for any school-based clinic is vital. Whether the clinics would be allowed to dispense contraceptives would be a decision left to the local school district, Dr. Altman said. Last summer, Senator Frank J. Pallone Jr., Democrat of the 11th District (part of Monmouth County), introduced a bill to block schools from dispensing contraceptives, conducting prenatal testing or testing for pregnancy. The bill is still in committee. ''Before we move the bill, we'd have to mount a major lobbying effort,'' Senator Pallone said, adding that he would welcome a hearing on the legislation, which is strongly supported by the New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents, a Monmouth County group that in the early 1980's mounted an unsuccessful campaign against mandatory sex education. Dr. Altman insists that, in his effort to set up the program, he will not be ''held hostage by teen-age pregnancy.'' Yet, judging from the hesitation on the part of Department of Education officials and the controversy generated by clinics in New York City recently, the issue could also delay plans in New Jersey. New York City's Board of Education has banned the distribution of contraceptives in its schools, but has allowed the nine school clinics to operate for six months while the issue is debated. ''We're at a very early stage,'' Dr. Altman said, ''I've been here for five months, and there's no commitment to this.'' Before taking the cabinet post, Dr. Altman, 35 years old, was a vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which has committed itself to move ahead on a national scale and finance 20 school-based health-care clinics in the next six years. The cost of an average clinic in a large urban high school staffed by a nurse-practitioner, social worker, secretary and part-time physicians is about $100,000 a year, according to Dr. Philip Porter, co-director of the Adolescent Health Care Program at the Johnson Foundation. Most clinics in other states do not dispense contraceptives, Dr. Porter said, although some have done so. Dr. Porter, a pediatrician on the faculty of Harvard Medical School, called the clinics ''a very effective way of meeting the needs of adolescents who don't have a home.'' He singled out clinics in St. Paul, Minn., and Cambridge, Mass., as examples. States that have supported the clinics include Florida, North Carolina, Washington and Oregon, Dr. Porter said. The school-based approach attempts to circumvent the stigma that adolescents feel is associated with a birth-control clinic, a drug crisis center or a mental-health facility. ''We have a lot of trouble getting adolescents to go to a clinic,'' said Jane Mattingly, director of special services for the Board of Education in Elizabeth. ''They don't feel they have the financial resources or their parents don't follow through. Also, there's the fear, because hospitals and emergency rooms can be frightening places.'' Health-care professionals concede that the bureaucracy and paper work in some agencies can be a formidable obstacle, especially for a self-conscious or troubled adolescent. ''Teen-agers are notoriously reluctant to seek social services, even when there's a crisis or an emergency,'' said Ann M. Wilson, coordinator of the New Jersey Network on Adolescent Pregnancy and a professor at the Rutgers University School of Social Work, where the network is based. While she has described the school-based approach as ''preventive,'' others contend that education about birth control encourages sexual activity. The United States Secretary of Education, William J. Bennett, has argued that birth-control clinics encourage sexual promiscuity among teen-agers. According to ''No Easy Answers,'' a study on adolescent pregnancy released last month by Rutgers University-New Jersey Network, about 30,000 adolescents in New Jersey were expected to become pregnant this year. About a third of them -most likely the impoverished - are expected to carry their babies to term. In 1984, 6,682 students under 18, with some as young as 10, gave birth, according to the report. The study recommended school-based clinics as one means of providing students with information for making responsible choices and for receiving health care that their families could not ordinarily afford. A handful of school districts in New Jersey has expressed interest in school-based clinics. Jersey City's schools have invited speakers from New York to talk about their programs. In Elizabeth, Rocco J. Colelli, the Superintendent of Schools, had some reservations, but did not rule out the possibility of welcoming such a clinic. In Perth Amboy, Frank Sinatra, the Superintendent of Schools, said he proposed a community school with a clinic, but referendums on that matter were defeated in 1979 and 1980. Perhaps the district with the most resources to develop school-based health care is New Brunswick, world headquarters of Johnson & Johnson. Elementary and secondary schools in New Brunswick have enjoyed a partnership with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School as part of a four-year grant of $339,075 from the Johnson Foundation. The medical school has provided staff for school-based care, in addition to planning a community health clinic on school property. The new program is to be housed in six trailers scheduled to open in January. Plans include facilities for pediatric, obstetric and dental services, a mental-health facility and offices for a federally financed nutrition program for pregnant women. With parental consent, reproductive matters will be handled through referrals to community agencies. The subject of contraceptives has come up, said Ron Larkin, the New Brunswick Superintendent of Schools, ''but we're not ready to deal with that one yet because of the hysteria that goes with it.'' Some educators and health-care professionals advocate a comprehensive approach to health care for adolescents because, they say, troubled teen-agers are likely to experience a wide spectrum of social and psychological problems. ''If a youngster does have a problem with alcohol, drug abuse or pregnancy,'' Mr. Larkin said, ''the family probably does have other problems. ''It's like a onion. Once you start peeling off the layers, other problems on a secondary and tertiary level become apparent.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A NEW YORKER UP FOR SAINTHOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/magazine/a-new-yorker-up-for-sainthood.html,"FOR MORE THAN TWO years now, the letters have been trickling in at a rate of 15 to 20 a week. They report in touching detail about jobs found, problems solved, illnesses overcome. A few correspondents relate stories of extraordinary cures. A retired New York City policeman whose son's eyes were severely damaged in a hockey accident writes that the boy's sight is now almost perfectly restored; one of the boy's doctors called it ''unexplainable.'' Another man reports that, although his grandson had battled ''terminal'' leukemia for eight years and doctors at one point had given the boy only a few days to live, he is now living the life of a normal teen-ager. A woman dying of cancer of the intestines, lymph nodes and liver writes that radiation, chemotherapy and four operations had failed to halt the disease, and then, suddenly, a CAT scan, liver scan and sonogram all proved negative. ''I felt this was miraculous,'' she declared. Like all the other correspondents, some 2,000 of them, she attributes her success to her prayers and the intercession of Terence Cardinal Cooke, the former Archbishop of New York, who died of cancer in 1983. ''The cases are piling up,'' says the Rev. Benedict J. Groeschel, a broad-shouldered, bearded Catholic priest who is also a Capuchin friar. ''But it's up to the people. We are simply waiting.'' Waiting for a miracle - for at least three miracles, to be precise. The friar, who wears the coarse woolen habit and sandals of a medieval mendicant monk, is only one of the late Cardinal's many friends in the church who believe the man they call Terry Cooke might be a saint. After Cooke's death, these friends began to urge the archdiocese to initiate formal proceedings to give them the opportunity to prove it. As a result, Cooke's successor, John Cardinal O'Connor, appointed Father Groeschel in August 1984, to be ''postulator and promoter of the cause of canonization of Terence Cardinal Cooke.'' Father Groeschel then quickly asked another friend of Cooke's, Sister M. Aloysius McBride, a Carmelite nun and retired head of one of the archdiocese's largest nursing homes, to help him set up a Cardinal Cooke Guild to promote the Cardinal's canonization, to pray for his help in people's lives and receive evidence of the effect he has had - from beyond the grave - on the living. So far, about 10,000 other admirers of the late Archbishop have contributed their support and money to the guild. These are the first steps in the complex and rigorous process whereby the Pope ultimately decides if a man or woman is worthy of the veneration of the members of the Roman Catholic Church. (Some other Americans under consideration are described in the box on page 70.) The final verdict on Terence Cooke's sanctity will probably take at least 50 years; some verdicts have taken 600 years. In the meantime, his supporters will have to prove that the Cardinal was a person of ''heroic'' virtue. They will also have to show that this has been confirmed by a series of miracles, proof that God, too, accepts the late Cardinal as a truly holy and perfect Christian. That a man so recently alive and at work in New York City may be responsible for miracles seems incredible to some, even to many Catholics. Saints are legends of simpler times, almost unthinkable in ours. Besides, does the Catholic church, in the late 20th century, with some 5,000 saints already in its canon, really need another? Cynics and critics are inclined to see the cause for Cardinal Cooke as an effort by the church to give itself a little boost in the media capital of the world. Even the hardest-boiled among them might be willing to grant saintly perfection to a remarkable woman like Mother Teresa of Calcutta, whose devotion to the dying and leprous of India won her the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1979. But Cardinal Cooke, a tall, round-faced prelate with rimless glasses and buckteeth? An administrator adept at crunching numbers? Could such a shy maestro of the chancery really be a saint? Or is the Cooke cause a bit of deft archdiocesan public relations to set up a man of God as a celebrity role model in an age when the public seems more attracted to the lives of the stars of ''Dynasty'' and ''Dallas'' than to the lives of the saints? ''P.R.?'' asks Father Groeschel, as he lets loose a giggle of contempt. ''Of course it's P.R. That's what canonization has always been about. It's a human-interest story. Someone can be the holiest man in the world, but without human interest he's not a canonizable saint.'' T IS TRUE THAT, THROUGH THE centuries, one of the Roman Catholic Church's most effective methods for getting its message to its people has been through the inspirational life stories of the saints, the best and most visible exemplars of its teachings. But now, at a time when the church seems to many to resemble a multinational corporation, when its liberal and conservative thinkers clash on such contemporary issues as divorce, contraception, abortion and homosexuality, talk of sanctity seems like a throwback. It is a reminder of the church's ancient roots, the mysteries of religion that have, from the beginning, been the attraction for converts - ''Credo quia impossibile est,'' as the early Christian thinker Tertullian phrased his famous paradox. ''I believe because it is impossible.'' DURING HIS 38 YEARS AS A PRIEST, TER-ence Cooke seemed an unlikely candidate for sainthood. The son of an Irish immigrant who worked as a chauffeur and in the construction trades, the Cardinal always claimed he had ''never wanted to be anything but a simple priest.'' According to family members, he set out to become one while he was still in elementary school in the Bronx. Cooke was ordained in 1945, served briefly in a Bronx parish, took leave to earn a master's degree in social work and returned to the archdiocese intending to pursue a career of working with children. Instead, the humble priest with no political ambitions was soon boosted onto the fast track by Francis Cardinal Spellman, the legendary Archbishop of New York whose own power, and taste for it, had earned him the nickname ''the American pope.'' Cardinal Spellman was always on the lookout for clever young administrators among his priests, and in young Father Cooke he had hit upon a tireless manager with a phenomenal memory for figures, one who soon became, as some said, (Continued on Page 68) ''a cash register whose keys the Cardinal pushed.'' After a stint as a middle-level administrator at the archdiocese's seminary, Father Cooke was appointed in 1957 to the prestigious and influential post of personal secretary to Cardinal Spellman. Within months, Father Cooke had become Monsignor Cooke, and was regularly promoted through a series of chancery positions until, in 1965, he became vicar general, the No. 2 post in the archdiocese. ''Spellman depended on him, and so he had an awful lot to do with the day-to-day running of the archdiocese, the financial operations, the real-estate dealings,'' recalls Bishop Patrick V. Ahern, now the vicar of Staten Island, who became a close friend of Terence Cooke's after succeeding him as the Cardinal's secretary. When Cardinal Spellman died in 1968 and the self-effacing Bishop Cooke had become, at 47, the surprise leader of the most visible archiocese in the Catholic church, liberal priests grumbled that the appointment was Cardinal Spellman's last act of cronyism. The new Archbishop had got the big job, as one of Terence Cooke's detractors put it, because ''he poured Spelly's Post Toasties every morning.'' Seminarians joked that the succession was ''the first soul transplant on record.'' It was the 1960's; the clergy wanted more democracy. Many opposed the Vietnam War, which Cardinal Spellman had publicly supported. After three decades of an autocratic archbishop who seemed to take the honor of ''prince of the church'' too literally, younger priests in the diocese viewed their new boss as the product of a ''discredited system.'' But the new Archbishop, who received his cardinal's red hat a year after his appointment, quickly proved he was not his mentor's clone by soliciting opinions from his staff on every issue. And, in time, he solved the toughest problems. While bitter liberal-conservative disputes broke out in Philadelphia, St. Louis and Chicago over how to implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Cardinal Cooke kept tempers in New York cool by proving himself - friends and subor-dinates all echo the description - a ''master conciliator.'' Bishops were shutting down schools and parishes in the inner cities all around the country. But in New York, by establishing ''interparish financial cooperation,'' the Cardinal forced the rich parishes to contribute to the survival of the struggling ones. ''He was a superior administrator and manager,'' says Howard A. Seitz, a retired senior partner in the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, who headed the Cardinal's task force on care of the elderly. ''But I never knew him to resolve an issue in terms of the bottom line when there were other apparent or obvious human and charitable conditions to be met.'' Still, Cardinal Cooke was not perceived as a great leader. His fellow bishops around the country carped about his reticence. ''He was the perfect number two man,'' says Msgr. Florence Cohalan, a historian of the archdiocese. ''He was best at carrying out others' decisions, and, apart from his ultimate rank, he probably reached his peak as vicar general.'' Then the Cardinal began to die, and opinions changed. The story first broke in August 1983, when the archdiocese announced that the Cardinal was being treated for a ''urinary infection'' and would have to curtail his normal activities. A week later, another press release reported his doctor's discovery that Cardinal Cooke had ''acute leukemia.'' The prognosis was ''terminal.'' Finally, the full story was told: the Archbishop's cancer had first been diagnosed almost 20 years before, before he succeeded Cardinal Spellman. The ''lymphoma'' had gone into remission until 1974, and, since then, he had been working at full tilt in spite of secret chemotherapy treatments and blood transfusions for leukemia. The Cardinal had kept his condition secret from even his closest friends. His doctors treated him clandestinely at home. During his last year, Cardinal Cooke attended 200 meetings, even though, for a time, he was working, as his friends were shocked to learn later, with a painful open wound on his back, the result of the chemotherapy. In his final meeting with Cardinal Cooke, Bishop Ahern expressed amazement at how the Archbishop had managed to maintain that pace. ''I never even saw you yawn,'' he recalls saying to Cardinal Cooke, and then asked if he had been in pain and exhausted. ''Always,'' he answered. ''How did you manage?'' asked Bishop Ahern. ''God did it,'' said Cardinal Cooke, simply and quietly, as he lay motionless in the Archbishop's residence. ''I had to keep going. If my illness had been divulged, I would have become a lame-duck archbishop and no one would have paid attention.'' ''It was as if he turned the page, and said what has gone up to now is over,'' recalls Msgr. Edward F. O'Brien, rector of St. Joseph's Seminary, who, as secretary to Cardinal Cooke, was one of the few outside the medical team to know how ill he was. With the same concentration that had marked his career, Cardinal Cooke focused on dying and its meaning. In a letter to Pope John Paul II, he assured the Pontiff that he accepted his illness in the spirit of the motto he had chosen as Archbishop - Fiat Voluntas Tua. ''Let Thy will be done.'' He wrote a letter to President Reagan, asking for continued economic assistance to the poor of the third world. He wrote another letter to Irish-Americans, urging them to work for peace in Northern Ireland. On his deathbed, the Cardinal wrote to his fellow bishops that his illness ''is an opportunity of grace.'' In another letter read from pulpits throughout the archdiocese, the Cardinal reflected on how illness, old age, poverty, hunger, physical handicaps and loneliness actually give one ''a special grace'' to appreciate ''the gift of life'' even more. After the Cardinal's death, on Oct. 6, 1983, thousands of people waited in line outside St. Patrick's Cathedral all day, in eerie silence, to pay their respects to, as several told reporters at the time, ''a good man.'' Cardinal Cooke's friend of 30 years, Sister M. Aloysius McBride, remarked at the funeral service to another friend of the Cardinal's that if this were the early church, the huge crowd at St. Patrick's would have acclaimed Terence Cooke ''a saint on the spot.'' But it is the 1980's, a skeptical age, and the leading skeptic in the face of the efforts to promote the canonization of Cardinal Cooke is likely to be the Vatican itself. ''The church's skepticism is in its own self-interest,'' explains Father Groeschel. ''The process is best seen as an adversarial procedure. In the eyes of the Vatican, you are guilty until proven saintly.'' Over the last 800 years, the church has established a long list of regulations and requirements for canonization, revising and toughening them periodically. The church's first heroes were simply acclaimed saints by the community. But by the 12th century, the Vatican had taken over the process to avoid the embarrassment of an increasing number of people who had, by fraud, gained a reputation for sanctity. Traditionally, a person whose Christian virtue had been confirmed by at least two miracles, was first ''beatified'' - presented by the Vatican as an example for all to imitate. After that, proof of additional miracles was required for final canonization. The latest revision in the guidelines, published in 1983, hints that the stage of beatification may eventually be omitted. But the new regulations impose stricter standards for reviewing medical miracles, requiring, if possible, the patient and his doctors to testify in person on the details of the alleged cures. A ND DO YOU, FA-ther, think he was a saint?'' Benedict Groeschel was slightly taken aback by the question. To find out more about the requirements of his new job as promoter of the cause of Cardinal Cooke, the Capuchin friar had traveled to Rome in 1984. At the Vatican, he conferred with a monsignor who has performed the role of the church's official skeptic, traditionally known as the ''devil's advocate.'' ''He was Cecil B. De Mille's idea of the devil's advocate,'' recalls Father Groeschel. ''Stern, bald, the heavy Germanic accent. Scared me to death.'' Father Groeschel informed the monsignor that he had known the Cardinal very well, and that in his opinion the Archbishop ''could be a saint.'' ''Good, because if you don't think he's a saint, you endanger your immortal soul by taking on this job,'' replied the monsignor. ''But if you're convinced he's a saint, you've taken away my job.'' The Vatican's man advised the American priest to ''show caution and care and let things follow the way of God.'' Father Groeschel is so far outside most non-Catholics' image of the modern Catholic priest that he is best described by what he is not. He is not, above all, a ''gent.'' Among New York City's Catholic clergy, the gent is the Hollywood version of the priest - smooth, urbane, streetwise and definitely good looking enough to impress the ladies of the parish and the young ones in Sunday school. The gent is Pat O'Brien in ''Angels With Dirty Faces'' or Bing Crosby in ''Going My Way.'' Although Father Groeschel moves in the world of the gents, he tramps up First Avenue in sandals, his friar's robes fluttering in the wind. It is not unusual for him to be found in the middle of the night bailing someone out of the drunk tank. He grew up in an Irish-Jewish neighborhood in Jersey City and joined the Capuchins, a branch of the Franciscans dedicated to working with the poor, in 1951. He has somehow found the time to earn a doctorate in psychology from Columbia, teach, do radio and television, and write six books, including ''The Courage to Be Chaste,'' published last year. In 1973, Cardinal Cooke asked him to head the archdiocese's new Office for Spiritual Development at Trinity Retreat House, in Larchmont, N.Y., where priests go to focus on the spiritual side of their vocations. There, his office floor is filled with cartons of Cooke memorabilia. More boxes occupy the Cardinal Cooke Archives at St. Joseph's Seminary in nearby Yonkers, where Father Groeschel is assisted by the cause's own archivist, the Rev. Terrence L. Weber, the assistant pastor of a Lutheran church on the North Shore of Long Island who admired the Cardinal and volunteered to help out. To confirm the integrity of a candidate's faith, the promoter must collect all his writings, even letters from childhood. ''If he has written anything contrary to the Catholic faith,'' Father Groeschel explains, ''the cause is immediately suspended.'' Father Groeschel's most interesting task will be researching and writing Cardinal Cooke's ''spiritual biography,'' a major part of the brief for canonization. ''This will be no traditional hagiography,'' insists Father Groeschel. ''It is supposed to be honest and critical. In fact, if there are no chinks in the armor, the Vatican is likely to suspect the cause.'' For the last two years, he and Pastor Weber have been interviewing Cardinal Cooke's family and friends, his schoolteachers, even the cop on the St. Patrick's beat during the Cardinal's last years. The two are trying to assemble all the data on a new personal computer. Already, the kinds of uncanny circumstances and prophetic remarks that are the hallmarks of the lives of the saints are turning up about Cardinal Cooke. Following an emotional visit with the Cardinal in the hospital in 1965, shortly after he had learned he had cancer, Bishop Ahern informed Terence Cooke's closest friend from his seminary days, Father Vincent Kenney, that chances were good they were going to lose their best friend. ''So help me God,'' says Bishop Ahern, ''this is what he said to me: 'Terry Cooke is not going to die. The reason is he is a saint, and God has some special work for him to do. I'm going to die before him.' '' Cardinal Cooke returned to work and was named a bishop that fall. Within a year, Father Kenney died. Then there is the matter of those miracles. ''I've seen a few impressive cases so far,'' says Father Groeschel, who is quick to add that this does not mean they are miracles and that, besides, it is not his job to say so. His correspondents, however, are certain that the Cardinal has interceded on their behalf. One woman prayed to Cooke to settle a long and bitter dispute within her family. When tensions eased, she called it a miracle. ''If it isn't good enough for the Pope, it's good enough for me,'' she wrote. The most dramatic, and most promising, case so far is that of a 14-year-old boy who has battled ''fourth-stage lymphoma/leukemia'' for eight years. After neither radiation nor chemotheraphy had succeeded in halting the cancer, doctors tried a bone-marrow transplant, a recent medical ''miracle'' that provides a new immune system. Periodic examinations turned up healthy cells with no sign of leukemia. The boy seemed cured. But two years later, doctors were shocked to find new leukemia cells, a rarity. ''This time there was no new medical miracle to fall back on,'' recalls the boy's grandfather, who cares for him. Worse, the radiation and chemotherapy that had given him temporary relief before now damaged his liver, heart and bladder. ''A friend told us about the Cardinal Cooke Guild,'' says the grandfather. ''Soon, guild members were turning up at the hospital to pray and visit.'' The doctors soon informed the family that the boy had only a few days to live. Last rites were administered, and the family decided to bring the boy home to die. The guild did not give up. An old friend of Cardinal Cooke visited the boy's sickbed and placed the Cardinal's zucchetto, the traditional red skullcap of a prince of the church, on the boy's stomach; another turned up with Cardinal Cooke's episcopal cross. Within days, the boy began to improve - ''gradually,'' says his grandfather. A few weeks later, the teen-ager walked into the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for a checkup - to the amazement of his doctors, who concluded that the cancer was apparently, and inexplicably, in remission. A year and a half later, he is doing fine. ''I'm not sure what happened, though my wife is absolutely certain his life was saved by the intercession of the Cardinal,'' says the boy's grandfather. ''And as time goes on, I must admit that I'm inclined to agree.'' For Father Groeschel, it is part of ''a beginning,'' the end of which, he points out with some relief, ''is likely to come long after my own death.'' Even if the effort to canonize Cardinal Cooke ultimately fails, Father Groeschel believes it will have succeeded. ''We live in a world not only of unbelief, but of disedification,'' he explains. ''We are surrounded by scandal and bad example. These efforts on behalf of the Cardinal might bring hope to some people in an otherwise ugly world.'' Father Groeschel also points out that modern medical advances will assure that an increasing number of us will die the kind of lingering death from cancer that Cardinal Cooke suffered. ''His example is an inspiring one,'' says the friar. Saints, by the Vatican's definition, are persons of ''heroic virtue.'' If, in our time and place, astronauts, rock stars or 20-year-olds blessed with the ability to throw a baseball 95 m.p.h. qualify for heroic stature, why not the inspiring example of a virtuous life and death? The American church has been modest about its successes; although there are 52 million Catholics in the United States, only three saints have been United States citizens: John N. Neumann, a 19th-century bishop of Philadelphia; Elizabeth Ann Seton, a socialite who became a nun, founded the American Sisters of Charity in 1809 and initiated the nation's parochial school system; and Frances Xavier Cabrini, the patron saint of the nation's immigrants, with whom she worked at the turn of the century. Terence Cardinal Cooke can be seen as the icon of a later stage in the history of American Catholicism. ''He's one of us,'' explains Father Groeschel, referring to the millions of descendants of Catholic immigrants. ''He's a kid from the city with a New York accent - proof, perhaps, that a saint can grow up playing stickball in the streets of New York and shopping at Korvettes.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ACTIVISTS ASSESS IMPACE OF RIGHT TO LIFE PARTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/nyregion/activists-assess-impace-of-right-to-life-party.html,"IN its almost eight years as a formal political party, the Right to Life Party has had minimal impact on Westchester's elections, according to three activists involved with the abortion issue. The three disagree over why. The party is ''irrelevant,'' said Polly Rothstein, executive director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, because ''those who favor 'choice' are in the majority. We have gained the edge in political clout.'' Not so, said Patricia W. Hatcher, co-chairman of the Right to Life Committee of Westchester, an entity separate from the Right to Life Party. She said the party has had little positive impact because it runs its own candidates even when there is a ''prolife'' Republican or Democrat in the race. A third interpretation was offered by Robert D. McKeon, chairman of the Right to Life Party of Westchester, who said that the blame lies with antiabortionists like Mrs. Hatcher who did not support Right to Life Party candidates. ''Ironically, they are the ones, not the proabortion people, who are preventing us from advancing,'' Mr. McKeon said. The Right to Life Committee is a national organization that predates the New York State Right to Life Party. Although both have the same objective of making abortion illegal, the two groups usually endorse different candidates for office and have occasionally not seen eye-to-eye on abortion-related issues. The party became a formal entity in the state after the 1978 gubernatorial election, when its candidate drew more than the 50,000 votes required to obtain the standing. As a formal party, it is reserved a row on the ballot for all races, and can nominate candidates by a party convention instead of by petition only. The only other formal parties in the state are the Democrats, the Republicans, the Conservatives and the Liberals. The Right to Life Party has about 1,400 enrolled voters in the county and 21,606 statewide. With the 1986 elections now history, those involved with the abortion issue are assessing the vote, and both sides find things to be pleased about. The good news for the Right to Life Party is that the party, with Dennis E. Dillon, the Nassau County District Attorney, as its gubernatorial candidate, drew more votes statewide than the Liberal Party, which had endorsed the Democratic incumbent, Mario M. Cuomo. This means the Right to Life Party will bump the Liberals from Line D on the next ballot. The local Right to Life Committee has found satisfaction in seeing elected many of the major-party candidates it endorsed, including Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi in the 20th Congressional District and Nicholas A. Spano, a Yonkers Republican elected to the State Senate. These victories come despite financial help from the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion to the respective opponents in those two races, former Representative Bella S. Abzug and Andrew Macdonald, both Democrats. ''Polly Rothstein says this is a prochoice county,'' Mrs. Hatcher said. ''Look at the people who are elected from Westchester County. I don't think it bears out.'' Mrs. Rothstein, in turn, argued that Mrs. Abzug and Mr. Macdonald lost for reasons unrelated to the abortion issue and that a number of candidates who support legal abortion defeated antiabortionists in races that could have been won by either candidate. These included Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci, a Democrat from New Rochelle, and Assemblyman-elect Terence M. Zaleski, a Democrat from Yonkers, she said. According to Mrs. Rothstein, election trends in recent years demonstrate a dwindling support for the Right to Life Party and the antiabortion issue in general. Specifically, she said, the average Right to Life Party candidate running for state office in the county in 1986 drew 2.8 percent of the vote, compared with 3.5 percent in 1980. For county-level races, the percentage has dropped to 2.5 percent in 1985 from 5.7 percent in 1979, she said. Mrs. Rothstein, Mrs. Hatcher and Mr. McKeon did have points on which they agreed, including the belief that most Westchester voters do not base their vote solely on a candidate's stand on abortion, although this may, indeed, be a factor. They agreed that a main reason that the Right to Life Party has received fewer votes in recent years is that many major-party candidates who in the past had the Right to Life endorsement now either refuse it or are not offered it. The only major-party candidates to take the Right to Life line this year in Westchester races were three Republicans: United States Senator Alfonse D'Amato and Assemblyman Guy J. Vallela, both of whom were re-elected, and Joseph A. Rauso, who lost a race for Assembly. In all other races, the Right to Life Party ran its own candidates. According to Mrs. Hatcher, voters are reluctant to waste their vote on a third-party candidate who is perceived to have no chance of winning, particularly when there is a candidate viewed by the Right to Life Committee as prolife. The committee usually endorses a major-party candidate, unless it considers neither of them to be an opponent of legalized abortion. Mrs. Hatcher said she believed that the Right to Life Party has been harming the cause by running its own candidates. ''I think where there's a split vote they're just helping the other candidate who is proabortion,'' she said, adding, ''We've seen the party as slowing down the achievements of our goal. While we wouldn't cheer at its demise, we wouldn't be upset about it either.'' Responded Mr. McKeon: ''We, too, are working to put ourselves out of business'' by winning the battle to make abortion illegal. In the meantime, Mr. McKeon said, the party would continue to run candidates. ''What is the purpose of being a political party if you don't run candidates?'' he asked. ''If we get the numbers, if we get 10 percent of the vote,'' he explained, then the politicians ''would look at our line as important.'' According to Mrs. Rothstein, this will never happen. ''The major-party candidates don't take the line because it's been the kiss of death,'' she said. ''It hurts more than it helps. The politicians who are antichoice would take it if it helped.'' In a rare move of unity between the state Right to Life Party and the state Right to Life Committee, the committee also endorsed Mr. Dillon in the recent gubernatorial race. However, the Westchester Right to Life Committee broke from the ranks and endorsed County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican candidadte. ''Party leaders misrepresented Mr. O'Rourke's positions,'' Mrs. Hatcher said, noting that Mr. O'Rourke is a member of the Right to Life Committee. Mr. McKeon said he personally worked actively to convince the state Right to Life Committee that Mr. O'Rourke was not ''prolife.'' He said this conclusion had been based in part on Mr. O'Rourke's refusal in 1983 to support a proposed county law that would have required women under 18 years of age to notify their parents before they could have had an abortion. The Right to Life Committee agreed with Mr. O'Rourke's position that such a law, on a county level, was unconstitutional, Mrs. Hatcher said. ''We are taxpayers,'' she said. ''It would have been irresponsible and a waste of money to support it.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE LORD OF LA MANCHA AND HER ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/books/the-lord-of-la-mancha-and-her-abortion.html,"DON QUIXOTE By Kathy Acker. 207 pp. New York: Grove Press. Paper, $7.95.  KATHY ACKER'S ''Don Quixote'' is a literary trash compactor, collapsing with hammer thumps and electronic whine the fictional containers - the genres, stories and characters - from which we take nourishment and, Ms. Acker says, sup poison. Cervantes constructed his two-volume landfill of medieval rubbish and Renaissance life over two decades. Ms. Acker's 207-page version is the product of the ''new era'' one of her characters in her last novel, ''Blood and Guts in High School,'' describes as an age when ''people will have to grapple with all sorts of difficult problems, leaving us no time for the luxury of expressing ourselves artistically.'' The novel begins with Don Quixote, now a 66-year-old contemporary woman, having an abortion, which maddens her: ''She conceived of the most insane idea that any woman can think of. Which is to love.'' This ideal is crazed, we learn later, because most women are too intelligent to believe in romantic love but have been persuaded by men and literature that love is woman's function and tragic triumph. Cervantes showed what courtly love could do to a man. Ms. Acker sketches 350 years of sentimental history and illustrates the cumulative effects of romantic madness with Ms. Quixote's wanderings through the gender wars of today's London and New York, her Sancho Panza a talking dog named St. Simeon. Like Cervantes' book, Ms. Acker's collects adventures, authorial addresses, reportage, other texts, anecdotes and hallucinations. Subtitled ''Which Was a Dream,'' ''Don Quixote'' has the three-part structure of the mythic heroic journey. ''The Beginning of the Night'' is also the knight's departure, her futile and often funny sallies into a world controlled by two ''power-mongers,'' Machiavelli and Christ. In the second part, ''Other Texts,'' Quixote has to read works by four male writers who create or unwittingly perpetuate harmful stereotypes of women. These works - Bely's ''Petersburg,'' Lampedusa's ''Leopard,'' Wedekind's ''Lulu'' plays and an anonymous science fiction story -Ms. Acker bashes with broad parody and grotesque revision. In the third part, ''The End of the Night'' (and knight), Quixote returns from literature to save America from ''evil enchanters'' such as Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and New York City landlords. She hears voices, including those of Hobbes, de Sade and Puritan divines; listens to a friendly dog's life story, which appears to retell Quixote's own childhood; wages war on ''Religious White Men''; and, after death, dreams of Spain, where people could ''dream publicly,'' which is ''to do art.'' ''Economic and political war or control,'' Quixote comes to believe, are now ''taking place at the level of language or myth.'' She also knows about ''the later semioticians . . . Derrida . . . Foucault.'' But Ms. Acker is no academic deconstructor. Not even a maker of Donald Barthelme collages or Angela Carter rewrites. Early in the novel Ms. Acker plays with her name, associating Kathy with ''catheter,'' the tool of abortion, and Acker with ''hack,'' both as noun (junk writer) and as verb. These associations, which turn into fictional methods, are probably why she has a reputation as a ''punk novelist.'' She has also performed with the rock group Husker Du. What is evident in ''Don Quixote,'' as well as in ''Blood and Guts'' and another earlier novel, ''Great Expectations,'' is a punklike reductiveness of lexicon and texture, a combination of the early Sex Pistols' raging repetition and the drugged synthesizer tonalities of Laurie Anderson's mantric songs. The original Quixote complained that his story was told by ''some ignorant chatterer who set himself to write it gropingly.'' Despite the Cervantean precedent, Ms. Acker's stylistic choices are, I think, at unfortunate odds with the sophistication of her materials. The novel is eccentrically learned; quite carefully constructed, though it appears haphazardly plotted; in control of its double and triple ironic inversions; canny in its feminist critique of male and female fictions, including feminist mythologies; and often acute in its overheard voices. But ''Don Quixote'' is much too frequently composed of banal language, the stilted and formulaic high-school passion I thought Ms. Acker had disposed of in ''Blood and Guts.'' How to separate the trash compactor from the trash? This is the challenge Ms. Acker does not manage with a craft equal to her cultural range. LIKE most postmodern experimenters, Ms. Acker includes within her novel several defenses of its alienating methods. ''Masochism is now rebellion'' might explain her ''messed-up language.'' Ms. Acker also likes to play authorial hide and seek. Toward the end of ''Don Quixote'' she implies that it, as well as other novels, are symptoms of trauma, the howl of guilt and anger inflicted by the suicide of a mother dominated by male notions of femininity. Whether autobiographical fact or not, this experience of self-destructiveness supplies a powerful cause of Quixote's abortion-madness and a motive for Ms. Acker's self-imploding prose. Her scarified sensibility, subversive intellect and predatory wit make her a writer like no other I know. Monique Wittig, in ''Les Guerilleres,'' would be the closest. At the end of ''Don Quixote,'' the knight inspires females to become marauding pirates in revolt. Ms. Acker does mash and slash. IN THE TRADITION OF CERVANTES, SORT OF''I think my 'Don Quixote' is in the same tradition as the first 'Don Quixote,' '' Kathy Acker said of her latest novel, in which Cervantes' visionary knight has been transformed into a crusading feminist, crazed by the prospect of having an abortion. The 39-year-old American author said she became fascinated with Don Quixote's ''trying to transform a fairly intolerable social reality into what really is the grail, this totally romantic search. All sorts of feminist issues got involved - it just took off.'' Ms. Acker picked up Cervantes' text two years ago, she said by telephone from her London home, when she was looking for something to divert her attention from her own impending abortion. ''I couldn't keep my mind off the abortion so I started writing down what I was reading, but the abortion kept getting into it. When I finally looked at what I had written, I said this is fabulous!'' Ms. Acker, who moved to London from New York's Lower East Side in 1984, said she was intrigued by the Arab themes and forms in Cervantes' text, especially what she called ''the art of narrative weaving.'' She incorporated African folk tales into her version, as she did English novels, American history books and German plays. ''I write by using other written texts, rather than by expressing 'reality,' which is what most novelists do. Our reality now, which occurs so much through the media, is other texts. I'm playing the same game as Cervantes. When I read novels now they don't seem to have anything to do with anything. I can't tell where the writers' guts are -novels should be aimed at adding to cultural discourse.'' - Lori Miller",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I AM LAPIDARY BUT NOT ERISTIC WHEN I USE BIG WORDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/books/i-am-lapidary-but-not-eristic-when-i-use-big-words.html,"ONE day in May I found on my desk my column, clipped from that morning's Washington Post, a red arrow - courtesy of my secretary - pointing to a footnote underneath the column. It read ''ERISTIC: (i ris/ tik) adj [ Gr. eristikos, d. erizein, to strive, dispute d. eris, strife ] of or provoking controversy, or given to sophistical argument and specious reasoning.'' I looked up to the corresponding asterisk in the text, and there saw my sentence, ''The action by Judge Robert Carter [ in fining the National Conference of Catholic Bishops for contempt ] has brought out a lot of smiles in judicial political circles (as a rule, you don't step up and fine the Catholic Church - or the Protestant, or Jewish churches - for failure to comply with eristic complaints.'' (The Abortion Rights Mobilization was suing to deny the bishops their tax deductibility, to which end it had persuaded the judge to subpoena the bishops' internal memos on abortion.) Meg Greenfield (The Post's editorial page editor) was rapping me on the knuckles, a quite unusual public reproach: I couldn't remember when last she had thought to help the readers of The Post to understand unusual words, however much time she needs to spend explaining unusual editorial positions. Dear Meg, I thought. The instincts of the Jewish mother just took over this time. And then, a week or two later, another clipping on my desk, red arrow, footnote, only this time it was The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, explaining to its readers the meaning of ''lapidary.'' (Their footnote: ''Lapidary. Having the elegance and precision associated with inscriptions on monumental stones.'') I was feeling a little beleaguered, and presently there appeared a letter of explanation from Mr. Ed Williams, associate editor of The Charlotte Observer, and the challenge was now, well, lapidary. Mr. Williams wrote me: ''I oversee the Observer's daily Viewpoint page, and in that capacity am in charge of preparing syndicated columns for publication in this newspaper. Sometimes I insert aids to the reader, such as the definition of 'lapidary' in your recent column, enclosed. A fellow editor asked why I didn't also define a outrance. I replied that I thought you use foreign words and phrases in your column because (1) you like to show off, and (2) you take delight in irritating people. Far be it for me, I said, to deny you those pleasures. Then I realized I shouldn't presume to answer for you. So let me ask. Why do you use, in your column, foreign words and phrases, and unfamiliar English words, that are unlikely to be understood by the average reader, or at least the average editor? Surrounded by dictionaries, I await your reply.'' The point here raised - When is it O.K. to use an unfamiliar word? When is it not O.K.? - is endlessly argued, yet even so, sometimes, notwithstanding the debates' endlessness, fresh insights and original formulations are coined. One of these, I think, was Dwight Macdonald's distinction, made in his marvelous survey of Webster's Third for The New Yorker (March 10, 1962), between unusual words (O.K.) and words ''that belong in the zoo sections of the dictionary'' (not O.K.). I should think most people would agree, for instance, that arachibutyrophobia would be an example of the latter (the word defines the fear of peanut butter's sticking to the roof of your mouth). James Jackson Kilpatrick, in his book ''The Writer's Art,'' takes a position on the dogmatic side against the use of unfamiliar words and cites me, however kindly, as a prodigious offender (the Lord delivered Kilpo into my hands, because his proscriptive passage against long & unusual words contained four long & unusual words). Mr. Kilpatrick likes to quote Westbrook Pegler, who denounced the use of what he called ''out of town words.'' The question, under the proximate prodding of Mr. Williams, is worth revisiting. And the best way to begin, I suppose, is to examine the two words singled out for attention, the first one - the word Mr. Williams thought that courtesy required him to translate for the benefit of his readers - the second, the French, which he let pass as arrant and provocative exhibitionism. What happens when Mr. A. and Ms. B. flatly disagree about whether a word is ''unusual''? Well, there is a problem there of an obvious order, namely that some words are unusual but widely recognized, while others are unusual and widely unrecognized. Returning to the general theme a few weeks ago, Mr. Kilpatrick wrote in his column, ''The Miami Herald carried a 72 point four-column head, 'DADELAND IS DOYEN OF AREA MALLS,' '' and said he had received a letter (Mr. Kilpatrick also writes a syndicated language column, and serves as ombudsman on usage) from a Floridian who wanted to know ''How many people know what 'doyen' means?'' Observed K.: ''The more pertinent question: How many of the Herald's 450,000 readers know what doyen means? Ten percent? 20 per cent? 80 percent?'' But Kilpatrick is a man of troubled conscience, because he goes right on to say that here he himself has just finished making reference to ''72 point'' type. That is workaday prose, of the John-Jane-Gyp order, for anyone who has ever engaged in editorial enterprises - but what about those 450,000 readers? Might they not have preferred, K. tortures himself, ''inch-high type''? Nobody is going to pay Mr. Gallup a lot of money to find out how many people in Florida know what the word ''doyen'' means. And not many people would be willing to come up with a threshold percentage: More than X know doyen? - O.K. to use. Less than X, verboten (forbidden). That's on the order of defining the line where obscenity begins. All of which brings me to say that I do not think of ''lapidary'' as a word so unrecognizable as to interrupt the reading flow of the average college graduate. But in saying this it is important to reiterate one of the points I made in the public argument I had with Mr. Kilpatrick (in the introduction to his book, which he assigned me to write). It is quite simply this, that people with vocabularies of the same size are by no means people who know the same words. A while ago I reviewed a book by John Updike (''The Coup''), discovering over 20 words the meaning of which I didn't know. Knocking these words around at an editors' session in my office, I would find that, cumulatively, my five colleagues knew them all. So: Sam Johnson's apothegm, ''In lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon oath,'' if it is not in the anthologies that circle Mr. Williams' desk, ought to be. But then let's take the tougher one. Here is what I wrote in a column on Paul Weiss, the philosopher whose 85th birthday was something of a national event. ''At Yale [ Professor Weiss ] was the political liberal a outrance, but his orderly mind made it hard for him to defend some of liberalism's zanier forms.'' This, now, is concession time. How many people are familiar with ''a outrance?'' It is, no question about it, an out-of-town word, though Pegler certainly ran into it when he was out of town covering the war in France in 1918, where the Germans faced the French, British and Americans, fighting their trench warfare a outrance. But the French word is given in Webster. First, the inquirer gets plain ''outrance,'' in English (''the last extremity''), and then is invited to look at ''a outrance,'' a separate entry, that gives: ''to the death, unsparingly.'' The Oxford English Dictionary also lists it in French, and cites uses of it by Tobias Smollet and Walter Scott . . . But why should a syndicated columnist use the word? I can hear Mr. Williams re-asking. Well, not, really, just to show off - one doesn't ''show off'' one's workaday equipment. You see, that word, and a hundred or so others, are a part of my working vocabulary, even as a C augmented 11th chord with a raised 9th can be said to be an operative resource of the performing jazz pianist. Are we now closing in on the question, by using the exclusivist word, ''performing?'' Yes, in a way we are, I suppose. Because just as the discriminating ear greets gladly the C augmented 11th when just the right harmonic moment has come for it, so the fastidious eye encounters happily the word that says exactly what the writer wished not only said but conveyed, the writer here defined as a performing writer sensitive to cadence, variety, marksmanship, accent, nuance and drama. WHAT of the reader who misses the refinement? Well, what of the listener deaf to the special reach of the C augmented 11th? That reader has the usual choices: he can ignore the word; attempt, from the context, to divine its meaning precisely or roughly (not hard, in the narrative above, on Professor Weiss's liberal politics); or he can look it up. Are these alternatives an imposition? Yes, if the newspaper's feature that day is on how to treat a rattlesnake bite. You would not instruct the reader to fight the poison a outrance. But newspapers, in particular in one-paper cities, tend to acknowledge an obligation beyond merely reporting the news. The very idea of a ''feature,'' whether designed to advise (Ann Landers), amuse (Art Buchwald), satirize (G. B. Trudeau) or opine (the syndicated columnist) presupposes that the performer should use the full range of his relevant skills, even if the percentage of readers who turn to that feature is reduced. Surely there is a corner, in spacy papers that carry five pages on sports, for Addison and Steele? It required a Pulitzer Prize to alert some editors to the very existence of Murray Kempton, the most entertaining analytical belletrist in town, and now we read him, hungrily, in The Stamford Advocate. Readers have diverse interests, resources, skills, appetites. The Latin Mass Committee petitioned for the resumption of a single mass to be said in Latin in London after the postconciliar ban of 1965, and was turned down - on the ground that Latin was only ''for the educated few.'' Sir Arnold Lunn said it all in a letter to The Times, ''Surely,'' he wrote, ''in all her charity, Mother Church can make a little room, even for the educated few?''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE CULT OF CEAUSESCU,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/magazine/the-cult-of-ceausescu.html,"THE FIRST QUESTION PEOPLE ASK WHEN THEY hear that you have just spent an hour with Nicolae Ceausescu is, ''How did he look?'' So it went with the hotel concierge, the restaurant waiter, the taxi driver, the travel-agency clerk and foreign diplomats in Bucharest. The implication of the question, and much of what is said in the police state that is Rumania deals in implications and inferences, was whether President Ceausescu has long to live. A year ago, he had been out of action for weeks, the rumor being that he had prostate cancer. But now, the 68-year-old leader seemed, to the nondiagnostic eye, more or less fit. I had asked to see Ceausescu in March, just 20 years after he barred me from Rumania while I was serving as Balkan correspondent of The New York Times. The reason for the ban, suggested but never made explicit, was an article I had written, based on many interviews, saying that Ceausescu, then in power for one year, appeared to be scarcely known in the Rumanian countryside. Ten years later, I was readmitted, returning again in 1979 and 1983. In the interim, the Rumanian President had become a kind of a Communist king, due in large part to the systematic development over the last dozen years of a cult of personality that has equaled, or even surpassed, those of Russia's Stalin, China's Mao and Yugoslavia's Tito. In guarded moments, Rumanians refer to him as ''Mao-Cescu.'' Ceausescu is probably the most powerful ruler in the history of the Rumanians, a history he likes to trace back to the Geto-Dacians, who stopped an invasion by Persia's Darius in the reed banks of the Danube delta 2,500 years ago. With the placement of scores of his family members in high positions, there is even the framework now for a dynasty. To his subjects, Ceausescu is all-knowing and omnipresent. The first half of the state television's single, two-hour weeknight program is customarily devoted to his activities and accomplishments, as are the front pages of the tightly controlled newspapers. Bookstores must devote a showcase to the 28 volumes of his speeches; news kiosks carry a smaller selection and music stores display records of his speeches. Painters and poets are required to produce works celebrating him. At the entrance to the Bucharest Fairground, a new triumphal arch bears the legend ''The Golden Epoch - the Epoch of Nicolae Ceausescu.'' The Ceausescu cult also requires that even high-ranking party officials are obliged to rise to their feet at party rallies and join in such ritual chants as, ''Ceausescu -Rumania, our pride and esteem!'' Beyond the borders of Rumania, Nicolae Ceausescu is viewed more dispassionately. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the new Soviet leader, who has shunned the semblances of a personality cult for himself, appears to have adopted a scornful stance toward Ceausescu and has not accorded him more than the minimal courtesies. Although the United States has developed closer ties on cultural, political and economic levels, there has been a certain disenchantment with Rumania's system of suffocating controls in its domestic policy. One of Rumania's few distinctions has been its independent foreign policy. Over the last two decades there have been moments of daring defiance of Soviet-bloc policies: having good relations with China; maintaining ties with Israel after the 1967 war; refusing to join in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia; not boycotting the 1984 Olympics at Los Angeles. These actions undoubtedly annoyed Moscow, but they were tolerated, because they never constituted any real threat to Soviet national security. Now, with the Moscow-Peking split in a healing process and talks begun between Israel and some bloc countries, the uniqueness of Rumania's independent policy is fading. Rumania had also become more dependent on trade with the Soviet Union. ''The Russians are not unhappy,'' a Rumanian foreign policy specialist observes, ''to see a weak Rumania on their southwestern frontier.'' Yet, despite a crumbling economy, Ceausescu is busily commemorating his reign with gigantic building projects. Already finished, though little used, is the Danube-Black Sea Canal. Under way in Bucharest is an unneeded $1.2 billion civic center that includes a state palace for the President, and a nationwide $1.8 billion irrigation system. Under consideration is a plan - frightening to environmentalists - to fill in much of the vast Danube delta wetlands to create new farmland. Construction is scheduled to begin next year on a parallel capital to Bucharest, at Tirgoviste, as there had been during the 16th-century reign of Michael the Brave, who first united all three Rumanian lands -Walachia, Transylvania and Moldavia. In Tirgoviste's history museum, there is a new exhibition of ''Rumanian'' heroes. An enormous portrait of Ceausescu gazes down on the busts of Rumanian rulers. Among the venerated is Vlad Dracula, the 15th-century prince whose cruelties gave rise to the Dracula vampire legend. Flanking the entranceway are huge bronze busts of Decebal, the Dacian king, and Trajan, the Roman emperor who defeated Decebal at great cost in the second century. Could it be that Ceausescu is casting himself not only as a Rumanian emperor but as a Roman one as well? After all, he carried a jeweled royal mace at his 1974 induction as President. ''Roman emperor!'' the guide snorted. ''No, he already thinks he is a god.'' ''What do you mean?'' ''In the newspapers, they have already printed poems about Ceausescu describing him as a 'demigod.' '' Although he claims Dracula as part of his political lineage, it appears that Ceausescu has not allowed torture or killing to be part of his style of governance. But in its 1986 report on Rumania, the Helsinki Watch, which monitors human rights, speaks of ''totalitarian control as repressive as any in Eastern Europe.'' T O VISIT CEAUSESCU as a journalist requires that written questions be submitted. These are then processed by Agerpres, the state press agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by the President's personal advisers. Over a period of seven months, four sets of questions were submitted, revised and eventually agreed upon. An interview was set for the week of Sept. 29. I arrived in good time, then waited three days before receiving word that Ceausescu would receive me at 9:30 A.M. on Oct. 2. The setting would be the headquarters of the Central Committee, whose general secretary he is, rather than at his presidential seat in the former royal palace. An elaborate ritual ensued. A foreign ministry official picked me up at my hotel at 8:25 A.M., and we walked for seven minutes in a circuitous route to the headquarters. An army colonel met us at the doors; two protocol officials took us to the second floor, along a lengthy corridor, around a corner and down to the mezzanine level, where we were escorted into a 20-by-50-foot reception room dotted with potted palms. Three still photographers and a television cameraman stood by. All such Presidential activities are recorded and dutifully presented in the Rumanian press and on television. Ceausescu requests that his interviews with foreign reporters be published in full. A compact man, about 5 feet 6 inches tall, Ceausescu entered, walking a bit stiffly. As I moved forward to shake hands with him, cameras clicked and whirred. Having reported on the absence of a Ceausescu cult two decades ago, it occurred to me, I was now participating in one. Before I could pull out a notebook, he shot a question at me: ''What are your impressions of Rumania?'' An interpreter translated. It did not seem to be the moment to talk about personality cults or meat and power shortages, so I replied, lamely, ''There is a lot of construction going on.'' The President nodded with satisfaction before opening a small red folder containing my questions. As instructed, I said, ''Let us proceed to the first question.'' He spoke softly and carefully, pausing to ponder each question before proceeding. His responses added nothing to previous statements, but they did make plain where his interests lie, as evidenced in these excerpts: Question: . . . What was the most memorable event in your career? Answer: . . . I think its acme [ was ] when we turned Rumania from a backward agrarian country into a developed industrial-agrarian country. Q. . . . How would you characterize Rumania's relations with the U.S.A. And the U.S.S.R.? A. Today, our relations with the Soviet Union are fine. And . . . so are the links between Rumania and the U. S. . . . I believe things would be much better if the problem of the most-favored-nation clause [ according Rumania preferential tariffs ] did not arise every year. . . . Q. How will Rumanian society develop in the coming years? A. . . . We plan that by 1990, Rumanian industry should compare with the world's technically and qualitatively most-developed ones. Likewise, we plan to take Rumanian agriculture to a high development level. We have endorsed a series of measures for the application of a new economic and financial mechanism, of the principles of self-management and self-administration. . . . It was all quite extemporaneous, but a bit like interviewing a juke box: you push a button and a record starts playing back familiar songs. At the end, Ceausescu permitted a few additional questions. When I asked how he had been drawn into the Communist movement, his face grew somber and he replied in measured tones: ''I had a very difficult life in the village. I came to the city to work, and . . . entered into a relationship with several revolutionaries when I was 12 or 13. I began to understand that another kind of living conditions could be created.'' I also asked if I might see his native village, meet another Ceausescu, perhaps his younger brother, Ilie, and visit Tirgoviste. He spread his arms wide in a gesture of generosity and replied: ''Poftim!'' - ''Be my guest.'' We shook hands again and he marched out. It was an odd moment. It did not seem as if I had been in the presence of an emperor, much less a demigod, or even the object of a cult, more like a distracted corporate chief executive officer. Then I noticed the eyes of the Rumanian aides who had remained behind. They were glistening. But of course, the Ceausescu cult was there for domestic consumption, not for people like me. E XITING A FEW minutes later onto the Piata Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, named for Ceausescu's predecessor and mentor, a striking figure suddenly appeared: a tall elderly man wearing white trousers, a red cravat and a black double-breasted blazer out of whose pocket spilled a huge orange-and-black checked silk handkerchief. On his head, a broad-brimmed black fedora, and in his hand a Malacca cane, which he flourished. He was a vision of the decadent past, when Bucharest was a legend throughout Europe, and beyond, for luxury and debauchery. He nodded slightly to the gawking pedestrians as he proceeded majestically on his way. I raised my camera to take his picture. The foreign ministry man lightly touched my elbow. ''Please don't,'' he said. ''He is crazy.'' The encounter was but one of several reminders that the Ceausescu cult, despite its pervasiveness, coexists with other, perhaps more durable, Rumanian realities. It is in the everyday life of the 23 million Rumanians that the iron shoe of the Ceausescu system pinches. Rumania exports large quantities of meat and vegetables to European countries while supplies at home remain critically short. An item as innocuous as black pepper is prized because it is one of thousands of consumer goods no longer imported in an austerity drive aimed at liquidating Rumania's $6.6 billion foreign debt. If you ask for sugar to go with your morning coffee in an A-category hotel, the waiter reaches into his pocket, withdraws a single packet of zahar and solemnly hands it to you. In a country whose wells produce 12 million tons of oil annually, gasoline is periodically rationed. Here again, the Ceausescu shoe pinches. Based on what had long been a major oil industry, the present regime built a huge refining capacity. Now the global market for refined products has shrunk, but Rumania is still saddled with agreements to purchase Soviet oil at world prices and then turn it into gasoline that can only be sold abroad, and at a loss. A driver of the state-owned Maxi-Taxi enterprise complains bitterly: ''They give me a quota of 15 liters [ less than four gallons ] of gas a day, which takes me about 150 kilometers [ 94 miles ] . That's half a day's driving. What am I supposed to do?'' What he and nearly all Rumanians do is to participate in a second economy, in which the standard currencies are United States dollars, American filtered cigarettes and Viennese ground coffee, and in which bartering is the medium of trade. Some of the worst shortages are in the power sector. The gas supply is often so low that stove pilot lights go out. During the last two winters, Rumania was caught stealing power from a joint Yugoslav-Rumanian hydroelectric station, The nation's first nuclear power station was supposed to have come on line last year, now the talk is of 1989. ''Basically, the outlook is pretty grim,'' says an economist at a Western embassy in Bucharest. ''People talk of a 20 to 30 percent drop in the living standard in the last three years. Ceausescu has ruled out any economic reform whatsoever.'' A colleague of his rejoins: ''Given the green light, they could do very well. They've got the potential. The schools are good, the infrastructure good. But innovators are ignored. Initiative is stifled. They are sliding toward being an undeveloped country, reduced to dealing in commodities.'' T HE QUESTION ON the minds of ordinary Rumanians, foreign diplomats, journalists and scholars is whether Nicolae Ceausescu seeks to create a dynastic succession. The question takes on weight when one learns that at least 40 members of his extended family have been identified in positions of varying power in the party-state apparatus. The question narrows if one considers the role of his wife, Elena, a chemist by training, who began to appear in public 15 years ago in the role of First Lady. Now, at age 67, she is generally viewed as the second-most influential person in the leadership. She is a key member of the executive committee of the Central Committee in charge of personnel policy, and the holder of numerous other high political posts. In recent years, her birthday has been marked as a state occasion. For a time, it was thought that the President's son Nicu was being groomed for succession. But though appointed to high posts in the party and put in charge of the national Communist Youth Union, he has preferred to indulge in fast cars, womanizing and drink. Of late, he has become increasingly inactive, and some Youth Union leaders have even dared to suggest that he be replaced. The other Ceausescus, including daughter Zoia Elena, a director of the Mathematical Institute, and an adopted son Valentin, secretary of the Rumanian Institute of Nuclear Physics, keep a low profile, despite their Government positions. As do several Presidential brothers: Ion, deputy chief of the State Planning Commission; Florea, a retired journalist; Marin, a trade official, and Nicolae Andruta, a lieutenant general in the Ministry of the Interior. Some specialists have surmised that Ceausescu placed so many of his and his wife's relatives in key positions to assure personal control of crucial sectors of the Communist power structure as much as to extend his dynasty. For the moment, the only Ceausescu deemed strong-willed enough to try to succeed the President in the event of his death would be his wife, Elena. But she is so widely disliked that, should she try, no one thinks she would last more than a few months. The day after my interview with him, the President made good on his poftim. I was to meet my third family member, having encountered Mrs. Ceausescu in Washington in 1978. A black Dacia car took me to meet brother Ilie, a lieutenant general in the Ministry of Defense, who is eight years younger than Nicolae, balder, and a charming host. His official position is chairman of the army's political administration, but his first love is military history. I had just seen ''Battle From the Shadows,'' a new Rumanian film about World War I, and had recently read about Vlad Dracula's military campaigns against the Turks. Was my impression that Rumanian strategy had long depended on ambushes an accurate one? Plainly delighted, the general commenced his response with the ambush of Darius I by the Dacians in 514 B.C. and concluded, two hours later, in the 20th century. It was a learned discourse, presented with great verve, rich details and gentle humor. What did he talk about with his brother, the President? I asked. ''Everything,'' he replied. ''No problems. We get together when possible. But each of us has very many activities. Even our wives don't get together.'' I asked if I could snap his picture. He agreed but admonished me: ''You may keep the photos of me on two conditions - one, that you don't publish them and, two, that you don't publish them together with photos of my brother.'' The following morning, I drove westward to the village of the Ceausescu clan. One sees the Ceausescu cult in full flower in Scornicesti, which now boasts paved streets, a new candy factory, a soccer stadium, stores with more goods in the windows than in comparable small villages, a discotheque and a stone monument opposite the modest ancestral Ceausescu cottage, which has been completly renovated. The village has even acquired a second small Orthodox church, perched on a hillside next to the marble tombs of the President's parents. The new chapel prompted a Rumanian wit to dub the village ''Scornicesti-les-deux-Eglises,'' as in the hometown of Charles de Gaulle, Colombey-les-deux-Eglises. Nicolae Ceausescu was the third of 10 children, seven of them sons. Their father, Andruta, was known locally as a heavy drinker, which may explain why he named two of his sons Nicolae. The one who became President was sent from home in 1929, at age 11, to Pitesti, a nearby big city, where he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. Soon after, he moved to Bucharest. In 1933, at age 15, he was arrested for leftist political activities and in 1936 was tried as a Communist and sentenced to several years in Doftana Prison. There he met older Communists, including Gheorghiu-Dej, who liked the precocious teen-ager, and took him under their wing. Party lore has it that he met Elena at the 1939 First of May celebration in Bucharest, where she was queen of the workers' parade. They married that year. He was arrested again in 1940, and spent the war years in various internment camps. I departed Scornicesti still wondering about the dynasty theory. Perhaps, in traditional peasant fashion, Ceausescu was merely taking care of his extended family members. But that would still leave begging an explanation for the cult and the megalomania. Those of us who watched Gheorghiu-Dej in the early 1960's thought we were witnessing the beginning of his cult. Maybe Ceausescu got the idea from him. But it was Gheorghiu-Dej who promulgated Rumania's policy of independence from the Soviet Union in foreign affairs and economic relations; his successor has merely elaborated on it. Rather, the Ceausescu stamp is evident in the creation of monster steel and aluminum industries that work at half capacity because there is no market for their products, in the gigantic irrigation scheme that lowers the water table and leaches the soil to the point of infertility, and in the law prohibiting abortions. There may not be individual cruelty, as in the reign of Vlad Dracula, but there is institutionalized misery and despair. It touches the majority of the population, except the police, who are paid more than university professors to carry submachine guns and stand on every street in the capital and at road-control points every 10 miles or so in the countryside. Some Rumanians estimate that half the population is involved in the security apparatus in one way or another, if only as informers. ''When Ceausescu rides down Dorobantilor Road in his convoy of eight cars in the morning, the blue militia jeeps appear at the cross streets,'' a Bucharest woman recounts. ''The militia lines the road, one posted every few yards. Plainclothesmen in black leather jackets appear among the trees, ready to shoo people into the doorways. Buses are drawn up to block against suicide drivers.'' In all likelihood, this is part of Nicolae Ceausescu's response to a youth of rejection, privation and imprisonment. He implied as much during the interview, in response to a question about the most significant event in his life: ''I would say that one of the important moments was when, resolved to defy any act of repression and to serve the Rumanian people, I chose the path of the fight for the revolutionary transformation of Rumanian society.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHILDREN WITH CHILDREN: COPING WITH A CRISIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/nyregion/children-with-children-coping-with-a-crisis.html,"Throughout New York City, ever-younger girls are becoming pregnant ever more frequently. Over the last five years, even as pregnancies among 15-to-19-year-olds have remained nearly steady, the rate among younger girls - some not even teen-agers -has risen. School officials offer a variety of reasons for the situation - the girls' desire for respite from a grim future, an ignorance of birth control and an unwillingness to postpone sex - but the officials remain perplexed as they try to keep their students' lives on course. The most candid explanations are offered by the child mothers themselves. 'He Couldn't Hack It' The story of Roseann Collado, now a 17-year-old student at Jane Addams Vocational High School in the Bronx, reflects the experience of many young mothers. She became pregnant at age 13 and again a year later. The father of both children was a 15-year-old with whom she liked to hang around, and whom she hoped to persuade to marry her. Instead he disappeared, leaving Ms. Collado alone with two children at the age of 15. ''He couldn't hack it,'' she recalled. ''I thought by giving him a kid, he would stay, I wanted to be out of the house. I wanted to be with a guy in a house, raising my own family. It didn't work out that way.'' Despite some regrets about the pregnancies, Ms. Collado, manages a cheery countenance and determination to finish high school. As to how she saw herself five years from now, she said, ''Working real hard, finding a father for the kids and finishing school.'' But for every girl who comes back to school, many more drop out. Many principals and teachers said it was unrealistic to expect the teaching of abstinence to have much effect on the birth rate. ''It's a matter of the availability of sex,'' said the principal of Jane Addams, Patricia Black. ''But we have to break this culture of the children of poverty having children. It's not the middle-class kids who are having the babies. They get taken care of either by birth control or abortion.'' Last year, 1,084 girls under the age of 15 became pregnant in New York City, an increase of 6.7 percent in the pregnancy rate since 1980, according to the nonprofit Center for Public Advocacy Research. About two-thirds of those girls had abortions, said Dr. Grant Higginson, deputy director of the maternity services and family planning division in the city's Health Department. In the 15-to-19 age group, there were 29,904 pregnancies in 1985, a drop of less than 1 percent in the rate of pregnancies since 1980, the center's figures show. Nationally, there are about a million teen-age pregnancies each year, 400,000 ending in abortions. The problem is clearly visible in New York City's school system, where in some high schools it is commonplace to see pregnant girls, and where the School for Pregnant Teens, which has been operating for 15 years, has expanded to five sites, last year serving 1,644 girls. ''We had one girl in the fifth grade last year, she was 11,'' said Marie Pellegrino, the assistant principal of the School for Pregnant Teens, whose main site is at 22 East 128th Street. ''She gave birth and the young mother is back in this school.'' Principals, teachers and doctors who deal with teen-age mothers in the school system suggest a variety of reasons why young girls become pregnant. A doctor who works at two high school health clinics, Dr. Alwyn Cohall, said the teen-agers showed little interest in postponing sexual activity. He said ignorance was widespread about birth control methods and that old wives tales about human reproduction often prevail. He said that health clinics in high schools should be allowed to distribute contraceptives, a policy that the Board of Education has banned for six months while it studied the issue. The head of the Board of Education's dropout prevention program, Victor Herbert, said he believed that many of the girls lead such uninspiring lives that becoming pregnant was a way of adding some interest. ''At first, they get a lot of attention,'' Mr. Herbert said. Often, said Mrs. Black of Jane Addams High School, young girls become pregnant in large part because their mothers did, too, at a similar age and in similar circumstances. Irrational Thoughts About Pregnancy ''I wanted my children to have their father, I didn't want them to be raised like me,'' said Ms. Collado, as she told her story at Jane Addams, where she is studying cosmetology. Her mother was 20 when Ms. Collado was born. ''I haven't seen my father since I was a baby,'' she said, noting a pattern that she said was being repeated with her own children. Her 3-year-old son, David, and 2-year-old daughter, Wandie, know, she said, how to say ''Mummy,'' not ''Daddy.'' She realizes now, she said, that what she thought at the age of 13 - that the father would stay around, that they could hold together a family - was largely irrational. ''I was a little child, but I didn't look like 13,'' she said. ''I had a body like I was older, I did talk to everyone as though I was older.'' She said she did not use birth control before her first pregnancy. Afterward, she took the pill, but ''I didn't take it right.'' She would get together with her boyfriend - ''he always wanted to be the best guy around the block'' - when his mother was out of her apartment. ''She would go with her boyfriend and I would go to her house with her son,'' Ms. Collado recalled. ''He had a five-room apartment. It was real nice, we had something going.'' She said she would usually leave his house by 9 P.M. so she could get back before her mother, then a nurse's aide, came home from work. When Ms. Collado delivered her first child, her mother left work to look after him and, later, the second child. ''She had to stop to look after the kids,'' Ms. Collado said. ''Now she has arthritis. My mother gets welfare for me, my sister and the two babies. When I get home from school, I do my mother's job of looking after the kids.'' Around her neighborhood in the north Bronx, she sees little changing among her friends. ''Basically the whole block is all young girls with kids,'' she said. ''They're all young, 14 or 15. The oldest one is my best friend, she's 17 with a 1-year-old. She did it to get out of the house. The youngest girls sleep with anybody they can get. To me, they want to be like everybody else. Some of the girls say: 'I slept with this guy.' It's like they did something real big. They're just wasting their time. Who's going to want them?'' Motherhood Gives 'A Reason for Living' Like Roseann Collado, Sherri Woodford, a 19-year-old student at West Side High School, an alternative school in Manhattan, said she became pregnant on purpose, hoping that she could transform a tumultuous home life. At 16, Ms. Woodford was having trouble in school in El Paso, Tex., and her parents constantly argued. ''My brother was into his friends,'' she said. ''I tried to get into trouble to get the attention of my parents.'' She said she tried to become pregnant because ''I figured this would be something that could be mine - nobody could take it and I would have a little piece of me left that would give me a reason for living.'' When she found out she was pregnant, she ruled out an abortion. ''I felt it was wrong unless absolutely necessary,'' she said. Ms. Woodford decided to lie to her boyfriend. ''I let his mother and him believe it was not his until just before I gave birth,'' she said. By that stage, her mother, then separated from her husband, had already brought Ms. Woodford and her brother to New York City, where they could be close to relatives. Ms. Woodford gave birth to a girl, Torrie, over a year ago and has seen the father only once since. He is now angry and confused about being a father, she said. ''I took Torrie to see him and told him he could love her and cherish her,'' Ms. Woodford said. ''I asked him if it would be all right if he gave her his last name. I haven't heard back from him.'' She was dependent on her mother, she said, to look after the baby for the first year. Recently, she enrolled the child in the day care center at West Side High School so that Torrie could be with other children. Ms. Woodford, her brother, her mother and the baby live on her mother's Social Security benefits and Ms. Woodford's welfare payments. ''Everybody wonders what would have happened if I'd done it later,'' Ms. Woodford said. ''Being on public assistance is not the easiest thing - I have to worry where I'm going to get diapers, clothes. It's hard enough living with my mother at my age - at this age there are a lot of things I want to do as a person.'' Ms. Woodford, a gregarious, sometimes boisterous young woman, goes to beauty school at night so ''I can pay for college.'' She talks of going to Howard University in Washington. If she doesn't make it, she will join the military. ''After two years,'' she said, ''they help me pay for college.'' West Side High School students recently appeared in a videotape made by the Board of Education about the difficulties of being a single mother in school. The tape's overriding message: The experience is unglamorous (a shortage of money), tiring (getting up early to feed and dress the baby and then going to school) and often bitter (no father around). Ms. Woodford concurs. ''I like to party, but it would be irresponsible for me to do that,'' she said. ''If at the end of the month I have extra money - which I rarely do - I go out and have a good time and then I come home and carry on being a mother.'' She said warns the girls at West Side to think about the future. ''I tell them they're stupid if they're having sex without birth control,'' she said. ''Most boys say if you love me, you'll have sex. I tell the girls to say: 'If you love me, use a condom.' '' A Boyfriend Becomes 'Disinterested' At Jane Addams, the principal, Mrs. Black, says she often sees pregnant girls or young single mothers who left Roman Catholic schools after becoming pregnant. One such girl, Gisella Vasquez, 18, the mother of a 2-year-old girl, came to the school pregnant and returned to classes when her daughter was 3 weeks old, leaving her with her mother. She has since graduated and is working at the school as a trainee teacher in cosmetology. Ms. Vasquez, shy and soft spoken, had known her boyfriend for a year before she became pregnant. ''I was so dumb,'' she said. ''I didn't know how to get birth control. I thought I would have to tell my mother. I was just taking a risk.'' Soon after her baby was born, her boyfriend ''became disinterested'' and he has not been around since, she said. A lot of the girls at Jane Addams, she said, seem to know about birth control methods but refuse to use them. ''Most of them know but are careless,'' she said. Other girls at Jane Addams and West Side High School offered varied reasons for becoming pregnant. One, Nadine Puerto, a 17-year-old senior at Jane Addams who is eight months pregnant and whose own mother was 17 and single when she was born, said her 23-year-old boyfriend was ''getting old.'' It was thus time for him to be a father, she said she had reasoned. Several girls said they did not like to take birth control pills, because as one explained, ''there are so many diseases coming on, like cancer.'' One 17-year-old girl at West Side, who wanted only to be known as Cheryl - she had named her 3-month-old daughter, Tiffany, after the star in her favorite soap opera - said her 24-year-old boyfriend, already the father of two other children, ''begged'' her to have his child. ''He told me it was a different kind of relationship with me,'' she said. Anyway, she said, by the time she was 16, she ''couldn't wait any longer.'' ''Every time I saw a baby I wanted to hug it or play with it,'' she recalled. ''I took care of my brother when I was 7 years old - I changed his diaper, fed him, everything my mother would but she was at work.'' Her grandmother cares for the baby during the week; Cheryl and her mother take charge on weekends. ''He's paying off the ring and we have those plans,'' she said of her and her boyfriend's decision to be married. At Jane Addams, Mrs. Black said she tried to explain to the girls that having children would keep them in poverty. ''I tell them in a not very subtle way that this is a feminist issue,'' she said, ''that 'This will keep you in economic bondage.' '' Like Edward A. Reynolds, the principal at West Side High School, Mrs. Black advocates clinics in the high schools that offer family planning, along with more intensive and frequent sex education courses containing explicit information about birth control. ''It has to be a course from day one, from kindergarten on all the way through the curriculum,'' she said.

PAPAL JOURNAL; AUSTRALIANS AT 'BARBIE' LIFT THEIR BEER TO JOHN PAUL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/world/papal-journal-australians-at-barbie-lift-their-beer-to-john-paul.html,"Pope John Paul II has been acclaimed in many ways in many places. Today for the first time thousands of beer cans were hoisted high in his honor, though not in his presence. ''Most of us believe that alcohol's a gift from God,'' said the Rev. Anthony Kain, who organized the unusual church-sponsored ''love feast'' at which gallons of beer were downed after a papal mass in Adelaide. ''Of course, this sort of party is in the best Christian tradition,'' said Father Kain, who insisted it was a throwback to the ''agape'' love feasts conducted by early Christians. The whole congregation at mass, officially estimated at 183,000, was invited to the giant ''barbie,'' the traditional Australian Sunday barbecue. About 40,000 people, not including the Pope, turned up on a very hot, sunny afternoon to lunch on grilled chops and sausages. Father Kain and his party produced a lively controversy because the ''pinnies'' provided to the thirsty worshipers were not ordinary beer cans. Beer With Papal Symbol In exchange for helping sponsor the picnic, the South Australia Brewing Company emblazoned 100,000 cans of its West End Export Lager with the official symbol of John Paul's Australian tour, thus creating the first-ever papal beer and a much sought-after collector's item. Justifying the deal, Father Kain argued there was a ''historical link'' because the first Roman Catholic church in Adelaide was in a former brewery. This left his critics unimpressed, particularly those concerned that the church appeared to be condoning consumption of alcohol when alcoholism is a major problem among Australia's 160,000 aborigines. In a televised debate in September, the head of the Aboriginal Affairs Department, Charles Perkins, accused the church of taking ''blood money'' in the deal and asked Father Kain, ''Why don't you get sponsorship from the cocaine and heroin dealers in Australia?'' The Pope was unable to attend Father Kain's barbeque because he had to fly here to Perth on the west coast, where he said mass again and addressed a gathering of the aged on the last full day of his Australian visit. At the mass here, he called abortion an ''unspeakable crime'' and reiterated the church's opposition to contraception and sterilization. Early Monday he is scheduled to begin the trip back to Rome, a voyage that will take 24 hours with a stopover in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean. Once the Pope is gone, Australian church and Government officials will begin some careful accounting to figure out how much the visit cost and, more important, how to pay for it. While the Government has not made the cost public, the church's initial budget called for a cash expenditure of about $3.5 million to be supplemented with $1.3 million worth of donated supplies. No Shortage of Kitsch Two fund-raising campaigns this year failed to meet their goals. So the church hopes to net about $630,000 from licensing contracts with the manufacturers of 110 official souvenirs ranging from teaspoons to big foam-rubber ''hands of hope'' made for waving at the Pope. One of the most popular items has been a T-shirt with the words ''Is the Pope a Catholic'' in bright lettering. The usual question mark was omitted, but a vendor at a mass in Brisbane was sure that ''it says it all.'' With sales down by the end of the trip, the price of the shirt had dropped from $10 to $6.50 as vendors tried to clear their stocks. Glenn Wheatley, a rock concert promoter who had a major role in the papal licensing deals, bristled at the suggestions of excessive commercialism. ''People say Jesus Christ never had sponsorships, but he lived 1,986 years ago,'' he said. ''The Pope rides in a bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz. Who's going to pay for that?'' ''The Holy Father is generating a genuine amount of enthusiasm at the extremes,'' said Ronald Conway, one of Australia's leading Catholic social critics. Older, conservative Catholics are attracted to the Pope's message, while the very young ''get a buzz from John Paul superstar,'' Mr. Conway said in an interview in his Melbourne home. ''The problem lies with the big group in the middle, the people now entering their 40's,'' he said. ''They are a likable, hedonistic lot whom he has done nothing to budge.'' It is that lot Mr. Conway has studied extensively in books like ''The Great Australian Stupor'' and ''The Land of the Long Weekend.'' John Paul made 35 speeches in Australia, and Mr. Conway said the impact had been diluted because ''he said too many things to too many people too briefly.'' ''The ordinary people will be confused and will go back to what they were doing before,'' he said. ''It is sad but true that the fully secularized people are not going to kneel down and repent after watching the Pope on TV.'' During his many hours in flight, John Paul has been reading three books: one in German by a Lutheran on ecumenism and two in Polish titled, ''Theism and Analytical Philosophy'' and ''The Inspired Word.'' Meanwhile, the Vatican Secretary of State, Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, who would have made a very different kind of Pope, was spied reading Frederick Forsythe's ''The Devil's Alternative.'' John Paul almost left Australia without seeing a kangaroo. But after he mentioned this omission on his schedule and after the photographers demanded the encounter, local church officials arranged it quickly. A pen was set up in a small park outside the Adelaide Festival Center, where the Pope addressed a group of farmers today. The handlers were worried because one of the three marsupials seemed spooked and hopped away whenever he was approached. But when the Pope arrived, the kangaroo stood still, posed as if on cue and allowed the Pope a little petting. ''They make their own judgments,'' one of the Pope's aides said. The Pope had already given Australia's koala bears their photo opportunity. In Brisbane on Tuesday, he visited a press center where 200 journalists were busy reporting on the arrest of a man who admitted he wanted to kill the Pope with the gasoline bombs he was carrying. A horde of photographers and television crews formed a long line, and the Pope, holding one of the cuddly bears in his arms, paraded down to the end and then back again. Amid the clicking and flashing there were shouts of ''Down in front!'' and ''Over here, your Holiness!'' Then the Pope made a speech in which he urged the journalists to ''realize your dignity.'' He told them they had a responsibility ''not only to report good deeds but to encourage them.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOW AT 20: REASSESSMENT IN A NEW ERA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/style/now-at-20-reassessment-in-a-new-era.html,"The year was 1966, and the setting was a luncheon for the state commissions on the status of women in Washington. A small group of women attending the event tried to propose a resolution calling for the enforcement of a law prohibiting sex discrimination in employment; they were turned down. One of them, Betty Friedan, scrawled on a paper napkin the words ''National Organization for Women'' and then the notation ''To take actions needed to bring women into the mainstream of American society, now, full equality for women in fully equal partnership with men.'' ''Then we all put in $5 and went home to ask 10 other women to join us,'' Ms. Friedan recalled the other day. Though the moment lacked fanfare, she said, ''we knew that we were doing something historic.'' Tonight the organization, which currently has 150,000 members and 765 chapters, will observe the 20th anniversary of its formation with a celebrity-studded benefit at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The actual anniversary date was Oct. 29, but the commemoration was postponed because of NOW's involvement with the national election campaign, in which it helped defeat referendums against abortion in four states and campaigned for a state equal rights amendment in Vermont that did not pass. As it moves into its third decade, there is no doubt among friends and foes of the organization that it has been a towering presence in the struggle for women's rights and the spearhead for a significant social revolution. It has defined the issues for women since the late 60's, and has battled for solutions on the streets, in the courts, in legislatures, classrooms and corporate offices. Barriers Were Broken Ms. Friedan said: ''NOW went beyond our wildest dreams. Our daughters take it for granted that they will play in the Little League, that they can be astronauts and that they can run for President. It broke through the barriers of explicit sex discrimination.'' Elisabeth Griffith, former Republican co-chairman of the Women's Campaign and former vice chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus, noted: ''In the beginning, there were no other such organizations, so it attracted everybody who was angry. It moved immediately into the vanguard, set a broad agenda for a broad constituency and took on everything related to women, from Playboy bunnies to demands for legislative change.'' But NOW is also considered by knowledgeable observers inside and outside its ranks to be at a critical juncture in its history. Only now is it recovering from the doldrums that followed the failure of the equal rights amendment to gain ratification in 1982, its major priority for years, as well as from a divisive battle last year for the presidency of the organization. No longer does it have one or two single issues around which to galvanize support; no longer is it the only voice demanding equality for women. How broadly - or narrowly - to focus its vision, how best to campaign for its goals, how much to rely on public demonstrations and how much on new approaches are questions that need to be resolved. As Ms. Griffith pointed out: ''Most of the pieces of its original agenda have been taken on by other organizations dealing only with older women, only with day care, with welfare, with pension rights. The assumption about NOW is that it is having difficulty setting priorities, determining which issues to focus on.'' Some observers say that NOW has been so intent on such public issues as abortion rights, job and pay equity and the equal rights amendment, that it has failed to tackle in any comprehensive ways the kinds of problems women grapple with daily as they struggle to support children alone or with insufficient incomes, to have children without jeopardizing their careers, or to juggle needs of spouse, children and community with little if any help from government or employers. Some say it has not sufficiently addressed the particular concerns of minority women, or, in fact, attracted them in significant numbers. 'An Activist Agenda' As Ruth B. Mandel, director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University, put it, ''The biggest challenge NOW must confront is, 'Who is the American woman of the 1980's and who is it that we are trying to represent?' We must rediscover her greatest needs and how to turn those needs into an activist agenda.'' To those who contend that NOW has relegated family and child welfare issues to the back burner, Eleanor Smeal, its controversial and outspoken president, said in a recent interview from Los Angeles where she was preparing for the anniversary celebration: ''We have always been involved in the full range of child care and family issues, in pregnancy leave issues, in employment issues for lower-income women. To say that we have not always done so distorts the truth: child care was in fact a part of our 1967 bill of rights.'' For NOW to engage the next generation of leaders and activists -women now in their 20's and 30's -feeling is strong that it will certainly have to give these concerns a significant place on its agenda. However, it is not clear how many young women the organization is currently recruiting, for no statistics on the ages of members are kept, a spokesman said. In the view of Lynn Hecht Schafran, director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund's judicial education project, the successes achieved by NOW and other organizations have made it inevitable that young women would be less involved. ''Many people are dismayed by the fact that there are not more young women involved in clearly feminist activities,'' Ms. Schafran said. ''But they don't need to be: they are getting the education they want, the initial jobs they want in their chosen professions at excellent salaries. That is why we don't sense a burning need in young people.'' At the lower end of the employment ladder, Ms. Schafran said, ''Women in low-income jobs, those struggling to raise children alone or on meager incomes, are also absent from the movement. ''It has never occurred to me to become a member,'' said Wanda Lucibello, 30 years old, an assistant district attorney in the Brooklyn District Attorney's office. ''I feel a certain sense of personal accomplishment and satisfaction with my own position and with my own ways of dealing with feminist issues, which don't seem to be as much of a problem as they used to be. As an organization, it doesn't seem to have relevancy to my life in particular. Women now in their 20's and 30's feel they have gotten access to jobs and equal pay, though of course, the cause is not over, nor is the fight.'' According to Ms. Smeal, young women are not apathetic to the cause, and in fact, of the estimated 120,000 participants in a NOW march for abortion rights in Washington early this year, about one-third were college students. NOW is conducting campaigns on 450 campuses to increase participation. In the political sphere, NOW must determine whether it intends to fit into or challenge the existing party system. In its 20-year life span, the organization has become an increasingly influential political force, and its lobbyists and 77 political action committees are taken seriously by members of Congress, state legislators and other government officials, as well as by candidates for office at all levels. Asked to assess NOW's influence, Ann Lewis, former political director for the Democratic National Comittee and presently national director of Americans for Democratic Action, said, ''If I were running an issue referendum anywhere in the country, I would try hard to get NOW's support because it translates into real volunteers and real commitment.'' However, because of the organization's tendency often, though not always, to endorse Democratic candidates and policies, some observers view it as an arm of the Democratic Party. Ruth Mandel explained, ''The most visible and controversial example was the 1984 Presidential campaign, which raised the question of whether NOW had become identified with one political party.'' Ms. Smeal disputed the conclusion that NOW had cast its political lot with the Democratic Party. ''Neither party has ever given us high enough priority,'' she said, enumerating what she views as obstacles set up by both parties to keep women from running for office or from winning when they do run. ''We are upset with both parties,'' she continued, ''and often when I speak, people come up and quietly ask me 'Could we ever pull off our own political party?' That has increasingly become a strong undercurrent. I do not say that I am for it, but if I don't give voice to this feeling for a massive change in the rules and for a viable poltiical force, who will?'' Even hints of such a prospect are already arousing debate in the inner circles of NOW. But meanwhile, Ms. Smeal, who made an unprecedented return to the presidency of NOW after challenging her own handpicked successor, Judy Goldsmith, and who said she intended to run again next summer, is generating internal controversy through efforts to bolster membership and lower the organization's debt, now $1.5 million, through direct mail campaigns. As Noreen Connell, president of NOW New York State, which represents 34 chapters, put it: ''This is a period when not much is happening politically for women on a national level, so it is a good time for us to think things through, then fight them out.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vendors: Good, Bad and Good-Bad",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/opinion/vendors-good-bad-and-good-bad.html,"The most contentious issue in New York City is probably not capital punishment or abortion but street vendors. On this issue, however, given a little patience, it's possible to achieve reasonable remedies because it's possible to distinguish among vendors. There are good vendors and bad vendors, even good-bad vendors. But so far, the City Council and City Hall refuse to make and enforce the distinctions. What are they afraid of? Merchandise peddlers are, for the most part, bad vendors. If confined to flea markets or traditional areas set aside for them, like Columbus Avenue on summer nights, they need not be bad. But few peddlers are so disciplined. Look down Fifth Avenue or even less soigne shopping streets and you see an array of cut-rate scarves, watches, umbrellas, gloves sold from blankets and cardboard boxes that clutter sidewalks already dense with shoppers. Such peddlers, interfering with traffic and blocking doorways to established stores, perform no more service than parasites. City Hall already has, but hardly uses, the power to limit their expropriation of public space for private gain. A new city law might make regulation easier, but the Council will not pass one until Mayor Koch shows he's strong enough to try running peddlers off with existing law. Food vendors are, for the most part, good vendors. A reasonable number of them belong in midtown. They offer inexpensive fast food to those who prefer the economy and speed of hot dogs and falafel. High rents have forced out most moderate-priced restaurants. Food vendors cause trouble, though, when there are too many of them blocking movement on streets with heavy lunchtime pedestrian traffic. A proposed new law would restrict each intersection to two food vendors, at fixed locations. That solution creates its own problem: Which food vendors get the choicest locations? The proposal calls for a lottery; why not an auction? But that's a detail; the whole proposal lingers in a catatonic trance before the City Council. Council members are still annoyed by the Mayor's behavior last year. First he asked the Council to enact a food-vendor bill; then, when he felt heat after the Council did that, he vetoed the measure. Members are reluctant to walk the plank again. Hence the remedy for bad vendors and good-bad vendors depends on Mayor Koch. As for the food vendors, let him persuasively swear support for the measure pending in the City Council and reclaim the advocacy of willing members. As for illegal sidewalk peddlers, let the police remove them and confiscate their property. Those merchandise peddlers are not poor-but-honest craftsmen selling artifacts because stodgy stores will not carry them. They are part of a cynical rent-free retailing network, supplied by truck. Providing a common open space in which small tradesmen offer their wares is entirely practical, as is proved by the city's public markets, green markets and flea markets. Other cities - Paris, for instance - have stimulated such facilities, gaining worldwide fame. But few cities permit non-tax-paying tradesmen to set up shop in front of world-class shops and milk the crowds attracted by renowned traditional merchants. Let City Hall block the peddlers before they block everyone else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LIFE IN THE 30'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/03/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,"SEVERAL years ago I spent the day at a family planning clinic in one of New York City's poorest neighborhoods. I sat around a Formica table with a half-dozen 16-year-old girls and listened with some amazement as they showed off their knowledge of human sexuality. They knew how long sperm lived inside the body, how many women out of 100 using a diaphragm were statistically likely to get pregnant and the medical term for the mouth of the cervix. One girl pointed out all the parts of the female reproductive system on a placard; another recited the stages of the ovulation cycle from day 1 to day 28. There was just one problem with this performance: although the results of their laboratory tests would not be available for 15 minutes more, every last one of them was pregnant. I always think of that day when someone suggests that sex education at school is a big part of the answer to the problem of teen-age pregnancy. I happen to be a proponent of such programs; I think human sexuality is a subject for dispassionate study, like civics and ethics and dozens of other topics that have a moral component. I'd like my sons to know as much as possible about how someone gets pregnant, how pregnancy can be avoided and what it means when avoidance techniques have failed. I remember adolescence about as vividly as I remember anything, however, and I am not in the least convinced that that information alone will significantly alter the rate of teen-age pregnancy. It seemed to me that day in the clinic, and on days I spent at schools and on street corners, that teen-age pregnancy has a lot more to do with what it means to be a teen-ager than with how someone gets pregnant. When I was in high school, at the tail end of the 60's, there was a straightforward line on sex among my friends. Boys could have it; girls couldn't. A girl who was not a virgin pretended she was. A girl who was sleeping with her boyfriend, no matter how long-playing the relationship, pretended she was not. It is the nature of adolescence that there is no past and no future, only the present, burning as fierce, bright and merciless as a bare light bulb. Girls had sex with boys because nothing seemed to matter except right now, not pregnancy, not parental disapprobation, nothing but those minutes, this dance, that face, those words. Most of them knew that pregnancy could result, but they assured themselves that they would be the lucky ones who would not get caught. Naturally, some of them were wrong, and in my experience they did one of three things: they went to Puerto Rico for a mysterious weekend trip; visited an aunt in some faraway state for three months and came back with empty eyes and a vague reputation, or got married, quickly, in Empire-waist dresses. What seems to have changed most since then is that there is little philosophical counterpoint, hypocritical or not, to the raging hormones of adolescence, and that so many of the once-hidden pregnancies are hidden no more. Not long after the day at the family planning clinic, I went to a public high school in the suburbs. In the girl's room was this graffito: Jennifer Is a Virgin. I asked the kids about it and they said it was shorthand for geek, nerd, weirdo, somebody who was so incredibly out of it that they were in high school and still hadn't had sex. If you were a virgin, they told me, you just lied about it so that no one would think you were that immature. The girls in the family planning clinic told me much the same thing - that everyone did it, that the boys wanted it, that not doing it made them seem out of it. The only difference, really, was that the girls in the clinic were poor and would have their babies, and the girls in the high school were well-to-do and would have abortions. Pleasure didn't seem to have very much to do with sex for either group. After she learned she was pregnant, one of the girls at the clinic said, without a trace of irony, that she hoped childbirth didn't hurt as much as sex had. Birth control was easily disposed of in both cases. The pill, the youngsters said, could give you a stroke; the IUD could make you sterile. A diaphragm was disgusting. One girl told me the funniest thing her boyfriend - a real original thinker - had told her: they couldn't use condoms because it was like taking a shower with a raincoat on. She was a smart girl, and pretty, and I wanted to tell her that it sounded as if she was sleeping with a jerk who didn't deserve her. But that is the kind of basic fact of life that must be taught not in the classroom, not by a stranger, but at home by the family. This is what, finally, I will try to teach my sons about sex, after I've explained fertile periods and birth control and all the other mechanics that are important to understand but never really go to the heart of the matter: I believe I will say that when you sleep with someone you take off a lot more than your clothes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CATHOLICS MAY CUT CITY FOSTER CARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/nyregion/catholics-may-cut-city-foster-care.html,"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has warned the Koch administration that because of a recent court agreement, it is giving serious consideration to discontinuing the foster care it now provides to more than 3,000 city youngsters. The archdiocese's opposition is not limited to one issue, but it centers on the court requirement that foster children have ''meaningful access'' to family-planning information, services and counseling. Under existing state and Federal laws and regulations, teen-agers receiving public assistance - which includes all children in foster care - cannot be deprived of contraception and abortion services. Meeting at City Hall Msgr. James J. Murray of Catholic Charities, the service arm of the archdiocese, told the city's First Deputy Mayor, Stanley Brezenoff, about the archdiocese's concerns at a City Hall meeting last week. According to city officials and religious agencies, he explained that barring a compromise, the archdiocese planned to phase out the foster care it provides to up to 3,200 children in group homes. It would do so in the spring by not renewing city contracts that are to lapse June 30. If the archdiocese does that, it could lose between $50 million and $60 million a year in Federal, state and city funds, and the city would either have to turn to other agencies or provide the foster care directly. Mr. Brezenoff has already asked officials in the city's Office of Special Services for Children to come up with contingency plans. Since the City Hall meeting on Nov. 25, Mr. Brezenoff and Mayor Koch have been trying to find a way to keep the archdiocese's services. But administration officials and a lawyer for the organization that brought the original lawsuit say it will be difficult to reach a compromise. ''There is no way out of it,'' said Marcia Robinson Lowry, director of the Children's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit that led to the court agreement. ''Services are either going to be provided or not. I don't think the city can go any further than it has.'' Ms. Lowry argued that in a sense the stipulation was already a compromise because it did not require Catholic agencies to provide any teachings they found morally offensive. Instead, the agreement says outside agencies can provide the family-planning counseling to children under the care of religious agencies. So sensitive is the situation now that no member of the administration or official of the archdiocese will discuss it on the record. The Mayor, eager to keep the church's service and to avoid a confrontation with John Cardinal O'Connor, issued a statement through his press office. ''It is, of course, our hope that ways can be found where we can carry out our obligations under state and Federal law and the Constitution, and they can carry out their mission under God's law because that result is in the best interest of the children whom we both serve,'' the statement said. Decision 'Under Review' A spokesman for the archdiocese, Msgr. Peter Finn, said: ''The court decision is under review. Eventually there is something to be said. But now there is nothing to be said.'' Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, vicar general of the archdiocese and deputy to the Cardinal, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. About 4,000 of the city's 17,000 foster children are in Catholic agencies that come under the auspices of the New York Archdiocese, and about 60 percent of the 4,000 are cared for in group homes. The rest are living with foster parents. The archdiocese has no plans to stop placing children in individual homes, just in group homes. The court stipulation, issued Oct. 8, settled a 13-year-old lawsuit that challenged the city's method of placing foster-care children in foster agencies. In the past, Catholic children were placed with Catholic agencies, Jewish children with Jewish agencies, and so on. The suit charged that black children who are Protestant were suffering discrimination. Under the settlement, to be made final by the end of this month, the city has agreed to place children in foster-care agencies without regard to race or religion. So, under the settlement, Protestant children will be placed with Catholic agencies, Catholc children with Jewish agencies and so on. Main Tenet of Stipulation The main tenet of the stipulation, approved by Judge Robert J. Ward of Federal District Court in Manhattan, is that foster-care agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on children in their care. The agreement specifies that all children in foster care must have ''meaningful access to the full range of family-planning information, services and counseling.'' Among the other matters covered in the agreement are that each agency has to ''provide comparable opportunities'' for children to practice their religion, that the agencies cannot require children to attend religious observances and that the agencies cannot display ''excessive religious symbols.'' Objections to Agreement Officials of the New York Archdiocese have indicated their general objections to the agreement, as have other religious foster-care agencies. Some mayoral advisers said yesterday that officials of the archdiocese were frustrated by what they viewed as interference in the church's ability to run its agencies as it sees fit. So far, other religious foster-care agencies have not indicated how they will deal with the stipulation. Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for the Diocese of Brooklyn, which is independent of the New York Archdiocese, said he was unaware of any decision about the stipulation. Jerome M. Goldsmith, executive vice president of the Jewish Board of Family and Children Services, called the agreement ''highly unsatisfactory'' but said his organization, which runs several foster-care institutions, had not yet decided how to proceed. This is not the first time the Koch administration has come up against the church-state issue. Cardinal O'Connor has in the past objected to a mayoral executive order banning job discrimination against homosexuals, arguing that the church did not discriminate but that it had a right to hire and fire as it saw fit. Last May, in a lawsuit now pending, a former employee of a Catholic foster-care agency affiliated with the New York Archdiocese charged that she was dismissed from her job because she refused to prevent teen-agers from using birth control. The former employee, Diane Arneth, contends that the agency - the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin on Staten Island - violates the same state and Federal laws incorporated in the new court stipulation. The new stipulation will be made final by the end of the month. The agencies have the option, according to several lawyers, of fighting it in court, withdrawing their services or accepting the agreement and abiding by it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHOOSE TRUE FEDREALISM OR A TYRANNY OF CLERKS; Court's Contribution,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/opinion/l-choose-true-fedrealism-or-a-tyranny-of-clerks-court-s-contribution-586286.html,"To the Editor: The Reagan Administration study titled ''The Status of Federalism in America'' (front page, Nov. 9) condemns the Supreme Court for allowing Congress to ''undermine the sovereign decision-making authority of the states'' and for acquiescing in the improper expansion of a ''virtually omnipotent national government.'' You correctly note that the Administration has followed a double standard on this - pushing for national power on some issues (e.g. nuclear energy and products liability) and for state power on others (e.g. abortion). I would like to point out that the Administration's study also fails to mention a major contribution the Supreme Court made to the viability of American federalism nearly half a century ago. In 1938, when our constitutional law was going through a cosmic transformation on economic issues, the Court made one of its most momentous decisions, a decision familiar to thousands of lawyers and first-year law students, but virtually unknown outside legal circles. In Erie v. Tompkins, the Supreme Court overturned a century of jurisprudence. Harry Tompkins, a citizen of Pennsylvania, had brought a negligence action against the Erie Railroad, a New York corporation, for injuries he received from a passing train while he was walking alongside the tracks in Hughestown, Pa. The Court decided that in lawsuits brought in the Federal courts involving parties from different states (diversity of citizenship cases), a Federal District Court was bound to follow the law of the state in which it sat. Since under Pennsylvania law, Tompkins was viewed as a trespasser, he lost his suit against the Erie Railroad as a result of the court's decision. The opinion in Erie v. Tompkins was written by Associate Justice Louis D. Brandeis, one of the great liberals of the 20th century. In Erie, the Court overruled an 1842 decision (Swift v. Tyson), which had held that there was a general (Federal) common law separate and apart from the common law of the states. The evil that Swift v. Tyson had led to over the years was the growth of a dual set of laws in every state - one body of laws enforceable in the state courts and another body of laws enforceable in the Federal courts in that same state - an anomaly that encouraged what lawyers call ''forum shopping.'' Since 1938, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed its allegiance to ''Erie Doctrine'' and its continuing fear of what a Federal judge in Massachusetts once called ''the ghost of Swift v. Tyson.'' Erie v. Tompkins is a technical decision lacking the social drama of Brown v. Board of Education (school desegregation) the moral tension of Roe v. Wade (abortion) or the ideological energy of Miranda v. Arizona (rights of the accused). Yet, on the issue of American federalism there is no decision more important than Erie, a decision that has been supported by both ''liberals'' and ''conservatives'' on the Supreme Court since 1938. Erie v. Tompkins continues to affect our law and our Federal system in the most fundamental way. The Reagan Administration's failure to take note of it provides yet another example of its tendentious use of historical facts to suit partisan political purposes.

PACT TO CURB FOSTER CARE UPSETS KOCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/05/nyregion/pact-to-curb-foster-care-upsets-koch.html,"Mayor Koch yesterday took issue with a court stipulation on foster care - an agreement that his administration has already accepted. The same court agreement is so strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York that church officials have threatened to discontinue some of the foster care that Catholic agencies currently provide rather than comply with it. The stipulation states that agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on children in their care, and lays out a number of regulations - among them that they must give foster children access to family-planning information, services and counseling. Over all, the agreement states that religious agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on children in their care. Koch Says Stipulation Is 'Bad' Calling the stipulation ''bad,'' the Mayor said the city had agreed to it because the alternative, a court fight, would probably have been worse and have led to a ban on religious agencies' providing any publicly financed foster care. But Mr. Koch said he understood the archdiocese's position and was sympathetic to it. ''They see a movement where they are helping, that they are required to be totally secular, that everything that they do is attacked as wrong because it has a religious element in it,'' the Mayor said at a City Hall news conference. ''I don't agree with those people who want to take the religious element out of these agencies that are providing services.'' The director of the Children's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, Marcia Robinson Lowry, called the Mayor's remarks ''offensive.'' ''These agencies have children of other religions in them,'' she said. ''If people are concerned about religion, they ought to be concerned about everybody's right to pracice their own religion and not have religion imposed on them. You're talking about the things that made people leave England and come to this country.'' The city's Corporation Counsel, Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., yesterday defended the court stipulation, which he helped negotiate. City Lawyer Calls Pact Fair He said, ''We believed it was the best way to comply with our obligations under the Constitution and under the law, that it was fair, and that failing to make an agreement of this sort, a court would have held that it was not lawful to do business with religious agencies, he said.'' Asked if he considered it a bad agreement, Mr. Schwarz said: ''No. I believe it was a legal necessity, but I would not have entered into it if I did not believe it was fair.'' The Mayor insisted that he and Mr. Schwarz, the city's top lawyer, did not disagree. The court stipulation, issued Oct. 8, settled a 13-year-old lawsuit which asseted that Protestant black children were suffering discrimination because the city placed children in foster-care agencies based on their religious beliefs. 'Excessive Religious Symbols' Under the stipulation, children will no longer be placed automatically in foster-care agencies based on their religion. In addition to the requirements for family-planning information, the agencies cannot display ''excessive religious symbols,'' and cannot require children to attend religious services. The archdiocese is most concerned about the family-planning requirement, because it means children receiving publicly-financed foster care cannot be deprived of contraceptives and abortion services. The archdiocese - which cares for about 4,000 foster-care children in the city, 2,400 of them in group homes -has told the administration it is seriously considering phasing out its group care. The city would then have to find alternative services for 2,400 children, and the church would lose $50 million to $60 million a year in Federal, state and city funds. Some social advocates said they did not believe the threat was real. They said yesterday that officials of the archdiocese might be using this opportunity to put pressure on the city at a time when the number of foster children is growing and the city needs its help. Mayor Koch disagreed, pointing out that the archdiocese contributes $30 million a year to foster care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WASHINGTON TALK: CONGRESS; Positions of the Probable Speaker Can Be Volatile,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/us/washington-talk-congress-positions-of-the-probable-speaker-can-be-volatile.html,"Representative Jim Wright of Texas, who is expected to become Speaker of the House when Congress convenes in January, has the reputation of a moderate conservative and his voting record over his 22 years in the House generally reflects this bent. But on a number of issues he has changed his position through his career, displaying a certain volitility. He has switched on civil rights, the MX missile, abortion, nerve gas and military spending. The changes indicate it could be difficult to predict how Mr. Wright as Speaker will act on some issues. The Speaker usually does not vote, but his role in controlling the flow of legislation can have a vast influence on the outcome in the House. Mr. Wright's voting ratings by various groups also reflect his volitility. In 1968, Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal organization, reported that he sided with it on key issues 25 percent of the time. That figure fell to 19 percent in 1972, rose to 70 percent in 1983 and then dropped back to 50 percent in 1985. Mr. Wright has fallen from favor with the conservative American Security Council, which is concerned with military issues. He won a 100 percent rating in 1972 and 1974 and an 89 percent rating in 1982. But in 1984 he fell to 40 percent and this year to 13 percent. Here is a summary of his votes on some important issues: Civil Rights Mr. Wright at first voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 when it was approved in the House but then voted for the conference committee's final bill, which went to the President. The act, the first civil rights law enacted by Congress since 1875, created a commission on civil rights and allowed the Attorney General to seek injunctions to keep people from being deprived of their right to vote. He also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed the appointment of voting referees to help blacks register and vote. But he voted against the far-reaching Civil Rights Act of 1964, a vote he recently said he now regrets. That bill guaranted access to public accommodations and allowed the Government to sue to desegregate public facilities and schools. The next year he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1965, which suspended the use of literacy tests and banned poll taxes. And in 1968 he voted for final passage of open housing legislation, although he had voted no on the procedural motion that opened the way to the final vote. In 1984, he supported legislation to overturn a Supreme Court decision that significantly narrowed the scope of Federal antidiscrimination laws. Military He has switched on the military budget, where he has supported deep cuts in the President's request in the 1986 and 1987 budget. But in 1972 he oppsed a 5 percent cut in the military budget and in 1976 he voted against a $2 billion cut across the board. He has switched his position on both the MX intercontinental missile and the B-1 bomber. He supported the MX in 1981 but then in 1982, 1983 and 1985 opposed it. In 1978, Mr. Wright supported President Carter's effort to kill the B-1 bomber. But in 1981 he opposed the deletion of funds for the bomber Mr. Reagan requested. Budget He has generally been a spender when it comes to domestic programs, in recent years leading the Democratic effort to restore money for programs cut by Mr. Reagan. In 1978 he opposed one of the House's first successful efforts to cut spending across the board. He voted against Mr. Reagan's major budget-cutting package in 1981 and earlier supported the beginning of many of President Johnson's Great Society programs, including the Economic Opportunity Act and Medicare. But he did vote against the Urban Mass Transportation Act in 1964, which set up the first matching grants to local governments for mass transit. On chemical weapons, he voted for production of a new nerve gas in 1982 and 1983. But in 1984 he opposed the production and then in 1985 backed nerve gas production the first year the House approved it. This year he flipped again, voting against production, as the House opposed it, 210 to 209. He voted this year to cut the President's budget for the space-based missile shield but supported tests in space for the antisatellite missile. Social Issues On abortion, he has generally voted for bans on the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. However, he has switched, voting against a restriction on using Federal employees' health insurance benefits for abortions in 1983 and voting in favor it in 1984. He voted for the first Medicaid abortion ban approved in 1976 but also supported efforts in the next year to expand exceptions under the law. On school prayer, Mr. Wright supported the conservatives in 1984, who proposed cutting off Federal funds for schools and school districts that had policies against officially sponsored prayer periods. He also supported proposals for silent prayer. In 1984 he backed a bill, finally enacted, allowing religious student groups to meet in public schools in hours outside of classes. On tuition tax credits, Mr. Wright has opposed credits for the payment of tuition for private elementary and secondary schools. Taxes His record is back and forth, but he has recently opposed tax cuts and supported tax increases. He opposed the tax law enacted this year, saying it it did not raise revenue to reduce the deficit. He voted against President Reagan's 1981 tax cut, which reduced tax rates by 25 percent over three years. Much earlier in his career he was one of only 29 Democrats who voted against the Kennedy tax cut in 1963, which lowered the top individual tax rate from 91 percent to 70 percent and the top corporate rate from 52 percent to 48 percent. He supported two of President Carter's tax cuts, which were desigend to stimulate a sagging economy. He also voted for the two major tax increases during the Reagan Administration, the first in 1982 and the second in 1984. Environment and Public Works He voted to bar the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing sanctions on communities that missed a deadline of Dec. 31, 1982, for meeting clean air standards. As a long-time member of the House Public Works Committee, he has been a strong supporter of pork barrel projects. He opposed the opening up of the highway trust fund for use for mass tansit. He voted to continue paying for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor and the Tennesse Tombigbee Waterway, two of the major symbols of expensive and uneeded projects. He opposed President Carter's veto of a major water projects bill in 1978. Energy He has supported the deregulation of gas and oil prices, as favored by the industry. But he supported President Carter's energy package in 1977, including the careful compromise on natural gas regulation and the tax on domestically produced crude oil. He also stuck with the Democratic leadership and a few Democrats in supporting gasoline tax increases, which were soundly defeated. In 1979, he supported the decontrol of oil prices and the windfall profits tax, which was seen by some oil-state legislators as the price for decontrol. Miscellaneous Gun control: He supported the 1968 Gun Control Act and opposed its weakening this year. Trade: Has supported trade legislation, including the bill for domestic auto content in 1982. Nicaragua: He voted to terminate covert aid to the rebels fighting the government in Nicaragua and has voted against aid to the rebels. Foreign aid: He has supported foreign aid in general and has also voted against several efforts to prohibit either aid, loans or loan guarantees for Communist countries. He opposed the sale of radar planes to Saudi Arabia. He supported the equal rights amendment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHURCH DIRECTIVE ON SPEAKERS IS QUESTIONED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/nyregion/church-directive-on-speakers-is-questioned.html,"A prominent monsignor in the Archdiocese of New York has written an article in an influential Roman Catholic magazine that strongly questions the archdiocese's policy of discouraging speaking engagements by people who differ with church teachings.

Byrne, who was a chancellor of the archdiocese from 1968 to 1970 under Terence Cardinal Cooke and is now the pastor of Epiphany Church at 239 East 21st Street, warned that the policy could revive the belief that Catholic politicians cannot be trusted to remain independent from their church. The monsignor said that before the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy as the nation's first Catholic President, many Americans believed that the church would pressure Catholic politicians to enact Catholic positions into civil law. ''For churchmen to cross the line between, on the one hand, instructing and informing conscience and, on the other hand, trying to force a legislative position on an officeholder by a speaker's ban is a very dangerous political game,'' Monsignor Byrne wrote. ''It can result in the nonelectability of Catholics.'' Monsignor Byrne said he believes his stance represents the views of a segment of the archdiocese's about 800 priests, although he could not say how large of a segment. Archdiocese's Directive Challenged The monsignor's article, ''Thou Shall Not Speak,'' was the cover story of the Dec. 6 issue of America, the Jesuit magazine. It challenges a directive that was issued Aug. 18 by Bishop Joseph T. O'Keefe, the archdiocese's vicar general. The directive was criticized by Governor Cuomo, who became embroiled in a public argument with archdiocesan officials. Governor Cuomo, a Catholic who is personally opposed to abortion, has supported Medicaid funding for abortions so that poor women would not be discriminated against in obtaining a widely available medical procedure. The Church has opposed such funding. The O'Keefe directive, sent to the archdiocese's priests, said: ''Great care and prudence must be exercised in extending invitations to individuals to speak at parish sponsored events, e.g., Communion breakfasts, graduations, meetings of parish societies, etc. It is not only inappropriate, it is unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite those individuals to speak at such events whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear, unambiguous teaching of the Church.'' Responding to Monsignor Byrne's position, Bishop O'Keefe said that he had not read the article. He said, in an interview, that he had never banned anybody and had urged only that ''care and prudence must be exercised for a speaker, which is a pretty logical position.'' Catholic politicians, he said, were ''not beholden to the Church any more than a Jewish candidate is to a rabbi. This is the United States of America.'' Bishop O'Keefe and Monsignor Byrne are friends, and, according to Monsignor Byrne, they talked about the issue before the article was written. Monsignor Byrne said he had also discussed the issue with John Cardinal O'Connor, who has endorsed the directive. ''I don't think there will be any repercussions,'' the 65-year-old monsignor said yesterday. ''I didn't do it to polarize. It's a discussion in the family. I think in a family you can have differences on various items and these differences become subject to discussion and study.'' In the four and a half page article, the monsignor, who as one of two chancellors was the archdiocese's supervisor of housing, job and racial justice projects, argued that the directive raised many questions about how it might work. For example, he wrote, it was not clear whether the directive could apply to non-Catholics, such as Mayor Koch, who differs with church policy on the rights of homosexuals, or to a Unitarian minister who rejects Catholic concepts about the Trinity but wants to speak to a Catholic audience only about housing problems. Partial 'Excommunication' In light of such ambiguities, Monsignor Byrne suggested, it appeared that the archdiocesan policy had been aimed only at Catholic politicians. Thus, the impression has been created that Catholic politicians are expected to ''enunciate and vote'' Catholic positions and ''failure to do so is followed by ecclesiastical punishment.'' A ban on speaking, Monsignor Byrne said in the article, was a ''sort of partial excommunication'' that violated the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom. That declaration said ''no one is to be forced to act against his conscience, nor kept from acting according to his conscience privately or publicly.'' Monsignor Byrne, in the interview, said he opposed Mr. Cuomo's position on Medicaid funding for abortion, but felt that he should nonetheless be permitted to speak to church audiences. He also noted that in its effort to put pressure on politicians the Catholic church was no different from fundamentalist Protestant or Jewish groups. When pro-Israel legislation is at stake, he said, Jewish leaders place ''the same kind of pressure on the conscience of legislators.'' Bishop O'Keefe has said he would not invite Governor Cuomo to speak at his parish. One politician, State Assemblyman John Dearie of the Bronx, has been told by his parish, St. Raymond, that he would not be allowed to speak at parish events, although that ban took effect before the issuance of the directive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADOPTION ALSO A CHOICE IN TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/opinion/adoption-also-a-choice-in-teen-age-pregnancy.html,"To the Editor: We were pleased to see Planned Parenthood's full-page ad Nov. 18 because we agree that the crisis of teen-age pregnancy requires national leaders to take considered action. Unfortunately, the first paragraph limited the discussion to deciding ''between abortions or dropping out of school, leaving home or becoming dependent on welfare,'' and overlooked the adoption decision. Adoption can hardly be a decision teen-agers consider if society - and molders of public opinion like Planned Parenthood - do not recognize it. A million teen-agers pregnant out of wedlock are a national crisis, and we need to focus on the problems related to that crisis. But let's also keep in mind some of the solutions, especially adoption, if we're really serious about a balanced debate and informed choice. WILLIAM L. PIERCE President, Natl.

"SINGAPORE DECIDES IT WANTS LOTS OF CHILDREN, AFTER ALL",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/weekinreview/singapore-decides-it-wants-lots-of-children-after-all.html,"LIKE many developing countries, Singapore in the early 1970's instituted population control. ''Boy or girl, two is enough!'' was the slogan, and officials warned that the island country would run out of room if population growth was not curbed. Now they say the policy may have succeeded too well. Singapore has become one of the first countries outside the industrialized world whose birth rate has declined below replacement levels. In reaction to that development, it appears to be the first to switch from officially discouraging large families to actively promoting them. ''People may laugh and say, 'Ha, ha, look at what Singapore is doing now,' '' said Yeo Cheow Tung, Minister of State for Health, ''but when we look at the data, it's a horrendous problem. And it's the role of a responsible government to plan for the future.'' The little city-state of 2.5 million people is often admired - or ridiculed - because of the extent to which it tries to plan ahead. In many respects, it has been wildly successful: An island with no natural resources has in one generation become wealthier, as measured by per capita income, than Ireland, Spain or Israel. Visitors sometimes complain, however, that Singaporeans are too docile and obedient to the wishes of the Government. The campaign to increase the birth rate is likely to provide a new test of their obedience. Young people seem less inclined than their parents to bend their personal lives to Government decree. ''Whether I have two kids or three kids doesn't depend on what the Government says,'' said Cora De Conceicao, a restaurateur who is engaged to be married soon. ''It depends on whether I can continue with my career. That is the general consensus of couples nowadays.'' Another young woman, a civil servant, was even more blunt: ''Having babies is a nuisance,'' she said. ''You want to buy a new pair of shoes or a new gown, and instead you have to save money for a child.'' Reflecting such attitudes, the reproduction rate has plunged. In 1957, women had an average of 6.4 children; in 1970, 3.1, and last year, just 1.6 - well under the 2-plus rate necessary to keep the population stable. The country is still growing because most people are young and in their reproductive years. But at present rates, the population will reach a peak early in the next century, then shrink rapidly as the young people of today die, leaving fewer descendants. The Government of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew warns that this would hamper the country's defenses. Moreover, a much smaller number of wage-earners would be available to support those who have retired. A Role for Matchmakers The campaign does not mention it, but fertility levels differ by ethnic group. The reproductive rate of the dominant Chinese, 77 percent of the population, is well below replacement level. Indians, a 6 percent minority, are slightly below replacement level, and Malays, who account for 15 percent of the population, are a bit above it. The present trend, if continued, would reduce Chinese dominance and increase the proportion of Malays. Mr. Yeo, who, like most officials, is Chinese, acknowledged the ethnic factor but said this was of secondary importance. All families, not just ethnic Chinese, are being encouraged to have more children, he said. The campaign involves several approaches. It is playing a well-publicized role as matchmaker for high school and college graduates. Matchmaking agencies run parties, dances and weekend retreats in the hope of finding spouses for the large number of college-educated women who remain unmarried, a higher proportion than in the United States, officials say. Economic incentives also may be tried. The tax system was amended in the 1970's to discourage large families, abortion was legalized and contraceptives made available. Now tax penalties will probably be removed and abortion may be curtailed. And Government housing can be arranged so that parents can live near their adult children, making it easier for grandparents to care for infants during the day. Singapore and similar rapidly developing countries face some of the same economic problems as the United States, where fertility is below replacement levels but high immigration keeps the population rising. Taiwan, South Korea and other rapidly industrializing countries may also have to encourage population growth. Fertility rates in Singapore sank below the replacement level in 1975, although this attracted little attention at first. In Taiwan, the rates fell to replacement level this year and South Korea is about to be in the same position. Singapore officials cite surveys suggesting that women still would like to have two or three children, if it were not for the inconvenience and the effect on their careers. The Government hopes that, by reducing these obstacles, Singapore's efforts will succeed where Western countries have failed. ''If we can reverse the fertility decline,'' said Paul Cheung, a demographer at the National University of Singapore, ''we'll be the first country to do so.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Men and Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/magazine/l-men-and-abortion-714986.html,"Michael Blumenthal's article comes closer to explicit details of abortion than anything I have seen. If pornography in all forms can be tolerated, then more accurate descriptions of the emotional and physical aspects of abortion should be available to influence teen-age (and adult) attitudes toward promiscuous sex. ERNEST ULMER New York City",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MEN And Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/magazine/l-men-and-abortion-748286.html,"In his article ''The Clinic'' (About Men, Nov. 2), what is it that Michael Blumenthal refers to when he says he is ''learning . . . something of what it means to be a man''? Is it learning to feel one's age? Is it realizing regrets about one's own life? Or perhaps it is frustration at being placed at the periphery of difficult personal decisions of others we may care about. If these are the things the author has learned, they are not part ''of what it means to be a man,'' but, rather, part of what it means to be alive. By taking his feelings of frustration, distance and regret and attaching them to the process of becoming a man, the author places manhood and abortion in a conflict that, as a man, I find inaccurate and dangerous. The issues Mr. Blumenthal discusses are real and important, but they should not be resolved or defined through a woman's procreative choice. The ''friend'' who needs an abortion does not need the additional burden of the author's hopes and regrets.

IDEAS & TRENDS; Catholics May Curtail Child Care,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/weekinreview/ideas-trends-catholics-may-curtail-child-care.html,"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which has often clashed with the city over issues of doctrine and legality, may cut back its foster care services rather than comply with a court order requiring, among other things, that children be given ''meaningful access'' to birth control. The warning of such a move by the archdiocese, delivered to the Koch administration two weeks ago, was its first reaction to a Federal District Court settlement Oct. 8 stipulating that the city must place children in foster care agencies without regard to race or religion and that the agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on the 17,000 children in their care. The decision resolved a 13-year-old suit that contended the system was unfair to black Protestant children. Among other things, the agencies will not be able to deprive teen-agers of the right to obtain birth control pills or abortions. As many as 2,400 children cared for in group homes might be affected, and the archdiocese stands to lose between $50 million and $60 million a year in Federal, state and local funds. The church has no plans, however, to stop placing about 1,600 children with individual families. Mayor Koch, who called the stipulation ''bad,'' said the city agreed to it to avoid a court fight.

U.S. COUNCIL URGES BIRTH CONTROL TO COMBAT TEEN-AGE PREGNANCIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/10/us/us-council-urges-birth-control-to-combat-teen-age-pregnancies.html,"Contraceptives should be distributed free or at low cost to teen-agers to combat the problem of teen-age pregnancy, the National Research Council said today. The council also said in a report that teen-agers should be encouraged to seek parental consent for abortions but not required to do so. The report by the council, a Congressionally chartered organization that is the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences, was based on a two-year study by a panel of outside experts, including doctors, public health experts, sociologists and demographers. 'Aggressive Public Education' It concluded that the birth control pill was the ''safest and most effective'' contraceptive for sexually active teen-agers and recommended ''aggressive public education to dispel myths about health risks for young women'' who use the pill. The report also supported further trials of school-based contraceptive clinics to attack the teen-age pregnancy problem, a proposal denounced once again by Secretary of Education William J. Bennett. The report advocated, moreover, that condoms should be widely distributed in places where teen-age boys congregate and that new methods for distributing the pill should be explored. Dr. Daniel D. Federman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chairman of the council's Panel on Adolescent Pregnancy and Childbearing, which produced the report, said a million teen-age girls in the United States become pregnant each year and almost half of them give birth. 'No Coherent Policy' A 15-year-old American girl is at least five times more likely to give birth than are her foreign contemporaries, the study said, but there has been ''no coherent policy'' to deal with the issue. Teen-age mothers and their infants are at high risk for health complications, Dr. Federman said. Teen-age parents have ''severely limited career opportunities'' and are more likely to become dependent on public assistance. ''Society's economic burden in maintaining these families is substantial -an estimated $16.6 billion in Federal outlays for Aid to Dependent Children, Medicaid and food stamps alone in 1985,'' he said. ''Of even greater significance are the costs to those young people in lost opportunities.'' Mr. Bennett, in criticizing the recommendations about school-based clinics, said: ''This is not the first time a prestigious-sounding group has advocated a dumb policy - school-based birth control clinics - that will damage our schools and our children. I'm sure this group had good intentions; I just wish it had more wisdom and common sense.'' In the past, Mr. Bennett has argued that school-based clinics might encourage children who are not sexually active to become so and has said they ''tend to legitimate the very behavior whose natural consequences they intend to discourage.'' The National Research Council includes members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. Founded in 1916, the council serves as the research agency for the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. The report, ''Risking the Future: Adolescent Sexuality, Pregnancy and Child Bearing,'' cost $600,000 and was sponsored by five foundations: the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. A spokesman for the council, Rick Borchelt, said the foundations commissioned the study, and not any branch of the Government. He said that beyond distributing the report, the council had no plans for any follow-up activities. The study director, Cheryl D. Hayes, said, however, that in addition to the 337-page report issued today, the panel would publish a second volume containing statistical information and working papers early next year. She noted that while the report had no Federal sponsor, the panel had provided advance briefings for Dr. Otis R. Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and for the President's Science Adviser, Dr. William Graham. ''They said they found it interesting and would take it into consideration,'' Ms. Hayes said. Panel Said to Be Diverse Group She explained that members of the panel had been selected by the governing board of the National Research Council on the basis of ''scientific expertise, not ideological perspective,'' and represented a ''broadly diverse group balanced for geography, race, sex and age.'' ''The report was done independent of any outside influence,'' and there were ''no coercive efforts by any sponsors,'' she said. ''It went throught the academy's formal review process without being subject to the influence of any political agenda or ideological perspective.'' She added that the report was intended as a ''broad assessment of what we know about effective strategies to deal with the problem.'' Dr. Federman said the panel had examined existing data and conducted new analyses of previous research in an effort to review what is known. ''We weren't asked to talk about the issue and put a policy together,'' he said. ''We were asked to look at information and the facts and see what the review generated. What we found is that there is no need to strike in the dark. If we develop a national consensus, the means to make things better exists.'' Those means, the panel found, include better sex education with information on contraception, more readily available contraceptives and access to abortion for teen-agers who want it and need it. Group Assails Report In criticizing the report today, a spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee said the sponsoring foundations had all contributed to pro-abortion causes, and the group's president, Dr. John C. Willke, said the study was ''fatally flawed by its pervasive pro-abortion bias.'' ''This is a major pro-abortion document, designed by abortion-funding foundations to use as a tool in their continuous efforts to influence public policy on the abortion issue,'' said Dr. Willke. ''The cooperation of the National Research Council in such a partisan effort raises serious questions about that organization's current goals.'' Ms. Hayes she did not know whether the foundation's sponsors had contributed to pro-abortion causes, as Dr. Willke asserted. The executive director of the National Abortion Federation, Barbard Radford, said, however, that ''with society making it harder and harder for teen-agers to have abortions,'' the report came as ''great news.'' ''Teen-agers have the greatest difficulty obtaining abortions because of parental consent and notification requirements that vary from state to state,'' she added. Use of Contraceptives Is Urged ''Sexually active teen-agers, both boys and girls, need the ability to avoid pregnancy and the motivation to do so,'' Dr. Federman said. ''Early, regular and effective contraceptive use results in fewer unintended pregnancies.'' He said there was little evidence to support the view that the availability of contraceptives encourages early sexual activity. Adoption services should be strengthened, it said, as well as services for girls who choose to keep their babies.

RATING STATE LAWS ON WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/12/style/rating-state-laws-on-women.html,"From the point of view of women's rights under state laws, Washington is the best state to live in and South Carolina is the worst, according to a list compiled by the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. In conjunction with the publication this week of ''The State-by-State Guide to Women's Legal Rights,'' a project of the organization, the states were ranked on the basis of how well their laws give equal status to women. The book, based on material assembled by the organization and published by McGraw-Hill, was written by Renee Cherow-O'Leary, a professor of communications at the City University of New York. The states were rated on how well, in the judgment of the Legal Defense and Education Fund, their laws treat women on employment and pay issues, educational opportunity, abortion financing, division of marital assets, child-custody matters, child support, protections against domestic violence, aid to displaced homemakers, insurance, credit, housing and public accommodations. The states ranked highest were Washington, Massachusetts, New York and Wisconsin, in that order, with Connecticut and Michigan tied for fifth place. New Jersey was tied for seventh place with Alaska and Maryland. The Five at the Bottom The five worst states were Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada, Alabama and, in last place, South Carolina. A high ranking on the index does not mean that a given state has necessarily abolished all discrimination or inequitable treatment for women. In a complicated formula, under which states won or lost points depending on their laws and how they were implemented, the maximum number of points available was 64. ''Washington had 36 points, or little more than half, so we still have a long way to go,'' Marsha Levick, executive director of the Legal Defense and Education Fund, said at a luncheon held at the McGraw-Hill Building Wednesday to introduce the book. Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, said in a telephone interview from Washington -where a second press conference was held - that the book would be a resource for Congressional hearings on the legal status of women. The hearings will be held next year by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, of which Representative Schroeder is a member. 'Women Have Been Forgotten' ''The book shows how unfair it is that in one state women have so many more rights than in another,'' she said. ''It shows the many ways in which women have been forgotten and ignored. We ought not be emancipating women plantation by plantation - rather we need a Federal standard.'' One criterion used to compare states was whether they had state equal rights amendments - 16 do, including Connecticut, but not New York or New Jersey - and how fully those amendments are enforced. Five of the 10 top-ranked states have such amendments. ''We know they make a difference,'' Ms. Levick said. ''They impose a higher standard of equality and force every institution in those states to rethink what equality means.'' Besides spelling out differences between the states, the book, suggested to the organization by the writer Shana Alexander eight years ago, also tracks in considerable detail the advances for women through legislative and court actions in the last two decades. It touches on nearly all areas of import to women in the last two decades, including marriage and divorce law, child care and custody, rights of unmarried couples, reproductive rights, legal implications of new methods of conception, Social Security and pension laws, equality in education, equal-pay and comparable-worth doctrines, employment practices, older women, sexual harassment, battered women, rape, premenstrual syndrome, parental leave, housing, public accommodations and women in the military. In addition to describing the history of the issues covered, the laws and the public debate surrounding them, the book explains, step by step, how to seek remedies in agencies and courts. More than three-quarters of the volume is devoted to cataloguing the laws and policies in each state. This makes it easy, for example, to determine the requirements for legal separation in New Jersey, the status of equal-pay laws in Oklahoma and which laws prohibit discrimination in insurance in California. Seeking Women's Participation ''We want women to become participants in the judicial process and consumers of the law,'' said Roxanne Conlin, president of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Ms. Levick predicted that, on the state level, ''We will see growing emphasis in the area of family law.'' ''Those states that haven't caught up, for example, in recognizing the economic contributions of homemakers will do so,'' she said. ''The State-by-State Guide to Women's Legal Rights'' is available in bookstores for $19.95 in hardcover, $12.95 in paperback. With an additional $2 to cover mailing, it can be ordered from the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, 99 Hudson Street, New York, N.Y. 10013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The U.N. Population Fund Needs the U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/13/opinion/the-un-population-fund-needs-the-us.html,"United Nations members - developed and developing countries representing the spectrum of political and religious thought - last month pledged a record of nearly $140 million in 1987 contributions to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. Regrettably, the United States, which for 17 years had been the largest contributor, was conspicuously absent from the list of donors. The United States Agency for International Development announced in August that it would not participate. It claimed that the Fund ''supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization'' in China. By withdrawing, the United States has abandoned its leadership in an area of technical assistance it helped found. The absence of its contribution will hurt population programs that the Fund supports in 134 countries. The Agency for International Development's allegation is unfounded. Ironically, after two separate reviews of the Fund's family-planning assistance, A.I.D. itself concluded that the Fund ''does not include coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization'' in its program in China or anywhere else. Moreover, the program in China has been approved twice by the Fund's Governing Council, of which the United States is a member. The Fund does not, in policy or practice, support abortion anywhere. Coercion is at odds with the principles and purposes of United Nations family-planning efforts. The Fund is explicitly charged with helping countries provide the information and means for every individual and couple to decide freely on the number and spacing of children. The Fund's assistance to China has included technical support for its 1982 census (the largest population enumeration in history), contraceptive supplies, administrative training and population education. At about $10 million annually, the Fund's program amounts to less than 1 percent of the $1 billion China devotes to its population efforts. Even if Fund support amounted to a much larger proportion of the national program, as it does in many developing countries, the Fund is not equipped, legally or otherwise, to participate in managing any country's program. It closely monitors the outlays of money it provides, but program management is solely the recipient government's prerogative. Last month's financial show of suppor for the Fund reaffirms the international community's recognition of the strategic role of population planning in development. However, even the nearly $140 million pledged for next year falls far short of what the organization needs to meet the developing countries' requirements for assistance. Not long ago, the plight of drought-afflicted sub-Saharan African countries, where starvation was widespread, made headlines. Generous efforts and timely rains have mitigated the great suffering for now. But without sustained long-term action, a repetition of the disasters is inevitable. Throughout Africa, it is finally acknowledged that long-term answers must include attention to population growth - currently well above 3 percent annually in many countries. A United States contribution would allow the Fund to respond more adequately to increasing African needs. The Fund does not advocate any single approach to solving population problems. It helps all developing countries irrespective of whether they have policies for the increase or decrease of fertility. To help countries reach their own goals, the Fund provides support for family planning, including natural family planning; mother and child health care; research for safer, more effective contraceptive methods; education on population issues; and census-taking and data analysis. The Fund's many successes should be put in perspective: toward the middle of 1987, the world's population will reach five billion; it will reach six billion before the end of the century. The United States' vision and support helped launch the United Nations population assistance program 17 years ago. Some of today's controversies will fade, but the need for global efforts to address population problems will never be more urgent or more timely. Population programs can be made more effective with full participation by the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADDRESSING NEEDS OF 'AT RISK' PUPILS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/nyregion/addressing-needs-of-at-risk-pupils.html,"''WHEN students drop out,'' observed Marie Ramirez, executive director of the Center for Multinational and Comparative Education in Albany, ''what do they drop into? Drugs, alcohol, prostitution and crime. Our most recent statistics on the relationship of alcohol to substance use among secondary students paints a very gloomy picture for the future of our youth. When we look at students enrolled in grades seven through 12, we find that 40 percent, or 601,000 have used alcohol, 8 percent or 122,000 kids have used drugs and alcohol and 25 percent or 382,000 have used both in combination, destroying their lives - that is a slow form of suicide.'' Ms. Ramirez shared these statistics with about 200 school administrators during this year's annual Superintendents Dinner, sponsored by the Association of Women Administrators in Westchester. The education official was the main speaker at the dinner, which was held at the Mariott Hotel in Tarrytown. Ms. Ramirez, a member of the National Committee on Youth Suicide Prevention and the Governor's Task Force on Domestic Violence, emphasized the need for guidance and counseling programs at the elementary-school level to identify ''at-risk students'' early and help them begin to deal with a variety of complex issues that may be affecting them. Among the issues she cited were poverty, divorce, the rise in single-parent households, homelessness and teen-age pregnancy. She said today's youths are facing increasing pressures at earlier ages as a result of changes in society and in the family structure. Referring to the 1980 census, she said it showed that ''17 percent of our K-through-12 school population in the state, or approximately 617,000 children, live in poverty. Think of the needs of these children for adequate health care, nutrition, clothing, housing and emotional support at home and at school. ''In our state,'' she continued, ''we had over 10,000 births last year by girls between the ages of 10 and 16 and 37,000 abortions for girls ages 11 to 19. What enormous problems the young mothers face. They are trying to deal with their own sexuality, their own femininity, their own persona, at the same time they're trying to develop parenting skills essential for nurturing their own children.'' Directly addressing the administrators, the former nun and teacher then asked: ''How free are you as caring and concerned adults to spend time with the 'at-risk students' in your schools, to be more responsive and sensitive to their problems?'' Ms. Ramirez told the audience that she had become aware of the need for expanded guidance services for students while participating in a study on the condition of counseling programs in American schools. The two-year study and subsequent report, entitled ''Keeping the Options Open,'' was authorized by the College Board in 1984 and was carried out by the board's Commission on Pre-Collegiate Guidance and Counseling, of which Ms. Ramirez is a member. ''We traveled throughout the country,'' she recalled, ''and held dialogues with parents, students, teachers, counselors, administrators, school-board members and college admissions officers. In every region we heard the same story, concern about test scores in math and the sciences, but at the same time the realization that there is no state reference point to indicate how students feel about themselves. All these people know is that there are students in their schools who are hurting.'' She said that to ask these students to wait for help until they get to high school was ''to offer too little too late.'' ''What they need is early identification and intervention,'' she said, ''and closer communication between home and school, between parents, teachers and counselors.'' Ms. Ramirez, who is a native of Puerto Rico and served on President Carter's Hispanic Advisory Board, said she had focused on the specific needs of pupils at risk and homeless children in New York in two reports she helped prepare for the Board of Regents, one while in her present job and the other as a former assistant commissioner for general education. ''The first report,'' she said, ''led to legislation passed this year that will provide more state aid to school districts for increased services in guidance and counseling. The other outlined the educational needs of homeless children and urged support for a bill introduced by Senator Mary B. Goodhue from Mount Kisco that would insure education and school tranportation for students from homeless families.'' In an interview before the dinner, Ms. Ramirez, who called her address ''The REAL Nation at Risk'' in order to dramatize the plight of pupils at risk, said she felt recent national reports on education had ''failed to recognize that more is not better and that increasing standards will not take care of the different kinds of human needs these kids have.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW JERSEY OPINION; FAMILY LIFE: LET TRENTON PUT ITS MONEY WHERE ITS MANDATE IS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-family-life-let-trenton-put-its-money-where-its-mandate-is.html,"STATE officials, legislators and the State Board of Education recently received some very important news:A poll taken in October by the independent polling firm of Penn and Schoen Associates of New York City showed ''sex education in the schools is now a 'consensus' issue because it is supported by over 90 percent of New Jerseyans.'' If this finding does not provide a sense of satisfaction to those who were involved in the passage of a requirement for family-life education in all public schools, then they should consider these poll results: * Sixty-eight percent recognized that family-life education was a required subject (a tribute to those portions of the policy involving parents and community members in its development). * Ninety-five percent agreed that ''with diseases like AIDS, sex eduction is more important than ever.'' But what may come as a surprise to these policymakers, and to supporters of the state requirement (including the New Jersey Catholic Conference,) is another poll result: 60 percent of New Jerseyans believe that the state should put more resources into sex-education programs. Of all the poll results, this last is the most exciting and presents the greatest potential. To date, neither the executive nor legislative branches of government has appropriated any significant resources for family-life education. The reality is that New Jersey has done absolutely nothing since it enacted the policy in 1980 (and readopted it in 1985) to put its money where its mandate is. Therefore, with some 60 percent of New Jerseyans favoring the expenditure of ''more'' resources for the fledgling programs, decision-makers should have the impetus and the confidence to create a second-stage agenda to strengthen and enrich the program. It is understandable that, in the first few years following the passage of the controversial regulation, politicians would be cautious about voting sizable resources. After all, New Jersey was only one of three states, and the first state since 1970, to adopt such a curriculum requirement. In many respects, New Jersey education leaders, thanks to the early-warning system of a former Health Commissioner, were prophets on the issue of preventing adolescent pregnancy and parenting. They saw, before their counterparts in other states, the need to provide children and adolescents with timely and comprehensive information about sexuality and family issues to protect them from the dangers and consequences of too-early sexual activity and pregnancy. In the last few years, child advocates in other states have caught up with New Jersey. They were awakened to the seriousness of the problem by the publication, in 1985, of a report by the Alan Guttmacher Institute revealing that the United States had higher numbers of teen-age pregnancies, births and abortions than most western European nations. (The conclusions were based on the numbers of pregnancies, births and abortions to white teen-agers alone.) The reasons for the disparity between United States statistics and those of economic and culturally comparable European nations include the lack of uniform sex-education programs in the schools and of convenient, low-cost health services for sexually active adolescents. The activities of other organizations also drew the attention of state policymakers. In Washington, the Children's Defense Fund, the leading national child-advocacy organization, undertook a five-year initiative to prevent adolescent pregnancy; another Washington-based organization, the Center for Population Options, provided research that showed that the adolescent pregnancy problem was costing the United States more than $16 billion every year. All this attention resulted in the establishment of task forces on adolescent pregnancy, pregnant and parenting youth in many states, including Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, Texas, North Carolina and Missouri, as well as in the District of Columbia. Almost all the task forces recommended extending sex-education programs in the schools and advocated resources for them. Because of their farsightedness, New Jersey policymakers received praise for their action of 1980. Lately, however, they have been criticized for failing to support the policy with resources. The Children's Defense Fund, in a recent publication, ''Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy: What Schools Can Do,'' called New Jersey's policy ''a model'' but then went on to say that the state's Department of Education had failed to provide funds to assure widespread training for family-life education teachers. Recommendations for what policymakers need to undertake next have come from other directions as well. After studying the implementation of the mandate in six districts, Lana D. Muraskin, former director of research for the National Association of State Boards of Education, wrote in ''Creating and Implementing Family-Life Education in New Jersey Schools'': ''If family-life education is not to become one more program that caught the brief attention of state officials and then disappeared, I recommend that they consider allocating state funds and implementing these suggestions.'' Ms. Muraskin then recommended state funds for: * Provision of workshops of sufficient length to build local expertise among teachers. * Establishment of a recognition program to highlight exemplary practices. * Provision of program expansion in communities with high rates of adolescent pregnancy and parenthood. * Creation of an overall program of small grants to districts on a competitive basis to improve teachers' skills and children's learning. Closer to home, another recently issued report also addresses the need for more state funds for teacher training. In ''No Easy Answers: A Blueprint for Action in Working with Pregnant and Parenting Adolescents and Those at Risk'' (published by the Association for the Children of New Jersey and the New Jersey Network on Adolescent Pregnancy), the authors, Louise Murray and Mary-Ellen Mess, recommend that opportunities for teacher training be expanded and that family-life education teachers be financially supported so they can upgrade their teaching skills in human sexuality, child and adolescent development and family dynamics. The report also urges that the Division of Family Planning in the state's Department of Health receive specific financing so that it can expand training opportunities for school staff on a county or regional basis. Two small nongovernmental organizations have been taking a stab at defining a second-stage agenda and assisting teachers. They are the New Jersey Network for Family Life Education (which represents more than 40 statewide organizations that back the mandate) and the Center for Family Life Education of Planned Parenthood of Bergen County. On their own, they have begun initiatives using private foundation grants. Efforts include annual conferences, mailing current materials and a mini-grant awards program for teachers of family life in Grades K-6. Both could do more if they could apply for state funds. But state education leaders have not yet directly responded to these suggestions for resources for family-life education. The Department of Education will soon make available a new publication to school districts: ''Family Life Education: Selected Programs and Practices in New Jersey Public Schools.'' This is a compendium of 17 self-selected curriculum models that districts interested in improving their own family-life education programs can use. However, the department has not allocated any funds to assist those districts interested in changing or upgrading their programs. At the moment, state officials seem to be turning their backs on family-life education and focusing instead on substance-abuse-prevention education. The Governor has asked the Legislature to require mandatory drug- and alcohol-abuse education in grades K through 12 and has promised funds to those districts that adopt a state-approved curriculum. Yet when the State Board of Education passed the requirement for family life, it recommmended that it be the umbrella curriculum for the prevention of all social problems. If the funds promised for the improvement of substance-abuse education went instead to strengthening family-life-education programs, the state would stretch its resources more fully and help children and adolescents understand more thoroughly the dangers of adolescent pregnancy, child sexual abuse, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. For the ultimate goal of family-life education is to help all the state's young people understand responsible, personal behavior and have strong bodies, strong families and strong lives. New Jersey took risks when it adopted the family-life education mandate; now we know that voters approve of the state's leadership. To retain that leadership position, and insure excellence of instruction, policymakers and officials need to consider a second-stage agenda of training teachers and strengthening curriculums and providing adequate resources to implement it. Knowing that 60 percent of New Jerseyans support such action should make the next steps far easier for them to take.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IDEAS & TRENDS; A Prescription for Contraceptives,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-a-prescription-for-contraceptives.html,"The most promising way to prevent teen-age pregnancy, the National Research Council has found, is contraception that is available and affordable. The council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, reported last week that teen-agers needed greater access to birth control services, and it supported further trials of clinics providing such services in schools. The council also said teen-agers should be encouraged but not compelled to seek parental consent for abortions. The report was most enthusiastic about the birth control pill, calling it the ''safest and most effective'' contraceptive and recommending ''aggressive public education to dispel myths about health risks to young women'' taking the pill. The council also endorsed the liberal distribution of condoms. On the other side were, among others, Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, who denounced school clinics as tending ''to legitimate the very behavior whose natural consequences they intend to discourage,'' and the National Right to Life Committee, which called the report a ''pro-abortion document.'' Dr. Daniel D. Federman, the Harvard Medical School professor who led the panel of doctors, public health experts, sociologists and demographers, dismissed the view that making contraceptives available encourages sexual activity. He said teen-age mothers and their babies were at high risk for health complications and had limited opportunities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
YELLOWSTONE BISON ELUDE FIRST HUNTERS OF YEAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/us/yellowstone-bison-elude-first-hunters-of-year.html,"Bison are continuing to show disregard for the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park, defying the efforts of the Federal Park Service to keep them inside. Once the animals leave the park, they become state property. And Montana officials, who say the bison carry a disease that can cause spontaneous abortions in cattle, want them killed. The first 10 hunters for this year's state-ordered hunt traveled to Yellowstone Wednesday morning to shoot bison among 31 that had wandered from the park. But by the time hunters, who were chosen by lottery, arrived at the borders, the animals had returned to Yellowstone, which is home to about 2,000 bison. Another herd of 38 animals was moving in and out of the park near Gardiner, and a group of 100 was just inside the park boundary. Meanwhile, several hundred other bison, almost the entire northern herd, were further inside the park, but moving toward the boundary. Last year, in the first major season on wild bison since the animals were hunted to near extinction in the 19th century, 57 bison were killed. 'Trying to Haze Them' ''We've been trying to haze them into the park,'' said Steven Martin, a ranger for the park's northern district. ''But to do it consistently is very expensive.'' To keep the animals from walking out of the park on a plowed highway that runs through a narrow canyon, the Park Service last summer built a cattle guard in the road and a 300-foot-long fence in the canyon. They also used recorded wolf howls, strobe lights and rubber bullets in the effort. But most of the animals simply took other routes out of the park, a task made easier by the small amount of snow the park has had. Amy Vanderbilt, a park spokesman, said the park was looking at new ways to restrict the bison movements. ''It was an experiment,'' she said of the earlier efforts. ''We'll have to go back to the drawing board.'' Health Threat Is Disputed Officials say the animals are leaving the park not because there is a lack of food but because it is natural for bison to colonize new areas. Park officials dispute the assertion that the bison pose a health threat to cattle because of the disease brucellosis, saying that there is no evidence to show that bison have ever passed the disease to cattle. But they say they want to keep the bison off of neighboring property. Bison are not a protected species, but the Yellowstone animals, which can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds, are considered the last wild herd in the United States. When the animals leave the park, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks summons hunters chosen by lottery. A bison-hunting permit costs $250 for Montana residents and $500 for out-of-state residents. 'This Is Crazy' ''This is crazy,'' said Cleveland Amory, leader of the Fund for Animals, an animal rights group based in New York that tried unsuccessfully in court last year to stop the hunt. ''Their job is to maintain and protect this herd. Letting slob hunters collect their bloody hides is the antithesis of that. I hope they miss and shoot each other.'' The hunt has been widely criticized as lacking in sport. A local rancher, Leonard Sargent, said shooting a bison was ''like walking up to the green and dropping your golf ball in the hole.'' Irvin Niemi, a tavern owner in Butte who was the first hunter called up this year, disagrees. ''It may be a little tougher to get a grizzly,'' he said. ''But I imagine they'll run like any other animal if you put a little lead behind them.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BLASTING CAP EXPLODES, BUT BOMB FAILS TO GO OFF AT ABORTION CLINIC",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/15/nyregion/blasting-cap-explodes-but-bomb-fails-to-go-off-at-abortion-clinic.html,"A man wielding a gun forced his way into an unoccupied Planned Parenthood abortion clinic on the East Side of Manhattan yesterday afternoon and planted a dynamite bomb that later misfired, the police said. A blasting cap exploded when the bomb's timing device went off, but it failed to detonate 15 sticks of dynamite, the police said. No one was injured. ''Had the bomb gone off, it would have absolutely destroyed the front of the building,'' said the commanding officer of the department's bomb squad, Lieut. William McCarthy. Lieutenant McCarthy said the squad had responded to a report of a fire in the abortion clinic on the fourth floor of 380 Second Avenue, at 22d Street. The 10-story building also houses the executive offices of Planned Parenthood of New York City. The clinic and the offices were closed yesterday. The bomb was believed to have been planted by a man who said he was looking for an office and was taken into the building yesterday at 2 P.M. by a real-estate agent. The police said the man pulled out a small automatic pistol, took the agent's keys and handcuffed him to a pipe on the seventh-floor. The man went downstairs to the fourth-floor offices of the Margaret Sanger Center of Planned Parenthood, placed the dynamite bomb behind a counter and fled, the police said. Meanwhile, the real-estate agent picked the lock of the handcuffs and freed himself. He was leaving the building just as the police were arriving. The police declined to identify the agent. Ignition of the blasting cap set off the building's smoke alarm and sprinkler system, causing minor damage to an office, the police said. Responding to the alarm, the police broke several windows in the front of the building. ''Luckily they noticed the bomb and were able to defuse it in time,'' Lieutenant McCarthy said. The police were alerted by a call at about 2:55 P.M., said a spokesman for the department, Sgt. Edward Burns. The Planned Parenthood clinic has been the target of bomb threats in the past, he said, but until yesterday no bomb was found. Had it functioned properly, the bomb planted yesterday would have exploded by the time the police arrived, Lieutenant McCarthy said. ''It should have gone off,'' he said. ''Lord only knows why it didn't.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATTEMPTED BOMBER OF CLINIC IS SOUGHT IN 2 OTHER ATTACKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/16/nyregion/attempted-bomber-of-clinic-is-sought-in-2-other-attacks.html,"The man who entered a Planned Parenthood clinic in Manhattan Sunday and planted a dynamite bomb is believed to be responsible for attempted bombings at two other clinics in the city in the last month, officials said yesterday. The officials declined to elaborate on why they thought the incidents were related. But they have not ruled out the possibility that other people are involved, acccording to Robert J. Creighton, head of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which has joined the Police Department in investigating the incident. Clinic Open Yesterday Only the detonator of the bomb planted Sunday went off, not the main charge, and no one was injured. The clinic, at Second Avenue and 22d Street, was open yesterday. Law-enforcement officials drew a composite sketch of the suspect and offered a $10,000 reward yesterday for information leading to his arrest. He was described as white, between 5 foot 7 to 5 foot 9, 32 to 37 years old, with brown hair and brown eyes and a mustache. He forced his way into the clinic and planted the bomb after he had gained entry to the building by telling a real-estate agent he wanted to rent office space on the seventh floor. A blasting cap exploded when the bomb's timing device went off, but it failed to detonate 15 sticks of dynamite - one of the largest and potentially most damaging bombs ever planted in an abortion clinic, according to a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Police Protection Asked Planned Parenthood officials sought police protection yesterday asking that officers be stationed around the clock at the organization's three abortion clinics, according to Planned Parenthood's executive director, Alfred F. Moran. Police officials said they could not put officers at the clinics because other clinics in the city would want similar protection and the cost would be prohibitive. The police crime prevention unit, though, will offer crime protection information to any clinics that want it, police officials said. The Planned Parenthood abortion clinics have a private security guard and alarms on the office doors, as well as a closed-circuit television security system, Mr. Moran said. In the last five years, he added, the organization has spent about $200,000 improving security at its three abortion clinics in the city, which perform about 10,000 abortions a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; JUSTICES LIMIT EFFECT OF ELECTION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/16/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-limit-effect-of-election-law.html,"The Supreme Court ruled today that a Congressional ban of direct corporate spending in political campaigns was unconstitutional as applied to a Massachusetts anti-abortion group and other small, nonprofit advocacy groups organized as corporations. The 5-to-4 decision left intact the statutory restrictions on campaign spending by business corporations and labor unions, and experts said its effect on the complex regulatory scheme for Federal elections would be slight. Carving out a narrow exception from the restrictions on corporate spending, the Court held that nonbusiness, ideologically oriented corporations had a First Amendment right to make ''independent'' expenditures of their own money, raised from donations, bake sales and other fund-raising events, to support or oppose political candidates. The decision would not allow such groups to make direct contributions to candidates, however. #1971 Election Law Cited Until today, the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 barred all corporations from spending their general funds in elections while allowing them to set up separate political action committees, financed by the voluntary contributions of members and subject to detailed public disclosure requirements. Today's decision, Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life Inc., No. 85-701, held that the small, nonprofit anti-abortion group could not be barred from spending its money in a political campaign or required to set up a political action committee before doing so. The election agency had sought to penalize the corporation for spending $9,812 to publish a special election newsletter in 1978 urging voters to support identified ''pro-life'' candidates and oppose candidates who favor women's rights to have abortions. The Court held unanimously rejected the group's arguments that it had not violated the statute because it had not made direct contributions to candidates and because it was covered by the statutory exemption for newspapers, magazines and other publications. It then divided, 5 to 4, in holding the statute unconstitutional as applied on the facts of the case. An Unjustifiable Burden The Court ruled that it would place an unjustifiable burden on the group's free speech to require it to comply with the complex paperwork requirements and the limitations on fund-raising from members of the general public that apply to political action committees. Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote the majority opinion, joined by Associate Justices Thurgood Marshall, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Antonin Scalia, and in part by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented, joined by Associate Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. The vote of Justice Scalia, the Court's newest member, confounded predictions by some observers that he would invariably side with Chief Justice Rehnquist, long the Court's most conservative member, in ideologically charged cases. Justice Brennan said that in cases involving small, advocacy-oriented corporations, the paperwork requirements and restriction of solicitations from the general public that Congress has required for political action committees ''may create a disincentive for such organizations to engage in political speech'' and ''impose administrative costs that many small entities may be unable to bear.'' 'Concentrated Corporate Wealth' He said the justification for the statutory ban on corporate campaign spending was to prevent ''the corrosive influence of concentrated corporate wealth'' from corrupting ''the political marketplace,'' and to prevent corporations from using assets of investors and members without their consent to support political causes. Justice Brennan said these dangers were not presented by corporations ''formed to disseminate political ideas, not to amass capital.'' He said such groups as Massachusetts Citizens for Life would remain subject to requirements that they publicly disclose independent expenditures ''as little as $250,'' the identities of large contributors and other information. Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a public-affairs lobbying group that had urged the Court to uphold the blanket ban on coporate campaign spending, said today that the decision would have ''minimal practical impact.'' Rehnquist Cites Prior Rulings He said he was relieved by the outcome because he had feared the Court might strike down, or create a larger exception to, the long-standing prohibition on direct political spending by corporations and labor unions. Chief Justice Rehnquist, in his dissent, said the decision conflicted with the reasoning of prior Supreme Court rulings upholding a broad rule against corporate campaign spending. Stressing that the Court should not sit ''as a council of revision to modify legislative judgments,'' he said it should ''leave the drawing of lines in cases such as this to Congress.'' The Chief Justice said the law was justified as ''a prophylactic measure applicable to all groups that organize in the corporate form,'' both ''to rid the political process of corruption and appearance of corruption that accompany contributions to and expenditures for candidates from corporate funds'' and ''to protect the interests of individuals who pay money into a corporation or union for purposes other than the support of candidates for public office.'' The Court took these other actions today: Visa Denials It agreed to hear a Reagan Administration appeal of a Federal appellate court decision slightly curbing the broad power of the executive branch to bar aliens associated with Communist or other ''totalitarian'' organizations from visiting the United States. Solicitor General Charles Fried said in the Government's appeal that the decision ''will not only enmesh the courts in questions outside the bounds of judicial competence, it will cast a chill over excecutive decision-making and impair the conduct of foreign policy.'' Quoting the dissenting opinion by Judge Robert H. Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Mr. Fried said the appellate court's decision ''manifests a troubling 'process of judicial incursion into the United States' conduct of its foreign affairs.' '' The appeals court rejected, 2 to 1, the Administration's assertion of unfettered power to bar Communist aliens from visiting the United States. It ruled that if the State Department has no reason other than Communist affiliation for excluding an alien, it must ordinarily recommend that the visa be granted or certify to Congress that the alien's visit would threaten national security. Basing its ruling on the various provisions of the immigration statute, in particular the 1977 McGovern Amendment, the panel said further proceedings were necessary to determine the precise scope of the Government's powers to exclude aliens, and the legality of the exclusions of the four aliens in the case before it. They are Thomas Borge, Nicaragua's Interior Minister; Nino Pasti, a former Italian lawmaker and general who belongs to a peace group that the State Department says is controlled by the Soviet Union, and Olga Finlay and Leonor Rodriguez Lezcano of Cuba, experts on women and family law in Cuba and who the department says are affiliated with Cuba's Communist Party. The appellate ruling, although narrow and technical, was hailed by civil liberties lawyers as a victory in their battle against the Government's frequent denials of visas to left-leaning foreign political and literary figures who want to exchange views here. At the same time, the appellate court said the Government had broad latitude to exclude aliens without any certification to Congress if they had ''affiliations with hostile governments'' independent of any Communist Party affiliations, or would engage in activities ''prejudicial to the public interest'' while in the United States. The plaintiffs in the case, Reagan v. Abourezk, No. 86-656, were members of Congress and others who had invited Mr. Borge, Mr. Pasti and the two Cuban women to visit this country to exchange views on various issues. They sued to challenge the visa denials. The State Department had said that denial of visas to foreign officials such as Mr. Borge may be a legitimate way of expressing disapproval of the polices of their governments and of preventing them from seeking to spread a positive image of Communist regimes in the United States. Invasion of Privacy The Court let stand, without comment, a Federal appellate ruling that a horse racing association must face trial in a suit for invasion of privacy for issuing a statement to the press exposing the identities of a couple who had assumed new names and been resettled under the Federal witness protection program. The plaintiffs did not allege that the statement was inaccurate. But the appellate court said the plaintiffs had a right to a jury trial to determined whether the information in the statement was sufficiently newsworthy to justify publishing it. The husband, Anthony Ciulla, renamed Anthony Capra, had been convicted of fixing horse races and had entered the witness protection program with his family after giving testimony against organized crime figures who might endanger their safety. The statement was issued in connection with his wife's application for a license to race horses in California. The case was Thoroughbred Racing Associations v. Capra, No. 86-238.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CALIFORNIA JOURNAL;,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/16/us/california-journal.html,"Californians are being urged to choose an unusual Christmas gift for friends this year - a light bulb for the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Price: $100. In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the bridge's opening last month, officials draped a temporary three-mile strand of lights along its arc-shaped suspension cables between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island in the center of San Francisco Bay. The lighting is not weatherproofed and is to be removed in the spring. But the nightly show of sparkling lights has been such a hit that it now seems likely to become permanent. Bay Area citizens are working to raise $700,000 for a longer, permanant necklace of lights that would stretch more than five miles along the full length of the bridge between San Francisco and Oakland. Next May, the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge between San Francisco and its northern suburbs will also be illuminated on its 50th birthday. State and city agencies are expected to pay most of the cost of the Bay Bridge lighting project, but more than $100,000 has been raised so far by grass-roots fund-raising. Among other things, residents are being urged to donate $100 to pay for one of thousands of lights to be strung on the bridge. Donors are promised a certificate pinpointing ''their'' light on the bridge. Thousands of dollars for the lighting projectg have been contributed by motorists who have said ''keep the change'' when they present a dollar bill for the 75-cent toll on the bridge. But some toll collectors have been unhappy with the extra bookkeeping chores these contributions have presented them and are now demanding five-dollar bills as a miniumum contribution. Hollywood Time Capsule An anniversary of a different kind has is causing this question to be asked in southern California: Of all the artifacts from the history of the motion picture industry, what items are most appropriate to be preserved in a transparent time capsule commemorating the 100th birthday Hollywood? Charlie Chaplin's cane? Harold Lloyd's horn-rimmed glasses? Judy Garland's ruby slippers from ''The Wizard of Oz?'' John Wayne's six-shooter from ''Stagecoach?'' The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has invited ''the world'' to send in nominations for enshrinement in the capsule, which will be roughly five feet square and made of acrylic plastic. The suggestions are being solicited as part of a yearlong celebration, scheduled to begin Feb. 1, of the 100th anniversary of the day when a land huckster from the Middle West named Harvey Wilcox bought a piece of land on the outskirts of Los Angeles and began peddling homesites in a place he called Hollywood. The moviemakers came a few years later, and the rest, as they say in Hollywood, is history. Nominations for items to be placed in the shrine to Hollywood history should be addressed to: Hollywood Centennial Celebration, Hollyood Roosevelt Hotel, 7000 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, Calif. 90028. Cranston's Victory Six weeks after incumbent Senator Alan Cranston, a Democrat, defeated Representative Ed Zschau, his Republican opponent, in one of California's closest Senate elections of the century, people in political circles are still analyzing the results. Mr. Cranston won the election by 116,622 votes, a margin of less than 2 percent. Although the issue is not likely ever to be settled conclusively, a consensus is emerging that Mr. Cranston's narrow victory may have resulted from the vote-splitting efforts of a disparate coalescence of political forces: fundamentalist Christian conservatives who regarded Mr. Zschau's views on abortion and other moral issues as too moderate, and certain wealthy Jewish contributors in southern California who felt Mr. Zschau would not be a strong supporter of Israel and wanted Mr. Cranston re-elected. Both groups got behind the candidacy of Edward Vallen, a little-known Senate candidate representing the right wing American Independent Party who received 107,000 votes in the election. Several Christian fundamentalist organizations denounced Mr. Zschau and urged Republican conservatives to vote for Mr. Vallen in the final days of the campaign. More recently, Mr. Vallen has acknowledged receiving at least $120,000 in contributions from Jewish donors working to assure the re-election of Mr. Cranston. According to several knowledgeable people involved in California politics, a principal source of the money was Michael Goland, a wealthy Californian who in 1984 contributed $400,000 and indirectly raised additional moneys in a successful effort to defeat Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, who as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was viewed by some American Jews as not sympathetic enough to Israel. Through a spokesman, Mr. Goland refused last week to discuss the issue with a reporter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ANTI-ABORTION CLINICS FOCUS OF HEARING IN HOUSE TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/17/us/anti-abortion-clinics-focus-of-hearing-in-house-today.html,"Anti-abortion centers that have caused increasing dispute in a number of cities and states will be the subject of House subcommittee hearings in Washington today. Nearly a dozen have been the subject of litigation in which women who sought abortion services contend the centers misled them through false advertising or misinformation. Most of the centers do not openly indicate they represent an anti-abortion view. Women say they have entered the centers under the impression that they can receive abortions or abortion services. But once inside, while awaiting results of a pregnancy test performed on the basis of a urine sample, numerous women said they had been shown strong anti-abortion presentations, depicting the procedure as exceedingly dangerous and immoral. San Francisco Center Sued ''I saw a slide show that made abortion out to be the worst possible horror a woman could go through,'' said Carla Abbotts, a 27-year-old San Francisco woman who is expected to testify in the hearings this week. She is suing A Free Pregnancy Center, which she visited earlier this year. ''The slide show had pictures of bloody fetuses in trash cans, and it said abortion led to sterility, death, deformed children, guilt and even suicide because of guilt,'' Ms. Abbotts said. ''To some women, abortion is the worst horror they'll go through,'' said Robert J. Pearson, founder of the Pearson Foundation, a St. Louis-based anti-abortion group, which created the slide presentation used by many centers. Many of the centers were modeled on guidelines written by Mr. Pearson and published by his foundation. ''We offer abortion information,'' he said. ''Everything we say in the presentations is documented. All we're offering is the truth.'' Planned Parenthood and other organizations that oppose the clinics say it is not so much the message they object to but the fact that the centers are often listed in telephone book Yellow Pages under ''Clinic,'' or, at times, under ''Abortion Clinics.'' They say neither the advertisements nor receptionists at the centers give any warning to women that anti-abortion views will be presented to them. ''We're concerned,'' said William W. Hamilton Jr., director of the Washington office of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, ''because they advertise themselves as offering medical services, but then they refuse to give women objective information on medical options available to them. These fake clinics are playing on the vulnerability of young women and essentially forcing them to listen to pseudomedical tirades about abortion.'' Issue of Advertising Curtis J. Young, executive director of the Christian Action Council, which operates a number of the centers, said: ''It's absolutely ridiculous. If you look up 'Clinic' in the Yellow Pages, there are many nonmedical agencies or businesses there.'' Mr. Hamilton and other critics say that most staff members at the centers have no medical training and thus should not be listed under ''Clinics.'' They also say many of the pregnancy centers look nearly identical with real abortion clinics and that many of them are situated near abortion clinics, in some cases next to them. ''We need our centers to look like the abortion clinics to reach people,'' said Mr. Pearson. ''There's no crime in that. We're competing with them. It's like a Wendy's locating next to a McDonalds.'' Mr. Pearson acknowledged that the centers did not openly state that they represented an anti-abortion point of view. ''We don't hold a flag in our door saying we are pro-life,'' he said. ''But it's honest advertising. We're just not saying what we don't do. A car dealer, when advertising, does not list the things his auto won't do. So why should we say we won't do abortions.'' The number of such centers or clinics has grown in recent years. Although statistics have not been compiled, most experts agree that the centers have grown from a handful several years ago to as many as 2,000 to 3,000 today. According to officials at Planned Parenthood, at least 25 centers operate in Connecticut, many in the southern part of the state, Nearly a dozen centers exist in the New York metropolitan area, including Westchester and Long Island, the officials say. A similar number were estimated to be operating in New Jersey. The centers are usually founded by local groups, at times with funds and support from religious organizations. The center sued by Ms. Abbotts was issued a temporary restraining order by a San Francisco court barring further advertising in the Yellow Pages unless the term ''abortion alternatives'' was printed. ''They have not proven our advertising is false.'' said Daniel J. Grimm, a lawyer for the Lourdes Foundation, which operates the center. ''It's a pretty small victory for them,'' Texas Center Fined $39,000 In another case in Texas, a pregnancy center and its founder were convicted in October of deceptive trade practices and were fined $39,000. ''These clinics practice what I would call the sins of omission,'' said Jim Mattox, the State Attorney General, who helped bring the case to court. The case is expected to be appealed. Nearly a dozen other similar cases are still pending around the country. The New York Attorney General's office is currently conducting its own investigation of a number of the centers, to ''determine if they are violating any of New York's laws,'' according to a spokesman. At the hearings today the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, part of the House Judiciary Committee, will hear testimony from women who say they were misled by the pregnancy centers. Mr. Pearson said he would not attend the hearings, although he was invited, because ''the deck is stacked against us.'' ''They have five legislators who are very pro-abortion, and only three, at most, on our side,'' he said. ''I feel we won't be treated fairly, since they won't let us bring some girls to testify who have been helped by the centers.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Archdiocesan Foster Care Does Not Discriminate,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/17/opinion/l-archdiocesan-foster-care-does-not-discriminate-914486.html,"To the Editor: In ''Foster Care Hits a Snag'' (editorial, Dec. 8), you state that New York City's Roman Catholic foster-care agencies were unwilling to serve black Protestant and Hispanic children. This allegation of discrimination for race and creed was first made by the American Civil Liberties Union. The allegation has never and can never be substantiated. Our archdiocesan programs are in no way discriminatory. Of the 5,137 children in the care of our agencies last July 1, 43.2 percent were black; 31.6 percent were Hispanic; 16.4 percent were white, and 8.8 percent were classified as other. As to religion, 45.9 percent were Catholic and 54.1 percent were classified as Protestant or other religions or having no known religion. The Archdiocese of New York is committed to caring for children in need and will strive to continue to meet those needs and, where possible, expand our services. But we will do this only in accord with our religious mission and principles and the best interest of children and their families. Neither a court order nor an agreement between the city administration and the American Civil Liberties Union can strip us of our right to the free exercise of our religion. We regard this court-approved agreement as an unwarranted governmental interference that would secularize religiously sponsored programs of care for children in need and strip us of our Catholic identity. With more than a century of service to the children of New York in need of certain child-care services, we regret that the parties to the agreement force us now to consider seriously the necessity of curtailing our services. Nevertheless, we do so on moral grounds and in our steadfast belief that the care of children in our charge must never force us to violate our religious principles, particularly in the areas of abortion and contra-ception.

GORBACHEV'S GREAT PUSH AND THE RELUCTANT PUBLIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/18/world/gorbachev-s-great-push-and-the-reluctant-public.html,"There is an old Russian proverb that the muzhik won't cross himself until he hears the thunder. The proverb is commonly cited by way of saying that a Russian will not rouse himself to action until the last minute, until the crisis is upon him. This trait has repeatedly frustrated Soviet leaders who have tried to impose their will on the people and rouse them to action. Twenty months ago, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, an energetic and capable leader of the postwar generation, came to power vowing to root out this trait, to change the character of the muzhik - meaning in this case the average Russian - and to reverse the decline of a great and richly endowed land through a fundamental and urgent transformation in the way Russians live and work. Call for 'Revolutionary' Change Only a profound, radical and even ''revolutionary'' restructuring, he said again and again, could check the stagnation of the economy, the corruption of the political system, the people's cynicism. Consolidating his power with unusual speed, Mr. Gorbachev immediately set about replacing the top level of the Government and party. He offered some new liberties to economic managers and legalized some private services. He declared war on the blight of drunkenness, demanded a new openness and turned a new diplomatic face to the world. No one could deny that Mr. Gorbachev's changes have rumbled through the bureaucracy, the press, the arts and the country at large. But as he approaches his second year in office, it is far from certain that the muzhik has heard the thunder - that Mr. Gorbachev has succeeded in convincing his nation that a crisis is upon it. Contradiction and Resistance The contradictory image of a nation sorely in need of change and yet strongly resistant to it arises repeatedly as a reporter nearing the end of a seven-year assignment to Moscow assesses the changes taking place in Soviet life. The novelty of a young, dynamic and attractive leader has waned, and with repetition his exhortations have lost some of their urgency and impact. Political anecdotes, the most sensitive barometer of public opinion in a nation denied open political discussion, have become potshots at the leader and his incessant calls for restructuring and intensification - perestroika i uskoreniye, the new propaganda refrain. One gibe making the rounds reflects a growing fatigue with Mr. Gorbachev's constant sermonizing: ''We don't drink vodka any more, nor sausage do we have. As soon as we come home from work, we listen to Gorbachev.'' For all his impatience, he has shown himself to be realistic about his country's capacity for change, and about the character of the muzhik. Talking to a group of writers a few months ago, he insisted that Soviet society was ripe for change. Then, almost without pause, he warned against expecting any quick transformation. ''Generations must pass for us to really change,'' he said. ''Generations must pass.'' The society Mr. Gorbachev took charge of 20 months ago is one whose shape has changed enormously in the four decades since World War II, often with results far different from those predicted by Marxist theory or prescribed by the Kremlin. The villages in which more than half the population still lived as late as 1960 have been emptied. The monotonous concrete tenements of the cities now house two-thirds of the Soviet Union's 280 million people. The urbanization and relative security of postwar years have nurtured new hungers, habits, needs and problems, many only dimly understood and only barely acknowledged by Soviet officials. Yet Soviet society remains profoundly conservative, perhaps because the Russian people have been conditioned by a tumultuous history to cherish stability and to be wary of the designs of their leaders. The Nation's Strength And Its Weakness ''Russia is slow to change'' - the assertion recurs like a refrain as Russians talk about their country. The immutability of the landscape is often noted by foreigners who return -the timeless villages of log cabins listing in endless mud, the rude clerks in dilapidated shops, the tired faces and gray dress of Muscovites plying the streets in search of produce, the dated fashions and fads. To an American, the resistance to change may be portrayed as a fundamental difference between the two countries and their people. Anatoly N. Rybakov, the 75-year-old novelist whose epic about the Stalin era is finally to be published next spring, says to an American interviewer, ''You must understand that our great, enormous land has been shaped a certain way, and change cannot take place rapidly.'' This Soviet trait is cited as a national strength: patience in the face of adversity, the ability to survive the worst of times and to be grateful for small improvements, the legendary tolerance for suffering and deprivation. The dissident Yuri F. Orlov, abruptly liberated after nine years of labor camps and Siberian exile, was curiously devoid of bitterness and self-pity as he flew to New York. ''We have different criteria of what's difficult,'' he explained. ''We have greater endurance.'' Shielded from the daily crises, cacophonous television, fierce competitiveness and the other unrelenting stimuli of Western life, Russians have managed to remained an unspoiled and curious people, capable of taking delight in an afternoon stroll and grateful for any cultural experience. The resistance to change is also cited as a national weakness, as the reason for the tenacity of habits like drunkenness, inefficiency in the workplace, resistance to new methods or routines, innate suspiciousness of foreigners and submissiveness before authority. Foreigners and foreign influences are still treated as if they are infected with a particularly deadly disease, perpetuating distrust and misconceptions. A New Generation, Defiant and Spoiled Yet despite the innate resistance Mr. Gorbachev may meet, the country is in transition, changing in ways that may not be as glaring or advanced as in the West, yet are often as wrenching and profound in Soviet terms. Long-ignored problems like drug abuse, prostitution and teen-age suicides are being openly acknowledged, and alcoholism has reached the proportions of a ''national tragedy,'' as Mr. Gorbachev told the writers. Divorce and abortion have soared. In the Ukraine, where the number of cities has quadrupled since the war, every third marriage ends in divorce. A study in one province of the Russian republic found that of 1,000 first pregnancies, 272 ended in abortion, and that 206 of the women who had abortions were unmarried. Of those who had the child, 140 were single and more than 270 were married shortly before giving birth. A new generation of urban adolescents is reaching maturity, far quicker to pick up Western trends, much less fearful of authority and far more spoiled by parents who had hoped to shield their offspring - increasingly an only child - from the hardships of their own youth. Grandparents who secretly explored jazz and parents who cautiously admired the Beatles are aghast at teen-agers who openly flaunt their affection for Western fads, whether by strutting around Pushkin Square in punk hairdos, blaring ''heavy metal'' rock on portable stereos or tooling around on primitive Jawa motorcycles. Rock groups like Boris Grebenshchikov's Aquarium or Mikhail Litvin's Rondo have shaped a defiant and original sound, with performers indifferent to official disapproval and well versed in the latest Western music. Old-time Marxist ideology has proved woefully inadequate to the new sophistication and consumerism. Newspapers regularly bemoan the growing irrelevance of the Komsomol Communist youth organization and rail helplessly against teen-agers whose lives center on hanging around urban courtyards, peddling rock cassettes and trendy clothes and even forming neighborhood gangs. Yet their parents, too, have developed a new taste for high living, and the chase for status symbols like video recorders, cars and Western clothes has become a national preoccupation. Urban Rootlessness And Nostalgia for Stalin The wane of ideology and the rise of a new urban rootlessness have often led to new searches for spiritual values. Old-guard cold warriors still fulminate regularly in the press about the need to restore discipline, darkly depicting the new fads and trends as ideological diversions planted in the Soviet Union by hostile forces from the West. There are those who nostalgically invoke a real or imagined past of purer morals and higher ideals. With every year the Soviet victory in World War II, known here as the ''Great Patriotic War,'' grows in legend and lore as the high point of Soviet history, when the people arose in glorious unity to oust the Fascist invader. Writers of the ''village'' school like Valentin Rasputin and Fyodor Abramov have gained a broad following with novels lamenting the loss of village values. Many in the Russian intelligentsia have delved into the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian history in a search for spiritual roots, many of them making pilgrimages to shrines and sites believed to be sacred. Others have found sustenance -often against stiff official repression -in the exotic disciplines of Indian religions. Aleksandr German's brilliant film about the early 1930's, ''My Friend Ivan Lapshin,'' shot in the sepia tones and sharp contrasts of the period, touched a yearning for a time when rampant poverty and hardship were still tempered by a residual revolutionary idealism, soon to be smothered forever by Stalin's terror. A misguided nostalgia persists for Stalin himself, nourished by the official falsification of his history. Truck drivers sometimes sport portraits of the dictator in their cabs, signs of a naive perception of his tenure as a lost era of order and discipline. The Demoralized Village Mired in Backwardness Rural Russia, meanwhile, never recovered from the brutal devastation of collectivization. The village, demoralized by decades of senseless bureaucratic controls, deprived of dignity by the priority given to industrialization and denuded of its youngest and brightest, remains mired in backwardness and apathy. The rural crisis remains probably the single greatest obstacle to any chance for serious reform of the Soviet system. Perennial plans to revive agriculture have failed, perpetuating the chronic food shortages that remain the Soviet Union's most glaring and painful failure. Viktor I. Perevedentsev, a respected Soviet demographer who himself was raised in a village, recently wrote that trying to stem the migration from farms in the Russian republic was no longer enough to save them. Only a mass resettlement of the rural areas could return the farms to productivity, he said. But given the primitive condition of the village, any voluntary return was described as less than likely. Workers, the proletariat in whose name the state purportedly rules, have likewise been drained of initiative, efficiency or pride in quality of production by 50 years of centrally imposed quotas and controls. Alcoholism, absenteeism and the habit of working only in furious spurts toward the end of a month to meet the quota have become deeply ingrained, driving productivity far below prevailing levels in the West. Mr. Gorbachev himself deplored dismal state of affairs at his meeting with the writers earlier this year. ''In 1969 we had a problem in Stavropol - what to do with meat and milk,'' he said. ''We were awash in butter. Today there is nothing. We have forgotten how to work.'' People and Leader: Grumbling or Thunder? Raised in the Russian heartland and reared in the party, Mr. Gorbachev has demonstrated a keen awareness of the problems of his country, and he has acknowledged them to a degree none of his predecessors dared. Yet it seems difficult living in the Soviet Union to find a widespread sharing of his sense of crisis, of impending thunder. If the postwar years have brought new problems and yearnings, they have also brought a rare stretch of peace and a steady improvement in comfort to a people who had known little but turmoil and tragedy. Living standards in the Soviet Union may seem primitive to an American, but most Russians remember far worse. The seamy communal apartments in which so many middle-aged Russians grew up are fading steadily into history. Food supplies, medical care and other services are inadequate and shoddy by Western criteria, but many people have learned to cope, and some to live downright well, by using the elaborate ''second economy'' of black-market goods and under-the-table services. Though by Western standards the Soviet system remains sorely deficient in guaranteeing basic liberties and rights, it has come a long way from the random terror of the Stalin era, and a mighty military machine has tempered the fear of war. Ironically, the complacency against which Mr. Gorbachev rails is also perhaps the proudest achievement of the state. This complacency, born of a cradle-to-grave security, may undermine initiative and competitiveness, but it is also the basic bond between the people and the state. Russians may grumble about the long lines and the battered cabbage, they may yearn for blue jeans and video recorders, they may worry about their children and bemoan their lost innocence, but ultimately they need not worry about tomorrow. And as long as there is no thunder, Mr. Gorbachev will find it hard to make the muzhik cross himself. ----NEXT: Change is welcomed in the arts, but other parts of society resist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION PILL EXPECTED TO BE SOLD IN EUROPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/18/us/abortion-pill-expected-to-be-sold-in-europe.html,"A French pharmaceutical company is expected to market a drug soon in Europe that a study published yesterday has shown can safely end an early pregnancy in at least 85 percent of women who take it within 10 days of missing a menstrual period. The drug is not approved for sale in the United States. The drug, now designated RU 486, for its developer, the Roussel-Uclaf Company, is also under study as a morning-after pill. It acts by blocking the action of the hormone progesterone, which is needed by the uterus to support the development of a fertilized egg. The drug is a steroid that is closely related to norethindrone, one of the oldest and most widely used synthetic contraceptive hormones. No long-term risks have been associated with continuous use of norethindrone, nor are any expected from brief, intermittent use of the new drug. An editorial in the Dec 18 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, to be published today, describes the drug as a ''major advance that will at once provide new options, yet force further difficult choices'' in a society already bitterly divided over the abortion issue. The drug is expected to be approved early next year and to come into wide use soon afterward as an alternative to surgical abortion in France and other European countries. No Marketing Plans in U.S. There are currently no plans to seek marketing approval for it in the United States, where pharmaceutical companies have encountered costly lawsuits related to reproductive drugs and where political opposition to abortion is strong. However, an American expert, Dr. Sheldon Segal, director of population sciences for the Rockefeller Foundation, said that after a year or so of ''good experience'' with the drug in Europe, some company is likely to seek marketing approval here. In the published report, a research team from Bicetre Hospital in Paris and the drug company described the study of 100 women who were treated with the drug within 10 days of missing a menstrual period. All were shown to be pregnant for two or four days before being given the drug. Within four days of starting the medication, uterine bleeding began in all the women, 85 of whom were later found to have had their pregnancies terminated by the drug therapy. The 15 women who remained pregnant were then given suction abortions. The newly reported effectiveness is significantly better than what the researchers described last summer after the drug was tested in women somewhat farther along in pregnancy. It appears to be most effective when used within five weeks of conception. Side effects were described by the researchers as minimal and readily tolerated. The most serious, heavy uterine bleeding, affected 18 women, none of whom needed a transfusion or treatment to stop the bleeding. A quarter of the women experienced painful uterine contractions when the abortion occurred. A similar proportion reported slight nausea and fatigue. The drug works by blocking receptor sites on cells where progesterone is supposed to attach. Its only other known action is blockage of cortisone receptors. However, its anticortisone effect is much less powerful, and no signs of cortisone insufficiency developed as a result of the brief treatment needed to end a pregnancy. Dr. Segal said the drug had other effects that could add to its marketing potential. For example, it might be used to treat tumors that depend on progesterone for growth, such as tumors of the breast and endometrium and other cancers of the reproductive system. The French researchers, led by Dr. Beatrice Couzinet, emphasized that, because some women bleed excessively and a sizable proportion do not abort as desired, the drug should be used only under close medical supervision. But the team concluded that ''even with these reservations, the drug offers a reasonable alternative to surgical abortion, which carries the risks of anesthesia, surgical complications, infertility and psychological sequelae.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBSERVER; Another Forget-'Em Crowd,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/20/opinion/observer-another-forget-em-crowd.html,"I couldn't wait to get my copy of People magazine and see if its list of the 25 most intriguing people of 1986 matched my own. What a letdown. Here are the usual suspects: entertainers whose photos constantly festoon news and gossip magazines, a couple of nowhere politicians (Marxist Nicaraguan Prexy Daniel Ortega and Christian U.S. would-be Prexy the Rev. Pat Robertson, for gosh sakes!), and the customary Royal Promotion Object sent over by the Brits, who this year happens to be Sarah Ferguson, poor girl. Forgive me - poor woman. This is intriguing? Surely the guys over at People magazine are testing us. They want to find out if we are all as numb as we look. Who can blame them? If we really are all sitting around in the dinner hour watching TV game shows, as polls report, maybe the collective national brain is pulsating so faintly that it's ready to believe anything, including People magazine when it says Vanna White and Chief Justice Rehnquist are 2 of the 25 most intriguing people around. Incidentally, can anybody explain this new passion for watching game shows at supper? The country used to watch game shows in the middle of the day. Then along came smutty soap operas and game shows had to nest elsewhere, but why at suppertime? You'd think by suppertime the country would be too enervated from watching soap-opera sex to enjoy the game shows' orchestrated hysterics, but it's not. As a result, the evening network news shows are probably doomed, which should please the mossbacks who always hated them anyhow. Soon, instead of Jennings, Brokaw and Rather annoying us with inconvenient reality, we will spend suppertime hoping the Pot of Gold will call or watching a nice young couple from Indiana try to win a refrigerator and an all-expenses-paid vacation in Asbury Park. I go on about all this not to change the subject, but to introduce a woman far more intriguing than anybody People magazine's intriguing-people hunters came back with. Her name is Orra Simone (pronounced Sim-oh-NAY), she lives in Charred Norton in the English Cotswolds, and she is a cat trainer. This past year Miss Simone has trained nearly 5,000 cats to watch television soap operas and game shows. When fully trained, Simone cats have an insatiable appetite for these entertainments and can be content only when observing human soap-opera performers get into bed or watching ecstatic women maul game-show emcees after winning a five-year supply of gorgonzola cheese and a den chair shaped like a keg of roofing nails. Miss Simone's purpose? She had noticed that cats, which have practically no intelligence but impeccable taste, often left home without leaving a forwarding address because they were ashamed to go on living with people who watched soap operas and game shows. By training cats to share their owners' tastes, Miss Simone can restore peace and harmony in households torn between viewing humanity and cats who feel they are trapped in the love of insufferably dim owners. Miss Simone hopes eventually to create such a cat audience for television that there will be commercials pitched at this big new market. These, creating powerful feline appetites for consumer goods, may, she believes, compel people to start giving financial allowances to their cats. ''It may sound a bit far-fetched right now,'' Miss Simone told The Charred Norton Intelligencer, ''but I remember when people also said it was far-fetched to think mom and pop would give the dear little tots enough cash to create the rock 'n' roll, blue jeans, abortion and cocaine industries. So much for the know-it-alls. Give me 15 years and you'll see Steven Spielberg making multimillion-dollar flicks about heroic teen cats cleaning up baddies in outer space.'' I submit Miss Simone is not just intriguing, but dangerously so. I can imagine some gentle, life-loving friend of civilization inquiring of certain wise guys about the cost of having her disappear permanently. Yet People magazine omits her from its list, as it omits other genuinely intriguing people. People like Alvin Carker, the crusading economist who urges everyone to start smoking three packs a day to save America from the bankruptive cost of nursing-home care for 50 million centenarians by the year 2020. And what about the infamous Hoover Mims, who pulls daring daylight bank robberies disguised as a giraffe? Instead, People gives us Ivan Boesky. That's not intriguing, People; that's just finagling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ALBANY COURT BARS UTILITIES' GIFTS TO CHARITIES FROM RATE REVENUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/20/nyregion/albany-court-bars-utilities-gifts-to-charities-from-rate-revenue.html,"The Court of Appeals ruled today that it was unconstitutional for state-regulated utilities to contribute ratepayer money to charity, saying the practice forces customers to subsidize causes they may oppose. The state's highest court, in a 5-to-2 decision, held that the practice, which is widespread, violates the right of free expression. ''Coercion results from the fact that the state establishes the rate that the customer must pay, and the rate includes an allowance for the objected-to contributions,'' the majority opinion said. ''Because the utility is a monopoly, the customer must pay or be deprived of his right to utility service.'' Opponent of Abortion The case involves a challenge by Joseph Cahill of Fishkill, N.Y. Mr. Cahill, a Roman Catholic, complained that some of the money he paid in his utility bills went to groups that encouraged abortion, which he found morally and religiously repugnant. He said his payments were also used to support other views he opposed. Unchallenged and unaffected by the decision today are charitable donations that utilities make from profits that would otherwise be paid to stockholders. Also unaffected are contributions from other private businesses, since they do not entail payments being compelled by government regulation. Mr. Cahill's suit is an individual case rather than a class action, and it is being returned to the lower courts to resolve the issues of Mr. Cahill's standing to sue, whether he exhausted other remedies and whether he filed in time. But Richard D. Emery, who represented the winning side as staff counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union, said: ''The court's language was so broad that it effectively struck down this practice. It's a ringing affirmation of First Amendment rights, protecting customers from having donations extracted, through government regulation, against their will.'' Even if the ruling is ultimately upheld, its effect on charities in general is likely to be slight since the bulk of their income comes from individuals' donations. According to ''Giving U.S.A.,'' the annual study by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, charitable contributions reached a record of $79.8 billion in 1985, and $66 billion, or 82.7 percent, came from individuals. Bequests amounted to $5.1 billion more. Foundations and corporations -including all private companies along with state-regulated utilities - made up the remainder, accounting for about $4.3 billion each. New York's utilities give millions of dollars to thousands of charities each year. A state study showed 11 of New York's biggest gas, electric and telephone companies gave $7.7 million in 1984 that was charged back to customers. Another $4.5 million was contributed from utility profits. Utilities in many states make customer-financed donations, Mr. Emery said. ''About half allow it and half don't, on the grounds that it's not germane to providing utility service,'' he said. ''But this is the first ruling dealing with the issue as a First Amendment right. It's very significant.'' A possible solution on utility contributions, Mr. Emery said, would be for utilities to offer customers a voluntary checkoff to pay above the basic rate. Mr. Cahill, a retired manager for I.B.M., learned of the donations by utilities in a local newspaper. ''I was mad about being told what charities to donate to, to get electricity,'' he said. ''I was even madder when I found out it was going to promote abortions.'' Specifically, he objected to donations to the United Way, which he said encourages abortion through its member agencies' counseling and referrals. So he sued the State Public Service Commission and the New York Telephone Company. His power company, the Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, intervened in opposition to the suit. Mr. Cahill's suit charged that the utilities commission made an unwarranted governmental intrusion into his beliefs. #1970 Policy Reversal His suit cited the P.S.C.'s decision in 1970 to allow donations to charities to be charged to customers. That reversed the policy that had restricted donations to funds from profits. He also cited subsequent P.S.C. rulings setting specific utility rates to finance such donations, based on budget requests from the utilities. Lawyers for the losing parties said they had not decided whether to appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court although Mr. Emery said he expected them to do so. If the ruling stands, the reduction in monthly utility bills will probably be negligible, utility officials said, since the savings will be spread among millions of customers. The New York Telephone Company, which court papers said gave money to thousands of charity recipients, said today it donated $7.2 million this year, from both customer revenue and profits, to a variety of welfare, educational, cultural and similar groups. The Consolidated Edison Company reported giving $3.8 million last year, $1.8 million of that paid by customers. The money is donated to thousands of agencies and institutions, including hospitals, colleges, museums and musical groups. Landmark Ruling Is Cited Today's majority opinion, written by Judge Stewart F. Hancock Jr., affirmed the State Supreme Court ruling and a 3-to-2 Appellate Division decision. In a dissent, Judge Vito J. Titone, joined by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, argued that the donations were the actions of a private company to which the P.S.C. ''merely acquiesced.'' The majority cited the United States Supreme Court's 1977 landmark ruling on Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. That decision held that school teachers' constitutional rights were violated when a union contract required them to pay union dues, part of which were spent for political activities that some teachers opposed. Mr. Emery emphasized that the Civil Liberties Union, which has been in the forefront of liberalizing abortion rights, does not agree with Mr. Cahill on that issue but is defending his right to his own views. Nor is the Civil Liberties Union opposed to charitable donations, Mr. Emery said, adding, ''We're dependent on contributions ourselves, but they're voluntary.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THE REGION; Court Browns Out Utility Give-Aways,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/weekinreview/the-region-court-browns-out-utility-give-aways.html,"It may not save New Yorkers much on their utility bills, but a ruling by the state's highest court last week may have calmed the pulses of a few wrought-up ratepayers. The Court of Appeals declared it unconstitutional for state-regulated utilities to contribute their customers' money to charity. Arguing that some ratepayers are being forced to subsidize causes -such as abortion - that they oppose, the court held, in a 5-to-2 vote, that the widespread practice violates the First Amendment right of free expression. ''Coercion results from the fact that the state establishes the rate that the customer must pay, and the rate includes an allowance for the objected-to contributions,'' the majority opinion said. ''Because the utility is a monopoly, the customer must pay or be deprived of his right to utility service.'' In 1984, according to a state study, 11 of New York's largest gas, electric and telephone companies charged their customers for $7.7 million in charitable donations. They gave away an additional $4.5 million from profits that otherwise would have been paid to stockholders, but that practice was not challenged in the suit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A SINGER AIMS TO OPEN PEOPLE'S MINDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/nyregion/a-singer-aims-to-open-peoples-minds.html,"IF pressed to describe her music, Patricia Shih calls it ''issue-oriented.'' ''It's not topical,'' said the songwriter and folk singer from Huntington, who is to give a free concert at the Hewlett-Woodmere Public Library this afternoon at 2:30. ''Topical work tends to be fleeting - quickly dated. I intend for my songs to last. They may have references to current events - things like hunger, women's rights, or the environment, for example - but they're general; general songs with meaning.'' A professional entertainer for 18 years, ever since at the age of 15 she and her singing partner in suburban Maryland talked their way into a record and performing contract, Ms. Shih has always believed that ''culture should promote social betterment.'' By following this path, she conceded that she is bucking today's trends and, therefore, could be considered a throwback to her coming-of-age days in the tumultuous 1960's, when social activism ruled the nation's campuses and influenced art. ''Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Judy Collins, Peter, Paul and Mary had terrific impact on my life,'' Ms. Shih said. ''They broadened me and my beliefs. And today, just because folk music is kind of like 'Golden Oldies,' it doesn't mean it's right. ''I mean, if nobody does it, it doesn't get done. And artists should help audiences become aware of the issues; open people's minds to different points of view.'' Billed as ''original songs of love, struggle and humor,'' her music, which she described as a kind of folk-rock, is meant to ''touch'' people. If she sees her listeners cry or laugh, she said, or nod in agreement or shake their heads in disagreement; or hears them say ''I felt that'' or ''I think that'' or ''I didn't know that,'' then she has succeeded. ''Music is not just entertainment,'' she went on. ''And I've got nothing against entertainment; I've got humorous, even nonsense songs in my repertoire, as well as love songs. But there's got to be other levels, too. There has to be the heavy with the light. Music has to touch people, in a nonthreatening way and on different levels, but still with some impact.'' So she sings of animal rights, and Amerasian children, and physical and mental handicaps, and the brotherhood of all people regardless of color, and abortion. Sometimes a headline prompts a song; other times the music comes first, and she'll ''hear'' a phrase just ''waiting for a lyric,'' she said. Sometimes, she added, the songs ''just come out intact - I don't recall who said it, but a composer once insisted he was just a 'vessel' for the creation of music, and I feel that occasionally.'' Naturally, she said, an issue-oriented performer ''has to be sensitive to an audience and try not to offend. Usually I don't, although there have been times.'' ''Ironically,'' she added, ''the biggest brouhaha I was ever involved in happened when I sang for a women's group that will remain nameless, and everybody got upset about my pro-choice song,'' referring to abortion. ''But generally, people react, even those who disagree with me, by admitting there may be another side to an issue. I mean, I'm always ready to listen, so I hope my audiences are, too.'' Despite her devotion to music, Ms. Shih has divided artistic loyalties. She is a visual artist as well as a performer and has had ''art and music tugging at me'' since her childhood. For a while, the two arts alternated. Art came first for Ms. Shih, who was born in New York City of Chinese parents, spent her infancy in Westbury and was raised in Bowie, Md. Music followed, in her teens. ''We, Gigi and Patty, were known as the 'female Simon and Garfunkel' on the Washington, D.C., pop music scene,'' she said. The art took precedence at 19 when, after that act broke up, she went to California to study painting at the San Francisco Academy of Art. It was there that the art of stained glass captivated her - and where she met the man who became her husband, Kenneth Ross, an attorney from Long Island, who was on vacation. She followed him back East in 1978, and in the eight years since has managed to work out a dual professional life while living in Huntington. Her energies are split between creating stained glass on order for decorators, and performing, either solo or with Arts With Heart, a socially oriented group of local musicians. With her 6-string and 12-string guitars; her Chinese flower drum, which is a nod in the direction of her origins; her porcelain spoons; her soprano recorder and her Marxophone, an antique instrument that is a cross between a piano and a hammered dulcimer, she has become a familiar figure on the Long Island pop music scene. She has also done a number of folk festivals, appeared in folk clubs in Manhattan and won such awards as the Cellar Door's ''Best of the Hoots'' and a New York Songwriter's Showcase. ''True, there aren't many folk clubs around, especially on the Island,'' she said, ''but I think that's all changing. I know I've had a dynamite year; worked so much that even my parents - both are retired, but my dad was with the Voice of America and my mom was a teacher - are beginning to understand what I do. ''Up to now, they thought I was just playing around, especially since my sister is a doctor and my brother's in computers, and here I was a street singer in San Francisco. That's not the Chinese ethic. In fact, I know of only two other Orientals in folk music. ''There's a folk revival under way,'' she went on. ''I'm seeing it in my audiences, which are getting younger. At one time I only used to see older people or people my age, but lately there have been teens and college kids around. ''This whole 'Live Aid,' 'We Are the World' business is making music with a message respectable again, and once the pendulum swings back, folk music and folk musicians will be ready to fill the need that will arise.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"OF CONFUCIUS, 'E.T.' AND HAPPINESS CANDY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/magazine/of-confucius-et-and-happiness-candy.html,"DURING THE 10-YEAR period (1966-76) known as The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, education in China came to a standstill. Schools closed down, teachers were persecuted and students made revolution in the streets. In the last decade, with the death of Chairman Mao Zedong and the ascension to power of Deng Xiaoping, much of the madness has subsided. On the educational front, schools are open again, teachers command respect, students struggle to pass the college entrance examinations. And as part of Deng's policy of pursuing modernization and ''opening up'' China to the West, foreign teachers have been allowed to live and work there. From August 1982 to July 1984, I was one of them. Outwardly, China has displayed an ambivalence toward this recent exposure to the West. More foreign experts, teachers, visiting lecturers and tourists are welcomed into China every year. And yet the Government remains famously chary of the infiltration of Western ideas. Travel by foreigners within China is restricted and monitored; this summer, The New York Times's correspondent John F. Burns was jailed and then expelled for making an unauthorized excursion. While I was there, during the 1983 Campaign for the Elimination of Spiritual Pollution, Socialist Beauty Experts visited factories to discourage young men and women from dressing, cutting their hair and behaving in Western style. All of which is to say that we were a good match, China and I, both of us ambitious but uninformed, naive and nervous. And so we taught each other. In 1982, I graduated from Yale University as a Chinese literature major. I was fluent in Mandarin and nearly so in Cantonese, had struggled through a fair amount of classical Chinese and had translated the works of Huang Po-Fei, a modern poet. Oddly, though, I had no real desire to go to China; it sounded like a giant penal colony to me, and besides, I have never liked traveling much. I applied to the Yale-China Association because I needed a job, and was assigned to teach English at Hunan Medical College in Changsha, a sooty, industrial city of more than a million people and the capital of the southern province of Hunan. When I arrived in Changsha, the temperature was above 100 degrees. I was 22 years old and homesick. The college assigned three classes to me: 26 doctors and teachers of medicine; four men and one woman identified as ''the Middle-Aged English Teachers,'' and 25 medical students, ages 22 to 28. I was entirely unsure what to expect from them; the reverse, I would learn, was also true. Their English ability ranged from nearly fluent to practically hopeless. At the end of the first week the Class Monitor for the class of doctors read aloud the results of their ''Suggestions for Better Study'' meeting: ''Dear Teacher Mark. You are an active boy! Your lessons are very humorous and very wonderful. To improve our class, may we suggest that in the future, we (1) spend more time reading (2) spend more time listening (3) spend more time writing, and (4) spend more time speaking. Also, some students feel you are moving too quickly through the book. However, some students request that you speed up a little, because the material is too elementary. We hope we can struggle together to overcome these contradictions! Thank you, our dear teacher.'' FOREIGNERS WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO take showers in the public bathhouse, where most Chinese bathe, so the living quarters for the American teachers was equipped with its own bathtub on the second floor. One day, returning from upstairs with a towel around my waist, I was met in my room by my supervisor from the college, a 70-year old woman named Teacher Wu, and a thin, silver-haired lady who looked about the same age. Teacher Wu, who seemed not to notice that I was half-naked and dripping, introduced us. ''Mark, this is Teacher Wei. Since you have a background in classical Chinese, she offered to teach you, in case you would like to continue your study. She is a very good teacher.'' Teacher Wei shook her head and said, ''No, no. I'm a bad teacher.'' Teacher Wu wanted to arrange a schedule then and there, but Teacher Wei pulled her out of the room, saying, ''He's wet now. I will come again tomorrow.'' After they left, I remembered that I had met Teacher Wei before, at a welcoming party thrown the day after I arrived. A student had taken me aside and said, ''Teacher Wei is a widow and has the reputation of being the strictest teacher in our college. It is said that she has never laughed out loud!'' I had no time to worry about how I would get along with mirthless Teacher Wei, however. That night I was scheduled to give a talk for which I had yet to prepare. My predecessors at the college had begun a Wednesday night ''Western culture lecture series,'' held in the largest hall in the college and open to anyone interested in learning English. We usually drew a crowd of several hundred. My topic was ''E.T.'' Before the lecture, I wrote out the events of the movie as I remembered them. Then I figured out what vocabulary I would have to introduce - for example, ''spaceship,'' ''alien,'' ''ouch,'' and ''phone home.'' I adopted a distinct facial expression, walk or tone of voice for each character, and decided to alternate between narrating and acting out the scenes. I worried that the audience might think this sort of storytelling childish, but I did not have to worry long. When I introduced E.T. by jumping on the table and hopping the length of it with my knees under my chin and my hands dragging, the audience rose to its feet and cheered. The next day, Teacher Wei arrived after xiuxi, the Chinese version of siesta. She accepted a cup of tea, put on her glasses and took a book from her cloth bag. ''We'll begin with an essay by Tao Qian,'' she said. ''He was a hermit and a famous drinker, almost 1,500 years ago. Most of the great Chinese authors were drinkers and dreamers.'' She stopped, took off her glasses, and looked closely at me. ''I saw your lecture last night, the one called 'E.T.' You are a very naughty boy!'' She took from her bag a small medicine jar and handed it to me. I opened it and found that it contained a measure of baijiu - Chinese rice liquor. ''Since we will be reading the works of drinkers and dreamers,'' she said, ''and since you are clearly an eccentric yourself, I think it only fitting that you appreciate their essays like this. From now on I will bring a small bottle of baijiu when I come. You will finish it, then we will have our lesson.'' She reached into her bag and pulled out a container of fried peanuts, still warm from the wok. ''You must have something to eat with it, of course,'' she said. ''I brought some peanuts for you. If you don't finish the wine, no lesson for you.'' I finished the baijiu and peanuts, to her great satisfaction. Then she put on her glasses and began the lesson. ON THE FIRST DAY of class, when I asked the Middle-Aged English Teachers to introduce themselves to me, each chose instead to introduce the person sitting next to him. Teacher Xu began: ''Teacher Cai was a wonderful dancer when he was a young man. He is famous in our college because he has a beautiful wife.'' Teacher Cai hit Teacher Xu and said, ''Teacher Xu is always late to class, and he is afraid of his wife!'' ''I am not!'' ''Oh, but you are!'' Teacher Zhang pointed to Teacher Zhu. ''Teacher Zhu was a navy man,'' he said. ''But he can't swim! And Teacher Du is very fat. So we call her Fatty Du - she has the most powerful voice in our college!'' Fatty Du beamed with pride and said, ''And Teacher Zhang's special characteristic is that he is afraid of me!'' ''I am not!'' ''Oh, but you are!'' On an afternoon some weeks later, I asked them to open their textbooks to a chapter entitled ''War,'' which contained photographs of World War II, including one of the atomic bomb explosion over Hiroshima. ''Teacher Zhu,'' I said, ''Can you tell us something about your experiences during the war?'' Teacher Zhu, an aspiring Communist Party member, stood up and smiled. ''Yes,'' he said. Then he hesitated. ''This is a picture of the atom bomb, isn't it?'' ''Yes.'' He smiled stiffly. ''Teacher Mark - how do you feel, knowing your country dropped an atom bomb on innocent people?'' My face turned red with embarrassment at having the question put so personally, but I tried to remain detached. ''That is a good question, Teacher Zhu. I can tell you that in America, many people disagree about this. Not everyone thinks it was the right thing to do, although most people think that it saved lives.'' ''How did it save lives?'' ''Well, by ending the war quickly.'' Here, Teacher Zhu looked around the room at his classmates. ''But Teacher Mark. It is a fact that the Japanese had already surrendered to the Communist Eighth Route Army of China. America put the bomb on Japan to make the world think America was the . . . '' ''The victor!'' shouted Fatty Du. ''Yes, the victor,'' said Teacher Zhu. I must have stood gaping for a long time, for the other students began to laugh. ''Teacher Zhu,'' I asked, ''how do you know this is a fact?'' ''Because that is what our newspapers say!'' ''I see. But our newspapers tell a different story. How can we know which newspaper has told the truth?'' Here he seemed relieved. ''That is easy! Our newspapers are controlled by the people, but your newspapers are owned by capitalist organizations, so of course they make things up to support themselves.'' My mouth opened and closed a few times. Fatty Du, apparently believing that the truth had been too much for me, came to my aid. ''It doesn't matter! Any capitalist country would do that. It is not just your country!'' My head swimming, I asked her if she thought only capitalist countries lied in the papers. ''Oh, of course not! The Russians do it, too. But here in China, we have no reason to lie in the papers. When we make a mistake, we admit it! As for war, there is nothing to lie about. China has never attacked a nation. It has only defended its borders. We love peace. If we were the most powerful country in the world, think how peaceful the world would be!'' I agreed that war was a terrible thing and said I was glad that China and the United States had become friendly. The class applauded my speech. M Y LESSONS WITH Teacher Wei came to involve more than reading and writing assignments. She was a teacher in the Chinese tradition, taking responsibility for my development as a person. She had advice for me concerning my family and friends, my diet, my clothing, my study and exercise habits. At times I got impatient with her and explained that in America, children become adults when they leave for college and like to make decisions for themselves after that. She was appalled. ''Don't your parents and teachers care about you?'' ''Of course they do, but . . . .'' ''Then how can they leave you stranded when you are only a child? And how can you possibly think you understand everything? You are only 22 years old! You are so far away from home, and I am your teacher; if I don't care about you, won't you be lonely?'' She pointed out that the close relationship between teacher and student has existed in China since before the time of Confucius and should not be underestimated. I couldn't help respecting her conviction, and she seemed to get such pleasure out of trying to figure and then straighten me out that I stopped resisting. I learned how to dress to stay comfortable throughout the year - a useful skill in a place without air conditioning or heat in most buildings - and how to behave toward teachers, students, strangers and bureaucrats, how to save books from mildew and worms, and never to do anything to excess. ''Mark, you laugh during your lectures. Why?'' ''Because, Teacher Wei, I am having fun.'' ''I see. Laugh less. It seems odd that a man laughs so hard at his own jokes. People think you are a bit crazy, or perhaps choking.'' ''Teacher Wei, do you think it is bad to laugh?'' ''No, not at all. In fact, it is healthy. We have a saying that if you laugh you will live long. But you shouldn't laugh too much, or you will have digestion problems.'' T HE SECOND YEAR I was assigned to a group known as the 1983 English Medical Class. Ranging in age from 17 to 20, they had been chosen from among hundreds of first-year medical students for their superior performance on a series of English tests. I gave them English names and tried to break them of the habit of learning everything by rote. My favorite method was to divide them into small groups, each of which had to prepare or improvise short skits based on a given situation. They were terribly shy, and at first things went slowly: ''Julian, you are a policeman. Sinbad, you are a criminal and Julian has just caught you. Have a conversation on the way to the police station.'' Silence. ''Come on, don't be nervous. You can think of something. Julian, you start.'' JULIAN: ''You are a criminal.'' SINBAD: ''I'm sorry.'' Silence. ''Sinbad, why don't you try to bribe Julian?'' SINBAD: ''Do you want some money?'' JULIAN: ''No, thank you.'' With practice, however, they became quite good at this. One assignment was to interview a Martian who had just landed on Earth. A pair of boys decided the Martian had fled here to escape persecution. A Communist, he had been condemned to death by the ruling Fascist Bourgeois Oppressors on Mars. He hoped that the earthlings would help him by setting him up with a human girl. If he got married, it would be safe to go home, for on Mars, he explained, there is a strict law against making widows. Another assignment was to invent a product, then perform a television commercial for it. Three girls walked to the front of the classroom, all with their heads hung low. One said, ''I'm unhappy. I'm very fat.'' The second shook her head and said, ''I'm unhappy, too. I'm too skinny.'' The third blushed, giggled, faced the blackboard and said, ''I'm unhappy, too. I can't find a husband.'' Suddenly, Juliet - she had chosen her own English name after hearing my ''Romeo and Juliet'' lecture - marched to the front of the classroom with a basket filled with rolled-up pieces of paper. Adopting a television announcer's huge smile and enthusiastic voice, she said, ''Ladies and gentlemen! I am pleased to tell you about a wonderful thing! It is called Juliet's Happiness Candy, and it is the most wonderful thing in the world!'' (In China, it is customary at weddings for the bride and groom to distribute ''Happiness Candy'' - any candy, preferably with the character known as ''Double Happiness'' printed on the wrapping - to their relatives and friends.) ''You must have it,'' Juliet said. ''This candy makes wishes come true. If you are too fat and you eat it, you will become skinny. If you are too skinny and you eat it, you will become fat. If you are lonely, it will help you get married. Truly, it solves all of your problems. Guaranteed - no sad, no cry.'' The three sad-looking girls ran to the desk and asked if Juliet's Happiness Candy could solve their problems. ''Of course it can,'' Juliet assured them, ''but you must buy it first.'' TEACHER MARK - CAN I trouble you? I have a relative. She is my wife's cousin. She is a doctor visiting from Harbin. She speaks very good English and is very interested in learning more. Could I take her here to practice with you? It would only be once or twice.'' Because of the overwhelming number of relatives and friends of students, not to mention perfect strangers, who wanted to learn English, I had to be protective of my time. I explained this to my student and apologized for not being able to help him. ''This is terrible,'' he said, smiling sheepishly. ''Why?'' I asked. ''Because . . . I already told her you would.'' I tried to let my annoyance show, but the harder I frowned, the more broadly he smiled, so at last I agreed to meet with her once. ''Her name is Little Mi,'' he said, much relieved. ''She is very smart and strong-willed. She was always the leader of her class and was even the head of the Communist Youth League in her school. During the Cultural Revolution, she volunteered to go to the countryside. There she almost starved to death. At last she had a chance to go to medical school. She was the smartest in her class.'' Little Mi sounded like a terrific bore; I cleared my throat, hoping that my student would simply arrange a time and let me be, but he continued. ''Her specialty was pediatrics. She wanted to work with children. When the time came for job assignments after graduation, though, some people started a rumor that she and some of the other English students read Western literature in their spare time instead of studying medicine. They were accused of fang yang pi!'' - imitating Westerners. ''So instead of being sent to a good hospital, she was sent to a small family planning clinic outside of the city. There she mostly assists doctors with abortions. That is how she works with children. But saddest of all, she has leukemia. Truly, she has eaten bitter all her life. When can I bring her?'' I told him they could come to my office in the Foreign Languages Building that evening. He thanked me extravagantly and withdrew. At the appointed time someone knocked. I braced myself for an hour of grammar questions and opened the door. There stood Little Mi, who could not have been much older than I, with a pur-(Continued on Page 56) ple scarf wrapped around her head like a Russian peasant woman. She was petite, unsmiling and beautiful. She looked at me without blinking. ''Are you Teacher Mark?'' she asked in an even, low voice. ''Yes - please come in.'' She walked in, sat down and said in fluent English, ''My cousin's husband apologizes for not being able to come. His adviser called him in for a meeting. Do you mind that I came alone?'' ''Not at all. What can I do for you?'' ''Well,'' she said, looking at the bookshelf next to her, ''I love to read, but it is difficult to find good books in English. I wonder if you would be so kind as to lend me a book or two, which I can send back to you from Harbin as soon as I finish them.'' I told her to pick whatever she liked from my shelf. As she went through the books she talked about the foreign novels she had enjoyed; ''Of Mice and Men,'' ''From Here To Eternity'' and ''The Gulag Archipelago.'' ''How did you get 'The Gulag Archipelago'?'' I asked her. ''It wasn't easy,'' she answered. ''I hear that Americans are shocked by what they read in it. Is that true?'' ''Yes, weren't you?'' ''Not really,'' she answered quietly. I remembered the story of her life my student had told. ''You are a pretty tough girl, aren't you?'' I said. She looked up from the magazine she had been leafing through with a surprised expression, then covered her mouth with her hand and giggled nervously. ''How terrible! I'm not like that at all!'' We talked for over an hour, and she picked a few books to take with her. When she got up to leave, I asked her when she would return to Harbin. ''The day after tomorrow.'' Against all better judgment I asked her to come visit me again the next evening. She eyed me closely, said ''Thank you - I will,'' then disappeared into the unlit hallway. I listened to her footsteps as she made her way down the stairs and out of the deserted building. Then from the window I watched her shadowy figure cross the athletic field. She came the next night at exactly the same time. I had brought for her a few books of photographs of the United States, and she marveled at the color pictures taken in New England during the fall. ''How beautiful,'' she said. ''Just like a dream.'' I could not openly stare at her, so I gazed at her hand as she turned the pages of the book, listened to her voice, and occasionally glanced at her face when she asked me something. We talked and talked, then she seemed to remember something and looked at her watch. It was after 10 o'clock - nearly two hours had passed. She gasped, suddenly worried. ''I've missed the last bus!'' She was staying in a hospital on the other side of the river, at least a two-hour walk. It was a bitter cold night. On foot, she would get back after midnight and arouse considerable suspicion. The only thing to do was put her on the back of a bicycle and ride her. That in itself would not attract attention, since that is how most Chinese families travel around town. I had seen families of five on one bicycle many times, and young couples ride this way for want of anything else to do at night. The woman usually rides sidesaddle on the rack over the rear wheel with her arms around the man's waist, leaning her shoulder and face against his back. A Chinese woman riding that way on a bicycle powered by a Caucasian male would attract attention, however. I put on my thick padded Red Army coat, tucked my hair under a Mao hat, wore a surgical mask (as many Chinese do, to keep dust out of their lungs), and put on a pair of Chinese sunglasses, the kind that liumang - young punks -wear. Little Mi wrapped her scarf around her head and left the building first. Five minutes later, I went out, rode fast through the gate of our college, and saw her down the street, shrouded in the haze of dust kicked up by a coal truck. I pulled alongside her and she jumped on before I stopped. The street was crowded. Neither of us said a word. Trucks, buses and jeeps flung themselves madly through the streets, bicycles wove around us, and pedestrians darted in front of us, cursing the liumang. Finally I turned onto the road that ran along the river, and the crowd thinned out. It was a horrible road, with potholes everywhere that I could not see in time to avoid. She, too shy to put her arms around my waist, had been balancing herself across the rack, but when we hit an especially deep rut I heard her yelp and felt her grab on to me. Regaining her balance, she began to loosen her grip, but I quickly steered into another pothole and told her to hold on. Very slowly, I felt her leaning her shoulder against my back. When at last her face touched my coat, I could feel her cheek through it. We reached the steep bridge and I started the climb. About halfway up she told me to stop riding, that we could walk up the bridge to give me a rest. At the top, we stopped to lean against the rail and look at the lights of the city. Trucks and jeeps were our only company. ''Does this remind you of America?'' she asked, gesturing toward the city lights with her chin. ''Yes, a little.'' ''Do you miss home?'' ''Very much. But I'll be home very soon. And when I get home, I will miss Changsha.'' ''Really? But China is so . . . no, you tell me - what is China like?'' ''The lights are dimmer here.'' ''Yes,'' she said quietly, ''and we are boring people, aren't we?'' Only her eyes showed above the scarf wrapped around her face. I asked her if she thought she was boring, and her eyes wrinkled with laughter. ''I am not boring. I believe I am a very interesting girl. Do you think so?'' ''Yes, I think so.'' She had pale skin, and I could see her eyelids blush. ''When you go back to America, will you live with your parents?'' ''No.'' ''Why not?'' ''I'm too old! They would think it was strange if I didn't live on my own.'' ''How wonderful! I wish my parents felt that way. I will have to live with them forever.'' ''Forever?'' ''Of course! Chinese parents love their children, but they also think that children are like furniture. They own you, and you aust make them comfortable until they decide to let you go. I cannot marry, so I will have to take care of them forever. I am almost 30 years old, and I must do whatever they say. So I sit in my room and dream. In my imagination I am free, and I can do wonderful things!'' ''Like what?'' She cocked her head to one side and raised one eyebrow. ''Do you tell people your dreams?'' ''Yes, sometimes.'' She laughed and said, ''I'm not going to tell you my dreams.'' We were silent awhile, then she suddenly asked me if I was a sad man or a happy man. ''That's hard to say -sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm sad. Mostly, I just worry.'' ''Worry? What do you worry about?'' ''I don't know - everything, I guess. Mostly about wasting time.'' ''How strange! My cousin's husband says that you work very hard.'' ''I like to keep busy. That way I don't have time to worry.'' ''I can't understand that. You are such a free man -you can travel all over the world as you like, make friends everywhere. You are a fool not to be happy, especially when so many people depend on it.'' ''What do you mean?'' ''My relative says that your nickname in the college is huoshenxian - an immortal in human form - because you are so . . . different. Your lectures make everyone laugh, and you make people feel happy all the time. This is very unusual.'' I asked her if she was happy or sad. She raised one eyebrow again, looking not quite at me. ''I don't have as many reasons to be happy as you.'' She looked at her watch and shook her head. ''I must get back - we have to hurry.'' As I turned toward the bicycle she leaned very close to me, almost touching her face against mine, looking straight into my eyes, and said, ''I have an idea.'' I could feel her breath against my throat. ''Let's coast down the bridge,'' she said. ''Fast! No brakes!'' I got on the bicycle. ''Are you getting on?'' I asked her. ''Just a minute. At the bottom I'll get off, so I'll say goodbye now.'' ''I should at least take you to the gate of the hospital.'' ''No, that wouldn't be a good idea. Someone might see me and ask who you were. At the bottom of the bridge I'll hop off, and you turn around. I won't see you again, so thank you. It was fun meeting you. You should stop worrying.'' She jumped on, pressed her face against my back, held me like a vice, and said, ''Now - go! As fast as you can!''

'PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME A JOKE',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/books/please-don-t-make-me-a-joke.html,"MARILYN By Gloria Steinem. Photographs by George Barris. 182 pp. New York: Henry Holt & Company. $24.95. ON June 1, 1962, her 36th birthday, Marilyn Monroe began what would be her final attempt to tell her story. Lies had been told about her, she insisted, and she was going to set the record straight. In addition to the biographical information she had contributed in interviews over the years, she had launched a previous full-scale autobiography in conjunction with the novelist and playwright Ben Hecht. Minus the name of its co-author, ''My Story,'' as that unfinished manuscript was called, was published in 1974 and reissued in paperback this year. For her new venture Marilyn Monroe also had a collaborator, a photojournalist, George Barris. Mr. Barris was obviously a sympathetic co-adjutant. Through June and July Marilyn talked and posed - and drank champagne. Mr. Barris took many soft gentle pictures of her, in bathing suit, towels, beach robe, sweater. But this project, too, was not completed. On Aug. 4 Marilyn Monroe died of an overdose of sleeping pills. More than two decades later, Mr. Barris turned over his photographs to Gloria Steinem for use in her present thoughtful and absorbing biography of the actress. Whether Marilyn Monroe, a chronic insomniac, intended to kill herself, or only to get some rest, will probably never be known, though we learn from Ms. Steinem's careful investigation that Marilyn's achieved death followed seven or eight near misses. Still a young woman, she had said of herself, ''Yes, there was something special about me, and I knew what it was. I was the kind of girl they found dead in a hall bedroom with an empty bottle of sleeping pills in her hand.'' She didn't die in a hall bedroom but the empty pill bottle is everywhere in Mr. Barris's pictures of her, perhaps especially when, below vacant eyes, she forces her famous smile, radiant and full of promise. The sessions with Mr. Barris had taken place in her new Brentwood home. She had not been in it long: it was still being renovated and Marilyn had only recently returned from Mexico where she had gone to buy furniture. By movie star standards it was a modest dwelling. Marilyn is reported to have been naively proud of having a swimming pool in her backyard. But, in fact, she was no longer a star. Worn down by sleeplessness and her dependence on drugs and alcohol, unable to take direction, she had been fired from a film fittingly titled ''Something's Got to Give.'' To be dropped from a film while it is being shot is not a minor event in an actress's life. It had been well-advertised that Marilyn consistently arrived late on the set and that some days she didn't arrive at all. We now learn that often, when she did come to work, she was so frightened that she threw up at the gate. Her dismissal proclaimed to the world that her movie career was at an end. It is questionable if Monroe had ever had a gift for acting, other than as an overflow of her good humor -professional opinion would seem to have been divided in the matter. On the positive side, according to Ms. Steinem's account, Lee Strasberg rated her with Marlon Brando as ''one of his most talented pupils.'' And John Huston said, ''She went right down into her own personal experience for everything, reached down and pulled something out of herself that was unique and extraordinary. She had no techniques. It was all the truth, it was only Marilyn.'' But whatever her talent or its absence - and certainly a capacity, like Marilyn Monroe's, for self-irony is a great asset in a comedian - movies and movie making were at the heart of her life. She had been born and raised in Hollywood. She was an illegitimate child; her father had run off before her birth - when Marilyn wanted to create this parent she visualized him as Clark Gable. During the brief periods that she was able to be with her daughter, before disappearing forever into a mental hospital, Marilyn's mother was employed in film studios. Shunted as a child between orphanage and foster homes, all Marilyn could turn to were the movies to instruct her in a world that offered more than barrenness. AT her death people charged Hollywood with having destroyed Marilyn Monroe; they accused the movie industry of ruthlessly exploiting her for its own gain. It was an unjust charge, or at least a muddled one. The Hollywood that made Marilyn Monroe into a sex goddess, the phantom object of every man's desire, also gave her fragile life all the structure and substance it ever had. It is a cruel paradox that this most abundantly endowed of women, whose public personality spoke to us only of sunlight and joy, was a creature of shadows, emotionally so much adrift that she required constant reassurance of her worth and even of her existence. The fact that she responded as she did to the collapse of her career can be taken, I think, as evidence of her insufficent sense of identity. For most people autobiography is an extension and defense of the self. Marilyn Monroe had little self to extend or defend. In repeating the sad dull cliches of orphanage and poverty she undertook to supply the self that she lacked. From bits and pieces of memory or fantasy she tried to fill the empty vessel of her being. Gloria Steinem's biography is a quiet book; it has none of the sensationalism that has colored other purportedly serious books about the film star, Norman Mailer's in particular. But it necessarily reports on Marilyn's sexual life. Although Marilyn Monroe cannot fairly be said to have slept her way to the top, she did at the start of her career sleep her way to the opportunity to work. After that, world famous, she continued to be vastly compliant: she slept with men, and on occasion even with another woman, in order to please - perhaps also to feel herself made real by their desire for her. Apparently the ability to give rather than receive pleasure in sex was the whole of her delight. Practiced in the arts of accommodation, she flattered many men into believing that they were the first to satisfy her. It was her boast that she had never been kept. But financial independence was one of her few expressions of strength. Ms. Steinem suggests that Marilyn's loneliness in the early days when she was earning her poor living by modeling or as a starlet was caused by her great neediness; the other girls were put off by the force of her emotional demand. Through three marriages - the first was arranged for her at 15 by fond but incompetent guardians - and numberless sexual encounters the neediness persisted. For someone who asked so much in emotional support her choice of husbands - the ballplayer Joe DiMaggio and the playwright Arthur Miller - would seem to have been unfortunate. They were unable to sustain her to the degree that she required. And apparently her later lovers, conspicuous among them Frank Sinatra and Robert Kennedy, were similarly inappropriate. Delving more closely than Arthur Schlesinger does into Marilyn's relation with Robert Kennedy, Ms. Steinem gives us a pitiful picture of Marilyn trying to convince herself that she will soon marry the Attorney General. She obviously pleased Robert Kennedy just as, during the 1960 Presidential campaign, she had pleased his brother Jack. But Marilyn Monroe was designed for wish-fulfillment, not for wifehood or public companionship with government leaders. (As to whether there was actual criminality in the circumstances surrounding her death, or merely an effort to sweep the premises clean of embarrassing evidence, Ms. Steinem seems to be in general agreement with the original conclusions of Anthony Summers in his popular biography ''Goddess'' that no crime was committed that night but there was a highly irregular cover-up of Marilyn's affair with Bobby. Ms. Steinem could, of course, not know the questions about the possibility of foul play that Mr. Summers raises in a postscript to the new paperback edition of his biography.) Nor, it would appear, was she designed for motherhood. She longed for children and had great empathy with them; perhaps this was because she was herself always a child, essentially unmarked by her experience - no doubt her ''innocence'' had much to do with her unparalleled appeal to people in all walks of life. Laurence Olivier, who played with her in ''The Prince and the Showgirl,'' said of her, ''Look at that face - she could be five years old.'' One of her suicide attempts followed a miscarriage during her marriage to Arthur Miller. But she had had a dozen or more abortions. Monroe's life was one of contradiction and pathos, as lives of emotional hollowness and disconnection often are. One might suppose that a pathology such as hers would be especially common among actors: they are in the business of borrowing personalities which they wear like clothes from a stage wardrobe. But it is far from restricted to professions that live by public display. It frighteningly proliferates in our time, crowding out of the clinic the old-fashioned neuroses for whose treatment psychoanalysis was specifically devised. In writing about Marilyn Monroe, Gloria Steinem for the most part admirably avoids the ideological excess that we have come to associate with the women's movement - Monroe emerges from her book a far more dimensional figure than she would have been if she had been presented as simply the victim of a male-dominated society. It is only when she deals with Monroe's quest for help with her emotional problems that Ms. Steinem becomes incautious and passes unfounded clinical judgments. That Freud regarded women as the second sex, charmingly puzzling but inferior to men, is scarcely arguable. This sexual bias cannot be overlooked by any prideful woman but it does not account, as Ms. Steinem would have it do, for the failure of Freudian psychoanalysis to cure Monroe. Marilyn Monroe was in the care of Freudian psychoanalysts but she was not being psychoanalyzed; she was in psychoanalytically derived supportive treatment. The distinction is important. Patients with her emotional affliction are not available to orthodox analysis. Ms. Steinem names Marilyn's California physician, Dr. Ralph Greenson; she omits mention of her New York doctor, Dr. Marianne Kris, to whom she left a considerable portion of her estate for use in psychoanalytical research. Were she to have been in orthodox Freudian analysis, Monroe could not of course have simultaneously had two physicians, one on each coast. Unhappily, medicine has not yet found a cure or even a confident therapy for Marilyn Monroe's personality disorder. Ms. Steinem quotes extensively from a work by Dr. W. Hugh Missildine, ''Your Inner Child of the Past'': it seems to serve as her psychiatric authority. While these passages sensitively report on how people behave when they have been neglected in childhood, they propose no method of treatment. EVEN Ms. Steinem's well-researched book falls short of fully documenting the role of heredity in Marilyn's psychic illness. It isn't only that Marilyn Monroe was manic-depressive and had a severe character disorder; by her own account in ''My Story'' her mother died insane, her mother's father died insane, her mother's grandmother died insane, her mother's brother killed himself. But our culture is a blame culture. It prefers to address only those ills that excite our moral indignation and to ignore the terrors of fate. Marilyn Monroe didn't view herself as a tragic figure; she didn't give herself that much weight. But she begged to be taken seriously and to be regarded as someone with ideas and opinions worth hearing. One of her most moving requests was made of an unnamed interviewer near the close of her life; it was not granted but it is remembered by her press secretary. ''Please don't make me a joke. End the interview with what I believe.'' One can wish that she had been told she wasn't a joke: a sex idol who read books! The truth is that she was unusually intelligent. Indeed, as uneducated as she believed herself to be, she gave distinct signs of literary gift. Professional writers might envy the terse description of her ill mother in ''My Story'': ''Even the sound of a page turning made her nervous,'' or her use of telling detail when she speaks of the poverty of Aunt Grace, her early guardian, ''I remembered how she had gone with one of her lenses missing from her glasses for three months because she couldn't afford the fifty cents to buy its replacement.'' Surely we are reminded of the everyday luminousness of F. Scott Fitzgerald and the strange sorrow that overhangs his work when Marilyn Monroe remarks of herself, ''I am not interested in money. I just want to be wonderful.'' EMBARRASSED FOR MONROE As a teen-ager in blue-collar East Toledo, Ohio, taking dance lessons as a means ''of dancing my way out of the neighborhood,'' Gloria Steinem walked out of a Marilyn Monroe sex comedy because she felt ''embarrassment and humiliation - for her and for me.'' Yet in writing ''Marilyn,'' the 52-year-old author said she felt ''empathy and connected'' to Monroe. ''The things that happened to her were things the women's movement has tried to prevent,'' Ms. Steinem said recently in her favorite East Side coffee shop. ''We lived through similar times and circumstances, but I was luckier.'' Like Monroe, Ms. Steinem comes from a working-class background. Her parents separated when she was about 9. She took care of her mother, an invalid whose ''spirit was broken,'' in the family home where survival depended on boarders. Ms. Steinem had written of Monroe for Ms. magazine in 1972, noting that problems the actress saw as uniquely hers, such as guilt over not having children, were felt by many women to be their own a decade after her death. It was this article, included in a book of Ms. Steinem's essays, that prompted Henry Holt & Company to ask her to write a text for pictures of Monroe taken by a photojournalist, George Barris, shortly before her death. Why did she agree? ''One aspect of writing about a woman like Marilyn is that you feel you're exploiting her all over again,'' she said. But Ms. Steinem spends a lot of time raising funds for feminist causes and saw writing - something she enjoys - as a way to donate her money from the book to a new organization: the Marilyn Monroe Children's Fund within the Ms. Foundation for Women. ''Not to be presumptive, I thought Marilyn would like to see the money go to children's projects.''

TEACHING THE HUMANE TOUCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/magazine/teaching-the-humane-touch.html,"ON A RECENT Wednesday morning, six people sat in the waiting room at the walk-in clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. A young man in a white coat, a stethoscope bobbing around his neck, approached one of them. ''My name is Michael Gillette,'' he told a patient in his mid-30's whose neck was in a brace. ''I'm a second-year medical student at Harvard, and if it's O.K. with you, I'd like to interview you before the doctor sees you.'' The man was suffering from a dull ache in his back that was keeping him from his engineering job; one doctor had diagnosed the problem as a herniated disk, and had recommended surgery. The engineer wanted a second opinion. Although Mr. Gillette asked several questions about his specific symptoms, he focused more on the patient's life at home and on the job. ''I haven't slept in my bed for several days,'' the engineer told the Harvard student. ''I've been sleeping in a recliner chair in the living room.'' As he talked, the man seemed unaware of his role in Michael Gillette's unusual medical education. Mr. Gillette and 60 other students at the Harvard Medical School - almost one-fifth of the students in the first- and second-year classes - are part of the New Pathway, an experimental program designed to help students understand and utilize the influence of family, society and culture in treating a patient's illness. Harvard's year-old New Pathway program stresses medical education's traditional goals of scientific and technical mastery, but it also emphasizes an untraditional ''humanistic'' approach to doctoring. In addition to attending lectures, New Pathway students learn basic science and clinical skills in small tutorials in which they study not only the scientific aspects of disease, but its impact on patients' lives. In most traditional medical programs, students do not meet patients until the beginning of their third year of school; New Pathway students meet their first patients during the initial few weeks of classes. Each student works closely with one experienced physician-preceptor throughout the four years. And weekly tutorials draw upon the social sciences and the humanities - disciplines not usually included in the medical mix - to explore issues that affect the doctor-patient relationship. Harvard's is one of an increasing number of programs around the country that are formalizing the teaching of social responsibility, ethics and ''patient-centered'' medicine as part of medical discipline. A 1985 survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges showed that 112 of the country's 126 four-year medical schools now require courses in doctor-patient relationships, communication skills and cultural, social and ethical issues. The new programs are a part of a broader movement, ''medical humanism,'' that is gaining strength - and sparking controversy - in the medical community. ''The debate over how to make doctors more compassionate is not new,'' says Allan M. Brandt, an assistant professor of the history of medicine and science at Harvard. ''What is new is that more and more medical schools are recognizing that it is important to specifically address this area. The biomedical model that said 'Specific disease, let's find it; specific treatment, let's give it' has become inadequate.'' The medical-humanism movement stems from a belief that physicians have become distanced from their patients because of the explosion of new medical technologies, the increasingly cost-conscious nature of medicine and the emergence of a more demanding, litigious and knowledgeable breed of patient. The movement rests on two premises: that the expansion of scientific knowledge has left little time for compassion, intuition and ingenuity - what the physician and essayist Richard Selzer calls ''the trinity of doctorhood'' - in the practice of medicine; and that it is the medical schools' responsibility to revive these qualities. ''If all physicians are taught is how to pass a catheter, that's all they'll know how to do,'' says Dr. August G. Swanson, the director of the department of academic affairs for the Association of American Medical Colleges. ''Many of the programs dealing with 'humanism' or 'humanistic studies' are really directed toward broadening physicians' views.'' There is a serious and widespread debate, however, about whether a humanistic approach to doctoring can be taught, or whether it should be a mandatory part of medical education. Some question whether so vague a concept as medical humanism can be instilled in students already overburdened with courses in anatomy, biochemistry and immunology. ''You might do it to impress society, but I have no use for a course in being human,'' says Dr. Henry M. Seidel, the associate dean for student affairs at Johns Hopkins Medical School. Harvard administrators, however, reject the idea that scientific education and humanism are in conflict. ''To say the New Pathway is developing more humane physicians at the expense of science-rooted competence would be wrong,'' says Dr. Daniel C. Toste-(Continued on Page 52) son, Harvard Medical School dean. ''We are after a better balance between the natural scientific, the social scientific and the humanities aspects of medicine.'' Mr. Brandt agrees: ''The fact is, we can teach students how to communicate effectively with their patients.'' T HE PRACTICE OF medicine has evolved dramatically over the last seven decades, but medical education has changed very little since 1910. In that year, Abraham Flexner, an educator on the staff of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, published a critique of North American medical schools that fostered a new system of medical education. The Flexner model stressed lectures, memorization and laboratory work, and divided medical school into two distinct parts - the first half devoted to the basic sciences, the second to clinical training. As scientific discovery has filled the physician's black bag with an ever-growing cache of technology, however, doctors have had to narrow the scope of their expertise. The consequence, say some experts, has been the destruction of important bonds between doctors and patients. ''The connections that allowed physicians and patients to avoid the trap of depersonalization have been systematically severed,'' says Dr. Robert S. Lawrence, associate professor of medicine at Harvard and one of the original planners of the New Pathway. What is more, the contemporary patient is better informed about health and disease than ever before, and consequently is quicker to doubt physicians' approaches. This has contributed to a rise in malpractice suits, making doctors even more distanced from their patients. So too, increasing government involvement in health-care has, in the opinion of many physicians, also complicated doctor-patient relationships. Concern over this growing divide has impelled calls for change. In a 1984 report entitled ''Physicians for the 21st Century,'' for example, an education panel of the Association of American Medical Colleges stated: ''The pace of medical education and of technology's increasing permeation of patient care is such that students need special assistance in perceiving the human dimensions of choices and in developing empathy with their patients.'' In addition to Harvard, scores of other medical schools, public and private, are now trying to address the humanistic side of medicine. Their approaches vary. Some schools tackle them with single, mandatory survey courses. At the University of California at San Francisco, for example, students are required to complete a course in medical ethics, jurisprudence, economics and sociology. Other schools, such as Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, offer series of seminars that focus on physicians' reactions to emotional and ethical issues and on the importance of psychosocial forces in medical treatment. Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons created its Center for the Study of Society and Medicine in 1982, to address the ''humanities gap'' in doctoring. The center's staff includes seven historians, political theorists, lawyers, sociologists and literature professors who teach elective courses and a course on society and medicine that all second-year Columbia students are required to take. ''As formally and traditionally taught, medicine does not have the answers to questions it is now facing,'' says David Rothman, the center's director. The center and other medical-humanism programs are ''a self-conscious effort to alert students to the universe in which they're going to practice.'' H ARVARD'S NEW Pathway, which was established last year after three years of planning, is one of the most structured and comprehensive efforts to teach humanistic concerns in a medical-school setting. ''Many educators are keeping an eye on Harvard,'' says Dr. Swanson of the Association of American Medical Colleges, who heads an independent committee that is charged with evaluating the program's progress. Students, too, are showing interest. Of the 165 men and women accepted for Harvard Medical School's class of 1989, 72 asked to be considered for the first New Pathway class. Twenty-four were chosen by lottery (one later dropped out). For the class of 1990, 76 students expressed interest; 38 were accepted. The New Pathway departs radically from the traditional approach to medical education. Although students still study basic science in large lecture courses during their first two years, their time is concentrated in small tutorials of six to eight students. In addition, at least one-third of a student's time is set aside for independent study, electives and research. New Pathway tutorials stress a case-study method of education similar to the one practiced at Harvard's law and graduate business schools; students attempt to come to grips not only with the biological complexities of an individual patient's problems, but with the psychosocial aspects as well. Students might consider, for example, the difficulties in diagnosing a ''hateful patient'' with a fear of doctors, or the special psychological demands of a terminally ill patient. In traditional curriculums, these subjects generally are not discussed in the classroom but, rather, are left for students to discover for themselves during internships and residencies. The case-study method in particular is attracting widespread interest, the more so because Harvard Medical School's administrators are considering merging it with the traditional curriculum within the next several years. ''If a faculty of Harvard's reputation adopts this method across the board and shows that it is feasible,'' says Dr. Swanson, ''it will have a major impact on other faculties.'' The medical school's curriculum committee is voting this month on whether to allow all departments to follow the New Pathway's methods. In addition to tutorials in basic science, the New Pathway offers other small weekly classes to discuss nonscientific issues and attitudes that affect the quality of care doctors provide. Among the issues covered in these classes are the cultural differences between doctors and patients, society's attitudes about AIDS, abortion or cigarette smoking, and the increasingly corporate structure of health care. The small size of New Pathway tutorials is designed to encourage cooperation (Continued on Page 55) among medical students in understanding both the medical and social complexities of patients' problems. ''Physicians will not be aware of the power of empathic behavior unless the program in which they work exemplifies that,'' says Dr. Gordon Moore, the director of the program. ''The degree to which we model partnership and participation and the students as people, the more successful we will be.'' Students say that in these classes they are able to examine the murky aspects of doctoring - attitudes and values - by drawing on the opinions of their classmates and on other disciplines, such as history, anthropology, sociology, economics, ethics and philosophy. ''You develop a healthy frustration with not knowing,'' says the second-year student Michael Gillette, ''and the motivation that comes from that is amazing.'' Students are motivated further by their opportunity to apply social insights gained in the classroom to the patients they begin seeing in their first few weeks of school. ''When you study, you're reading on paper what might walk in the door at any minute,'' says Mr. Gillette. In one recent class, six second-year students considered the changing implications of treating uninsured patients. After one student noted the long tradition of physicians' charging well-to-do patients a little more in order to subsidize their care for the needy, others speculated that increasing bureaucracy in health care meant doctors were not as free as in the past to take such independent action. When they became physicians, several students asked, would they be able to strike their own balance? Forcing students to confront perplexing, nonscientific questions is among the New Pathway's goals. ''The way we normally teach medicine - saying there is a body of material out there that is truth - is much more reassuring,'' says Dr. Moore. ''But eventually, students will practice in a world that is constantly confusing and messy. Uncertainty is an important part of what all physicians and patients have to deal with, and to do so you have to live in it and learn to be effective in that setting.'' ONE OF THE MOST SIG-nificant criticisms of medical-humanism education is that it detracts from medical education. ''Science is the fundamental basis of medicine and there is no way we can diminish it,'' says Dr. Richard S. Ross, the dean of Johns Hopkins Medical School. ''I don't think there's time for humanities courses in medical school.'' Some New Pathway students fear that may be true. ''At first, a lot of people talked about whether or not we would be able to pass the boards,'' says Dawn E. DeWitt, a first-year New Pathway student, referring to the tests that students take to become licensed as physicians. Dr. Moore calls the distinction between humanities and science a false dichotomy. ''When we define humanism as a separate entity from bioscientific competence we do ourselves a disservice,'' he said. ''The two are as important as the front and back of the hand.'' Dr. Brandt agrees. ''This is not just cultural window dressing,'' he says. ''Instead of telling students that a humanistic outlook is important, we're trying to get them thinking about the clinical utility of the range of issues that will bring a patient into their offices. It's a new model of effective therapeutics.'' The model, however, can be faulty. Even the Association of American Medical Colleges, which generally supports the drive to incorporate humanistic education into medical-school curriculums, concedes that some programs, particularly those that concentrate their efforts on simple elective courses, may be ill-conceived. ''The piecemeal introduction of courses into preclinical curricula is not likely to influence students' orientation'' as much as programs that integrate humanistic concerns into the essential fabric of the curriculum, the college association's 1985 survey concluded, The survey also found barriers to the introduction of effective programs at many medical schools. ''New programs are time-consuming to create, the most vulnerable to budget axes, and not likely to be taken as seriously as established courses,'' it said. In addition, the report (Continued on Page 72) said many medical faculty members, though paying ''lip service'' to the ''art'' of medicine, act ''as if medicine is hard science and human-values education is soft and therefore extraneous.'' Some critics, like Dr. Seidel at Johns Hopkins, say that society plays a larger role in tempering physicians' attitudes than does education. ''Physicians should always be caring - I don't think that's an issue,'' he says. ''But are we a caring society? All these programs won't really matter unless society changes.'' But, counters Mr. Rothman of Columbia's Center for the Study of Society and Medicine: ''The message to future physicians is quite clear -that mastery of technology is not the beginning and end of medical education. The practice of medicine will require you to navigate in the realm of values and ultimately to respond to more than what is on the chart.'' A T MASSACHUSETTS GEN-eral's walk-in clinic, Michael Gillette felt that there might be more to the engineer's back problem than what was written on his medical chart. In his interview with the engineer, Mr. Gillette was careful to ask open-ended questions - New Pathway students are urged to encourage patients to explain their ''agenda,'' their reasons for coming in. Although any good doctor ordinarily would try to glean personal information that might pertain to a patient's ailment, many experts feel that the technological and financial pressures of modern medicine leave little time for this. Mr. Gillette, however, had little choice but to ask nonscientific, ''patient-centered'' questions; as an early second-year student, he lacked the medical knowledge to arrive at a diagnosis. ''Compassion is all I can offer,'' he said. The engineer told the Harvard student that he had no history of back trouble, but his answers indicated that nonphysiological factors might be contributing to his problem. There were deadlines to meet at work, and at home, his wife was eight months pregnant with their first child. In the end, the physician serving as Mr. Gillette's preceptor agreed that the engineer was probably suffering from a herniated disk; but he advised the patient to consider waiting several months before having surgery, to see whether his pain would lessen when his current stresses subsided. Michael Gillette, the New Pathway student who provided much of the background that allowed the doctor to make his diagnosis, thought his lack of expertise served him well. ''You don't have a lot of the equipment that can impede getting the patient's story,'' he said. ''All you have is the ability to interrelate warmly and openly with people.'' He hoped that would make him a better doctor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SING TO HEAVEN A NEW SONG,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/books/sing-to-heaven-a-new-song.html,"WOMEN-CHURCH Theology and Practice of Feminist Liturgical Communities. By Rosemary Radford Ruether. 306 pp. San Francisco: Harper & Row. $16.95. FLANNERY O'CONNOR once wrote, ''To the deaf, you must shout! And to the near-blind, you must draw large, wild pictures.'' Sometimes it seems as though Rosemary Radford Ruether thinks all of us are deaf and near-blind. But then one must remember to whom Ms. Ruether is used to talking: the Roman Catholic Church - an institution not renowned, as far as feminists are concerned, for its ability either to hear or to see. Ms. Ruether, a professor of theology at Garret-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston, Ill., and author of many books, including ''Sexism and God-Talk,'' deserves a good deal of credit for simply staying in dialogue with this church over the 25 years in which she has taught, lectured and written. It's no wonder, perhaps, that in the process she has lost a measure of moderation. In the first part of ''Women-Church'' (there are two sections; the first on theology, the second on practice) Ms. Ruether articulates yet again, with brilliance and sway, her comprehensive feminist theology. She argues broadly that ''the churches we have inherited have confused patriarchy and Christianity,'' that women have been determinedly erased from religious history, and that, more specifically, a pattern of ''promise and betrayal'' toward women has always been characteristic of religious renewal groups. She calls for a new kind of community of faith - ''Women-Church'' - to exist side by side, not schismatically, with parent church institutions. She defines ''Women-Church'' as an antihierarchical ''exodus community'' of ''liberation from patriarchy.'' Her thinking, as usual, is sweeping and synthetic, and her historiography is important. Still, I can't help feeling alienated by her lapses into the unbridled. Quoting from a sermon she once delivered, she writes, ''The temples of patriarchy have disfigured and hidden our true Mother and Teacher, and replaced her with a great mechanical idol with flashing eyes and smoking nostrils who spews out blasphemies and lies.'' Ms. Ruether sees her feminism, like that of liberation theology, as being of a piece with the prophetic tradition that serves to expose, in her words, ''the corruption of religion as a justification of oppression and as a means of ignoring the issues of justice.'' In and of itself, of course, exposing oppression is a worthy undertaking. Coupled as it is, though, with Ms. Ruether's heightened prophetic metabolism - vatic, blindered, occasionally unhinged - it can also point dangerously to a kind of fundamentalism. One measure of Catholic feminists' fierce debarment from the Church, actually, can be inferred from how old-fashioned Ms. Ruether's feminism is: reading ''Women-Church'' - particularly the section on liturgies -feels almost like going back in time. Where else in this country, in this era of assimilation, is feminism still reactive, angry, full of revolutionary intellectual brimstone? Ms. Ruether's Women-Church is in the tradition of separatist (''the last shall be first'') as opposed to classical (''the last shall be integrated'') feminism. To be sure, she insists that her Women-Church is separatist only ''as a stage in a process'' and not as an ideology. But as Cynthia Ozick once pointed out: ''Separatism quickly becomes a characteristic, not a strategy, of feminism. The so-called temporary has an ineluctable inclination to turn into long-range habit.'' Many of the liturgies in ''Women-Church,'' I'm afraid, already bear this tendency out. These liturgies were written for many occasions by a variety of women. Some representative texts are: ''Ritual of Moving From an Old House to a New House,'' ''Rite of Healing From an Abortion,'' ''Good Friday Walk for Justice,'' ''Puberty Rite for a Young Woman,'' ''Earth Day Celebration'' and ''Menopause Liturgy.'' The fact that women are taking the writing of core liturgies into their own hands - after millenniums - is, in and of itself, an exciting rite of passage. It's fundamental, then, that these ceremonies be written well. By and large they are not - though they do evince a challenging new sense of range for liturgy. Part of the problem here is with Ms. Ruether herself, whose judgments in this section have only to do with the political. She seems to have no interest at all in language, in what Mircea Eliade calls hierophanies (manifestations of the sacred) or, most importantly, in any of the primary questions of liturgy. Some of the latter - to suggest just a few - are: What is the usefulness of familiar patterns in liturgy? What are the problems inherent in crafting ''new antiques?'' When is prayer a matter of symbolic thinking and when of cognition? How does one create esthetic balance in a religious service? At what point do prayers become so tailored to the self that they cease to work? How is worship different from therapy? The writing of good feminist texts is such a critical current religious task that it's hard to imagine that a serious book of feminist liturgies has been put together without raising these questions. Then, too, in creating new rites, there are respectful questions of psychology to be broached. For example, how will it feel for a 12-year-old to have a group ceremony celebrating her menstruation? Or what are the implications of a dying person's telling others, through a religious rite, what to do after she is dead? The results of Ms. Ruether's approach -in which politics is very often the doctrine for which liturgy is the vehicle (a dog wagged by a tail) - are more than a few ceremonies with unfortunate lines like these: ''Rapists are the shock troops of patriarchy, while wife batterers are the army of occupation'' (from ''Rite of Healing for Wife Battering''); ''This is the apple of consciousness raising. Let the scales of false consciousness fall from our eyes. . . .'' Another knot has to do with Ms. Ruether's rather narrow and strenuous definition of authentic liturgy. It must be, she writes, ''done with real intentionality and meaning'' and requires ''a lot of energy. . . . We should properly be both exhilarated and exhausted when we have truly worshiped.'' But isn't the role of prayer - besides exhausting us - also to comfort, to provide community, to point quietly to eternity? To help us be tender toward the smallest things? To say thanks? To put us in a room with our dead grandparents, and the dead, very distant, generations? Doesn't spiritual expansiveness derive often from liturgical simplicity and understatement? Isn't liturgy also a matter of cosmic empathy? Still, despite the narrowness of the terms here, there are some wonderful ceremonies among these selections, including a very beautiful ''Coming-Out Rite for a Lesbian''; a sensitive ''Rite of Healing From a Miscarriage or a Stillbirth''; a moving and grave ''Ash Wednesday Liturgy: Repentance for the Sins of the Church'' that involves the singing of two songs simultaneously from opposite sides of the congregation (''The Church's One Foundation'' and ''Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?''); and a lighthearted Christmas processional that strikes a balance between songs, liturgical candles, practical information about homelessness and a rowdy party. On the other hand, various other ceremonies take what feels like a mix-and-match approach to rites, employing one or several of the following: group hugs, candles, circles, communal baths, laying on of hands, lying in a circle touching one another's stomachs, sprinkling grains into a furrow around one's house, moaning together. Some of these ceremonies work reasonably well; others don't. THERE is a free-floating sense that one's gender somehow posits an intrinsic affinity for anything at all sensate and that only a woman out of touch with her estrogens would be traitorous enough to take issue. I take issue not as a traitor at all, but out of loyalty to feminism: first, because the random nature of some of these rites tends to encumber them with self-consciousness and artificiality; second, because these rituals are sometimes not statements of liturgy at all, but of community, of tribe. One doesn't create community through group hugs; in fact, when the community is a real one, one generally gets by on much less. My main concern, of course, is that in writing liturgical texts, feminists not sequester themselves from other sensibilities, from other fields of expertise or from questions of esthetics. That would be giving the cause a severe blow. Also, wouldn't it be more profoundly clever and coherent for Ms. Ruether to be arguing strenuously at this point for the aggressive drafting of men into Women-Church? For one thing, this would have a prophylactic effect on the writing of rituals and liturgies (a crucial endeavor). For another, it would accelerate bringing the movement into the mainstream - an ultimate goal Ms. Ruether claims to be seeking. Over this next decade, the writing and rewriting of texts will be the homework for feminists in religion. Rosemary Radford Ruether, as usual, is leading the effort. There is no doubt that this volume - despite its problems - is a whole step along the way. The Talmud tells the story of a student of Rabbi Eliezer's who used to study silently. After three years, the story goes, the student forgot everything he learned. Fortunately Ms. Ruether - though she may talk too loud or draw too large - is in no danger of doing that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AMERICA AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH: CONFLICTS WITH ROME AND WITHIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/24/world/america-and-the-catholic-church-conflicts-with-rome-and-within.html,"Long before it was popular to do so, a Roman Catholic clergyman from the United States favored celebrating mass in English instead of Latin, the election of the leadership of the American church by its own priests instead of its appointment by Rome, and a strong role for the laity. The man in question was not a latter-day Catholic dissident, but John Carroll, the first Catholic Bishop of the United States, elected by his fellow clergymen in 1789. Pope Pius VI agreed to leave the choice to them, which was not unusual at the time. The story of Bishop Carroll underlines the unusual role that America has played in the Roman Catholic Church and the fact that conflicts today between Rome and elements of the American church are not new. Genuine Conflicts The recent struggles have been bitter, however, dividing the American church itself. And despite the insistence of some American bishops that differences between Rome and American Catholics are exaggerated, Vatican officials say the conflicts are genuine and have an importance that transcends the United States. The most dramatic cases have included the Vatican's decision to take away some of the powers of Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen of Seattle and to strip the Rev. Charles Curran, who has dissented from official teaching on sexuality, of his right to teach as a Roman Catholic theologian. These cases are only part of a broader questioning of Rome in the United States that includes sharp attacks on the all-male, celibate priesthood, the church's teachings on homosexuality, birth control, abortion and divorce. According to a New York Times/ CBS News Poll in November 1985, a majority of American Catholics favored permitting Catholics to get divorced and marry someone else (73 percent), favored the use of artificial methods of birth control (68 percent), favored letting Catholic priests marry (63 percent) and favored letting women become priests (52 percent). The dissent on sexual questions, and especially birth control, offers the most dramatic and widespread example of diasaffection among many of America's 52 million Catholics. Here, in the view of the Vatican, is where modernity has made great, and dangerous, inroads. ''The major problem the hierarchy faces may be that Catholics simply don't believe in hell and eternal punishment the way they used to,'' said Prof. Monika Hellwig of Georgetown University, president of the Catholic Theological Society of America. ''The American laity, especially the college-educated,'' she said, ''is well aware that the hierarchy doesn't have many sanctions against them. It's harder to frighten them.'' If the changes wrought by the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) produced ferment and turmoil all over the world, the American church went through additional transformations. Old ethnic enclaves slowly broke up, and millions of American Catholics were shorn from roots. Parochial schools tied to the ethnic parishes declined. Throughout this century, moreover, the educational levels of American Catholics have dramatically risen, leading to a more inquisitive and, in some cases, more skeptical flock. Above all, there were the cultural and sexual revolutions of the 1960's, which coincided with the Vatican Council. The Rev. Thomas Herron of Philadelphia, an official of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican body charged with safeguarding orthodoxy, argued that the Vatican Council's liberalizing effects are often confused with the far broader upheaval in American society. ''People tend to blame the council for many things that had far more to do with the counterculture,'' he said. ''We are still dealing with the effects of an enormous revolution that we still do not fully understand.'' ''What is clear,'' he said, ''is that the 1960's involved a revolt against authority, and few institutions had such a powerful sense of authority as the Catholic Church. So the rebellion in the church may have been much stronger than against almost any other institution.'' U.S. Catholics: More Faithful? Even Vatican officials who see serious problems facing the American church today acknowledge its continued strength and the enormous energy of its members. ''We understand that the Catholic Church in the United States is one of the most dynamic churches in the world,'' said Archbishop Jan Schotte, a Belgian who is secretary general of the Synod of Bishops and a key Vatican official. Pope John Paul II, who will visit the United States next year, shares this view, said Joaquin Navarro Valls, the chief Vatican spokesman. ''The Pope gets labeled as an anti-American, and it's simply not true,'' said Mr. Navarro, a Spanish layman. ''He doesn't dramatize the problems in the American church.'' In a formal sense at least, American Catholics are unusually faithful compared with their counterparts in many Western European countries. The American church never suffered from the reactions against state-imposed Catholicism that swept many nations in Europe, where the church was frequently allied with monarchy and absolutism. This is one reason that the mass attendance rates among American Catholics, despite a decline in the 1960's and early 1970's, are still among the highest in the world. Some estimates show that about half of the Catholics in America attend mass on an average Sunday. At the same time, the donations of American Catholics have helped to create an extraordinary network of institutions - schools and hospitals, universities and publications. Yet the very dynamism of the American church helps fuel the controversies within it. As descendants of an immigrant minority that struggled to preserve the faith on sometimes hostile territory, American Catholics are unusually fierce in holding on to their Catholic identity. ''Being a Catholic is like being a member of a family,'' said Lisa Sowle Cahill, a liberal Catholic who is an associate professor of Christian ethics at Boston College. ''You have to be pushed out in order to break with it. It's not like any other voluntary organization.'' James P. McFadden, president of the National Committee of Catholic Laymen, a conservative group based in New York, agrees, albeit from an entirely different perspective. He argues that one of the church's gravest problems is that dissidents refuse to leave. ''You don't need to be Catholic to be Catholic anymore,'' he said. ''If you dissent, you don't get out. That's the problem. Martin Luther looks like a prince compared to these people because he knew when it was time to go.'' Traditionalists have been heartened - and liberals worried - by John Paul's appointments to the hierarchy of the American church, symbolized by New York's Archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor, and Boston's Archbishop, Bernard Cardinal Law. The ''John Paul bishops'' now number about 90, and the steady appointment of more like-minded bishops is expected to push the American church in a more conservative direction. However, a moderate to liberal coalition led by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago still holds a substantial majority in the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. One result of strong loyalties is that anger and hurt are pronounced on both sides of the battlelines in the American church. Traditionalists like Mr. McFadden complain that those who are less than orthodox are trying to hijack the true church; liberals like Ms. Cahill complain that traditionalists want to throw them out altogether. Such talk underlines one point of agreement between Vatican officials and their critics in the American church: that the conflict is not only between liberal American Catholics and the Vatican, but also within the American church. The internal divisions are clear within the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as at the grass-roots level. An American Answer: Write to Rome One priest who is a close aide to the Pope chuckled recently about a letter the Vatican received from an American Catholic. The correspondent reported that his parish priest had urged parishioners to protest recent Vatican actions by boycotting the Peter's Pence collection that goes to support the Holy See. ''He sent a check for $100 directly to us,'' the priest said, ''because he was afraid his priest wouldn't pass it on.'' Perhaps because of the United States' tradition of activism and democracy, Vatican officials say, traditionalist Catholics in the United States are far more likely than the faithful elsewhere to write to Rome and urge a crackdown against various forms of dissent. ''Americans are used to writing their Congressman and getting action,'' said the Rev. Diarmuid Martin, an Irishman who is an official of the Pontifical Coucil for the Family. ''So American Catholics who are angry write the Vatican for action.'' The Vatican has acknowledged that a ''high volume of complaints'' were a factor in its actions against Archbishop Hunthausen. Liberals, skeptical of centralized authority and without much hope of finding a sympathetic ear in the Vatican, tend to write fewer missives, though there has recently been a flow of letters of protest. Some liberal Catholics worry that the traditionalists' love of letter writing has given the Vatican what Ms. Cahill called a ''distorted'' view of the American church, because the traditionalists often focus on the most extreme and bizarre forms of dissent. One Vatican official, a European who reads many of the letters of complaint, said he believed there was some truth to this assertion. But he added that he was nonetheless surprised ''at some of the amazing things that seem to go on in American church.'' He cited the example of a book used by an American diocese for preparing couples for marriage. Its section on the spiritual lives of couples, he said, began with the question, ''Have you ever thought of praying in the nude?'' ''Is that really central to the spiritual lives of couples?'' he asked. ''Did it really have to be the first question?'' Dealing With Dissent: What Are the Limits? The root question in nearly all the disputes involving the American Catholics is the nature of church teachings and the extent to which the church can permit dissent and disobedience. The Rev. Richard A. McCormick, a professor of Christian ethics at the University of Notre Dame, warned against a static view of orthodoxy, which he said amounted to ''faith in formaldehyde.'' In an important statement of the liberal theological position in America, the Jesuit weekly, in November, Father McCormick wrote, ''One of theology's most important roles is a critical one, a distancing from past formulations and the proposal of new ones more adequate to the circumstances and insights of the time.'' Because of the United States' democratic tradition, and because Roman Catholics have always been a religious minority in a predominantly Protestant nation, Catholics in the United States have been among the stoutest defenders inside the church of the idea of ''freedom of conscience.'' The Second Vatican Council's ''Declaration of Religious Liberty'' bore a heavy American imprint, notably that of the Jesuit theologian John Courtney Murray, who before the council had been virtually silenced under Pope Pius XII. Today, liberal American Catholics like Bishop James W. Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, a former president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, are at the forefront of the battle for ''collegiality,'' a diffusion of responsibility to the bishops and the national churches. And theologians like Father Curran are leading the battle for the rights of theologians to dissent. ''The Catholic tradition has always emphasized that human reason can reflect on faith,'' said Father Curran, a professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington. ''Any tradition that says that faith and human reason can't contradict each other has the tools to deal with these problems.'' But to some Vatican officials, as well as to many conservative Catholics in the United States, the American liberals often seem intent on watering down the church's more unpopular teachings. ''The problem in the American church is a problem about the structure of the church and where authority comes from,'' said Mr. Navarro, the Vatican spokesman. ''The Catholic Church says the bishops get their power as successors to the Apostles and the Pope as successor to St. Peter. That is the central issue.'' Rocco Buttiglione, an Italian who is one of the leading thinkers of Communione e Liberazione, a group that strongly supports John Paul's approach, echoes the private comments of many Vatican officials when he says Americans often confuse political structures with the church. ''Democracy is a wonderful formula for political society, but the church is not a democracy,'' he said. ''Sometimes the church simply has to say unpopular things.'' The Battle Over Sexuality Certainly some of the things that the church has been saying about sexuality and the role of women are unpopular among many American Many Catholics cannot understand why a more ''modern'' attitude toward women's roles would shake the foundations of the church, or why the birth control pill - invented, as it happened, by a Roman Catholic - should necessarily undermine the entire structure of Catholic moral teaching. The question of women's rights has special resonance in the United States, not only because of the strength of its women's movement but also because women - particularly nuns - have played an unusually large role in building American Catholicism. The American bishops have encountered difficulty in drafting a pastoral letter on the subject, not only because of divisions among them but also because of fears of appearing to move beyond Vatican teaching. The sexual revolution may have shaken the Catholic Church more than most other American institutions because the church's members cleaved so faithfully - and for so long - to traditional morality, especially on birth control. In a study published in 1963, the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the American author and sociologist, found substantial acceptance among Catholics of the church's birth control teaching. But between 1963 and 1974, astonishing changes took place: opposition to birth control, for example, fell from 52 percent to 13 percent, to divorce from 46 to 25 percent. The revolt against the church's sexual teaching was paralleled by a decline in church attendance, and Father Greeley argues that the church's ban on contraception was the major cause of this disaffection. In a carefully worded speech at a bishops' synod in Rome in 1980, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco said he supported the church's teaching on birth control, but added a pointed reference to widespread dissent. ''Unless one is willing to dismiss the attitude of all these people as obduracy, ignorance or bad will,'' he said, ''this widespread opposition must give rise to serious concern.'' But most Vatican officials, and especially the Pope, argue that American Catholic dissenters are merely deceiving themselves by claiming that sinful acts are somehow not sinful. ''Man commits sin without calling by name what he does,'' the Pope said in his Easter sermon this year in a typical passage. ''But this is not the way of liberation. This is only the way of falsifying the truth.'' A Vatican official added that the Vatican understood the deep cultural revolution that had taken place in the United States, but that this only underlined the fundamental question: the extent to which church is prepared to resist trends in society that it thinks are wrong. Even if this involves some losses in formal allegiance, the official said, ''it might be worth some losses to preserve the church.'' But more liberal American Catholics, fierce in their identity and accustomed to due process and open debate, are not likely to go quietly - if at all. ---- NEXT: A more universal church. SOME CATHOLICS CALL FOR CHANGE Some say that the official position of the Catholic Church on sexual morals should bot be changed. Others say that this position should be changed to reflect trends in the modern world. Which point of view more closely reflects your own opinion?

THE ARTS: NEWS AND REVIEWS; RE-ENACTED RAGEDIES OF STREET LIFE BRING HELP TO JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/theater/arts-reviews-re-enacted-ragedies-street-life-bring-help-junior-high-students.html,"THEY perform plays about cocaine, incest, teen-age pregnancy, fallen heroes and broken dreams. Off Broadway? No, junior high schools -so students can watch on stage dramas that mirror life in the streets. A college basketball star smokes a crack pipe, a father forces himself on his daughter, a man flings his wife across the kitchen table - not ordinary fare for auditoriums in junior high schools. But the Creative Arts Team, a theater company in residence at the Gallatin Division of New York University, is no ordinary troupe. Its members work both on stage and in the classroom. A week before a performance, the actors conduct theater-in-education workshops in the classroom, usually for seventh- and eighth-graders, to improve literacy skills, particularly among disadvantaged youths. Students write endings to different scenes they have read, and the actors stay in character after performing scenes, to discuss the conflicts of the drama with students. Drama helps students understand the choices they face in their personal lives, school officials say, and helps them talk about problems they might otherwise repress. The dramas are particularly helpful for poor youngsters and those from broken homes because they often think they will suffer the same misfortunes that have befallen their families and communities. 12 Plays in 12 Years ''Drama is something very young people understand.'' said Charlotte Frank, executive director of curriculum and instruction for the New York City Board of Education. ''Very often children cannot articulate their problems. But when they see the situation on stage, their lives are crystallized in that moment.'' In its 12 years, the Creative Arts Team has produced 12 plays, all written in house. The 30-member company has contracts to perform in nine city school districts, which contribute 40 percent of the group's budget. The team also receives city and state money. While most of the company's work is done in New York City, performances have been given at the Kennedy Center in Washington and in Miami and Detroit. The group estimates that 240,000 students have seen it perform. School officials for the city direct the company in selecting subjects for the dramas. Topics have included the disintegrative effects of drugs on a family in a story inspired by the cocaine-related death of Len Bias, the basketball star; the cyclical nature of family violence in which victims of child abuse become perpetrators in adulthood, and teen-age violence and sexuality. Joe Louis and Rosa Parks Two historical plays have been produced. One, a story of two heavyweight boxers, Joe Louis and Max Schmeling, depicts their lives in the Depression in the United States and in Nazi Germany. It describes their two championship bouts, showing exploitation of each man by his country. The second was a play about Rosa Parks, the black seamstress who in 1955 refused to sit in the back of a bus in Montgomery, Ala., defying racial segregation laws and helping spark the civil rights movement. Some of the plays deal with such issues as abortion and drug use, which were rarely discussed openly in junior high schools 20 years ago. ''The scenario on the street - drugs, sex, teen-age pregnancy - is a lot more stark than what's happening on stage,'' said Cynthia Dantzler, an official in Public School 26 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. ''Some of the principals may be taken aback by the plays at first, but the kids fall right into it.'' It is this gritty realism on stage -in word and action - that draws students into the story and makes its message meaningful. In the play on family violence, which will be touring New York State next year, a woman fends off her threatening husband with a hot iron. ''One more step and you're pressed for life!'' she yells. ''I mean it! Steam or dry?'' Moments later, the husband flings her belly-first onto the kitchen table, cutting her lip. Later, their son describes cigarette burns he received from his mother. ''She said she had to burn the evil out of me. I love my mama. Sometimes I was her darling son. And sometimes, her ashtray.'' The Rape Scene In the same play, which was written by James P. Mirrione and Diane Houston, a teen-age girl in another family is raped by her father. The girl is preparing for a prom in her room, and the father says he wants to teach her how to slow dance. After they begin, he holds her closer. ''I can feel your heart beating inside your dress,'' he says. ''It makes your dress move. That's because your're not a little girl anymore - you're a real woman now.'' The girl tries to struggle free, but her father tightens his grip, overpowering her. He slowly pushes her down, she screams, ''Daddy!'' and the lights go out. ''It's chilling everytime I see it, and the audience is left gasping,'' said Mimi Flaherty, the program director of the Creative Arts Team. After the play, she said, the students are reminded that the girl was raped and that she was not at fault. School officials say they know the team is effective because students approach them after a performance to discuss personal problems that have been depicted on stage. Indeed, even though the dramas are of despair, the message to students is that they can control their own lives but that they must be willing to share their problems with others. When a play is over, students are asked what different choices the characters could have made to avert the trauma that occurred on stage. The actors then replay several scenes based on the advice of the students. The characters are given a second chance, which for some students is where the drama on stage departs from life in the streets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WIVES, MISTRESSES AND WORKING WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/books/wives-mistresses-and-working-women.html,"THE MOTHER OF DREAMS And Other Short Stories: Portrayals of Women in Modern Japanese Fiction. Edited by Makoto Ueda. 279 pp. New York: Kodansha International. $19.95. MAKOTO UEDA, the editor of this noteworthy anthology of modern Japanese short stories, has divided the book into five sections: the Maiden, the Wife, the Mistress, the Mother and the Working Woman. It is an indication that the influence of roles, even with the changes in postwar Japan, is still felt. The authors are all established -among them, the 1968 Nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata and other popular writers such as Kobo Abe, Kafu Nagai and Fumiko Enchi - and include an almost equal number of men and women writers. (Readers be warned that the table of contents lists the authors in the traditional Japanese order, with surnames first.) The surface of these stories, mostly written since World War II, is often deceptively placid. The writing is spare. Because the stories have various translators -all, in fact, students of Mr. Ueda (who teaches at Stanford University) - it is hard to measure how much of the voice and style of a story is the author's own. Some are smoother than others. Still, throughout the placid prose there is strong emotion. In ''A Woman to Call Mother'' by Taiko Hirabayashi, a daughter's failure to visit her dying mother is ''an indication that their emotions were too strong.'' By refraining from frenzied description, the writer renders the drama in a story all the more powerfully. The women themselves are quite powerful, whether they are waitresses, secretaries, art dealers, ballerinas or housewives. Overwhelming emotion often propels them out of their roles. In Ms. Hirabayashi's story, a dancer cannot resist an affair with her daughter's fiance and regrets it all her life. The less dramatic actions have their own import within a woman's world. The wives who set aside Sunday afternoons for themselves in Sakae Tsuboi's ''Umbrella on a Moonlit Night'' are taking a small step by most standards, but a large one for them and their families. The woman in ''Be It Ever So Humble'' by Yoko Mori takes lovers in order to appreciate more keenly her life at home: ''After the bleakness of their clandestine lovemaking, it was a pleasant thought to know a husband and home awaited her, no matter how small and humble that home was. She even saw herself as a happy woman.'' Overwhelmed by love, these women are at their Continued on next page most fierce. In ''Pheasant'' by Harumi Setouchi, the heroine's ''love sought to fulfill rather than be fulfilled. Most men were unable to take on her vast love; it flooded over them and they ended up being swept off their feet by its waves. In the end, men who were loved by Makiko all became unhappy.'' These stories are as much about dreams as they are about women. Desire suppressed finds its way into other more surreal settings, into dreams. The fabric between dream life and waking life is a very thin membrane. People appear in dreams with as strong an assurance as they do in life, sometime more. A long-absent daughter first appears in the dreams of Ms. Setouchi's heroine before the woman actually realizes the keenness of her loss. ''The Mother of Dreams'' by Shohei Ooka is simply the telling of one dream after another: the repeated appearance of a dead mother in a man's dreams. The images in many of the stories seem to me to come straight from Japanese paintings - mountains and clouds, pebbles and rivers, mist and the outline of branches. The selection of details is particular and quite lovely. Raindrops on a train window, described by Kawabata, ''stop momentarily, move a little, stop again, then move again.'' RESTRAINT is especially effective in the telling of violence. The abortion in Ms. Setouchi's ''Pheasant'' is so gruesome it gives an observing journalist visions of expanding horror: ''Admidst the clotting blood, a white thing that looked like chicken fat suddenly came out. It was a bit of the fetus. In Makiko's vision, innumerable eyeless, noseless fetal phantoms lined up in jostling heaps like the gray tombstones at Adashino, making her want to scream out in terror.'' The description of a young girl's death in Kawabata's ''Socks'' is quiet, as if viewed through soundproof glass, and most disturbing: ''Her body tensed, her arms reached upward, and her clenched fists shook convulsively. When the fit subsided, her head slumped to the left side of her pillow. It was then that a white tapeworm slowly crawled out of her half-open mouth.'' I was struck by the presence of death in these stories. Suicide appears frequently, matter-of-factly. The dead do not stay in that other world. In Kawabata's mythlike ''Beyond Death,'' a girl, a suicide, strolls a golf course, accompanying her beloved to his death 50 years after her own. ''Song of a Dead Girl'' by Kobo Abe is just that, narrated by a suicide who finds herself, to her disappointment, still stuck in this world, sitting in a cinema with ''twice as many dead as there were living.'' Then, with a comic shrug, ''If they were all to come alive again, I thought, the theater could really make a lot of money.'' The satisfactions these women find have more to do with having chosen a way to live apart from predetermined roles than with having found a traditional ''happy'' way to live. They have a dignity, these bold ones, but they pay the price for it. The last story, by Yumie Hiraiwa, ''Lady of the Evening Faces,'' ends when a woman leaves her husband, the classic act of liberation. ''She was indeed lonely, but she was free. From then on, she would be able to live just for herself. She noticed that the men and women walking about town thinking the same way were surprisingly numerous. They all strutted triumphantly along the chasms of the city wearing the elegant expressions of the single nobility. Mieko left in the evening, and lost herself in their throng.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABOUT EDUCATION; THE YEAR FOR VALUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/30/science/about-education-the-year-for-values.html,"VALUES was the buzz word of education in 1986. Stern demands for the teaching of values came from liberal Democrats like Governor Cuomo as well as conservatives like William J. Bennett, the Secretary of Education. Why? Probably because values seemed in short supply everywhere, from Wall Street to Washington. As usual, the schools were asked to undo society's failure. But they got little help in defining the values they were expected to teach. Threats to the nation's economic competitiveness also raised demands for a response from the schools, particularly for better science teaching. Ironically, at the same time fundamentalists sought to elevate creationism to a science and to give it equal time with the teaching of evolution. Arguments over ''creation science'' went to the Supreme Court in a suit brought by Louisiana's Attorney General against the state's education authorities. The attorney general was supported by religious fundamentalists and conservative groups; the educators were backed by many scientists and liberals. A decision is expected next year. Fundamentalists achieved a striking victory in Federal District Court in Greeneville, Tenn., when Judge Thomas Gray Hull ruled that parents of children in public schools had the right to let their children leave the classroom whenever something being read or discussed offended their religious values. Among offending readings: ''The Wizard of Oz,'' Anne Frank's ''Diary of a Young Girl,'' and a chapter about the origin of tidal waves. Advocates of educational excellence also took to the field. Bill Honig, California's Superintendent of Public Instruction, rejected many science and mathematics texts from major publishers as academically inferior. A study commissioned by People for the American Way, a liberal organization concerned with constitutional issues, found ''dramatic'' improvements in American history textbooks. Its only major criticism was that while history textbooks talk about American religious diversity, ''they do not show it.'' For example, the study found, that the books omit the role of religion in social movements, such as Prohibition, antiwar protests, and the abortion debate. In 1986, the focus of educational criticism shifted to higher education. Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Corporation for the Advancement of Teaching, who three years ago published ''High School,'' a critique of secondary education, this year followed up with ''College: The Undergraduate Experience in America.'' He found conflict between careerism and general education, faculty neglect of undergraduate teaching and excessive catering to the market place. As one department chairman at a mid-Western college put it: ''They're trying to turn this college into a supermarket where we're willing to put anything in the catalog so long as it will sell.'' Still, escalating college costs, without additional financial aid to students, threatens to create two categories of colleges - one for the rich, the other for the rest. A notable change in 1986 was a recognition that education cannot be improved by legislation alone; teachers were more widely recognized as the key to better schools. Their preparation, the 1986 reform proposals insisted, must concentrate on the subjects they will teach. Pedagogy should be left largely to a year's study toward a master of education and a year or two of supervised internship in the classroom. Proposals by the Carnegie report, ''A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century,'' and others stressed that teachers must also be treated as professionals; they should be allowed to reach goals set by school boards and legislatures in their own ways and with materials of their own choice. As the Federal Government withdrew to the sidelines, there was new activism among ggovernors who equate better schools with a better economy. Drop-outs remained education's dark side. Lack of jobs after graduation undermined the incentive to stay in school. Deficiency in reading and writing creates an unemployable underclass. Teen-age pregancy leads many girls to drop out of school and become dependent on welfare. The year heard heated debate over the schools' efforts to reduce unwanted pregnancies by providing birth control information and devices. Arguments raged over behavior control as against birth control, between preaching and prevention. Early childhood education began to get a hearing as a partial solution. Experiments have shown that a nurturing and instructive environment for 3-year-olds can dramatically reduce learning problems, teen-age pregnancies and anti-social behavior later on. Finally, after college students had been targets of criticism for being self-centered and apathetic, they returned to greater activism. Their protests - far milder than recent student actions in France and China -over such issues as apartheid in South Africa and discrimination at home, or over American foreign policies, may not please campus management. Still, it suggests that, whatever may be lacking in formal teaching, values of conscience are not dead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"JOHN T. DOLAN, FOUNDER OF GROUP THAT BACKED CONSERVATIVES, DIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/31/obituaries/john-t-dolan-founder-of-group-that-backed-conservatives-dies.html,"John T. Dolan, co-founder of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, a leading force in the New Right, died Sunday at his home here after a long illness. He was 36 years old. Mr. Dolan, widely known as Terry, had been in failing health for several years and withdrew from leadership of the committee six months ago. The immediate cause of death was listed as congestive heart failure, which the committee said his doctor attributed to diabetes and pernicious anemia. The committee was formed by Mr. Dolan, Charles Black and Roger Stone in 1975. It quickly became known for the efficiency with which it raised money and the sharpness of the television commercials it devised to attack liberals, usually Democrats, running for public office. 'Muzzle' Maureen Reagan But Mr. Dolan also went after Republicans whom he did not regard as sufficiently conservative, once suggesting, for example, that conservatives ''muzzle'' Maureen Reagan, President Reagan's daughter, who holds a political position at the White House. ''Maureen Reagan is the type of person who, in the middle of a war, would go out and shoot our wounded,'' Mr. Dolan said. Mr. Dolan was born in Norwalk, Conn., and graduated from Georgetown University in 1974. By the time he finished college he was already a political veteran, having worked in the 1960 Nixon campaign at the age of 9. It was estimated that the National Conservative Political Action Committee spent more money on politics in 1979 and 1980 than any other political action group. It used the money against candidates who did not support a conservative agenda, which included opposition to abortion and big Government and support of school prayer. It spent more than $7 million to support Mr. Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984. Survivors include Mr. Dolan's parents, Joseph and Peg, of Fairfield, Conn.; a brother, Anthony, of Washington, who is the chief speech writer for Mr. Reagan, and a sister, Maiselle, also of Washington, who is a former member of the White House staff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spain Keeps Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/31/world/spain-keeps-abortion-law.html,The Supreme Court today struck down a decree that liberalized Spain's law on abortion. The Nov. 24 decree did away with five-member review boards and permitted private clinics to perform abortions. The decree also provided that psychological stress was a ground for abortion. It was suspended on an appeal by an anti-abortion group.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

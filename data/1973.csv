And Now It's Britain That's ‘In’ in Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/01/archives/and-now-its-britain-thats-in-in-europe-hope-for-better-living-some.html,"PARIS, Dec. 31 — A Parisian, invited home to dinner by some French friends the other day, was served a Christmas pudding. Lapin gallois a la Lord Snowdon is making its appearance on some French restaurant menus. The dish is simply Welsh rarebit. Hungry on the Champs Elysees? Try the Red Lion for a tasty steak and kidney pie. An English food invasion of France can mean only two things: The French have lost their senses, or the French are in love. It's probably the latter. As Britain finally joins the European club of nations known as the Common Market, not just the French bbut all Continentals are fascinated by their cousins across the water. Of course, there's a little anxiety, too, especially in the business circles thrown off balance by the British investment money that has flooded Continental centers over the last 12 months. The British used overvalued pounds, as Americans had been using overvalued dollars in the last decade, to buy Continental property and industry. The French tightened their controls to keep some of the British money out. Yet part of the resentment was offset by knowledge that lucrative new markets will open for Continental exporters when more than 60 million consumers in Britain, Ireland and Denmark are linked to the internal free trade arrangements of the European Economic Community. Hope For Better Living The shoe manufacturer in Milan, or the dyestuffs maker in Leverkusen will find that his products are more competitive inside Britain and will perhaps displace either local British or foreign suppliers. But British manufacturers will get reciprocal advantages on the Continent, which could mean an economic shock for a lot of people. The hope is that the results will be not only greater efficiency and more productivity, but higher general living standards, a fairer distribution of the wealth and eventually an economic and political union of Western Europe. That's a tall order, and everyone knows it. There is none of the starry‐eyed idealism that accompanied earlier postwar moves toward European integration. There is instead a realistic assessment of the magnitude of the problems. As a sample of what's in store, Common Market ministers, including the British, spent 48 hours a few days before Christmas coming to an agreement over the amount or Cyprus sherry that Britain should be permitted to import as a member of the Common Market. In trying to make a single unit out of nine different economies, some interests are going to be hurt — Cyprus's sherry producers, for instance, or a truck manufacturer in Lyons whose vehicles have heavier axle weights than regulations permit in other Common Market countries. This is why there are — and will continue to be — such fights in Brussels. Polyphony adds to the complexity of problems, and to the confusion. The Common Market will have six official Ianguages, Some say six and one half because Ireland obtained the right to have all texts pertaining to Irish matters translated into Gaelic. Yet on the positive side, the British membership question, the cause of so much argument in the past, has finally been resolved. And the British, at least Continentals believe, are intent on making the Common Market work. But the problems are in the future, after the marriage. For the time being, the water is warm and romance is in the air. In Frankfurt, Basel and Brussels the “scene” is being made in the crowded rooms where the bitter and mild and lime and lager are served. There is a high mortality rate for American style hamburger havens in Germany, but the pubs — which no longer even need a retired English wing commander and his wife to grace the saloon bar—have seemingly an endless lease on life. One pub, 100‐per cent Walloon‐owned, even opened in the farming town of Wave south of Brussels. On the Continent things British are smart, like the whisky aperitif at fashionable and not so fashionable dinner parties, like the tweed suit in the Burberry window in Brussels, like the disk jockey's voice at the Voom Voom in Vienna, like the red mini parked outside the Griffin Club in Geneva. For the Continental rich, the ultimate in conspicuous consumption is not a Cadillac or a Mercedes, but a Rolls or Bentley. Entry into the Common Market has made everyone on the Continent more aware of Britain. “The Continent is no longer isolated,” a Brussels civil servant quipped. The new awareness goes beyond the things British that adorn the Continent's materialism to reach British ideas and “the British way of life.” Continental society is more rigid than Britain's, and more closed. The emancipation of the working class electrified pop culture the Beatles and the Rolling Stones — and the arts in Britain and led to a number of social reforms. As Britain gets closer to the Continent, some of this influence is rubbing off. For example, when at a recent trial in France national attention was drawn to the cruelty of French abortion laws, commentators immediately cited Britain, where the laws have been liberalized. They spoke of the injustice that permitted the, rich — or at least those who could afford the trip — to get a London abortion, while the poor had to stay in France and submit to the birth of an unwanted baby. The new romance has also turned eyes to Britain's greater freedom of communication. The independence of the British Broadcasting Corporation is often cited by critics of the French Radio and Television Organization, which is not only ‘controlled by the Government, but run by it in such a way that nothing unfavorable to the Gaullist administration is ever disseminated. There is an enormous curiosity about the “British way of life,” at least the way the Continentals imagine it, which does not exactly match the real thing. The curiosity explains why the most popular shows in the recent history of French teleVision have been those borrowed from Britain, one serializing Galsworthy's epic, “The Forsythe Saga,” and the other, the famous B.B.C. documentary of the British royal family at home. The adventures of Princess Anne and Prince Charles are avidly, followed by Continental newspapers is well as the more gossip‐oriented journals. The traditions of republicanism seem to inspire the cult of monarchy. As the Continentals grow warmer toward Britain, they appear to be becoming colder toward the United States. The latest intensification of the air war in Vietnam has not improved the American image. Continentals wonder what President Nixon has in mind for Europe after he finishes up, if he ever does, in the Far East. Britain is accepted as being in the same boat as the Continentals when the expected economic battles break out between Europe and the United States. In Paris toy shops this Christmas one of the big sellers was a model of the British‐French Concorde aircraft with a nose that slides up and down like the real thing. These toys symbolize one area — supersonic airline flight — where Europe is ahead of the United States. They also symbolize the romance between Britain and the Continent."
"Both Sides Gird for Renewal of Fight on Legalized Abortion, Explosive Legislative Issue",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/02/archives/both-sides-gird-for-renewal-of-fight-on-legalized-abortion.html,"In 1970, when abortion on demand was legalized in New York State, its opponents, led by the Roman Catholic Church, said they had been taken by surprise. Last spring, when the State Legislature voted to repeal the law, which was saved only by Governor Rockefeller's veto, it was the supporters of abortion who said they had been lulled into overconfidence. This year, both sides say they are ready for the renewal of the struggle, which is expected to provide once again the‐most explosive issue of the legislative session that begins tomorrow. During the weeks ahead, thousands of easily enraged partisans will prowl the corridors of the Capitol, buttonholing members of the State Senate and the Assembly, arguing, cajoling and often abusing them, one the one hand, for being responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of unborn infants, or, on the other, for trying to turn the clock back to a ghastly period of filthy abortion mills, abused and unwanted children and abridged civil liberties. A No‐Compromise Issue “Until now we have tried to keep our arguments on an intellectual plane,” said Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, the grandfatherly obstetrician who heads Planned Parenthood‐World Population. “The other side waves its fetuses in bottles, but we haven't shown pictures of battered babies or frightened, pregnant 14‐year‐old girls, or the bodies of young women who have died in coat‐hanger abortions. Now we may pull off the silk gloves and fight them with bare knuckles.” Dr. Guttmacher is one of the is led by the Roman Catholic Church and scores of Right to Life committees around the state, which are generally dominated by Roman Catholic laymen, but also include significant conservative Protestant and Orthodox Jewish representation. Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, spokesman for the New York Archdiocese, said that local committees had received office space, telephones, mailings and the like from the church, but that: direct financial aid had not been given. In Washington, however, the National Right to Life Committee acknowledges receiving about half of its $50,000 annual budget from the United States Catholic Congress, an organization of bishops of the church. “It is an issue on which we can not compromise,” Monsignor Clark said in a recent interview, “a principle that cannot he bent to conform to the ideals of a pluralistic society, since what is involved is no less than the murder of the unborn.” If Dr. Guttmacher is thinking of taking off his silk gloves, Edward Golden of Brunswick, N. Y., a construction foreman and father of six children who heads the state Right to Life Committee, is thinking of putting them badk on. Aware that his organization has been criticized for the excessively enthusiastic heckling of its opponents and public officials, including Mr. Rockefeller during his “town meeting” appearances around the state last fall, Mr. Golden has asked his 200,000 members for more decorum this time around. “We're not going to get the law repealed by ranting and raving,” he said. “We've got heck of a lot more to gain by acting our age.” Strategy Is Noted Not that Mr. Golden or the church are predicting victory this year. While they believe they can still muster a majority of the votes in each house, they doubt, they can count on the necessary two–thirds majority to override the Governors anticipated second veto. Thus, their main concern is to keep the issue alive for reconsideration after a change in administration. Indeed, there are indications that the leadership of the Legislature may be carefully gauging public opinion before coming to a decision on permitting the repeal bill to get out of committee. Election‐year pressures led to its consideration on the floor and subsequent passage last year. At least a few members of the Assembly and the State Senate are thought to have voted for repeal not so much out of conviction as to protect themselves at the polls and because the Governor had already announced that he would veto the measure. Perry B. Duryea of Montauk, L. I., the Speaker of the Assembly said in a recent interview that while the fate of the bill would be up to the committee, “my own disposition is that to send a bill to the floor just to have it debated when its ultimate fate is known is an exercise in futility.” The Governor has made it clear in recent weeks that his position in favor of liberal abortion “has not changed.” At the same time he has been emphasizing that the matter may soon be taken out of his hands, since the United States Supreme Court is expected to rule definitively on abortion, perhaps within a month or two and, in any case, no later than its summer recess. The Court heard arguments in October on appeals from Circuit Court rulings that restrictive abortion statutes in Georgia and Texas unconstitutionally restricted the rights of women. The high court's decision is also expected to dispose effectively of appeals against the New York law, which was upheld in a 5 to 2 decision last year by the State Court of Appeals, and of the restrictive Connecticut statute, which was overturned by a Federal Circuit Court. Although the arguments for and against abortion have become familiar in recent years, proponents of abortion on demand believe that their case has been strengthened by the practical results since the law took effect on July. 1, 1970. Among other indicators of success, deaths attributed to abortion have all but ceased, and mortality in childbirth has dropped sharply. At the same time, many supporters of the law are hoping that the number of abortions —402,100 in New York City alone during the 24‐month period for which figures are available — will gradually be reduced. “Abortion is obvious evidence of social failure,” Dr. Guttmacher said. “Icleally, conception should have been prevented.” He pointed out that the percentage of abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy —a period in which the fetus may attain a weight of two pounds and come close to viability outside the womb—had been decreasing sharply. It is these abortions that many persons who support _ legalization find disturbing. Dr. Guttmacher is one of these. “If I had written the law I would have made 20 weeks the maximum period,” he said, “but I wouldn't tamper with it now.” Agreement on Principle Last year, in fact, Governor Rockefeller proposed an amendment to the law providing an 18‐week limit. It was rejected by the anti‐abortion forces, which said they were fighting for a principle and not taking part in “a numbers game.” This uncompromising stance has its opposite in the proabortionist camp. The Women's National Abortion Coalition, one of the radical feminist organizations that will be lobbying in Albany, argues that a woman should have absolute control over her own body, including the right of abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Judith Lambert, a staff member of the coalition, which excludes men from its decisionmaking sessions, also said she favored the training of paramedical personnel to perform early‐stage abortions with medical supervision, to reduce the cost of the procedure. She also seeks the wider use of “menstrual extraction,” by which a woman whose period is delayed can eliminate the possibility of pregnancy through process called aspiration. It is on the principle that abortion ought not be regulated by law at all, and should be a private matter between a woman and her physician, that the proabortionists generally agree. They are supported publicly by at least a few Roman Catholic priests, notably Jesuits, among them the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Democratic Representative from Massachusetts. In the same way, the Roman Catholic bishops of Texas, confronted by the passage of an eased abortion law, issued an open letter in which they said; “In our view it would be better, in the ultimate sense, for the laws of the state to be silent on the subject than to lead positive approval to acts that deny the value of life. ...” Church doctrine on the question of abortion and the beginning of specifically human life has changed several times in the last 700 years. From 1591 until 1869, the church taught that the unborn infant acquired a soul only with the “quickening” — the first movement — of its body, which generally occurs between the 12th and 15th week of pregnancy. An abortion that took place before that time fell into a less‐serious category of sin. Antiabortionists assert that the church's present position that human life begins at the moment of conception, which was adopted a century ago has been borne out by recent discoveries in genetics and fetal development. However, Robert M. Byrn, a member of the faculty of the Fordham University Law School and a Right to Life leader in the city, has based his legal case, which has been rejected by the state courts and has been appealed to the United States Supreme Court, on the ground that permissive abortion statutes deny unborn infants the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. “Shouting ‘Catholic’ is an easy way to avoid confronting the issue,” he said. “I don't give a damn what Catholic history shows. To the extent that the church relied on the science of the time it was wrong.” Both Sides Confident Each side in the abortion controversy believes that the tide of events is running in its favor. The antiabortionists cite the decisive defeat of referendums seeking relaxation of abortion laws in North Dakota and Michigan last November. In this formulation, legalized abortion is regarded as one of the major issues that sank the Presidential candidacy of Seriator George S. McGovern. President Nixon, it is suggested, correctly read the public mood by allying himself with the antiabortion forces in a letter to Cardinal Cooke as the Legislature was debating the issue last year. A reaction is seen taking place, led by the President, against “permissiveness,” with the unspoken corollary that child‐bearing, as the penalty for sexual indulgence, be made mandatory. Proabortionists, on the other hand, point to polls showing an increasing public support for abortion on demand. They say the referendum defeats came about as a result of heavily financed last‐minute “shock” campaigns, in which billboards and television were widely used. “It's easy to be against abortion until your own daughter needs one,” said a psychiatrist who asked that his name not be used. “The white lower‐middle‐ and middle‐class people who make up the bulk of the Right to Life movement are the same people for whom illegitimate birth still carries the arparpst social stigma.” Having an easy abortion law in New York, it has been suggested, makes it easier for vot‐d ers in other states to reject them three. Two–thirds of the abortions performed in New York City in the first 24 months under the law have been done on out‐of‐staters, 20,000 of them from Michigan. The proabortionists also argue that the strength of the Right to Life movement at the polls has been exaggerated. Constance E. Cook, a Republican member of the Assembly from Ithaca and a sponsor of the liberalized law, pointed out that she was re‐elected last fall by the largest majority of her career. “I don't think there was single member of the Legislature who was defeated in November because of his support iof the law,” she said. Few Voting Switches Albert H. Blumenthal, the West Side Democrat‐Liberall who is assistant minority leader of the Assembly, pointed out that all but one incumbent in the city who voted for liberalized abortion, had won in primary and general elections last year. The defeat of the lone exception, he said, could be attributed to redistricting rather than to his stand on abortion. On the other hand, legislators have tended to arrive at their position on abortion after carefully analyzing the sentiment in their districts, and since no antiabortionists were defeated either, all that these results may show is that there was considerable success last November in judging the mood of the voters. There were comparatively few switches in position in the Legislature between the 1970 and 1972 votes, the majorities for repeal having been provided, in general, by new members. This year there are about 50 new members in the two houses, and it is again thought that their, reading of the political auguries will have a decisive effect on the voting. To influence them, and to try for further switches among returning members, the major organizations working for and against the law have already set up offices in Albany. The New York Abortion Education League, an offshoot of Planned Parenthood, has a $200,000 treasury. It shares offices with Citizens for Abortion Rights and Religious Liberty, whose co‐chairmen are the Rev. Howard Moody, pastor of Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, and Mrs. Norton of the City Rights Commission. Probably the most influential of the antiabortion lobbyists is Charles J. Tobin Jr., secretary of the New York Catholic Committee, which speaks for the state's bishops. The amount of money budgeted by Mr. Tobin's committee in its antiabortion fight and the funds spent by the rightto‐life committees in the state could not be determined, but the total was said to be not significant. The use of television and other media is not contemplated here, as it was in Michigan. “I expect even stronger majorities will vote to repeal what I describe as the abominable 1970 abortion law,” Mr. Tobin said in a recent interview. Mr. Blumenthal, a proabortionist, believes the vote will be closer than last year's. “The only thing I'm certain about,” though, is that everybody will know they've been in a fight,” he said."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/02/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-navy-and-mr-rule-police-pressure-on.html,"To the Editor: A recent Times editorial (“Punishing Mr. Rule...,” Dec. 26) decrying the Navy's harassment of Gordon W. Rule, outspoken director of its procurement control operation, cornmendably urges Congress “to protect courageous civil servants who give honest testimony in response to its questions.” Twice before Mr. Rule “committed truth” before Congressional committees—in 1970 the subject was the illstarred F‐111B fighter, in 1971 it was Avondale Shipyards and Lockheed. For his earlier efforts he was passed over for the Legion of Merit, given to all of his immediate subordinates, and for a promotion. He later received both an award and a promotion, but Only after Senator William Proxmire's public denunciation of the Navy's retaliation. Once again Mr. Rule is being harassed for doing precisely what the little ‐ publicized code of ethics for U.S. Government service requires him to do—“Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department” and “expose corruption wherever discovered.” And, as The Times has pointed out, the Navy may have committed a crime by picking him off to a bureaucratic Siberia writing curricula for a Navy supply school in retaliation for his Congressional testimony. Unfortunately, like Ernest Fitzgerald, who blew the whistle on Lockheed's $2‐billion C‐5A cost overrun, Mr. Rule will find little solace in the fact that he is on the side of morality, ethics and the law. Neither the Congress—as opposed to a few individual members—nor the public yet fully realize how much they have come to rely on honest insiders who pierce the veil of corporate and governmental secrecy from within, if their unwillingness to take concrete steps to protect and aid civil servants like Messrs. Rule and Fitzgerald is any indication. In our book “Whistle Blowing” we describe the experiences of men and women who have dared to speak the truth about their organizations, but too often these heroes are left in the lurch and the reforms that have been proposed gather dust. The nonprofit Clearinghouse for Professional Responsibility, P.O. Box 486, Washington, D.C. 20044, was organized in 1971 to offer some measure of aid and advice to ethical whistle blowers and to discourage retaliation à la the Rule case. At a January 1971 conference on professional responsibility sponsored by the Clearinghouse, Senator Proxmire called for new laws that would Police Pressure on Judges To the Editor: In setting bail at $500 for a prisoner the police charge with attempted murder, Judge. Bruce McM. Wright exercised discretionary power vested in him by statute (New York Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 520.10). The discretion is rather broad since the code does not fix maximum or minimum dollar amounts for bail. There is a simple remedy for abuse of discretion by a Criminal Court judge in setting bail. The party aggrieved can seek to change it by an application to the State Supreme Court. Many such applications are made and heard day. Mayor Lindsay and police officials are presumably aware of this normal legal avenue to change the amount of bail in a given case. Yet before resorting to it they saw fit to level a publicized attack before TV cameras upon the action of the judge if not on the judge himself. Such attacks, aside from being in bad taste, would seem to constitute a threat to the independence of our judiciary. If a judge of the Criminal Court is to be subjected to televised attack by police, Mayor and others who disagree with his judgments, he may soon be tempted to trade his judicial independence for personal expediency. History has demonstrated that such expediency soon leads to the criminal courts' becoming a mere arm of the police. It is therefore to be hoped that the Bruce McM. Wright incident does not become a prelude to others where the police seek to have things judged their way in court or else. NEWCOMB B. PINES New York, Dec. 26, 1972 ‘Right to Human Living’ To the Editor: The proponents of the “Right to Life” movement have the satisfaction of being sincerely moral and righteous at no visible cost to themselves or other taxpayers, and with no awkward racial problems to worry about, a position especially appealing to at a minimum protect civil servants who speak out at the instance of Congress. We understood that he will introduce, just such a bill in 1973. RALPH NADER, PETER PETKAS Washington, Dec. 26, 1972 • To the Editor: I would like to speak in defense of Admiral Kidd and the many fine, devoted, competent men who stay in the Navy in order to make it better. I have the feeling not many of them will be able to make themselves heard above the innuendoes of another prejudiced, poorly founded Congressional hearing about to stem from Gordon Rule's remarks. I was a Navy pilot from 1961 to 1970. As a fleet and training command pilot I had to live with the decisions of our civilian procurement group, which has grown sloppily in the last decade. Its growth seems to be formed in the wake of badly informed Senatorial and newspaper inquisitions. I watched our P‐3A's loaded with electronic equipment that rarely worked at peak performance and had questionable tactical practicality. I was stationed at the Naval Air Test Center when Robert McNamara not once but repeatedly tried to ram the TFX (F‐111) down the Navy's throat. I flew the F‐9 Cougar in the Advanced Training Command when the Navy remained about the only major world air force with a subsonic, Korean‐war vintage (in 1969) advanced‐trainer aircraft. When we sustained aircraft losses, comparable to Vietnam fleet carrier fighter squadrons because of decrepit aging aircraft, the civilian answer was a new, hastily designed ejection seat. Now that the Navy has a chance to get a damn good pure fighter (F‐14 Tomcat), our civilian procurement types have pretty well scuttled it with the help of the news media. Thank God for men with real courage like Admiral Kidd and Melvin Laird who have given the fleet serviceman at least the hope of getting quality performance equipment. Gordon Rule's attack on the line officer's ability to buy equipment is as poorly qualified as my telling my wife how to buy a bra. Every time a Gordon Rule opens his mouth a Senator McGovern or Senator Proxmire agrees and says let's have a good prejudiced investigation. I pray Americans will remember those who have to sail, fly or fight with weapons and ideas generated by the fat, civilianinfluenced military. Certainly a sane compromise can be found: Next time ask the man who flies it not the one who buys it. SANFORD H. WETMORE Bethel, Conn., Dec. 23, 1972 legislators. Only the woman forced to bear a child she does not want pays physically, psychologically and financially. Once the woman has given birth, the intense solicitude of everyone, especially legislators, disappears, because a living child needs light, airy rooms without rats; a living child needs plentiful food of good quality; a living child needs good medical care and good schooling; a living child needs a father who has a job, and a mother who has the will, the time and the means to provide loving care, together with the father. All these necessities to nurture a human being cost money, and take thoughtful planning. We need a “right to human living” movement to insure that the children who are born are wanted by their parents, and that these children, of all races, are wellfed, well‐housed and well‐educated, so that they grow up knowing they are ROSE E.

AMES For a Nixon Debate With Congress To the Editor: Your Dec. 19 editorial “Deception or. Naiveté” concludes: “Between the alternatives of deception and naiveté, the second Nixon Administration opens on a foundation of a formidable ambiguity.” It seems to me that the President is at least morally obligated to clear up this ambiguity. He could do this by doing what he did not do during the election campaign: engage in an open debate with the elected representatives of the people — designated Senators and Representatives—who hold a different view of the propriety of his actions. The Lincoln‐Douglas debates are bright spot in American history. It is common in other democracies for the heads of state to debate their policies before their legislative bodies. President Nixon has nothing to fear from engaging in such a debate. He has won the election, and Congress will not impeach him if the outcome is not in his favor. Congress, on the other hand, might decide to stop the war. In all this, there is also the serious question whether President Nixon's. actions in Vietnam are consistent with his ardent and noble desire to create “a generation of peace.” HARRY GOLDSMITH Upper Montclair, N. J., Dec. 21, 1972 Din of Subway Loudspeakers To the Editor: It seems a shame that the greatest culprit in the campaign against noise should be beyond the jurisdiction of the Mayor's Committee. The subway loudspeaker system apparently belongs exclusively to Dr. Ronan. Hundreds of thousands of ears are daily assailed by voices which are either so muffled as to be indistinguishable or so loud as to be ear‐piercing, announcing such unnecessary pieces of informa tion as the name of a station which the rider can read from the window or assailing him with superfluous instructions about “watching the doors” or “letting them out.” Yet, when that same rider seeks information, the cacophony suddenly ceases. Will the voice warn him when he enters the express at 14th Street that known delays will make the trip to Brooklyn Bridge take more than an hour? Never. And when he is so trapped will the voice give him any consolation or hope? Hardly ever. If we are doomed to suffer, could the speaker system not be converted into a means of useful information to tell the rider when he should make shift and when he should stay on? Louis S. AUCI'IINCLOSS New York, Dec. 19, 1972 • Blue Cross and Hospitals To the Editor: I would like to clarify certain aspects of the way in which Blue Cross relates to hospitals, in response to Margot Rau's Dec. 22 letter concerning Mount Sinai Hospital. Mrs. Rau's use of the term “arrangement” seems to suggest that something underhanded is taking place between hospitals and Blue Cross. This is not the case. Blue Cross “arrangement” is a contract with its member hospitals under which it pays for care rendered to its subscribers on the basis of a formal reimbursement method, officially approved by the New York State Departments of Health and Insurance. This reimbursement method is based upon the cost of efficient production of services, not upon the “room and board” charge or other charges which a hospital might bill to the non‐Blue Cross patient. This approved Blue Cross reimbursement applies to ambulatory procedures (the specific subject of Mrs, Rau's letter) as well as to in‐patient care. There is no profit for the hospital in this “arrangement” and no profit for Blue Cross. On the contrary, the. fact that the Blue Cross payment is designed not to exceed the costs of efficient production of services is a vitally important factor in limiting the rate of increase of hospital insurance premiums, GEORGE I., GOODLETT Vice President, Communication Assoc.

Roth Sides Gird for Battle on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/02/archives/both-sides-gird-for-battle-on-abortion-both-sides-gird-for-renewal.html,"In 1970, when abortion on demand was legalized in New York State, its opponents, led by the Roman Catholic Church, said they had been taken by surprise.

Other leaders are Protestant and Jewish clergymen, civil libertarians, population planners, women's liberationists, radical feminists and several city officials, including Gordon Chase, the Health Services Administrator, and Eleanor Holmes Norton, chairman of the City Commission on Human Rights. The opposition to the law is led by the Roman Catholic Church and scores of Right to Life committees around the state, which are generally dominated by Roman Catholic laymen, but also include significant conservative Protestant and Orthodox Jewish representation.

Election‐year pressures led to its consideration on the floor and subsequent passage last year. At least a few members of the Assembly and the State Senate are thought to have voted for repeal not so much out of conviction as to protect themselves at the polls and because the Governor had already announced that he would veto the measure. Perry B. Duryea of Montauk, L. the Speaker of the Assembly said in a recent interview that while the fate of the bill would be up to the committee, “my own disposition is that to send a bill to the floor just to have it debated when its ultimate fate is known is an exercise in futility.” The Governor has made it clear in recent weeks that his position in favor of liberal abortion “has not changed.” At the same time he has been emphasizing that the matter may soon be taken out of his hands, since the United States Supreme Court is expected to rule definitively on abortion, perhaps within a month or two and, in any case, no later than its summer recess. The Court heard arguments in October on appeals from Circuit Court rulings that restrictive abortion statutes in Georgia and Texas unconstitutionally restricted the rights of women. The high court's decision is also expected to dispose effectively of appeals against the New York law, which was upheld in a 5 to 2 decision last year by the State Court of Appeals, and of the restrictive Connecticut statute, which was overturned by a Federal Circuit Court. Although the arguments for and against abortion have become familiar in recent years, proponents of abortion on demand believe that their case has been strengthened by the practical results since the law took effect on July 1, 1970. Among other indicators of success, deaths attributed to abortion have all but ceased, and mortality in childbirth has dropped sharply. At the same time, many supporters of the law are hoping that the number of abortions — 402,100 in New York City alone during the 24‐month period for which figures are available — will gradually be reduced. “Abortion is obvious evidence of social failure,” Dr. Guttmacher said. “Ideally, conception should have been prevented.” He pointed out that the percentage of abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy —a period in which the fetus may attain a weight of two pounds and come close to, viability outside the womb—had been decreasing sharply. It is these abortions that many persons who support legalization find disturbing. Dr. Guttmacher is one of these. “If I had written the law II would have made 20 weeks the maximum period,” he said, “but I wouldn't tamper with it now.” Agreement on Principle Last year, in fact, Governor Rockefeller proposed an amendment to the law providing an 18‐week limit. It was rejected by the anti‐abortion forces, which said they were fighting for a principle and not taking part in “a numbers game.” This uncompromising stance has its opposite in the proabortionist camp. The Women's National Abortion Coalition, one of the radical feminist organizations that will be lobbying in Albany, argues that a woman should have absolute control over her own body, including the right of abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Judith Lambert, a staff member of the coalition, which excludes men from its decisionmaking sessions, also said she favored the training of paramedical personnel to perform early‐stage abortions with medical supervision, to reduce the cost of the procedure. She also seeks the wider use of “menstrual extraction,” by which a woman whose period is delayed can eliminate the possibility of pregnancy through a quick and simple suction procedure. It is on the principle that abortion ought not be regulated by law at all, and should be a private matter between a woman and her physician, that the proabortionists generally agree. They are supported publicly by at least a few Roman Catholic priests, notably Jesuits, among them the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Democratic Representative from Massachusetts. In the same way, the Roman Catholic bishops of Texas, confronted by the passage of an eased abortion law, issued an open letter in which they said: “In our view it would be better, in the ultimate sense, for the laws of the state to be silent on the subject than to lead positive approval to acts that deny the value of life....” Church doctrine on the question of abortion and the beginning of specifically human life has changed several times in the last 700 years. From 1591 until 1869, the church taught that the unborn infant acquired a soul only with the “quickening” — the first movement — of its body, which generally occurs between the 12th and 15th week of pregnancy. An abortion that took place before that time fell into a less‐serious category of sin. Antiabortionists assert that the church's present position that human life begins at the moment of conception, which was adopted a century ago has been borne out by recent discoveries in genetics and fetal development. However, Robert M. Byrn, a member of the faculty of the Fordham University Law School and a Right to Life leader in the city, has based his legal case, which has been rejected by the state courts and has been appealed to the United States Supreme Court, on the ground that permissive abortion statutes deny unborn infants the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. “Shouting ‘Catholic’ is an easy way to avoid confronting the issue,” he said. “I don't give a damn what Catholic history shows. To the extent that the church relied on the science of the time it was wrong.” Both Sides Confident Each side in the abortion controversy believes that the tide of events is running in its favor. The antiabortionists cite the decisive defeat of referendums seeking relaxation of abortion Maws in North Dakota and Michigan last November. In this formulation, legalized abortion is regarded as one of the major issues that sank the Presidential candidacy of Senator George S. McGovern. President Nixon, it is suggested, correctly read the public mood by allying himself with the antiabortion forces in a letter Ito Cardinal Cooke as the Legislature was debating the issue last year. A reaction is seen taking place, led by the President, against “permissiveness,” with the unspoken corollary that child‐bearing, as the penalty for sexual indulgence, be made mandatory. Proabortionists, on the other hand, point to polls showing an increasing public support for abortion on demand. They say the referendum defeats came about as a result of heavily financed last‐minute “shock” campaigns, in which billboards and television were widely used. “It's easy to be against abortion until your own daughter needs one,” said a psychiatrist who asked that his name not be used. “The white lower‐middle‐ and middle‐class people who make up the bulk of the Right to Life movement are the same people for whom illegitimate birth still carries the greatest social stigma.” Having an easy abortion law in New York, it has been suggested, makes it easier for voters in other states to reject them three. Two–thirds of the abortions performed in New York City in the first 24 months under the law have been done on out‐of‐staters, 20,000 of them from Michigan. The proabortionists also argue that the strength of the Right to Life movement at the polls has been exaggerated. Constance E. Cook, a Republican member of the Assembly from Ithaca and a sponsor of the liberalized law, pointed out that she was re‐elected last fall by the largest majority of her career. “I don't think there was a single member of the Legislature who was defeated in November because of his support of the law,” she said. Few Voting Switches Albert H. Blumenthal, the West Side Democrat‐Liberal who is assistant minority leader of the Assembly, pointed out that all but one incumbent in the city who voted for liberalized abortion had won in primary and general elections last year. The defeat of the lone exception, he said, could be attributed to redistricting rather than to his stand on abortion. On the other hand, legislators have tended to arrive at their position on abortion after carefully analyzing the sentiment in their districts, and since no antiabortionists were defeated either, all that these results may show is that there was considerable success last November in judging the mood of the voters. There were comparatively few switches in position in the Legislature between the 1970 and 1972 votes, the majorities for repeal having been provided, in general, by new members. This year there are about 50 new members in the two houses, and it is again thought that their reading of the political auguries will have a decisive effect on the voting. To influence them, and to try for further switches among returning members, the major organizations working for and against the law have already set up offices in Albany. The New York Abortion Education League, an offshoot of Planned Parenthood, has a $200,000 treasury. It shares offices with Citizens for Abortion Rights and Religious Liberty, whose co‐chairmen are the Rev. Howard Moody, pastor of Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, and Mrs. Norton of the City Rights Commission. Probably the most influential of the antiabortion lobbyists is Charles J. Tobin Jr., secretary of the New York Catholic Committee, which speaks for the state's bishops. The amount of money budgeted by Mr. Tobin's committee in its antiabortion fight and the funds spent by the rightto‐life committees in the state could not be determined, but the total was said to be not significant. The use of television and other media is not contemplated here, as it was in Michigan. “I expect even stronger majorities will vote to repeal what I describe as the abominable 1970 abortion law,” Mr. Tobin said in a recent interview. Mr. Blumenthal, a proabortionist, believes the vote will be closer than last year's. “The only thing I'm certain about, though, is that everybody will know they've been in a fight,” he said."
Legislature Convenes,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/03/archives/legislature-convenes.html,"As the New York State Legislature convenes in Albany today, its members confront an extraordinary range of issues. These run from the extremely personal question of abortion through the always nettlesome issue of relationships between the state and its cities, towns and counties. Even more pressing is need for a decision on the still unsatisfactory relationship between the electorate itself and government. This last issue is of extreme importance to New York City because the local Board of Elections has been held by the courts to be unconstitutional. New legislation is needed in ample time to allow preparation for school district elections in May and citywide primaries for Mayor and other high municipal offices in June. The best solution, in our view, would be to authorize establishment of a bipartisan board to handle the quasi‐judicial functions of the present Board of Elections, supplemented by a permanent commissioner of elections to assure orderly working of election machinery. Still other electoral reforms should ease voting and voter registration. Absentee balloting ought to be allowed in primaries as well as in general elections. For Presidential primaries the game of blind‐man's‐buff could give way to intelligent voting by letting the names of the candidates to whom slates of delegates are pledged appear on the ballot along with the slates. The state's inadequate campaign expenditure disclosure law also needs repair. As for state‐local relationships, for the first time in several years, the Legislature will have to decide how to spend surplus revenues rather than how to raise new revenues to meet impending deficits. More state aid to cities, towns and counties remains an acute need. In many areas the state has long shirked its fiscal responsibilities. Thus, the just‐released report of the Temporary Commission on the New York State Court System reinforces earlier efforts to have the state assume most of the court costs now shouldered by localities. Education, at all levels, ought to become more of a state responsibility, while transportation could be shifted even more effectively to regional authorities. The highly emotional abortion issue, debated year after year, may emerge from committee for floor consideration once more. Proper public policy, it seems to us, calls for continuing to leave individuals free to follow their own personal and religious convictions. The state has the right neither to require abortions nor to preclude them. Satisfactory experience with “no fault” automobile insurance elsewhere, particularly in Massachusetts, strongly suggests adoption of a meaningful “no fault” program here. The state's mental institutions and its prisons, both long in the legislative shadows, deserve more attention at this session. The Legislature has no lack of problems; does it have the leadership and the will to meet them?"

TV: An Intelligent Discussion of Population Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/06/archives/tv-an-intelligent-discussion-of-population-issue.html,"Once again the subject is population, or at least those aspects of the subject covered by the Population Commission in a special report to President Nixon last spring. An official film version of the report was shown on public television several weeks ago. It was disappointing, primarily because it was too broad and too slick, almost divertingly pretty. This time, tonight at 10, the American Broadcasting Company is offering “Population; Boom or Doom?” Produced and written by Marlene Sanders, the hour‐long study of the Presidential report is solid, fair, unafraid of using “talking heads,” unsensational but steadily absorbing. • The narrator is Herbert Kaplow, and he and Virginia Sherwood serve as on‐camera news correspondents. The subject of population is quickly put into some perspective: Unlike the problems in India or China, “our situation is different—not a major crisis but it is something to be concerned about.” The problem here is not space or even food supplies. It is a threat to the human “amenities and qualities of life.” The A.B.C. News program is limited to four major areas of the commission's report: population numbers, current and projected; sex education; contraceptives and abortion, and immigration policies, which annually contribute 20 per cent to this country's normal population growth. Bernard Berelson, president of the Population Council, a private group, illustrates the enormous significance in small number differences: If the average family has two children, the United States population will grow from 210 million to 350 million over the next 100 years; if it has three children, the total will soar to one billion. The threat of shifting population patterns is already evident. In an interview, Gov. Tom McCall of sparsely populated Oregon concedes that the state is conducting a campaign to discourage new residents. Noting that the Presidential Commission referred to abortion as a “complex issue requiring a thoughtful balancing of moral, personal and social values,” the program obviously supports the commission's limited pro‐abortion positions, but it carefully gives time to the antiabortion dissenters. • The anti‐abortion side is dominated by, though hardly restricted to, certain groups within the Roman Catholic Church. And Msgr. James T. McHugh of the United States Catholic Conference reiterates arguments he presented at hearings of the Population Commission. On sex education, he objects that the commission virtually ignored “input from the family.” On abortion, he rejects all methods as an “assault upon the life of the unborn child.” The monsignor's views are given professional consideration. That was not the case, unfortunately, for another anti‐abortion spokesman on Channel 13's “The 51st State” the other evening. Following a film essay on a possibly new and significant method of abortion, the spokesman was seen in the studio with the reporter and anchorman. He was allowed to present his views, but not without the accompaniment of a smug look of disbelief on the face of the reporter. It was a perfect TV case of the words delivering one message and the picture another, not entirely to the credit of the pro‐abortion side. Whatever the position on abortions, the issue is complex. It doesn't need superficial archness. Tonight's A.B.C. study of population offers a serious and valuable discussion of the issues, issues that have been, and will be, triggering intensely emotional public debates. The network has already received objections and complaints, complete with horror literature, from the more militant of the antiabortion groups. The crucial matter, however, is that the debates continue. • One of the more interesting and provocative parts of the program is tacked on near the end. The subject is not population but the response, or pronounced lack of response, of Presidents to most Presidential reports. Mr. Kaplow notes that in the case of the population report, “the President's response has been limited.” In addition, “A.B.C. News asked Nixon Administration officials to explain their position on this program, but they declined.” That particular subject might deserve a news special of its own."
Arizona Abortion Appeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/07/archives/arizona-abortion-appeal.html,"TUCSON, Ariz., Jan. 6 (AP) —A Court of Appeals decision upholding Arizona's antiabortion law will be taken to the state Supreme Court, an attorney for plaintiffs in the original case announced.

L. I. Legislators Gain Key Posts,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/07/archives/l-i-legislators-gain-key-posts-li-legislators-gain-key-posts.html,"ALBANY—The Long Island legislative delegation won a useful beachhead in its annual battle for more school aid this week when State Senator Leon E. Guiffreda of Suffolk was named chairman of the Education Committee. The Senator immediately asserted that while an array of interesting, sweeping educational reform proposals have been issued and would be studied, the probability was that the emphasis this year in Albany would be on increasing the pupil‐aid formula. The attention of much of the state and some of the nation, too, was drawn to Governor Rockefeller's dramatic life‐term prison proposals for drug dealers as the Legislature held its opening session. But minutes after the Governor departed the legislative rostrum and the television lamps were snapped off, the lawmakers leaned forward even more attentively in their seats to hear the new committee assignments. For this was a matter of bread and butter legislative politics. And the Long Island area, at least the Republican suburban part, got a generous helping, including six new chairmanships in the two houses. The area's chief political leader continues to be Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea of Montauk, a Republican many observers assume would like to run for Governor next year. This session is considered likely to enmesh him in further conflict with Governor Rockefeller, who has shown signs of seeking a fifth four‐year term as chief executive. In addition to Mr. Giuffreda's gain, the increasing spoils of suburban Republican power and seniority included the chairmanship of the Senate Insurance Committee, assigned to Jahn R. Dunne of Garden City, a proponent of no‐fault auto insurance. At the outset of this 196th session of the Legislature, those parochial and pragmatic, enough to ask “What's in it for Long Island?” could note the following: ¶A budget surplus of uncertain proportion is expected, with Long Island Republicans — notably Assemblyman Joseph M. Margiotta, the suburban bloc leader—hoping to have enough muscle to raise the school‐aid formula. ¶For Brooklyn and Queens residents interested in regaining some of the home‐rule controls now exercised by their Nassau and Suffolk neighbors, the City Charter Revision Commission is expected to seek additional time beyond this fall to do its job of making government more responsive. ¶A repetition of the annual Long Island Sound bridge minuet to expected, in which the Legislature votes to demap and the Governor then vetoes the opposition. ¶Another wetlands protection attempt is likely. Last year the Governor, urging “balance,” vetoed a bill that would have mandated virtually total protection of the wetlands. ¶The Governor has proposed that the state take over administration—but not local expenses of—Medicaid and welfare. Suffolk County Executive John V. N. Klein found this disappointing since: it offers localities no real dollar relief, just more state supervision. ¶The idle Long Island Rail Road — described as “the finest” by the Governor only a few election years ago—was viewed by Mr. Rockefeller as involved in a “tragic” labor strike that was basically a matter of Federal jurisdiction. He said he would urge changes on the Federal Government, but local legislators, feeling commuters' anger were seeking to do more. There are any number of other local issues, Including the Governor's promise of more community college aid, the possibility of a change in the way the interest rates of home mortgage loans are set, and another attempt at independent status by eastern Suffolk. Beyond these, of course, are numerous broad issues, such as abortion repeal and no‐fault auto insurance. Court Decision Awaited But this week the legislators were thinking in terms of relative power. Senator Giuffreda, a real estate and insurance executive from . Centereach, won the education chair after seven years in the Legislature. Seniority is a major factor in the chair selection process, plus the fact that Mr. Giuffreda is of the Legislature's Republican majority and, more Importantly, of the influential Long, Island bloc led by Speaker Duryea and Mr. Margiotta. Senator Giuffreda's view is that, despite the several new school reform proposals offered to the Legislature by study groups and the State Regents, the question of restructuring school financing will be decided by the United States Supreme Court. He noted the Court is expected to rule on a Texas case involving the question of the equity of local property taxes in relation to the varying quality of local school systems. In the short terni, Mr. Giuffreda Iooks forward to an increase in the existing state aid formula of $860 a. pupil. Operating expenses now are up around $1,300 and the burden on the local property tax is intolerable, he said. Other new Long Island Republican chairmen include Norman J. Levy of Long Beach on the Labor Conunittee and George A. Marino of Seaford on the Crime and Correction Committee. Committee chairs were retained by Bernard C. Smith of Northport on Conservation, and John D. Caemmerer of Mineola on Transportation. In the Assembly, John G. McCarthy of . Huntington retained the Insurance Committee chair. Fellow Republicans who picked up chairmanships included Peter J. Costigan of Port Jefferson on Ethics, Milton Jonas of Hempstead on Commerce, and Joseph M. Reilly of Oyster Bay on Labor."
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/07/archives/the-nation-lets-go-from-worse-to-bad.html,"ALBANY—State and local bureaucracies are “swollen” and unresponsive. Too many policies and programs are made by bodies unconcerned with how to raise the money to implement them. The court system is a shambles. There is a “reign of fear” because of crime and drugs. The taxpayers are (you guessed it) irate. That is a precis of Nelson A. Rockefeller's 15th annual message delivered last week at the opening of the 196th regular session of the Legislature—a 45‐page screed described by Albany observers as the harshest appraisal the Governor has ever made on the state of the State. “Creative tensions” and “productive stresses” were needed, Mr. Rockefeller told the 210 members of the Senate and the Assembly. By far the most tension‐producing and controversial of his legislative proposals was his call for mandatory life sentences for all convicted pushers of hard narcotics. But there were others, including a request for greater state responsibilities in administering welfare and Medicaid payments, state assumption of local court costs and the creation of a state inspector general to oversee primary and secondary education. The inspector general proposal was aimed at weakening the Board of Regents, which determines all educational policy in the state, and which, in the Governor's opinion, was part of the “too many policy‐making bodies” that recommended “huge new Government programs without any responsibility or interest in where the money is going to come from.” Greater state control in such areas as education, health and welfare, Mr. Rockefeller allowed, would achieve “substantial savings” and prod reluctant—sometimes rude—bureaucrats to respond to the people's wig. But not everyone was convinced that the gubernatorial message was the thunderbolt that would shake the bureaucratic monolith. “The Governor's dilemma,” said Assemblywoman Constance E. Cook, Republican of Ithaca, “is that he is always attacking bureaucracy, while at the same time he wants more control and that involves more bureaucracy.” Some legislators believed the message was “purely political”—that the Governor was gearing up to run for a fifth term next year. Others cited the lofty rhetoric in the opening portions of the message in which he discussed the study he had undertaken, with President Nixon's approval, of “our problems in the context of a highly competitive and rapidly evolving world.” That raised a few eyebrows among the Capitol seers interested, in politics as a profession and a pastime. Was Nelson Rockefeller still casting longing eye on the White House? Why not, they said, he has had everything else. Aides to the Governor dismissed all this as twaddle. The newly elected Republican‐controlled Legislature begins its routine tomorrow and in the ensuing weeks and months faces the following major issue along with a host of local interest legislation: • A growing controversy over an expected budget surplus, caused by Federal revenue‐sharing funds and by increased state reventies. The estimates have ranged from $66‐million to about $500‐million, with the Governor's the low one. Everyone has ideas on how to spend it. There are suspicions Mr. Rockefeller is trying to hide it so that there will be a rosy budget outlook when the 1974 election year rolls around. The next weeks will be spent trying to determine just how much it really will be. • A renewed and anguished debate over repeal of the state's liberalized abortion law, permitting a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancy. Not even the pledge of a veto, something the Governor employed last year, is expected to stop this issue from reaching the floors of both houses. Lobbyists for right‐to‐life groups, who want restoration of the old state law permitting abortions only when a mother's life is imperiled, and lobbyists favoring the present law are already geared up for the fray. • The Governor and the Republican leaders have pledged some form of nofault automobile accident insurance—the big consumer issue in the Legislature this year. Last year the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, whose members engage in, negligence Work, sandbagged a diluted no‐fault bill in an appeal to the innate instincts of the lawyer‐dominated Legislature. • Court reform has everyone in the act—Mayor Lindsay has a plan, a temporary state commission has issued two volumes on the subject, the Governor will have proposals and so will some individual lawmakers. • Mr. Rockefeller has a plan to update how education is financed in the state. Some legislators hope that it will mean a lessening of the burden on home owners who pay property taxes. There are many other issues to be dealt with once the pall cast by the Governor”s glum message lifts. Its message as summed up by one wag: “Let's go from worse to bad.” —WILLIAM E. FARRELL Drugs Lifelong ‘Cure’ by Rockefeller The modern theory of sentencing: The punishment should fit the individual as well as the crime. The Modern theory of penology: Crimimils should be rehabilitated, using probation and parole wherever possible. The modern theory of drug addiction: It is a disease and should be treated as such. Last week, the Governor of New York appeared to reject all such theories. In his “State of the State” message to the Legislature, he called for mandatory life imprisonment of all sellers of drugs and of all who commit violent crimes while under the influence of drugs. There would be no plea bargaining, no parole, no suspended sentences. (The only exception would be defendants under the age of 19, who would be eligible for parole after 15 years). And “bounty” would be paid to those who informed on addicts and sellers. There were a few cries of outrage in response to the Governor's message from such as the New York Civil. Liberties Union. But many persons, including a number who once would have been quick to label the plan outrageous, reacted cautiously or declined to comment at all. Those who did comment pointed out a host of problems with the proposal, but almost unanimously applauded the prospect of being “tough” on drugs. Thus by week's end, it appeared that some tough laws on drugs would be passed by the Legislature this year. The Governor explained his action in these words: “We have tried every possible approach to stop addiction and save the addict through education and treatment ... We have allocated over $1‐billion. But let's be frank — let's ‘tell it like it is’: We have achieved very little permanent rehabilitation — and have found no cure ... The crime, the muggings the robberies, the murders associated with addiction continue to spread a reign of terror.” Those who were critical of the program suggested that the state had not tried every approach. Said Representative Bella Abzug: “A comprehensive rehabilitative drug program that has been adequately funded and administered has yet to be tried.” The state set up the Narcotic Addiction Control Commission (N.A.C.C.) to treat addicts under the “all‐out war” on narcotics that Mr. Rockefeller announced in 1966. But as some critics noted, these facilities were substantially shut down for year as a result of insufficient funding. Beyond that, many drug experts have recently begun, to sense a slowdown in the heroin epidemic. And they point out that several recent studies indicate that drug addiction causes less street crime than had previously been thought. The sweep of the Governor's proposal has raised a number of questions. Under present law the crime of “sale” of drugs includes gifts of drugs. Did the Governor intend, some asked, to mandate life imprisonment for a Westchester housewife who gives her neighbor some hashish? Sources in the Governor's office indicated that he did. What of the range of drugs? The Governor excepted marijuana but referred specifically to hashish, LSD, amphetamines, heroin and “other dangerous drugs.” Questioned too was the Governor's failure to make any distinction between small‐time addict pushers and college‐kid experimenters on the one hand and big‐time dealers on the other. Many penologists and others suggested there should be a distinction; the Governor's press office indicated that none was either intended or forthcoming. There were some constitutional questions too. The Eighth Amendment ban on “cruel and unusual punishment,” some lawyers suggested, might preclude a mandatory life term with no hope of parole for a 20‐year‐old first offender caught giving a pound of hashish to his girt friend. On an even more practical level, some observers suggested that the Governor's proposal was simply impossible to implement. Not only would many more prisons have to be built, they said, but, because the Governor would forbid plea bargaining and thus necessitate many more trials, more courts and judges and prosecutors and lawyers would also be needed. Some cynics believe that the Governor made his proposal for purely political purposes: He knew That the public was weary of drugs and eager for a solution, having heard these sentiments repeatedly at his recent series of “town meetings;” he also knew, the theory went, that the Legislature would not pass his proposal in toto. So he issued the proposal, it was said, to exhibit a “tough” image for the headlines. Yet state officials and associates in the Rockefeller administration offered another explanation: The Governor's personal sense of frustration. He is not, they noted, fond of programs that do not work out the way he had expected; N.A.C.C., despite his compliments to the commission in his speech, had clearly not worked out. —LESLEY OELSNER Nixon's Team Now There Are Supers And SuperSupers WASHINGTON—When his official Cabinet was slow to act, Andrew Jackson turned to his Kitchen Cabinet for help. Franklin Roosevelt had his Brain Trust, Last Friday, frustrated by the largest and most complex Government bureaucracy ever created, Richard Nixon proclaimed a massive reorganization of the Executive Branch — the most sweeping in history. He rolled out a super Cabinet and a super super Cabinet—a total of eight trusted aides and official Cabinet members — who will be superimposed on the existing Government machinery. It was not entirely clear who would be super and who would be super super. Much depends on how it all works out. But basically what happened was that the President, tired of waiting for Congress to enact the reorganization plan he proposed almost two years ago, moved to put much of the plan Into effect as he could by executive order. The President wants a Department of Human Resources to oversee health, education, manpower development, income security, social services, Indian and native peoples, drug abuse and consumer protection—functions that are now scattered throughout the executive branch. So he is bringing to the White House as Counselor cool, analytical Caspar Weinberger, who earlier was designated as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to run Human Resources just as if the reorganization had taken place. Mr. Weinberger will keep the title of H.E.W. Secretary. Similarly, James Lynn, the quickstudy lawyer who has been appointed as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, will be Counselor in charge of community planning and institutions, highways, public transportation, regional development, disaster relief and national capital affairs; and Agriculture Secretary Earl L. Butz will be Counselor for natural resources in charge of resource use, lands and minerals, environment, outdoor recreation, water control, parks and wildlife. So much for the super Cabinet. There were possibly five men on the super‐super level, all with the title of Presidential Assistant: Henry Kissinger, foreign affairs, and George L. Shultz, Secretary of the Treasury, economic matters; H. R. Haldeman, White House administrator; John D. Ehrlichman, domestic affairs, and Roy Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Thus on the organizational chart at least, these five Assistants are notch above the three new Counselors. Mr. Nixon, however, said that the five “will work immediately under me, and at my direction, to integrate and unify policies and operations throughout the executive branch of the Governments.” The three new Counselors will report to Mr. Ehrlichman. The present departments and agencies outside of the White House will—and must—remain in place, Only Congress has the constitutional right to break them up or create new ones. But their heads will report to the appropriate Counselor or Assistant, depending on the subject at hand. Some of the agencies directly under the White House—they include, for example, the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Office of Emergency Planning—will be cut back or abolished. The President has not designated which are to go but he said the 4,000 jobs under the White House will be reduced to about 2,000, The Administration denies that, the cutback will be offset by a buildup in the staffs of the officials. In one sense, the Government will be more complicated with a super secretary trying to run programs out of five or six departments. Interest groups could find it harder to get attention, The sponsor of a manpower training program, for example, who now goes to the Secretary of Labor might also have to go to Counselor Weinberger. This is the crux or Congressional opposition to the Nixon plan. Members of Congress; who are closer than the President to the interests, have tried to keep departments small, and they view consolidation as further concentration of power in the Presidency. Mr. Nixon sought to make the move palatable by elevating Cabinet officials to the super agencies. Thus they can still be called for Congressional testimony. One reason Congress has not acted on the reorganization was that some members felt it would, be necessary to reorganize the Congressional committee structure at the same time. The action Mr. Nixon took last week avoids that problem. No one was predicting how well it would work. Even John Ehrlichman called it “an experiment.” But it was certain that the Government was being placed in the hands of a rather singular group of Nixon loyalists and technicians who would see to it that the President's goal of getting his grip on the bureaucarcy is achieved. —JOHN BERBERS Spending Issue Nixon vs. Congress—Clash of Priorities WASHINGTON—President Nixon is risking a major confrontation with Congress over his refusal to spend money that Congress has appropriated. The growing congressional anger could spell trouble for the President—possibly even the passage of legislation greatly circumscribing his power to hold back such funds. Why is Mr. Nixon risking such confrontation? The story is not all one‐sided, but in the view of a great many economists, it Mr. Nixon's premises and priorities are accepted there is a very good reason for his highly controversial effort to hold total Government spending in the current fiscal year to $250‐billion and to maintain it in the range of $267–270‐billion in the next fiscal year. The case was put simply last week by Joseph M. Barr, former Democratic Secretary of the Treasury and now chairman of a bank here: “If the Congress continues a level of high and increasing expendtures, and if no one takes the responsibility for raising taxes, then we could all be in trouble by the end of the year.” The American economy, after nearly three years of sluggishness lasting until late 1971, is now expanding powerfully. There are still idle men (5.2 per cent of the labor force is unemployed) and idle machines, but the economy is heading toward full capacity operation and fairly full employment. There is a widespread view that the economy does not overshoot the mark, the nation could be in for a period of relatively non‐inflationary prosperity lasting into 1974 and even beyond. And the view is equally widespread that the one thing most likely to make the economy overshoot the mark—with a return to intense inflation, followed by Government restraint and another recession—is excessive Government spending in 1973. What then, is the other side? First, there are some economists who believe that the President and his advisers are excessively afraid of overstimulation this year. But a more common view among Mr. Nixon's opponents is that his economic reasoning and analysis are essentially right, but his conclusion is wrong. In this view the right Government policy this year is to go ahead and spend the money approved by Congress for such things as pollution abatement, but to raise taxes as well, preferably to take effect in 1974. There is much criticism of both the President and Congress for the tax reductions that occurred in 1969 and 1971. The President has been adamant in declining to propose higher taxes. Finally, there is the view of the members of Congress themselves, who are infuriated at the President's assumption that he alone can decide on the nation's priorities and frustrate the intent of Congress. Some believe, in fact, that legal technicalities aside, there is a serious Constitutional issue at stake. Nevertheless, the economic case is a serious one, given the President's refusal to propose a tax increase. The Government, counting the current fiscal year, will run three consecutive budget deficits in the neighborhood of $23‐billion. Although enormous, such deficits did no major damage while the economy was slack. But another deficit of that size as full employment approaches would probably cause nothing but trouble. For example, interest rates would almost certainly shoot up as the Government bid against rising private credit demands for a limited supply of funds. And total demand or spending would grow more rapidly than agricultural and industrial supply, with a classic “demand pull” inflation as a result—one that price and wage controls could not check for long. If the Government's deficit is cut in the next fiscal year to the $10.13‐billion range, as the President intends, the forecasts indicate a sturdy but not excessive expansion in 1973 and a good year in 1974 as well. Thus the President has already slashed such programs as rural electrification and farm disaster loans, to cries of anguish in and out of Congress, and more cuts are expected—and with them, more controversy. —EDWIN L.

ECONOMIC RULINGS DUE IN HIGHER,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/08/archives/economic-rulings-due-in-high-court-interest-is-focusing-on-how.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 7—The Supreme Court faces a series decisions of critical importance to business, industry and the nation's economy as President Nixon's second term approaches. As has been increasingly true in recent years, the publicity spotlight is more likely to focu, on the Court's rulings on social issues. On the horizon this year are major cases involving such controversial matters as ob. scenity, abortion, public school financing and busing. But the docket for the 1972‐73 term is also heavy with cases that may have considerable national impact on labor‐management relations, advertising, taxation, Government control over mergers and the legality of specific practices in the oil, drug and communications industries, among others. Conservative Justices Of particular interest to business leaders will be the effectiveness as a bloc of the four more conservative Justices appointed by President Nixon: Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist. In criminal and social decisions, this group has been able, on occasion, to attract a fifth vote from the moderate‐to‐liberal wing of the Court for a majority among the nine Justices. Among a number of pending cases affecting the relative Tights of labor unions and employers is one arising in Louisiana involving the question of whether striking workers who destroy company property may be prosecuted under the Federal law that prohibits violence in obstructing interstate commerce (U.S. v. Emmons). Demonstrations an Issue The court has also agreed to decide whether an employer has the right to refuse to hire an otherwise qualified job applicant who is black on the ground that he had participated in civil rights demonstrations against the company (McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green). A Court hearing is being sought by a Texas woman who contends that her civil rights were infringed by being discharged from a state job two months before she expected a Daby. The decision could have road effect on employers' pregtancy policies (Schattman v. texas Employment Comm.). Already in the early weeks if the term, the Court has decided that a union could not fine members who resigned after a strike vote and went lack to work (N.L.R.B. v. Granite State). It has declined to review a lower court finding that unions may engage in coalition bargaining” by making one contract conditional on he signing of others involving subsidiary companies (Phelps lodge Corp. v. A.F.L.‐C.I.O.). One of the biggest financial cases that the Court will decide in 1973, at least in money terms, involves an antitrust acon by Trans World Airlines gainst the Hughes Tool Company, whose stock was sold in public offering Dec. 8 by the millionaire recluse, Howard Hughes. At stake is a lower court award of over $163‐million to T.W.A., with interest alone running at $11‐million a year. (Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines). Other antitrust cases before the Court deal with the proposed acquisition of a $41‐million Greeley, Colo., bank by a $1‐billion Denver bank holding company (U.S. v. First National Bancorporation), the purchase of an Illinois steel company by General Dynamics (U.S. v. General Dynamics) and the acquisition of the Narragansett Brewing Company in New England by the Falstaff Brewing Corporation, of St. Louis, the fourth largest in the country (U.S. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp.). Awaiting decision is a package of cases with serious implications for the broadcasting industry, involving whether radio and television stations have a constitutional obligation to sell time for balancing statements on controversial issues (C.B.S. v. Democratic National Committee, etc.). Also in the communications area, the Justices have agreed to hear a case in which a newspaper has been prohibited from using male and female classifications in employment ads because it constitutes discrimination (Pittsburgh Press v. Comm. on Human Relations). Among other 1973 cases with serious national economic consequences are these involving the effect of accelerated depreciation rates on utility taxes (F.P.C. v. Memphis Light), states' power to create unlimited liability for polluting offshore water (Askew v. American Waterways) and the courts' power to review findings of the Food and Drug Administration on drug effectiveness (Richardson v. Hynson).

ABORTION BACKERS ASSAIL PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/10/archives/abortion-backersassail-president-say-white-house-enlisted-cooke-to.html,"Alfred F. Moran, the chief executive officer for Planned Parenthood of New York City, charged yesterday that the campaign to repeal the state's liberal abortion law was being “led by the White House”—because, he said, President Nixon had “virtually asked Cardinal Cooke to lead this fight.” Mr. Moran warned that the law's defenders, “not so naive as last year,” now were willing to “make it a clear‐cut religious issue.” At, a news conference at the Roosevelt Hotel to announce a coalition drive to “educate the public and the Albany legislators” on how the law is actually working, figures were released disclosing a “profile” of the typical abortion patient who is a resident of New York City. Mr. Moran's reference to Mr. Nixon harked back to a letter the President sent in May to Cardinal Cooke, saying he wished to associate himself “personally” with the Cardinal's opposition to the law and calling the repeal campaign of the archdiocese “a noble endeavor.” “We do not say that we're taking on either the Catholic Church or the President,” Mr. Moran said. “But we do say that we are horrified at the regressive position—particularly coming from the White House—that the President took in choosing the Catholic hierarchy to lead the opposition to the law.” Archdiocese Responds Responding later for the Archdiocese, Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, director of communications, said: “Catholic opposition to abortion is a matter of Christian principle that antedates any American President's administration. It is a moral issue, but it is also a constitutional question of the protection of human life.” Planned Parenthood's “profile” of the resident abortionpatient showed her to be in her 20's, with only 18 per cent under 20 and 24 per cent over 30. She is terminating a second‐through‐fifth pregnancy. Thirtyeight per cent of abortions for residents are for first pregnancies and 40 per cent are third through fifth. And 80 per cent are in the first three months of pregnancy. The resident patient is “nonwhite or Puerto Rican”—nearly 47 per cent the former and over 11 per, cent the latter, compared with 42 per cent for whites. Mr. Moran called these figures “significantly disproportionate to those for live births,” which are just over 54 per cent white, about 30 per cent nonwhite and 16 per cent Puerto Rican. The Planned Parenthood figures were based on Health Services Administration statistics, which showed just under 64,000 abortions for city residents from July, 1971, through June, 1972. Abortions here for nonresidents totaled 132,000. Most Unmarried Mr. Moran said later that there were no statistics to differentiate married and unmarried patients “because most facilities do not ask that question.” “My guess,” he said, “is that 60 per cent of all abortion patients here are unmarried but that this figure would be only 45 per cent for resident patients. I base this on their higher age, their termination of third‐to‐fifth pregnancies and their almost 3‐to‐1 utilization of hospitals compared with free‐standing clinics.” Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said he believed “nothing would be sacrificed, medically” if the up‐to‐24‐weeks provision of the present law were reduced to 20 weeks. “Anything below that,” he said, “would produce hardship particularly by making tests meaningless when abortion is desirable for genetic reasons. “Twenty‐four weeks, he said “does give the doctor room to move around in to make medical judgments.” Mr. Moran and other Planned Parenthood officials present however, barred compromise with the 24‐week provision o?? “this model law,” although they said that—like most pro‐abor?? tion groups—they would prefe?? the repeal of all abortion laws"
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/10/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 10, 1973 The Major Events of the Day International Pentagon officials said yesterday that American pilots were being permitted to cross the 20th Parallel in pursuit of North Vietnamese jets that attempt to attack United States B‐52's and other bombers south of the 20th Parallel. The sources, who were speaking privately, said that in one instance last Sunday, an American F‐4 Phantom, in chasing and shooting down a North Vietnamese MIG‐21, crossed the lihe, which President Nixon has again set as the northernmost limit in bombing North Vietnam. [Page 1, Columns 6–7.1 Henry A. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho held the second session of their current round of private talks on a Vietnam cease‐fire. They met for five and a half hours and gave no sign of what had been discussed. [3:4–6.] The United States command reported that heavy B‐52 raids had been made for the second day on Communist‐troop concentrations in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam, near Kontum. The raids were said to have been directed at the area northwest of Kontum, where the borders of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia meet. [3:1–3.] President Pompidou of France denounced the expected arrival in Paris on the weekend of five Socialist heads of government as “an intrusion into French Internal politics,” and therefore “perfectly inopportune.” At a news conference, he said that the leaders of the Socialist International are “coming as party militants,” and that they will have no contact with. French authorities. [1:6–8.] National Wholesale prices increased in December at a pace that has not been equalled since the inflationary surge that followed the start of the Korean War. The Labor Department's index of wholesale prices rose 1.6 per cent in December, after adjustments were made to eliminate the influence of regularly recurring, purely seasonal factors. [1:8.] President Nixon observed his 60th birthday in continued silence and isolation regarding his conduct of the Vietnam war. But if aides who have been in close touch with the President, and who usually reflect his views, are any indication Mr. Nixon believes that he has been unfairly attacked for the recent United States bombing of the Hanoi‐Halphong area. [1:3.5.] President Nixon's first two new Cabinet nominees to face Senate confirmation proceedings refused to commit themselves on key Administration policies. Elliot L. Richardson, prospective Secretary of Defense, declined to give his personal views on the recent United States bombing campaign in North Vietnam, and Claude S. Brinegar, prospective Secretary of Transportation, declined to say whether he believed that urban areas should be allowed to use Federal highway funds for mass transit systems. [1:6–7.] New Orleans policemen identified the sniper at the Downtown Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge as Mark Essex, 23 years old, of Emporia, Kan„ and said that the rifle used to shoot hotel guests and policemen was the same weapon that killed a police cadet and wounded a patrolman, on New Year's Eve. [1:1–2.] Metropolitan John W. Wilson, 23 years old, was arrested in Indianapolis and charged with the stabbing murder of 28‐year‐old Roseann Quinn, a teacher, in her West 72d Street apartment last week. The police said that the defendant met Miss Quinn for the first time on the night she was killed, and that he has no known address or occupation, but has a prison record. [1:1–2.] Mayor Lindsay said that the way to safer streets, healed families and a greater sense of security was not to be found in “impractical, unworkable and vindictive penalties” proposed by Governor Rockefeller for drug pushers and addicts who commit violent crimes, [1:5.] Governor Rockefeller, predicting an increasingly rosy fiscal picture for the state, said that local governments would receive $93‐million more in state‐revenue sharing funds in fiscal 1973–74 than in the current fiscal year ending March 31. It is estimated that the city would receive 60 per cent, or $55.8‐million, of the increase. [1:3.] In a three‐count indictment, a Federal grand jury in Newark. charged John A. Kervick, New Jersey State Treasurer,, from 1958 to 1970, with extorting $113,200 from Frederic R.

Mini‐Courses at Hunter High: Comic Books and Conversational Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/11/archives/minicourses-at-hunter-high-comic-books-and-conversational-chinese.html,"Melissa Singer and Karen Gumbs are lecturing on comic books this week. They have 11 students in their class of varying ages, and by the end of the week, the 13‐year‐old teachers will have devoted something more than three hours to explaining the history and background of one of their favorite pastimes. “Comic books teach you a lot about social values,” said Miss Singer, swinging her Alice‐in‐Wonderland hairdo. She said she thought her classes had gone very well—“The kids even raised their hands to ask questions.” The class in comic books is one of more than 100 “minicourses” that are replacing regular lectures this week at the Hunter College High School. The 1,200‐pupil school, a division of the Board of Higher Education, is limited, for the present, to girls only and is made up of particularly bright and talented children. About 300 of upward of 2,500 applicants are selected each year. All the applicants are Grade 6 students who are at least two years above av erage in English and mathematics, and, once admitted, they remain in the school from the 7th through the 12th grade. There is, as well, a special admissions program for children who do not do well in the elementary test but are nominated by school principals as “having potential.” These students go through an intensive summer program before registering for regular classes. The annual week‐long minicourses were started two years ago by the school's student‐faculty innovative programs committee. The courses take in a wide range of subjects (card tricks, tumbling, witchcraft, embroidery, horsemanship, bridge, Russian, consciousness‐raising and city government among them) and are taught by regular instructors, guest lecturers, students and parents. Parents are also invited to sit in on any class of interest to them; students are required to select three single or one double and a single course. “This is a program of studies that would not generally fit into the existing curriculum,” said Bernard S. Miller, director of the school, outlining the purpose behind the Annual change‐of‐pace. “There's an interchange ... a healthy reaction ... between the students and the teachers and they look at each other in different lights.” To most of the students, the mini‐classes are not only a break in routine but also an opportunity to delve into peripheral areas that could eventually lead to permanent interests. “The courses are a great idea,” said Marvin Morgenstern, a father who had volunteered his services for the 40‐minute morning class in chamber music. Mr. Morgenstern, whose 14‐year‐old daughter chose a computer course “because she's clobbered with chamber music at home,” is a professional musician with the American String Trio. Traditional Garb Mr. Morgestern showed up for work in traditional men's garb despite a tonguein‐cheek request from Helen Finegold, acting chairman of the Fine Arts department, that participants dress in “attire appropriate for chamber music.” Miss Finegold compromised by topping her dark hair with a long blond wig; Jean Ishizuka, a department teacher, covered her hair with a mass of red curls; students in the course showed up in everything from paper and lace jabots to old‐fashioned jackets with nipped‐in waistlines and jeans rolled up to look like knickers. Although typing was one of the most popular courses, with 130 girls registered (chess had 136 registrations), it was apparently unrelated to any secretarial or stenographic ambitions. “For a career? Oh no!” exclaimed 13‐year‐old Eileen Hunt of the Bronx. “I'm going to be a lawyer ... I made up my mind in elementary school and both my mother and my father want me to.” Mr. Hunt is a telephone company employe and Mrs. Hunt is a housewife. Judith Thompson, the daughter of a Brooklyn construction worker, chose typing and stage make‐up for her courses. She plans, however, to be a doctor or nurse. “I'd like something to do with medicine; I'd like to help sick people,” she said. “But I'd like to learn typing to type my reports and I'd like to learn to make myself up to look different if I wanted to.” Feminism Ranks Low The course on feminism was somewhere at the low end of the selections. Thirteen girls enrolled for it, but at least one said she had been “stuck with it.” “I had to take it because of the time period but really didn't want it,” said Melissa Ritter, a 13‐year‐old eighth‐grade student. “In feminism, you can get your own ideas.” Vietnam, with six registrations, was on a par with Russian, and Clark's civilization, a course based on the Kenneth Clark television series. “I think the kids have had it,” Dr. Miller said. “They now have the same apathy and feeling of uselessness as the adults.” The course in conversational Chinese, offered by Wai Wah Chin and Virginia Tong, both 16‐year‐old students in Grade 11, attracted 13 girls, among them Jyll Townes, 13. “I like it, I like it ... I don't know why but I like it,” she said enthusiastically. “I've always wondered about it, the strange letters and everything ... and I like Chinese food.” Barbara Pollack, a 15‐year‐old would‐be lawyer from Brooklyn, thought that the popularity of the course on the Supreme Court (66 registrations) might be because many of the students were interested in outside groups involved in politics, abortion and the Vietnam war. Miss Pollack, who is also acting as a teacher this week, with a course in Jewish law for 10 of her peers, said she had already learned one thing from her experience. “It took me weeks and weeks to prepare and learn how to say it and now I've said it,” she lamented. “It went so fast.” But, she added: “Mini courses are the best ... better than school.” The remark was overheard by Dr. Miller. “It is school,” he said with a grin."
U.S. PUTS OFF PLAN FOR ABORTION FILM,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/11/archives/us-puts-off-plan-for-abortion-film.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UPI) —The Government has halted temporarily plans to distribute to public schools and colleges a controversial population film advocating legal abortion the Administration's top population experts said today. “Pressure was applied to the White House and inquiries made to the White House and therefore the decision is being reviewed by the Secretary,” said Dr. Louis M. Hellman, Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. “It is not a technical decision now it's a political, decision.” Dr. Hellman said some antiabortion groups, including local Right to Life organizations, began a campaign of public pressure to block the film's distribution. He added that mail opposing distribution has been received by H.E.W. from Right to Life groups in Pierre, S.D., and Westchester County, N.Y., although the department's mail was running, about 5 to 1 in favor of distribution. The “sensitivities” forced H.E.W.'s Secretary, Elliot L, Richardson, to call a halt in the project, which was scheduled to get underway Jan. 2, Dr. Hellman said. “But there is a very good chance this will be approved.” DON'T FORGET THE NEEDIEST!"
Queens Man Loses Bid to Ban Abortions in City Temporarily,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/12/archives/queens-man-loses-bid-to-ban-abortions-in-city-temporarily-statute.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 —Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court today denied an application for a temporary restraining order that would have prohibited abortions in New York City until a pending challenge to the legality of the 1970 New York state law is decided by the High Court. The injunction was sought by Robert M. Byrn of Queens, who is also bringing the court case against the statute. Justice Marshall, who handles such matter; for the Second Circuit (New York, Connecticut and Vermont), denied the application without comment. In his application, Mr. Byrn charged that New York hospitals were “inflicting death by induced elective abortion on more than 100 unborn children daily” and that “thousands more” would be killed before a final court decision on the constitutionality of the law. Mr. Byrn won a preliminary injunction against the statute in State Supreme Court in Queens last January. But that action was stayed pending appeals, and the Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed the decision, 4 to 1, six weeks later. In July, the Court of Appeals voted 5 to 2 to affirm the Appellate Division, and Mr. Byrn filed an appeal with the United States Supreme Court last September. Statute Gets New Backing Representatives Bella S. Abzug and Shirley Chisholm joined several state legislators, city officials and labor leaders yesterday in supporting a feminist‐oriented campaign to save the 1970 abortion law on the basis of “democracy versus hypocrisy.” “Democratized abortion is not just a women's‐rights issue, but a matter of public health,” said Michael Blumenfeld, deputy commissioner of the Health Services Administration. He said the city “will do all it can in the fight” to keep the law. Feels Minorities Will Suffer “The hypocrisy of those who would undo abortion reform is staggering,” Representative Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, said at a news conference of 20 participants organized by the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition to announce plans for an Albany rally and an “abortion tribunal” here. “They speak of ‘the right to life,’” Representative Abzug said, but “show no concern” for women “left to the surreptitious and frequently unskilled abortionist” or for “the child born unwanted.” Representative Chisholm, Democrat‐Liberal of Brooklyn, said in a statement sent to the news conference that “minority‐group and other poor women will suffer most” if the law is repealed. “Before it went into effect, black and Puerto Rican women experienced the highest maternal death rate, almost all attributed to botched back‐room abortions,” she said. They cannot, she said, “get two psychiatrists to certify that they will jump off the bridge if they are not spared the burden of an unwanted pregnancy.” Mr. Blumenfeld said the city had not had a fatality since July, 1971, from abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. He said there had been 17 fatalities since 1970 from abortions in the second trimester, compared with one since last June."
What Makes ‘Poseidon’ Fun?,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/14/archives/what-makes-poseidon-fun-why-is-poseidon-fun.html,"ARK movies are easy to describe: a group of assorted characters (two of each is the accepted way) are put aboard an ocean liner, in an airplane, or maybe on a bridge that clearly looks unsafe to us but to no one within the film. In short order (the shorter the better for this sort of thing to be successful), the bridge collapses, the ocean liner starts sinking, or the airplane threatens to crash (though two out of three times it doesn't), which is the easiest way to explain survivors in Ark Movies about airplanes, most air crashes being so fatal. This is also the factor that makes Ark Movies about airplanes seem such gyps. The technology and the ingenuity of survival are what fascinate us in Ark Movies, especially survival after some spectacularly dreadful sequence of events that has effectively eliminated all of the non‐speaking roles and all the other not‐quite‐anonymous actors, leaving us with small group of featured performers and one or two stars to figure things out against odds that must, ultimately, be surmountable. Some of which may explain why found Ronald Neame's “The Poseidon Adventure” such innocent, earnest entertainment as it satisfied a certain lust for classic form, although I'd been thoroughly bored by “Airport,” the movie to which it can be too glibly compared. “The Poseidon Adventure” puts the Ark Movie back where God intended it to be, in the water. Not flying around in the air on one engine or with a hole in its side. I can think of no really good Ark Movies, films that one might go back to see a second time, yet I see them all, usually sooner than later—“Airport,” “The High and The Mighty,” “A Night to Remember,” “Titanic,” “Phone Call From A Stranger.” I'm not at all sure that such semior pre‐Ark movies as Stanley Kramer's “Ship of Fools” wouldn't have been better if his liner had run into a submerged object early on, or that George Cukor's “Dinner at 8” wouldn't be still more vivid in my memory if something cataclysmic had interrupted all of the elegant chatter and back‐biting. This may sound as if I have a peculiar affection for disaster, at least on the screen. Perhaps I do. I also have affection for the kind of special effects that are so beautifully executed in “The Poseidon Adventure” and make the film so much fun, even when the screenplay (by Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes, based on Paul Gallico's novel) is burrowing into some new foolishness with all of the intensity of a mad mole digging through soap chips. When, early in the film, we see the S.S. Poseidon, en route from New York to Athens, plowing through a Mediterranean gale, the combination of model liner and studio‐made (I assume) high seas is so effective that one applauds the ferocity while acknowledging the fakery. When, a little later, a few minutes after midnight on New Year”s Eve as the Poseidon is steaming between Gibraltar and Sicily (I think, but the film is fuzzy on its navigation), the ship is walloped by a 90‐foot wave and turns over, hull‐up, the movie delivers all of the details of disaster that could possibly be promised by even the most hyperbolic ad campaign. It seemed apparent from the audience with which I saw the film last Sunday afternoon at the National Theater (it's also playing at the Beckman) that a lot of the people had been pre‐sold by the television commercials. One little boy sitting in front of me was anticipating the big wave (supposedly caused by the collapse of a section of sea floor north of Crete) almost from the film's first frame. “Here it comes!” he announced during the initial gale sequence. But it didn't. “Here it comes!” he announced again at the height of the carefree New Year's celebrations aboard the Poseidon. This time he was right. As any student of Ark Movies knows, disaster strikes most effectively at carefree moments. We know what's going to happen. They don't. Which is very much a part of the simple pleasures afforded by such fiction. The pleasures are simple, and have little to do with characterization or acting, or such techniques as the split screens with which George Seaton tried to jazz up the old‐fashioned nonsense of “Airport.” “The Poseidon Adventure” has no first‐magnitude stars on the order of Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin, no first ladies of the theater like Helen Hayes, no particularly topical problems (abortion)—all of which contributed to the dogged fatuousness of the Seaton film. It tried to put on airs, to act above its station, which is that of upper low‐brow fiction. “The Poseidon Adventure” makes no such mis‐@@takes. Its stars (Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Roddy McDowell, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters) and its so‐called co‐stars (Jack Albertson, Pamela Sue Martin, Arthur O'Connel, Eric Shea “and Leslie Nielsen as The Captain”) are all relentlessly second‐magnitude, which is no reflection on their talent, but rather an acknowledgement that most of them are names who, with the possible exception of Hackman, don't mean a great deal at any box office. There is also something very second‐magnitude about the characters they play—a sweet old Jewish couple (Albertson and Miss Winters) on their way to Israel, a hardheaded cop (Borgnine) and his wife (Miss Stevens), who is a former prostitute, a swinging preacher (Hackman) who sees poverty in conventional prayer, a lonely little haberdasher (Buttons), and so on and so forth. The screenplay offers some of the most uncomfortably maudlin if obligatory death scenes you're likely to see all this year, and my favorite line (out of a 1972 movie) directed to God: “We don't want You to fight for us. Just don't fight against us!” It's the kind of movie in which earnest enemies become admiring friends and in which simple pleas for understanding touch cold hearts, all the while as the small group of survivors of the Poseidon disaster struggle to make their way upwards into the bowels of the ship and, they hope, freedom, after the ship has capsized. The simple pleasures of “The Poseidon Adventure” are mostly technical and, I suspect, not at all simple to effect. The interior, pre‐capsize scenes of the film were shot aboard the Queen Mary, now in Long Beach, California, and it's the old Queen's innards, especially its first‐class dining room, that are carefully recreated in studio mock‐ups of the upside‐clown liner. The sequence in which the ship rolls over is seen almost entirely from the point‐of‐view of the passengers in the dining room, and it's a smashing bit of photographed, simulated chaos, of gradual fright and then sudden panic, of extras dropping from the floor to ceiling, while the film's stars and co‐stars survive, as you know they must. Shortly after this big scene, you stop worrying about acting and writing and logic and probability. You simply enjoy the engineering feats of the moviemakers, which are so effective that they touch even outrageous things with credibility. Last week the audience at the National actu ally applauded a bit of business by Shelley Winters that, in another, less spectacular film, would have had me asking for my money back. I'm beginning to think that when Miss Winters, who can be a very good comedienne, wants us to know she's acting, she just eats a lot. Perhaps I'm being unreasonable. The audience clearly adores her, to such an extent that at one point, when it appeared the character might be having a heart attack, a lady in my row cried out with concern: “Aw, come on, Shelley!” If they are nothing else, Ark Movies are what the trade calls, with justification, audience pictures."
As Massachusetts went—,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/14/archives/as-massachusetts-went-im-frommassachusetts-dont-blame-me.html,"BOSTON. On election night, I went to a television‐watching party at a spacious Manhattan duplex. By the time I arrived, the networks' electronic tote boards were already crackling with decisive portents of the Nixon landslide. I began working on a fifth of Jack Daniels. Over in the corner, a stockbroker was saying what a great thing the President's victory would be for the market. In a sullen stupor, I sank into a couch to watch one state after another sign on for Four More Years. Then I heard a new note creep into Walter Cronkite's monotone. “Well,” he said, “it looks as though Massachusetts may be the only state in the union to go for George McGovern.” Suddenly I felt much better. For, after New York, I am most at home in Massachusetts—where I went to college, returned on a fellowship and have spent countless vacations. Good old Massachusetts! Soon I was composing a drunken panegyric to the Bay State: to Emerson and Thoreau; golden Berkshire autumns; steamer clams dipped in melted butter on a Gloucester dock; a Mozart string quartet in Mrs. Jack Gardner's grandiose palazzo; muddy‐booted farmers arguing over a new fire engine at a Wilbraham town meeting; weathered salt‐box cottages on a Nantucket shore; the Mediterranean hubbub of Boston's North End; the soaring white spire of a Unitarian church steeple; the slash of Bobby Orr's skates across the Garden ice; a sloop in full sail making for Marblehead harbor; the call of French horns across a sun‐drenched Tanglewood lawn. The next morning I woke to a leaden hangover and a soaking downpour. The morning papers confirmed that only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia had resisted the Nixon landslide. But in the grim light of dawn, I could muster little of my nocturnal euphoria. Indeed, the Bay State's defection began to strike me as curious. After all, my most vivid memories of Massachusetts politics stem from the early fifties when Senator Joseph McCarthy was rooting out “Communists” at Harvard, and Massachusetts was a stronghold of pro‐McCarthy sentiment. When I went into Boston to cover the Senator's hearings as a young reporter for The Harvard Crimson, I often felt as if I were entering enemy territory. The crowds in the murky hearing room booed Harvard witnesses, and one day a pasty‐faced woman behind a Scollay Square lunch counter told me to “go back to Pinko U.” And when I came back to Boston in 1958 to write speeches for Gov. Foster Furcolo's re‐election campaign, I found the Democrats riven by feudalism, factionalism and corruption. Issues were largely subordinated to bitter vendettas and fierce loyalties. As late as 1962, Prof. Murray Levin of Boston University could write, “The Democratic party in Massachusetts is far less liberal than its national counterpart.” So, as I lay abed that morning after the election, I began to wonder just what had happened to Massachusetts? Had its politics really changed so much in the past decade? Why should it, of all places, rally to McGovern's quixotic campaign? I set off to find out. When I arrived here in late November, I found the Commonwealth still obsessed with its singularity. Boston's Mayor Kevin White had distributed 1,200 buttons reading, “Massachusetts—The Lone Star State.” Cars sported a line of new bumper stickers: “Don't Blame Me—I'm from Massachusetts,” “Massachusetts—We'd Rather Be Right,” “Massachusetts—The One and Only.” An epidemic of irreverent humor swept the Commonwealth. Arch Macdonald of Channel 5 was first to coin the slogan, “As Massachusetts goes, so goes the District of Columbia.” Others said the Bunker Hill Monument had been renamed “The Shaft.” Many of the new jokes focused on anticipated White House reaction. Some predicted that the President would remove the Department of Transportation complex in Cambridge and replace it with the National Institute of Mental Health. Others said the U.S.S. Constitution was being towed from Boston to Key Biscayne for safekeeping. A cartoon in The Boston Globe showed the President with shears in one hand and a new 49‐star flag in the other. And the Clover Club of Boston, in a satirical skit at its annual dinner, sang this ditty to the tune of “Bye, Bye, Blackbird”: “Bye, bye, Bay State, You gave Georgy boy your vote, Out to sea—you can float. Most states will get Federal donations, You'll instead be paying reparations.” But beneath all this levity, Bay Staters preened, even gloated in their loneliness. John Kenneth Galbraith, always one of the Commonwealth's most confident citizens, struck the keynote when he told the “Today” show: “Invariably the country has been out of step with Massachusetts. We have been four years ahead.” The theme was echoed in hundreds of letters to the press. “It gives me a great sense of pride and satisfaction to know I live in the only truly enlightened state, in the country,” wrote Christine O'Hearn of Malden. “The people of Massachusetts stand alone, again the pilgrims to a better world,” wrote Lydia A. Capano of Revere. Mrs. Jane Lambert of Boston wrote, “I am so proud of the voters of Massachusetts I could cry.” And, from around the nation, letters poured in from those, who admired Massachusetts' stand. “Everyone is talking about moving to Massachusetts, the real home of the free and the brave,” wrote a woman from Bohemia, N. Y. There was something touching in these letters—in their almost desperate quest for a beacon in the darkness. But that need, like my own on election night, cast the state in a role it simply could not fill. Massachusetts was not unique. The statistical quirk which left it as the only state to cast its electoral vote for McGovern did not mean it was immune to the political tides running in the rest of the country. At best, it was the end of a continuous spectrum, differentiated from other states only by degree. And, viewed another way, it was not even the end of the spectrum. Massachusetts Democrats have a huge edge in registration‐43 per cent, to 19 per cent Republican and 38 per cent Independent. In 1968, Hubert Humphrey polled 63 per cent in Massachusetts (the second largest Democratic margin, after Rhode Island). Yet, McGovern polled only 55 per cent this year. Michael Barone, a Massachusetts political scientist, notes that this dropoff of 8 percentage points was among the largest in the nation (only 10 states had falloffs as large or larger) Thus, Massachusetts was very vulnerable indeed to the Nixon landslide, just not quite vulnerable enough to erase its traditional Democratic majority. But this kind of analysis raises as many questions as it answers. For the only state which went more decisively for Humphrey in 1968—Rhode Island—suffered one of the heaviest defections from McGovern this year (18 points), enough to take it into the Nixon column. Moreover, Rhode Island is not only adjacent to Massachusetts—and thus subject to most of the same regional pulls and tugs — but it is similar in ethnic and religious configuration. Any interpretation of the Massachusetts vote must explain why, despite, these similarities. Rhode Island Democrats defected at nearly twice the rate of Massachusetts Democrats this year. One obvious answer, which I heard frequently from New Yorkers, was simply, “Teddy did it.” This theory attributes the Bay State's vote essentially to Senator Edward F. Kennedy's machine, money and influence. At first glance, it is a persuasive explanation—for certainly nobody benefited from the Massachusetts results more than Ted Kennedy. A postelection cartoon in The Philadelphia Inquirer depicted the Democratic party as an exhausted whale panting on the beach at Hyannis Port. But, significantly, I heard this theory chiefly from New Yorkers. When I mentioned it here, most people scoffed. “Ted Kennedy doesn't have a machine because he doesn't really need one,” one Boston politician told me. “By now the Kennedy name is enough to get him elected here despite a horror show like Chappaquiddick. He has an organization, of course, but it wasn't really enlisted in the McGovern campaign.” A prominent member of that organization is K. Dun Gifford, a former Kennedy aide now in the real estate business. Gifford concedes that Kennedy people weren't deeply involved in McGovern's Massachusetts effort “because frankly I don't think they wanted us.” Although McGovern clearly sought and got Ted Kennedy's help elsewhere—notably appearances with the candidates in Ohio, New Jersey and Illinois —his Massachusetts people aplparently didn't feel they needed Kennedy. At times, they positively didn't want him: for example, at the Post Office Square rally in Boston on Oct. 3, where McGovern organizers were eager to show that their candidate could draw a big crowd on his own (he drew 60,000). In fact, the Senator did very little stumping for McGovern in his home state. There were undoubtedly those who voted for McGovern simply because they knew Kennedy was for him. “People wouldn't go too far from the Kennedy line,” Frank Santa Maria, a 73‐year‐old Roslindale man, told a reporter after the election. McGovern's widely advertised preference for Kennedy as his running mate undoubtedly helped with some Massachusetts voters, and his eventual selection of Kennedy's brother‐in‐law, Sargent Shriver, couldn't have done him any harm in the state. But most people I talked to doubted that this sort of loyalty—what Dun Gifford calls the “do‐it‐for‐the‐Gipper” reflex votes. More important than Ted Kennedy's direct influence is the indirect effect from more than 20 years of three successive Kennedys. A living Kennedy helps to keep the “Kennedy mystique” alive, but the mystique persists in the state on its own. Student canvassers report finding pictures of Jack and Robert Kennedy in many white working‐class homes in Revere and Somerville, and the same two pictures alongside Martin Luther King's in the black homes of Roxbury and Dorchester in Boston. In the weeks just after the election, The Globe gave front‐page display to a serialization of Dave Powers's and Ken O'Donnell's new book of recollections of Jack Kennedy, “Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye.” The first segment began, “The memories will always keep coming back....” In Massachusetts, they probably will. But how much of the Kennedy mystique could rub off on George McGovern, who, despite his long identification with the Kennedys, shares so little of their special magnetism? David Bartley, the 37‐year old Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, puts it this way: “Three Kennedys have legitimized liberalism in Massachusetts. They've made it O.K. for a loyal son of Ireland, a devout member of the church, to also be a liberal. Elsewhere in this country, blue‐collar workers, Catholics, ethnics may still see liberalism as far out or alien. But here the voters have been conditioned by the Kennedys to accept it.” Others see the 1960 election itself as a direct factor in this year's vote. Richard Nixon is the only man ever to run against Camelot and there are those who will never forget it. Boston Mayor Kevin White told me: “If you were 10 when the Black Knight attacked the White Knight, when you're 22 you remember that and you don't vote for the Black Knight.” Bartley put it even more bluntly: “If Nixon were running against Satan in Massachusetts and ‘none of the above’ was the only other choice, ‘none of the above’ would win.” Nixon compounded his problems here by virtually ignoring the state during his first term. Except for a brief visit to his daughter Julie, while she was a student at Smith, he is not known to have entered the state. And he didn't make a single campaign appearance here last fall. Nor, for that matter, did Spiro Agnew. Massachusetts may be the only state where even Republican officeholders could summon little enthusiasm for Nixon. Gov. Francis Sargent didn't have much to say for him all fall. Nor did Senator Edward Brooke, who had an easy race this time against a ho‐hum Democrat. After the votes were counted on election night, Brooke said bluntly: “I will support the President when he is right and vote against him when he is wrong.” The other side of this coin is the striking loyalty of the state's Democratic politicians. Unlike other states where regular Democrats defected in droves, the only prominent Massachusetts politician to join “Democrats for Nixon” was John T. Collins, the former Mayor of Boston, who teaches urban affairs at M.I.T. As in other states, a breach was opened between the “regular” and “new‐politics” factions of the party during the campaign for the April 25 primary. Most of Massachusetts' prominent regulars—among them Kevin White and Attorney General Robert Quinn—quickly hopped on the Muskie bandwagon and headed his slate in the primery. They were outraged when McGovern decided to enter a slate against them and chagrined when he clobbered them 325,673 to 131,709 (an impressive triumph which got the McGovern operation here off to a stirring start). The McGovern slate, headed by some prominent reformers and filled out with a cast of unknowns (a Pittsfield plumber and a North Attleboro jeweler) was openly jubilant at upsetting the “pols” The resentments peaked after Ted Kennedy turned down the Vice‐Presidential offer, when McGovern seemed ready to choose Kevin White as his running mate. Galbraith apparently helped put the kibosh on White, warning McGovern that the selection would not be welcomed by either Ted Kennedy or the Massachusetts delegation. But right after the miniconvention which put Sargent Shriver on the ticket, Massachusetts Democrats held a “unity breakfast” at the venerable Parker House in Boston. Charlie Flaherty, the state chairman, says, “We had everybody who was anybody in the Democratic party here. From then on, we were a hell of a lot more successful than most states in getting the regulars and the McGovern people together.” Clearly, the regulars had read the lesson of McGovern's resounding primary victory. Michael Dukakis, a former state legislator who is con sidered a possible candidate for Governor in 1974, puts it this way: “All of us in this state—liberals, moderates or conservatives — are acutely aware of the importance of what we now call the McGovern constituency. It's particularly important because that's where the workers are. The people who get out there and ring doorbells for you are the kids with the McGovern buttons. They work like crazy. So nobody wants to antagonize them.” Clearly, “the kids with the McGovern buttons” exerted heavy leverage on Massachusetts politicians this year. But how important were they in other respects, as canvassers or as voters? Their role has been widely emphasized. One man wrote to Newsweek, “Lest you think we are all crazy here in Massachusetts, please remember that it was the outof‐state students and academicians who put McGovern over the top here” (suggesting that students, like the Freedom Riders of the sixties, are “outside agitators” who disrupt local patterns). True, there are lots of students here—a ballpark figure would be 300,000, of whom about a third are from out of state. There are 120 institutions of higher learning, heavily concentrated in the Boston metropolitan area (Harvard, M.I.T., Brandeis, Wellesley) but also dotted across the state in lush profusion (Williams, Holy Cross, University of Massachusetts, Bradford). But relatively few of these students voted in Massachusetts this fall—in part because the McGovern forces urged out‐of‐state students to register at home. Ann Lewis, who headed the McGovern registration drive in the state, recalls: “One of the first things I was told when I came on the job was that we were sure of carrying only three areas—Massachusetts, the District of Columbia and South Dakota. So, from the start, we were going to be exporting money, volunteers and votes.” This policy irritated some Massachusetts activists who were after every vote they could get for local candidates and referendum issues like abortion reform. But apparently the McGovern effort was successful. Dave Strohm, the state student coordinator, estimates that at most 30 per cent of out‐ofstate students registered in Massachusetts, of whom perhaps 75 per cent—or about 24,000—may have voted. Of the roughly 200,000 Massachusetts students, Ann Lewis estimates that about two–thirds registered and 75 per cent of those—about 95,000—voted. Surveys suggest that the vast majority voted for McGovern. But, even with the out‐of‐staters, this still makes barely 100,000 votes for McGovern, who carried the state by more than 220,000. The fabled “student vote” does not seem to provide the answer. Nor does student “activism.” Dave Strohm told me that only 2,000 to 3,000 students in the state were “active” this fall—that is, canvassed more than once—and most of them served as a “mobile strike force” in the rest of New England. “The level of apathy was incredible,” he said, “and greatest of all at the elite schools. Students at Harvard and Wellesley insisted on ideological purity. McGovern would make some concession they didn't like, or we worked with some local pol they found distasteful and they'd throw up their hands and refuse to play.” Thus the student buttonwearers probably didn't produce much direct result; but their numbers may have had an important psychological effect. “They created a presence for McGovern that simply didn't exist in most states,” says Mike Dukakis. “There may not have been all that many, but they seemed like an army. You looked around and you really felt McGovern was going to win.” Many Massachusetts students live home and commute to schools like Northeastern, Suffolk or Boston University. Shuttling back and forth between the liberal‐left student subculture and their workingclass homes, they may have persuaded many of their parents to vote for McGovern. There is more than just a huge student subculture in Massachusetts. There is a dense thicket of academia—formidable phalanxes of professors, lecturers, instructors, tutors and section men. Some —like the ubiquitous Galbraith, Abe Chayes and Marc Roberts of Harvard—were McGovern advisers this year. Others were simply outspoken supporters. They undoubtedly added their weight to McGovern's “presence” in the state. Academia has influenced the Massachusetts voter not only directly, but through the state's peace movement, perhaps the strongest, most effective such force anywhere in the United States. The membership of the state's peace groups has never been large: the most important, Massachusetts Political Action for Peace (known as “Mass Pax”), now has only 1,220. But the movement's impact goes far beyond its membership. It has mobilized huge crowds on the Boston Common, before the State House, at Army bases and Navy yards. Perhaps its most significant was the State Legislature's passage in 1970 of a bill forbidding Massachusetts residents to serve in Vietnam without a Congressional declaration of war. The courts rejected Massachusetts' argument, but it was a historic stand by a state against a war it regarded as unjust. At least two Massachusetts Congressmen owe their seats largely to the Movement: Michael Harrington in the Sixth District (the WASPY North Shore) and the Rev. Robert F. Drinan in the Fourth District (Newton, Brookline and other prosperous Boston suburbs). Both men won decisively this year. A third “peace candidate,” John Kerry, lost this time in the largely industrial Fifth District (but less because of his leadership in Vietnam Veterans Against the War than because of his slick, preppy style.) A segment of Massachusetts—the Yankee‐Brahmin tradition—has always tended to see issues in moral terms. Doris Kearns, an associate professor of government at Harvard, says: “From the witch trials and the abolitionists down through the peace movement, this state seems to respond when the battle lines are drawn between Good and Evil. And that was perfect for McGovern, because he is essentially a prairie preacher. He was best when thundering against the war and Watergate and Nixon himself as ‘evil.’” The “dean” of the Massachusetts peace movement is Jerome Grossman, an envelope‐company executive, who founded Mass Pax in 1962 and originated the Vietnam Moratorium Movement in October, 1969. Not surprisingly, Grossman believes that the peace movement's 10‐year crusade is the single most important factor in McGovern's victory. “In the fifties, this was a priest‐ridden, reactionary state, probably the most hawkish in the nation. Anti‐Communism was next to godliness, if not godliness itself. We helped change all that. We made peace the single most important issue here and we made the politicians take us seriously. Nobody's frigging around with us anymore.” Grossman points particularly to re cent infusions of young Catholics into the movement. “We always got Quakers, Jews and Unitarians,” he says, “but in the old days it was just impossible to talk to Catholics about social issues. Now, all of a sudden, get phone calls from Catholics saying, ‘We heard you speak and we want to get involved.’ Ten years ago that would have been unthinkable.” The changes in the Catholic Church over the past decade have presumably had some political impact. The ecumenical movement, Vatican II, Pope John's far‐reaching internal reforms, Father Groppi's fair‐housing marches, the Berrigans' activism and all the other dissenting priests have obviously worked remarkable changes in the American church. The Archdiocese of Boston has evolved, too: from haughty, rigid William Cardinal O'Connell to ebullient, compassionate Richard Cardinal Cushing, to Humberto Sousa Medeiros, a close friend of Cesar Chavez's. And the changes among Massachusetts Catholics are unmistakable. Father Drinan's stanch advocacy of liberal ‐ to ‐radical positions — and his widespread acceptance — is one sign. The students at Boston College, Jesuit institution where Father Drinan served as dean of the Law School, now look very much like those at Boston University a few miles awayblue‐jeans, long hair, no bras and, very often, politics to match. But just what impact this liberalization had on Catholic voting behavior this year is difficult to gauge. Nationally, of course, Nixon pressed his socalled “Catholic strategy” with apparent success: a Harris survey showed that 52 per cent of Catholics now say they voted for the President and only 48 per cent for McGovern, reversing a long ‐ time Democratic allegiance. Why then did Massachusetts Catholics vote so overwhelmingly for McGovern when their fellow communicants in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan did not? Perhaps the Catholic subculture in Massachusetts is simply so strong, self‐contained and irredeemably Democratic that it proved largely impervious to Nixon's vaunted “strategy.” The state is 52 per cent Catholic — more than twice the national percentage (23 per cent) and second only to Rhode Island (62 per cent). Although there are many Italian and French‐Canadian Catholics here, “Catholic” in Massachusetts still means primarily Irish‐Catholic. And the Irish are historically Democrats here. Many historians have told the story of how legions of impoverished, uneducated Irish flooded into Massachusetts following the great potato famine of 1845; how the entrenched Yankee Protestants systematically excluded them from the professions and all but the lowestpaying jobs in industry; how the Irish then turned to their favorite avocation—politics. Since the Yankees were overwhelmingly Republican, that meant Democratic politics. John McCormack, the former Speaker of the House, once said, “The people in my district are conceived Democrats.” Of late, the Italians—often Republicans precisely because the Irish are Democrats—have begun to encroach on the Irish oligarchy in Massachusetts politics. And there has been a maverick tendency to elect Republicans as Governor (Robert Bradford, Christian Herter, Francis Sargent) and Senator (Leverett Saltonstall, Henry Cabot Lodge)‐almost as if the Irish didn't trust their own men in those jobs. But, at lower levels, where “representation” is more important than efficiency or honesty, the Irish still have an extraordinary hold on Massachusetts politics. In Presidential politics, they have helped provide a solid majority for Democratic candidates in all but two elections since 1928—the ac tions being Eisenhower's victories over Stevenson in 1952 and 1956. William Schneider, assistant professor of government at Harvard, says: “Everything else being equal, the Irish‐Catholic voter in Massachusetts goes into the voting booth and pulls the Democratic lever.” MASSACHUSETTS STATE OF AWARENESS Yet it would be wrong to see the Irish as purely instinctive voters. In some respects, they are among the shrewdest voters anywhere. For politics is their game: they lave it more and are fooled by it less. And somehow this trait has pervaded the entire state. As Dun Gifford says: “Massachusetts is the most politicized state in the Union. People here are just more sophisticated about politics than anywhere else. They don't take political posturing very seriously—which means Nixon would have a particularly tough time here exploiting fake issues like amnesty and marijuana or fooling people on Watergate or the grain deal.” Some people I talked with linked Massachusetts' political sophistication to education, claiming that the state was simply the “best educated” in the nation. There is no evidence to support this claim (12.5 per cent of Massachusetts citizens over 25 have four or more years of higher education—slightly above the national average of 10.7, but not even among the top 15 states). It isn't formal education which seems to count, but a kind of “street sense” about politics. Al Lupo of WGBH attributes some of this to the high rate of community organization: “In recent years, dozens of communities here have mobilized for some cause, often against something like a renewal project or a highway. It spans a broad range, from the little old lady who says, ‘Could we have something to say about that?’ to the black man who says, ‘You're not coming onto my turf.’ But it sharply increased political awareness in the neighborhoods. They used to sit back and say, ‘Ah, politicians! They're all crooks.’ Now they say, Wait a minute, we can work with him.” In most of the country, McGovern seemed unable to exploit the recession, inflation and unemployment. But economic issues may have gained him some votes in Massachusetts because the recession hit this state harder than most and because people here seemed to put the blame for that directly on Nixon. The Massachusetts economy has been in trouble for a long time. Undermined by obsolescence, assaulted by imports from Japan, unable to compete with cheap Southern labor, the Commonwealth's traditional shoe factories and textile mills began closing up decades ago. This vacuum was gradually filled by another kind of industry—electronics and research‐and‐development companies which feed off the scientific expertise available at the state's universities. Such firms clustered along Route 128 — a belt highway around Boston—which by the early sixties had become one of the world's great centers of space and electronics research. Then, in 1969, recession came to Route 128. Almost simultaneously, the Defense Department and NASA sharply cut back spending on research and development. By 1971, Massachusetts employment in electrical‐equipment and supplies manufacture had dropped from its 1967 high of 103,000 to 80,800. Unemployment in the state this year averaged 8 per cent, nearly double the national average, with certain pockets running as high as 13 per cent. Many of the unemployed felt they were victims of a conscious Administration retaliation against Democratic Massachusetts. “The President has concluded we're a lost cause and he's going to use the contracts where they'll do some good,” one engineer told me. “You won't find many Engineers for Nixon' around here.” And economic issues may have counted for more because there were fewer diver sions. Sam Beer, professor of government at Harvard, says: “Massachusetts went for McGovern because it's a large industrial state with a small black population. Thus, the blue‐collar workers could vote their economic/class interests without being sidetracked by racial fears as they were in other industrial states. Nixon won the country largely by playing on subterranean fears of blacks, and he lost here because there just weren't enough blacks to scare the average voter.” Beer notes that not only is Massachusetts' black population very small (3 per cent), but it is essentially middle‐class, moderate and not given to violent demonstrations. There has been an intense controversy over school integration and busing in Boston—the issue which brought Congresswoman Louise Day Hicks to prominence. But, perhaps significantly, Mrs. Hicks lost this year. After two weeks here, concluded that no single factor explained the Massachusetts phenomenon. Many different factors seemed to play a role, each reinforcing the other. Ultimately, I came to feel that what counted as much as anything else was the exceptional “openness” of the state. Unlike the fifties, when it was Balkanized into warring and deeply suspicious enclaves, Massachusetts today is a place where people really talk—and listen to each other: the peace movement to the Catholic Church, the professors to the labor unions, the students to the wealthy suburbs. Much of the talking, of course, is not faceto‐face, but through the media. And here Massachusetts is fortunate to have a good, news‐oriented public television station (WGBH), two of the best “alternative” papers in the country (Boston After Dark/Phoenix and The Real Paper) and—most important of all—a fine daily newspaper (The Globe). Finally, Massachusetts is distinguished by a confident —almost cocky—air of irreverence. One day I walked into The Harvard Crimson to ask its managing editor, David Lubow, why he thought Massachusetts had voted for McGovern. “That isn't a question that's concerned us very much,” Lubow said. “We've been wondering why the other 49 states went for Nixon.” ■"
Congress Beginning the Difficult Task of Putting U.S. Criminal Code in Order,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/15/archives/congress-beginning-the-difficult-task-of-putting-u-s-criminal-code.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 —Congress has begun an attempt to rewrite the entire Federal Criminal Code, a project that encompasses a whole arsenal of explosive issues like abortion, capital punishment, gun control and obscenity. Sponsors of the 538‐page bill, said to be the longest in Congressional history, maintain that modernizing and harmonizing this important area of law for the first time is far more important than the objections of some members to the way the measure deals with some controversial problems. Critics, only beginning to, be heard since the bill was introduced 10 days ago, suspect that its backers may be trying to win Congressional approval for some unfortunate and repressive changes in the criminal law by enveloping them in a worthwhile over‐all project. Senator John L. McClellan, Democrat of Arkansas, the chief sponsor of the revision, did not discourage such speculation when he opened the campaign for approval of the new code on the Senate floor last week.. Long Road Ahead “In my judgment,” the Senator declared, “we are only just beginning to move out of one such period of extreme solicitude for the accused individual. Our criminal law and procedures today tip the scale too far away from the best interests and full protection of society.” Senator McClellan, chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on criminal law, said the problem was finding a middle course between “those who will resist any change that would make the administration of justice more effective” and “those who would adopt any change that might promise relief from the ills that beset our system of criminal justice,” even at the cost of infringing upon personal liberty. At the most optimistic estimate of its sponsors, the new code might win Senate approval, almost certainly in revised form, by the end of the year and, pass the House in 1974, in time for reconciliation of differences in conference and dispatching to the White House before, the new 93rd Congress adjourns. Sonie of the reasons why the McClellan bill is liable to have a king and stormy course through Congress are these: ¶It reinstates the death penalty for the. crimes of murder and treason, attempting to override the Supreme Court's ban on such punishment by establishing a two‐stage trial procedure in which the death sentence could be imposed only in the second stage. ¶It continues to classify possession of marijuana as a misdemeanor, carrying a possible jail sentence of up to six months, Some drug law reformers believe that possession should be reduced from a crime to an offense or violation, punishable by fine and not incarceration. ¶It retains the present limited Federal sanctions on firearms, declining to impose any limits on the sale and possession of handguns or to establish any registration systems for firearms in general. ¶It contains an entirely new definition of obscenity, setting a maximum jail sentence of three years or a sliding‐scale fine for those who traffic in or disseminate obscene material. What is “shameful or morbid” or excessively candid, and thus punishable under the new law, is to be judged by “standards generally accepted” in the judicial district in which the offense was committed. ¶It retains in recodified form present law with respect to public access to “national defense information,” according to Senator McClellan, “only to serve as a starting point for further discussion. The McClellan bill is based to a considerable extent on recommendations by the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, created by Congress in 1966 and headed by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California. It reported the results of its study to Congress and the President two years ago. But in a number of controversial issues, the Brown commission proposals have been replaced by others more acceptable to Senator McClellan and his subcommittee, on which law enforcement conservatives enjoy a clear majority. Commission Proposals Diluted  For example, the Brown commission called for the abolition of capital punishment, elimination of jail sentences for possession of marijuana, a ban on the sale of handguns except for military and police use and nationwide registration of all firearms. In the area of obscenity, the Brown commission left the problem of definition up to the courts. It also made dissemination of obscene material a misdemeanor unless it was “carried on in reckless disregard of risk of exposure to children under 18 or to persons who had, opportunity to avoid expsure,” in which case it would be a felony. On the floor last week, Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr., Democrat of North Carolina and a cosponsor of the McClellan bill, called it “a reasonable starting point for Congress” and a “thoughtful beginning.” But Mr. Ervin, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee's constitutional rights subcommittee, acknowledged that he had some “serious reservations.” Among the areas that Mr. Ervin said he would want to study closely were capital punishment, interception of communications, obscene mate rial, disclosure of confidential information and protection of national security. Justice Department lawyers have also been at work for two years on a comparable examination of the Federal Criminal Code, a move requested by President Nixon immediately after the Brown commission report had been received by the White House. The Justice Department recommendations are expected soon, and the McClellan subcommittee will then resutne public hearings, focusing on section‐by‐section comparison of its bill, the Nixon Administration alternative and the Brown commission recommendations. The Federal. Criminal Code has built, up, bit by bit, over nearly 200 years as Congress felt called upon to impose national criminal sanctions. It has never before been codified and harinonized into a single coherent document with uniform classification of offenses and punishment. The McClellan bill contains several innovations produced by study in criminal law in other countries. One involves a new fine system, patterned after those used in Scandinavian countries, based roughly on the convicted person's earning power per day and the number of days he could have been sent to prison. A major attempt has also been made to eliminate legalistic language that could confuse jurors and even lawyers. Robbery, for example, is no longer classed as first or second degree but as armed robbery and robbery. Loan sharking and skyjacking are called by their common names instead of a longer legal euphemism."
VOTE ON ABORTION SOUGHT IN JERSEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/15/archives/vote-on-abortionsought-in-jersey-pressure-by-citizens-who-favor.html,"TRENTON, Jan. 14—Support appears to be growing for enactment by the New Jersey Legislature of a bill that would permit abortions only to save a mother's life. Pressure by public groups could force a vote on the bill in this sensitive legislative election year. The Assembly Speaker, Thomas H. Kean, Republican of Essex, said he had received 1,000 letters in recent weeks urging action on a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Brian T. Kennedy, Republican of Monmouth. He, said similar pressure reported by other lawmakers could spring the bill from the Assembly Judiciary Committee, where it had been expected to languish until the end of the session. Few lawmakers are eager to see anything so emotionally charged as a fight over abortion in a year when all must stand for re‐election, but this is precisely the time when they also must be sensitive to important public issues. “Election‐year pressure can work both ways,” Mr. Kean noted. “Not many legislators want to vote on abortion, but they may have to.” The Speaker added there was not much public support for three other bills that were more liberal than the Kennedy bill, which was inspired by Catholic and Protestant Right to Life groups. The Kennedy measure would permit abortion only when two physicians certified it was necessary to save the life of the mother. Anyone who performed an abortion under any other circumstance would be liable to a 15‐year prison sentence and a $5,000 fine. The Kennedy bill has 14 cosponsors, both Democrats and Republicans. Whether they pass this bill or a more liberal one and whether they delay action another year, most legislators agree that some law on abortion is needed to replace the old New Jersey statute, which was struck down last, year by the United States Supreme Court as unconstitutienally “vague” and an invasion of a woman's right to privacy. The move for a conservative bill parallels the drive by antiabortion forces in New York, who say they have enough votes in the Legislature to repeal New York's liberal abortion statute and to override an expected veto by Governor Rockefeller. Legislators are not the only ones up for re‐election in New Jersey this year. Governor Cahill is expected to announce his intention, to run for another term. He showed an apparent desire to avoid controversial isues in his annual message to the Legislature last Tuesday. It was considered a low‐key message. But the Governor, a Roman. Catholic, probably would have little trouble signing the Kennedy bill if it passed both houses and reached his desk. Mr. Kean also said that an other bill that had been labeled controversial Sand apparently had been due for shelving at this session was showing new signs of life. A rent‐leveling bill supported by a statewide tenants' organization has attracted. three additional legislative sponsors. Mr. Kean is the chief sponsor of the measure. The bill would freeze rent at Jan. 1 levels and allow limited increases thereafter to reflect increased costs to the landlord for capital improvemeats and utilities."

"In Italy, Abortions Are Easy‐for Rich",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/16/archives/in-italy-abortions-are-easyfor-rich-only-nine-months.html,"ROME—“It is easier for a girl to have an abortion in Italy than in any other Western country where abortion is outlawed,” commented an American who had helped find doctors for two fairly well‐off foreign women. But when Silvana, a 25‐year‐old Roman who lives with her family, became pregnant several months ago, things were not quite so simple. “In the first place,” said Silvana, one of an estimated 800,000 to 3 million Italian women who have illegal abortions every year, “I didn't know where to get information. I certainly couldn't confide in my family doctor and my gynecologist said all he could do was to give me the name of an abortionist he'd heard of. “Of course,” she added ruefully, “he assured me could come to him for postoperation check‐up since the abortionist would probably never want to set eyes on me again.” Money was another problem. “I earn only about $30 a week,” she noted; “and the doctor wanted $250. But had no choice, so now I am paying him off in installments.” 20,000 Fatalities a Year Abortions by bona fide doctors range from about $175 to $500 or more for wealthy women whose willing physicians work in private clinics. Low ‐ income women, on the other hand, are out of luck. Either they must bear the unwanted child, thus becoming “girlmothers” in a society intolerant of unwed mothers and their offspring, or they are forced to resort to local midwives or “witches” whose remedies are risky and often fatal. Precise statistics are hard to come by, but figures indicate that at least 20,000 women die here each year from abortion malpractices that run the gamut from the use of herbs to primitive, very unsophisticated instruments. The Italian Ministry of Health estimates that clandestine abortions in Italy may be about 800,000 annually; women's groups who are seeking to legalize abortions insist there are as many as 3 million illegal operations a year. (One recent study, based on interviews with 558 31‐year‐old married women in Rome's low‐income neighborhoods, showed an incidence of two abortions for every two to three surviving children.) Legislation last amended by the Fascists in 1930 makes abortion a crime. With both the practitioner and his client subject to jail terms of a maximum of five years and a minimum of two (reduced to one where “honor” was the motive), the topic is rarely discussed. However, the present situation appears to be tolerated by knowing authorities who, in recent years, have prosecuted only 150 to 200 people annually. ‘Only Nine Months’ For the Roman Catholic Church, whose influence cannot be discounted even in the face of increasingly lenient social standards, abortion is tantamount to murder. Many liberated women bristle at the attitude of the men, whom they complain “oppose abortion at any cost —to the woman, that is.” One Italian, Paolo, a law school graduate who now runs his family's construction firm, said, “I don't think I'd help a girl abort. Anyway, what's the big deal? It's only nine months.” At present several Italian groups are actively campaigning for legalized abortion, with the women's liberation; movement seeking to collect the 50,000 signatures needed to present a bill by “popular initiative” in the Italian Parliament. One source of help is the Italian Association for Democratic Education, whose founder, Luigi de Marchi, provoked a lawsuit that last year led to repeal of the ban on disseminating birth‐control information. Mr. de Marchi favors legalized abortion, but he said he does not consider it useful “at this time to try and provoke a constitutional issue as we did for birth control. After all, at present a proabortion majority exists neither in the country at large nor in the Parliament.” Thus observers here agree that any proposal to legalize abortion would face difficulty in the foreseeable future. None of the lay parties of either the Government coalition or the Opposition are willing to take a firm position."

Women Smokers Warned Of Fetal and Infant Risks,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/18/archives/women-smokers-warned-of-fetal-and-infant-risks-women-smokers-are.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 —There is strong evidence that pregnant women who smoke cigarettes are thereby increasing the risk of death of their babies, a Public Health Service report said today. The report contains the strongest statement on the risks of smoking in pregnancy ever made by the Public Health Service. “Twelve retrospective and prospective studies have revealed a statistically significant relationship between cigarette smoking and an elevated mortality risk among the infants of smokers,” said the report from the Public Health Service. The document also raised doubts concerning the safety of the little cigars that have become increasingly popular and that can still be advertised on television. Many people can inhale these much as they do cigarettes, the Public Health Service reported, and those who do will probably face increased risks of the lung and heart problems that have been linked to cigarette smoking. Smokers of pipes and large cigars were told they face some health risks, too, but the report made its strongest attack against cigarettes and was particularly strong concerning the risks in pregnancy. It said several lines of evidence were accumulating to show “a strong, probably causal association between cigarette smoking and higher late fetal and infant mortality among smokers' infants “ Basically that means stillbirths and deaths during the first few days of life. The report said that about 4,600 stillbirths a year in the United States can probably be accounted for by the smoking habits of the women involved. The pediatrician who wrote that section of the report noted today that the number was roughly equal to two‐thirds of all the deaths from accidents in Americans aged one to 14. Accidents are the leading cause of death in that age group. The document is the Public Health Service's seventh annual report to Congress on the health consequences of smoking. These used to be called the Surgeon General's reports, but the 1973 edition was submitted by Dr. Merlin K. Duval, Assistant Secretary for Health in the, Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Among the several hundred references cited in the Public Health Service document was a 1972 British report showing that smoking mothers had a stillbirth rate 30 per cent higher than nonsmokers and an infant death rate for the first few days after birth 26 per cent higher than mothers who did not use cigarettes. 4th Month Vital The report to Congress also said new data suggest that the woman who gives up smoking by the fourth month of her pregnancy eliminates the heightened risk for her unborn baby. It has been known for more than a decade that women who smoke cigarettes bear children with a lower averäge birthweight than babies of nonsmokers. The Pablic Health Service document said every investigator who had examined this relationship had confirmed it. Some studies have also found a higher mortality rate among infants of smoking mothers, while others have not. Thus there has been controversy and confusion over the significance of the findings. The new report puts forth what it feels is a probable explanation of much of the past discrepancies. For example, the report said the small babies of smoking women appeared to be small for their age, but not mature in calendar and velopmental sense. Prematurity —meaning birth before full development—involves a strong risk. Therefore, the report gues, a premature baby of a nonsmoking mother may times be at greater risk than a small, but mature baby of smoking mother, but this does? not invalidate the case against smoking. Furthermore, in the United States, the statistics show that black women, women of lower socio‐economic status and women who have a previous history of unsuccessful pregnancy all have greater than average risks of stillbirth or early infant deaths. Although cigarette smoking exerts an independent influence of its, own, this can be hidden or influenced by the other factors, the report said. Thus these other factors must be taken into account in seeking clear evidence for the effect of cigarette smoking by itself. The report said that three major studies have now done this and show a “highly significant independent association between smoking and mortality.” On the questions of spontaneous abortion and birth defects, the report said there was not enough evidence to allow any firm conclusions. The document also cited animal studies showing that exposure to the chemicals in cigarette smoke can retard fetal growth or cause stillbirths. Doubts on Small Cigars A statement from the Tobacco Institute, spokesman for industry, congratulated the report mildly for its candor in discussing the conflicting evidence on infant mortality, but said the document was misleading the public in other, important respects. The document of 381 pages in typewritten form also raised doubts about the safety of small cigars as substitutes for cigarettes. They are about the same size and shape as ciga rettes although rolled in tobacco rather than paper. The report said men and. women who smoke these little cigars in the same way that, they smoke cigarettes will probably face some of the health risks cigarette smokers incur. These are said to include can cer and heart disease. The report said the accuinulating evidence indicts cigarette smoking more strongly than ever with respect to these, diseases. There was also a special section this year reporting ithat cigarette smoking hampers performance in exercise. Eventually the report will be published and sold through the Superintendent of Documents of a the United States Government Printing. Office in Washington. Last year's edition was priced at 70 cents."
Handbook Tells How to ‘Call for Action’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/20/archives/handbook-tells-how-to-call-for-action-in-48-cities-hours-fees-and.html,"A handbook with 276 pages of New York City telephone numbers—ranging from emergency services to bus information — will be appearing in bookstores here beginning late next week. The $1.95 paperback, entitled “Call for Action” and subtitled “A Survival Kit for New Yorkers,” is a compendium of information in more than 600 categories that has been documented for the last 10 years by volunteers in radio station WMCA's ombudsman program, “Call for Action.” In 48 Cities During this period, more than 410,000 people have telephoned in their requests, which have ranged from simple questions about where to get new license plates to desperate pleas for help in getting redress from city agencies, landlords or employers. In the course of answering questions and following up the cases to see whether help was actually supplied by the proper agencies, the Call for Action volunteers here (there are now 75 of them) have amassed formidable amount of expertise in winding one's way through the red tape of city government. There are now Call for Action programs in 48 cities throughout the country. All of them work in connection with local radio stations, which supply space and telephones for the volunteers, advertise the telephone numbers and often broadcast specific cases where city agencies are refusing to cooperate. According to Ellen Straus, who first started the Call for Action program at WMCA, the volunteers had long considered compiling their information for publication but had been worried that the book would soon become outdated because of the frequency with which organizations come and go and telephone numbers change. If this book is a success, however, they hope to use the proceeds to update it and publish a new one every year. There are 2,142 references in the book, which is published by Quadrangle. These include information on all‐night services: telephone numbers for physicians in all five boroughs, the Mayor's night line, 24‐hour drugstores, where to get help in gas and water emergencies and how to report crank telephone calls in the middle of the night. They tell the reader what to do in case he is bitten by a rat, where to apply for a loan, where to get a cancer test, where to get pregnancy tests, birth‐control devices or abortions and how to find out more information about the effects of German measles. Hours, Fees and Services The reader can also call Dial a Prayer, call Sky Information to find out the current position of Venus or call Pigeon Control. In most cases, the book states the hours that a given agency is open, whether a fee is required and, in some cases, a brief description of just what services the agency provides. “A cheap, simple thing like this book could make life more dignified for a number of people,” said Mrs. Straus, whose husband, R. Peter Straus, owns WMCA. She added that a call to the proper agency was not an automatic guarantee that the problem would be solved. If all else fails, there is a number listed for “Complaints about New York City Agencies.” It states that anonymous complaints are accepted."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/20/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-case-for-the-nonlawyer-justice-to.html,"To the Editor: To demonstrate that he himself possesses the objectivity which he claims to be the sole province of lawyers, Eugene H. Nickerson (letter Dec. 26) should first lay down what he considers to be the function of courts—and especially so of the Supreme Court—before he renders his decision as to whether nonlawyers can or cannot, and consequently should or should not, be admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court. Agreed that neutrality, nonpartisanship, the ability to suspend judgment until, each party has had its say, the unquestioned reign of reason over whim, the current fancy, political expediency or the sentiments of the majority and the recognition and application of universal principles should be the hallmarks of those who sit in judgment. But since when are these qualities characteristic exclusively (if at all) of lawyers? They simply bespeak a deliberately developed rationality—the practice of discovering and cultivating our native intelligence in every aspect of living, social, political, economic, as well as personal and emotional. Thus, while it is true that a lawyer's training is important in developing this type of behavior, the same can be said of the physicist's training, the economist's training, the philosopher's training, and indeed the training of any professional—all of whom pursue programs of study in applying the principles of right reason. What the study of law does provide is the key for deciphering and making intelligible the legal verbiage in which so many laws and legal precedents are couched. However, once the “wherewithal . . . inasmuch as . . . therefore . . . to wit . .” entanglements of our language structures, preserving the baroque at its best, are removed, the underlying universal principles of justice are recognizable, arguable, defendable and perpetuable by any practitioner of reason. Furthermore, couldn't it also be argued that by the inclusion of nonlegalistic minds in decisions of such import, the myopic vision offered by the unitrend of the legal profession can better be overcome, thereby reestablishing justice once again to its Olympian status as the all‐encompassing highest human virtue as it was conceived by one of the ancients—whose wisdom I am sure would grace any session of the U.S. Supreme Court — namely, the Greek philosopher Socrates. HEATHER G. KRESS Yaphank, L. I., Jan. 3, 1973 To Conserve Water To the Editor: After a year of record‐breaking rainfall, warning of water supply problems in the City of New York makes me feel like a Cassandra. But a drought is sure to come, and the city is no more equipped to cope with one now than it was in 1949‐50 or in the midsixties. If several basic steps are not taken, our supply of clean water will become even more precious. During each drought of the past two decades, a number of prosposals such as metering have come close to acceptance only to have enthusiasm for their adoption washed away by drought‐ending rains. The key to the city's problem is that water is virtually free: the consumer pays a flat rate for all the water his pipes can bring in. There is no incentive to save water or fix a leak other than altruism. New York consequently has a higher per capita water consumption rate than other American metropolitan areas. Universal metering and a realistic price policy would dramatically reduce the city's water consumption and obviate the fear of drought and the need for new, land‐grabbing reservoirs. A program of voluntary conservation in the mid‐sixties resulted in a temporary 25 per eent reduction in use. Now—not during the middle of another drought—is the time to raise this issue. GIL KEMP New York, Jan. 8, 1973 Heart Research in N.Y.C. To the Editor: Lawrence K. Altman's recent excellent article on the first diagnosis by Dr. Herrick in Chicago of coronary occlusion (“heart attack”) in a living patient in 1912 prompts us to report that Dr, Herrick's findings were not entirely ignored in New York City. In that year we established the first “evening cardiac clinic for workingmen.” In 1915 our association was formed—the first organization of physicians anywhere in the world to combat heart disease. Nor has New York cardiology been idle since. The only cardiovascular research in this country to be awarded the Nobel Prize was done here by Drs. Dickinson W. Richards and Andre Cournand, brilliant developers of cardiac catheterization. The New York Heart Association is advising every hospital in the city of the erratic behavior of digoxin and how to use it safely. One of the most widely used drugs in the country, about ten million doses of digoxin are prescribed annually in New York City. Mr. Altman's article also explained why we have become involved in sickle cell anemia, discovered by Dr. Herrick, a cardiologist. Research in this disease, which often resembles vascular disease, may not only relieve its sufferers, but illuminate disorders of the heart and circulation as well. We also prepared an authoritative guide to recognizing and treating this disease and have sent it to every practicing physician in the city. Vastly more could be said, but this is by way of thanking you for excellent reporting of cardiovascular history and reminding you that New York City has always been a leader in scientific progress in this field. STANLEY E. BRADLEY, M.D. CHARLES 1. CAM'PBELL New York, Dec. 23, 1972 The writers are, respectively, president and executive director of the New York Heart Association, Inc., and Heart Fund. Abortion: Two Views To the Editor: Rose E. Frisch's letter [Jan. 2] unfairly implies that people who are prolife have no real solicitude for others. If she were more familiar with some of us she would know that this is not so. Neither is it so of the legislators she also stigmatizes. The sad fact that millions and millions of dollars are being expended in an attempt to take care of the needs of which she speaks. The tragedy is that a child on welfare is very much more expensive to bring up than a child who is not. The problem is not lack of money nor is it one of planning. Indeed, we have perhaps had too much of the latter in recent years. The “good society” which she seeks will never result from the counsel of despair which comes from the abortionists, nor will their “final solution” to the poverty problem produce it any more than did Hitler's “final solution” produce the millennium which he promised to the Germans. HAROLD A. MERIAM Jr. Wantagh, L. I., Jan. 3, 1973 To the Editor: Your Jan. 10 issue reported the protest of Planned Parenthood of New York City over the President's choosing “the Catholic hierarchy to lead the opposition to the [abortion] law” and the Archdiocese's response that “Catholic opposition to abortion is a matter of Christian principle that antedates any American President's Administradon. . .” What “Christian principle”? The history of Christianity will eventually record the position of the Catholic Church on population control and abortion as one of the major tragedies of the twentieth century. In the mean, time, those who hunger for justice can be gratified that the Archdiocese does not speak for a majority of Christians, or even for all Catholics. ROBERT M. PENNOYER Member, Board of Directors Union Theological Seminary New York, Jan. 10, 1973 Grappling With Urban Problems To the Editor: In reply to your Jan. 8 editorial “Recycling the City”: While indeed it is true that our cities “need to be preserved and developed,” perhaps the main attention for achieving more efficient and wholesome communities lies not solely on central governments, as Sir Desmond Plummer would have us believe, but on individuals. That the future of our cities lies in jeopardy, no one would deny. Decay and fear are fast replacing the intellectual stimulation once found in urban centers. The migration of industry to the suburbs—which, according to the report of Professor Ginzberg, is merely a short‐term solution—still is an important factor to contemplate if our cities are to be considered national assets. Throwing thb urban problem into the laps of the central governments will not help to eradicate the many problems. Instead, solutions will become hogged down in red tape and countless bureaucratic procedures is about time that the resident of the city take it upon himself to do something. A well‐worded letter sent to a Congressman might be read and thrown aside, but pressure, in the form of citizen interest in urban affairs and the life of his city, might serve to instigate some positive steps toward reform. JOAN PASKO Montclair, N. J., Jan. 9, 1973 Service From Rockaways To the Editor: With the Catch 22 logic peculiar to inept bureaucracy, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has promulgated a new schedule that supposedly improves service for Rockaway Park's double‐fared commuters. The number of “E” trains departing from that terminus will be increased during the rush hours, but instead of running on express tracks through Brooklyn as is now the case, the “E” will run as a local in Brooklyn. Evidently the architects of these “improvements” never thought worthwhile to consult the community affected by these changes, because even to the most obtuse of bureaucrats it should have been apparent that the vast majority of Rockaway Park commuters work in Manhattan, not Brooklyn. Therefore, the elimination of the Rockaway Park “E” express to Manhattan represents an effective cut in service. MICHAEL LIGHT Rockaway Park, N. Y., Dec. 28, 1972 To the Editor: Recent articles on the exclusion of women from Rhodes Scholarships have failed to mention the Rhodes Fellowships for Women, established by the Rhodes Trust and Oxford's women's colleges several years ago to support study, research or teaching by outstanding Commonwealth and U.S. women in Oxford. Fellowships are “separate” from but each is much more than “equal” to scholarships. A Fellow's advantages include a living stipend almost twice as large, paid accommodation, faculty status, dining privileges, and a chance to teach Oxford students. Flexibility in eligibility and selection also marks an important advance over previous major Anglo‐American scholarships. One may apply at virtually any stage in one's postgraduate career before age thirty. There is equal opportunity for married and unmarried applicants and those from any region in the United States and from higher educational institutions in the U.S. or abroad. Since screening is by Oxford women's colleges upon direct application, the final screening by state, regional and national committees to maintain strict regional apportionment and the initial U.S. col lege committees (with traditional biases and sometimes misconceptions about Oxford education) are avoided. The selection panel, taking much more than a token interest in women finalists, pays their way to a personal interview; this gives needed reality to the selecting process and the candidates’ conception of Oxford. The main disadvantage is that the number of fellowships is small; it is intended to rise to a maximum of ten divided among Commonwealth and U.S. competitors, far below the number of scholarships for American men alone. But the fellowships’ potential impact, similar to the scholarships', in providing post‐B.A. grants needs to be realized. The fellowships have been awarded in most cases to women who had not yet received a doctorate; but they have not been declared open to students just completing a B.A., those least able to finance but most eager and available (if not always prepared) for Oxford study. The fellowships might fulfill their needs in greater measure if such students were allowed to compete for stipends and statuses which would vary between those of Scholar and those of a Fellow depending on a candidate's qualifications. Up to twice as many awards as currently intended could then be given to women. I suggest that women with little postgraduate work but serious interest in applying for Rhodes Fellowships write directly to the principals of the Oxford women's colleges about their own eligibility and the possibility of reorienting the program in part. JOAN LEOPOLD Oxford, England, Dec. 31, 1972 The writer is the first American Woman Rhodes Fellow (1972‐74). A Correction Thomas L. Brewer, whose letter appeared Jan. 17, should have been identified as Visiting Assistant Professor of International Affairs, George Washington University Naval War College Center."
‘So Now I Know From Pastrami’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/so-now-i-know-from-pastrami-.html,"I WAS leaning against a fire hydrant in the East Bronx the other day, wolfing a pastrami on rye and a first‐rate pickle, and I got to thinking about my old magazine life, when I didn't know, as they say, from pastrami and pickles. They don't have pastrami at La Côte Basque, and if they did, it wouldn't cost a dollar and, besides, you would have to eat it nicely. Among the many other changes in my life since I began training as an NBC news hen, is the size of my bites. They're larger now, and I don't always have a napkin. It isn't that I used to lunch at La Cote Basque every day, but lunch used to be, most definitely, an indoor sit‐down affair — one which began in the middle of a day which, in turn, began at 11, or 10:30 if there was a lot to do. Lunch was also something that happened, as indeed, everything else happened, between 50th and 57th Street. (In Manhattan? Of course in Manhattan. Who knew then from Queens?) Oh, one was sent out of town on assignment now and then—to Beverly Hills, for example, where one would stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where the flowers and fruit would arrive simultaneously, and where one would spend at least the first half‐day at the pool, adjusting to the time change, after which one would slide into the maroon Mercedes of Steve McQueen's press agent, who would whip one away to interview Steve McQueen at his pool. And oh, there were hard times. I once did a story on the Women's Army of Israel, and it was hot there; and in '68, I did the wives of the Presidential nominees, and the short campaign flights made me air‐sick. And, occasionally, there would be what I then considered a pressing deadline. Like the time I had to cover John Lindsay and write about it all in the same day. The strain was awful. * After Look died, I simply could not face Good Housekeeping, and joining Life (lucky I didn't) would have been like taking up with your dead husband's worst enemy before the body was cold. So when NBC's “First Tuesday”—a very good “newsmagazine” sort of TV program—offered to take me in, I jumped. Well, even in that luxurious one‐show‐a‐month world there were certain hardships—no secretary I could really call my own, no room to hang my asparagus plant; and there was this new thing — film — to cope with. No more jotting down bright little insights in a little leather notebook, no more catching quotes inadvertently dropped in one's precious journalistic butterfly net. With film, I soon learned, nothing counts unless the camera's rolling. Now, suddenly, even an interview no longer meant me and him (or her), but me, him or her, three men, 225 pounds of equipment, and 10 cents (a foot of film) every time anybody opened his mouth. Then, too, there was this problem of complexity. You solve that problem, I found out, by eliminating it. “One idea at a time, one simple idea,” producer Dave Schmerler used to warn me. “Television. is not a magazine. If they don't get it, they, can't turn back the page.” Then I started reviewing plays for NBC. No film problems there, but rushing back from a play, writing a review, getting made up in an hour, and going on live is nobody's idea of tranquility. (Even if you never have the hiccups, you can't imagine what it's like to know you can't have the hiccups.) Still, as I look back, play‐reviewing was, in the main, a civilized affair. * The big change didn't really occur until this year, when I was asked to be a correspondent. After I accepted the invitation (I learned long ago never to say no. You can always do that later), it became apparent that I not only did not know how to be a correspondent, I wasn't sure what one was. Did it, for example, mean going far away to cover war, pestilence and famine? Who knew? So, sensibly, I wound up in‐training at local news, where they don't have war, pestilence and famine, but instead, fires in Queens, demonstrations in Brooklyn, and until recently, Burt Roberts. The entire local operation, about which I still have mixed feelings of awe, excitement, and terror, revolves around what is called the assignment desk. That is, literally, a desk and into it are fed all possible story ideas and out of it come individual assignments to reporters. The first thing you notice about the person who sits at this desk, and his assistants, is that they are always there. As far as I know, they don't eat or go to the bathroom and although theoretically they arrive, I hear, at 8 A.M., I suspect they do not arrive at all because it is my hunch they never leave. It figures. How could anyone be anywhere at 8 in the morning unless they lived there? The reporters, on the other hand, have staggered arrivals of 7, 8, and 9 A.M. (Those assigned to cover the recent Carnarsie fracas appeared, I hear, at 5:30 A.M. every morning for a week); but I happen to know some of them have apartments, even families. Although, as one story goes, one of the reporter's wives, not having seen her husband for six years, remarried. Everything was fine until one day the reporter got the flu and wanted to stay home and I hear it was quite embarrassing for everyone. Okay, that's a little joke and anyway, you're probably thinking, if they come in that early they must go home early. Wrong again. Drop into the newsroom any day between 6 and 7 P.M. and you will see a lot of very gray‐looking reporters hanging over the backs of chairs, their eyelids at half‐mast, watching the show. So what, you say? Other people work long hours, what about newspaper reporters? Sure they do, but thete's one big difference. They don't go on film along with the story. Tom Wicker doesn't have to look nice while he's killing himself. Even Charlotte Curtis, if she gets hit over the head at an anti‐abortion demonstration, doesn't have to worry about whether or not one of her false eyelashes is askew. Morning arrivals in the newsroom are almost always followed by rapid departures. Before one's coffee from the wagon is cool enough to drink, one shoves one's arm back inside one's (still warm) sleeve and, as per the desk's instructions, heads for the fire or the rape or the (yawn) press conference or the art show. Often one is briefed with no more than an address and an explanatory sentence or two: “A man got mugged at 3 West 96th Street. Second time in a week. Name is Frederick Schultz. He oughtta be home by now—he says he'll talk.” One is also informed as to one's crew for the occasion. * Crews come in threes—cameraman, soundman, electrician—and there are a few things to keep in mind about them. The most important of these is, simply, that without them you can do nothing. Nothing. As I said earlier, all of one's Jittle perceptions and profound understandings of the story at hand are magnificently useless unless the camera's rolling, the sound is recording, and the lights are on. The point is, you don't get the story. The crew gets the story, or no story. Point two to remember about crews is altogether as important as point one because it has to do with something about which they care profoundly and have an extraordinary expertise: lunch. There is, to start with, one fundamental fact with respect to the crews and lunch: they have it. Thanks to a union which takes a no‐nonsense, hard‐line, Jewish‐mother position on the matter, crews—after working a maximum of five hours—must Eat. Whatever the reason—perhaps Protestants have a steong hold on the performers' union—there is no similar dictum for reporters. “You can't imagine what it's like to know you can't have the hiccups” On occasion, however, a reporter does get to lunch with a crew. And that, believe me, is some treat. With all due respect to Gael and Craig and Raymond et al, crews know more about where to eat in New York than any other living mammals. I have been at the tip of Brooklyn, in the bowels of Staten Island—there is no village or township so obscure that a member of a crew cannot lead one to a dazzling feed there. Of course, any area in which there is so much expertise will lead to conflicts. One day I was tagging along on a story in upper Manhattan and the cameraman wanted to go to a Hungarian restaurant near Yorkville, while the soundman had an absolute fix on a certain delicatessen. The soundman won and the cameraman sulked the rest of the day. I guess what I like best about crews is that they are a) good company and b) straightshooters. Unlike many of the folks from my old life, crews do not, as they say, put on airs. They are what they are—Archie Bunker on the outside, pussycat on the inside—and that's nice. In the morning, all four of you pile into the company car with the gear stashed away in the trunk and head for The Story., You don't always get there. For example, during the two weeks that, as part of my training, I followed reporter Bob Teague, he often was either called back or re‐directed to a different story en route. Sometimes the fire you're chasing goes out, or the Chinese doctors who are supposed to be touring Monteflore Hospital are behind schedule and are in Harlem instead. The way you get re‐directed is, the assignment desk beeps you. As soon as you're beeped, you call in on the car's walkie‐talkie and say things like “Roger” and “Over.” Speaking of which, one problem any newcomer is likely to have is vocabulary. There is, for example, a whole new universe of nouns. “Talking head,” is not decapitation per se, but a chopped‐off head (closeup) of someone talking, which, it turns out,, is something of a no‐no because it is considered visually dull. Also in that category is a “thumbsucker”—not a baby with an oral problem, but a story that is not much of a story. “Sound bite” is simply a sound statement—a person talking on film, as opposed to silent. A “wrap” is not a small fur, but what you say when the story is over. And “stand‐uppers” are those numbers the reporters do on‐camera, usually at the begginning and/or end of a piece. * A word about “stand‐uppers”: They are usually written (and memorized immediately) on a car fender. What is murderous about standuppers is not only that you have to think of something pithy to say on the spot (and look smart as you're saying it), you also have to plan ahead, on the spot, what else you'll be saying in the narration over film, plus figure out what the anchorman's introduction might be, what the lead‐in and lead‐out will be, and make sure, in other words, that what you say fits into the whole bloody piece which, on the car fender, you are also creating on the spot in your head. Moreover, if it's January, which it usually is, while you are tending to all of the above, you are also trying to keep your hands and feet front going numb. Plus you have to cope with the queries of passers‐by and onlookers—queries like, “Hey, can I get on TV?” or “hey, where's geraldo Riviera?” (sic). Although no one saunters into the newsroom after a story has been shot, each reporter has a slightly different style of entrance. If, for example, you are in the newsroom when Bob Teague enters, you will see a gleaming black rocket in aqua suede, a veritable blur, pulling off his jacket as he moves in the direction of an office in which he will, in 20 minutes, write the narration for the film he has just shot. After typing the narration, one then shoots upstairs to record it, and then, finally, into film editing, which is a kind of emergency room. Filming editing is my favorite place. For one thing, it's indoors; for another, I have a thing for film editors. Even though, individually and ethnically, they are by no means alike, I think of them generally as Italians with high metabolisms. The latter, because it is always freezing in the editing room and they are always in shirt sleeves, and the former because many of them are Italian and even those who are not are small and muscled and give terrific squeezes and hugs, all of which means Italian to me. My previous life was not without its moments of affection, but most often it was that two‐cheeks‐together‐and‐kiss‐the‐air kind. Not bad, but nothing that would take the chill of an outdoor demonstration out of one's bones. Besides providing displays of massive sexuality, film editors also edit the film. In other words, they take the mess you've come back from Queens with, and turn it into something. They do this in small, dark, airless rooms with the reporter (and/or a writer), by now a nervous, shivering wreck, hanging over their shoulders, with the chief film editor pacing in the background like an expectant father, and with the editorial man from downstairs saying, “How're you doin'?” every five seconds, which really means, “Step on it buddy, or it's not gonna, make the which, it does. As any writer knows—“print men,” they call us here in TV land—nothing beats finishing a piece. To wave bye‐bye to words headed for the printer, to know that in a month or so they will be on a page, readable and holdable, is to experience the most heady sort of pleasure—one that Is followed, moreover, by an overwhelming sense of calm, an expansive feeling of self‐worth plus, in my own case, a week's recuperation in Bloomingdale's. But these poor buggers, what do they get? Two minutes on the, tube—if a viewer sneezes, he misses half your stand‐upper—a dinner gone cold, and maybe a trip to Levittown the next morning. * Guess what? They just moved me from local to network news. And guess what else? I don't have to go far away to cover war, pestilence and famine. Instead, for my first number, I covered a story in Atlantic City. Except for the ocean, Atlantic City didn't look that different from Queens, but instead of having lunch on a fire hydrant, we had to rush back to New York with the film, so we didn't have lunch at all. Still, the new people that surround me here are as monumentally patient and loving as the dears at local, the assignments, I hear, will be frequently, riveting, and not eating beats diet pills. As I get hard in the body, I may be getting soft in the head, but I like it here."
There's a Cop‐Out in The ‘Sandbox’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/theres-a-copout-in-the-sandbox.html,"IN “Up the Sandbox,” Barbra Streisand plays the role of Margaret, a fantasy ridden, day‐dreaming housewife and mother who spends her days at the sandbox with her children,, escaping into wild mind‐trips. Her husband is a history professor totally absorbed in his work, who ostensibly has no need for fantasies. They all live in an upper West Side apartment full of toys, books, pillows, art and other possessions demonstrable of the daily life well lived. Into this seemingly innocent nest of twigs and feathers a few worms begin to wriggle, and under the unused wings an itch develops. This is not a serious disease, since it is confined to the skin alone and can be cured by hourly immersion in the running stream of life. Margaret truly loves her family; the movie opens with the joyous physicality of children being bathed, and later read to. There is a closeness of husband and wife: sexual playfulness as well as minor irritations common to all relationships. Imposed on this naturalness, on this example of the absurdity and beauty of just being alive, a “political” platform is added from which a number of current and popular concerns are aired. Margaret finds herself pregnant for a third time! Question: should she have an abortion, or (this question mine) should she continue dreaming tabloid‐type dreams instead of acting on them? Should she (this question mine) wait 20 years until she is in her 50's (a romantic, liberating age?) only to find there is no place to fulfill herself since there is nothing she can do, and this includes prostitution, waitressing, saleswork, or even housework, all of which require both strength and a great deal of professional finesse. Although Margaret makes some motions in the direction of enlightenment and freedom, one has the feeling that—with her Neanderthal mentality—she will never amount to more than an allpurpose perpetual dustmop. Margaret has three friends whose purpose in the movie is to voice (superficially) ideas now prevalent in the women's movement. FRIEND 1: “I suppose you say thank you when he does the dishes.” FRIEND 2: “To be a good mother, you've got to eat ␣.” FRIEND 3: “The best mothers maintain their identity.” One does not hear conversation, one hears research—dull extrapolation by a scriptwriter with a tin ear. Now, although “Up the Sandbox” purports to examine Margaret's changing role in relation to her husband, children, political reality, racial problems—anything and everything that touches upon herself and the rest of the world—it becomes a clumsy reaffirmation of the notion that staying at home and having babies is the best thing for a woman to do, especially if her husband “generously” likes babies and is willing to give her one day a week off. The husband (David Selby), just another pretty face in a poorly written role, says: “Honey, our children will be a credit to the world ... they'll make it less crazy.” Maybe they will, but he does not notice that his wife is getting more crazy. When dreams become more satisfying than real life, something has to give. It is symptomatic that in the fantasies that interrupt Margaret's everyday existence, weinen appear as her enemies: husband stealer, militant powerhouse, mother, tribal goddess, doctor. In Anne Roiphe's book, Margaret does not fantasize going to an abortion clinic, but in Paul Zindel's screenplay, she does. The clinic is filmed as a kind of horrible limboland housing countless women, all waiting to rid themselves of unwanted fetuses ... no one speaks... the quiet is ominous... the female doctor is made to look like a monster ... the husband arrives and, wonderful man that he is, struggles with the forces of evil (the doctor and the nurses) for the return of his pregnant wife! The hospital table breaks free and with Margaret still on it, freewheels back to the sandbox where children are playing ... and a chorus of angels is, heard. This sentimental, maleimposed fantasy is unliberating and tacky, the very lowest point of the movie. However, politics aside, Irvin Kershner, the director, is often really excellent: I loved his direction of a family get‐together on the occasion of Margaret's parents' 33rd wedding anniversary. During this party, a relative is shooting home movies the lighting, is blinding, and so‐called normal behavior becomes abnormal or forced. The actors perform within a performance: they realize that movies—home movies—are for posterity, a reservoir of information, a cheerful record. There is a variation of the pie‐in‐the‐face routine as Margaret imagines shoving her mother's face into an elaborate anniversary cake, after which they tussel on the floor, with the father cheering Margaret on. If only all problems could be handled by slapstick, with each of its expert in pratfalls, exploding cigars, and magic umbrellas that would suddenly lift us out of hann's way. Jane Hoffman as the mother (she also played Mommy in Albee's “The American Dream”) is an intelligent and funny actress who has mastered her craft, John C. Becher, as the father, is also fine, as is Paul Benedict, who plays a comic anthropologist. Barbra Streisand is Barbra Streisand (love her or leave her) trying to be ordinary, but being beautiful. * The rest of the cast, a few hundred if one is to count the Somburu Tribe of Kenya which pops up in a dream sequence, do their thing well too. But so what! “Up the Sandbox” is to the women's movement what “The Strawberry Statement” was to the student revolution, a rip‐off giving lip service to authentic concerns but copping out in the end. It concludes in typical Hollywood starry‐eyed wonder as the husband asks Margaret on her day off: “Where are you going?” and she answers: “I don't know, but it's such a beautiful day it doesn't matter. She drives off into the sunlight, sitting in the back of a cab as if it were the saddle of a magnificent white stallion. Note: The more, the meter ticks away, the more she'll have to pay. She'll wish she had known where she was going."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/22/archives/loves-labors-paradise-lost-books-of-the-times-glimpses-of.html,"THE DARK FIELDS OF VENUS. From a Doctor's Logbook. By Basile Yanovsky. M.D. 240 pages. A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $7.95. The basic scenario of these 327 sketches of life in New York City's venereal disease clinics is depressingly unvarying. The patient present‐ him‐, her‐, or—as Dr. Yanovsky would add, in his bemusement over the variety of sexual appetites—itself; mumbles the usual embarrassed explanations and excuses (“You know how is . . .”): submits. to a blood test and an examination of the genitalia; turns out to have gonorrhea; receives a heavy dose of penicillin through a large needle inserted painfully into the buttocks; and leaves, presumably to wage new wars in the battlefields of love. Yet Dr; Yanovsky succeeds in varying their impact so skillfully —making them by turns brutal, funny, shocking, sad, yet always interesting and dramatic—that 327 of them hardly seem enough. Glimpses of Personalities Yes, mere sketches these are, never more than a page and a half long, more usually running two‐dozen lines or so, yet each of them seems to ring a different note. Sometimes we simply glimpse a personality, brought to life with a few deft strokes of the pen: like “This blond girl, German or Flemish‐looking, very mature ture and womanly, although only 19”: she screamed and resisted while Dr. Yanovsky struggled to insert the speculum into her vagina, yet once it was in she began to laugh—'“Homeric laughter: hilarious, triumphant, joyful”—until the entire clinic was infected by it and joined in. “I had the impression that this was how she behaved in bed, too,” Dr. Yanovsky concludes the vignette. Sometimes, a bitter irony curls off the page. For instance, a man comes in to be checked for gonorrhea, since the woman I'm seeing now called me and said that she's being treated for clap.” With him he has brought a barefoot child in tow. Dr. Yanovsky is furious. “It's filthy here, full of garbage. That child shouldn't be barefoot,” he says to the man. “We believe in nature,” the man explains. Sometimes it is a curious scrap of information we get: “For some reason we have many female bank tellers with gonorrhea, but no men. (Perhaps the men go to private doctors”). Sometimes, a provocative theory on human nature: “Of course there are ‘scientific’ ways of shaking the tobacco or cocaine habit. These are antimiraculous ways, and methadone is one of them. That's why so many addicts instinctively abhor, and are offended by, the very idea of it. For them it means complete surrender of their inner capacities.” Sometimes, an angry outburst against the calousness of the Health Department's bureaucracy: “Personally, if I had to choose between freedom, privacy, and gonorrhea on one side and no freedom, no privacy, and no gonorrhea on the other, I would opt for the first alternative.” And every so often, Dr. Yanovsky merely pauses to pay tribute to the enemy: “We dug into this small ulcer for a Dark Field examination [“the most dramatic test for syphilis, exposing the agent of the disease against a dark background under the microscope, is called the Dark Field. Hence the title of this book.”) and a short while later the bacteriologist showed me two dangerously slim, beautifully slithery Spirochaeta pallidae under the microscope. Their fine, silvery, corkscrew silhouettes conveyed a truly ominous impression.” But more important, Basile Yanovsky is not only a medical doctor, trained in Paris and New York, who in 1970 quit the hospital where he, was working because “had turned into an abortion mill, and I refused to take part in this destructive, although now legalized, activity.” He also a writer, a former member of a group of young Russian émigrés who lived and wrote in Paris from the 1920's until the 1940's, and the author of two novels published in this country, “No Man's Time” (1967), and “Of Light and Sounding Brass” (1972). So it should come as no great surprise that these sketches add up to more than the sum of their parts. Severe Social Problem What they add up to is an enlightening picture of why V.D. has once more become a severe social problem; a Breugelian portrait of the society that carries and spreads it (or at least that portion of the society that can't or won't seek private medication); a moral statement on contemporary life; and, above all, a profile of an outspoken man with a shrewd eye for human character and a rich sense of humor, who believes that love is still potent and enriching enough to be lasting and monogomous, who doubts that social engineering can cure diseases of the spirit, and who was not about to tailor his beliefs, or curb his tongue, to suit the needs of the system. And whether we agree with him or not, by the time we have finished reading these sketches we can understand what he is getting at when he writes in his Postscriptum: “I get the . . . impression . . . from all these singles, couples, and triangles, young and old, hetero and homosexuals, these wives, husbands, lovers, and mistresses [that] they are after something else, and sex is only a substitute, which, apparently, does not satisfy them. . . Every time I stick in my needle I feel: penicillin is not enough!”"
Court Says Clinic Run by 3 Doctors May Do Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/court-says-clinic-run-by-3-doctors-may-do-abortions.html,"The Appellate Division in Brooklyn overturned yesterday in a 4‐to‐1 decision a Westchester County State Supreme Court ruling that had enjoined the Dobbs Ferry Medical Pavilion, Inc., from performing abortions. The decision upheld the contention of the three doctors who operate the clinic that they were partners in group practice, and so did not need to be licensed as a clinic by the State Public Health Council. In his ruling last Sept. 8, Justice John J. Dillon had concluded that the medical pavilion fell “within the classification of hospital,” because, among other reasons, “the circumstances commonly indicating a doctor‐patient relationship are nonexistent.” The appeals court, in reversing that opinion, found that the doctors were well qualified and their offices adequately equipped to handle the abortions. The court maintained, moreover, that the statutory definition of the word “clinic” was unclear and that no criteria existed to determine whether the doctors' offices constituted a clinic. The majority held that the partnership did not constitute an “independent out‐ofhospital health facility” within the ambit of the public health law. Presiding Justice Samuel Rabin handed down the majority opinion in which he was joined by Justices J. Irwin Shapiro, Marcus G. Christ and Henry J. Latham. Justice Fred J. Munder dissented."
Cardinals Shocked —Reaction Mixed,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/cardinals-shockedreaction-mixed-2-cardinals-denounce-decision-other.html,"Reaction to the Supreme Court decision on abortion fragmented yesterday along predictable lines, as leaders of the Roman Catholic Church assailed the ruling while birth control and women's rights activists praised it. In the forefront of Catholic reaction were Cardinal Cooke of New York and Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, who is also the president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Statements by Cooke and Krol appear on Page 20. Cardinal Cooke issued a statement calling the Court's action yesterday “shocking” and “horrifying.” Cardinal Krol called the decision “an unspeakable tragedy for this nation.” But William Baird, a crusader for birth control and abortion, called the decision “a triumph” that culminated a long struggle. “I'm delighted to see that our position—that women have the right to control their own bodies—has been vindicated,” he said. Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, cailed the decision “a wise and courageous stroke for the right to privacy, and for the protection of a woman's physical and emotional health.” “By this act,” he said, “hundreds of thousands of American women every year will be spared the medical risks and emotional horrors of backstreet and self‐induced abortions. And as a nation, we shall be a step further toward assuring the birthright of every child to be welcomed by its parents at the time of its birth.” The decision was also welcomed by the Rev. Dr. Howard E. Spragg, executive vice president of the Board for Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ, who said, “The decision is historic not only in terms of women's individual rights but also in terms of the relationships of church and state.” ‘Neutrality of State’ Dr. Spragg said: “Although religious principles often form the basis of secular law, we hold that where religious beliefs vary, American law traditionally establishes the neutrality of the state. The doctrine of one religious group is not imposed by legal fiat or enforced by criminal sanction on the rest of American society.” Women lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights praised the Court's action as a victory for the women's liberation movement and a “tribute to the coordinated efforts of women's organizations, women awyers and all women throughout this country.” But Barbara Meara, president of the Bronx chapter of Right to Life, an anti‐abortion organization, said, “It is ironic that at a time when this country is trying to improve the lot of so many people and is so opposed to violence the Court should sanction the destruction of life.” The American Civil Liberties Union described the Court's decision as “an important step in the right direction.” “We trust that this is the beginning of the end for state efforts to interfere with the rights of women to secure medical abortions.” REMEMBER THE REEDIEST!"

National Guidelines Set by 7‐to‐2 Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/national-guidelines-set-by-7to2-vote.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 —The Supreme Court overruled today all state laws that prohibit or restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion during her first three months of pregnancy. The vote was 7 to 2. In a historic resolution of a fiercely controversial issue, the Court drafted a new set of national guidelines that will result in broadly liberalized anti‐abortion laws in 46 states but will not abolish restrictions altogether. Excerpts from opinion and dissent are on Page 20. Establishing an unusually detailed timetable for the relative legal rights of pregnant women and the states that would control their acts, the majority specified the following: ¶For the first three months of pregnancy the decision to have an abortion lies with the woman and her doctor, and the state's interest in her welfare is not “compelling” enough to warrant any interference. ¶For the next six months of pregnancy a state may “regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health,” such as licensing and regulating the persons and facilities involved. ¶For the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, the period during which the fetus is judged to be capable of surviving if born, any state may prohibit abortions, if it wishes, except where they may be necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Today's action will not affect existing laws in New York, Alaska, Hawaii and Washington, where abortions are now legally available in the early months of pregnancy. But it will require rewriting of statutes in every other state. The basic Texas case decided by the Court today will invalidate strict anti‐abortion laws in 31 states; a second decision involving Georgia will require considerable rewriting of more liberal statutes in 15 others. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion in which Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan Jr., Potter Stewart, Thurgood Marshall and Lewis F. Powell Jr. joined. Dissenting were Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist. Justice White, calling the decision “an exercise of raw judicial power,” wrote that “the Court apparently values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life which she carries.” The Court's decision was at odds with the expressed views of President Nixon. Last May, in a letter to Cardinal Cooke, he opposed “liberalized abortion policies” and spoke out for “the right to life of literally hundreds of thousands of unborn children.” But three of the four Justices Mr. Nixon has appointed to the Supreme Court voted with the majority, with only Mr. Rehnquist dissenting. The majority rejected the idea that a fetus becomes a “person” upon conception and is thus entitled to the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Constitution. This view was pressed by opponents of liberalized abortion, including the Roman Catholic Church. Justice Blackmun concluded that “the word ‘person,’ as used in the 14th Amendment, does not include the unborn,” although states may acquire, “at some point in time” of pregnancy, an Interest in the “potential human life” that the fetus represents, to permit regulation. It is that interest, the Court said, that permits states to prohibit abortion during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, after the fetus has developed the capacity to survive. In both cases decided today, the plaintiffs had based their protest on an assertion that state laws limiting the availability of abortion had circumscribed rights and freedoms guaranteed them by the Constitution: due process of law, equal protection of the laws, freedom of action and a particular privacy ihvolving a personal and family matter. In its decision on the challenge to the Georgia abortion law, the high court majority struck down several requirements that a woman seeking to terminate her pregnancy in that estate would have to meet. Among them were a flat prohibition on abortions for outof‐state residents and requirements that hospitals be accredited by a private agency, that applicants be screened by a hospital committee and that two independent doctors certify the potential danger to the applicant's health. The Georgia Iaw permitted abortions when a doctor found in “his best clinical judgment” that continued pregnancy would threaten the woman's life or health, that the fetus would be likely to be born defective or that the pregnancy was the result of rape. The same Supreme Court majority, with Justice Blackmun writing the opinion again, emphasized that this medical judgment should cover all relevant factors—“physical, emotional, psychological familial and the woman's age.” In some of the 15 states with laws similar to Georgia's, doctors have tended to take a relatively narrow view of what constituted a woman's health in deciding whether an abortion was legally justified. The Texas law that the Court invalidated entirely was typical of the criminal statutes passed in the last half of the 19th century prohibiting all abortions except those to save a mother's life. The Georgia law, approved in 1972 and altered by the Court today, was patterned after the model penal code of the American Law Institute. In the Texas case, Justice Blackmun wrote that the constitutional right of privacy, developed by the Court in a long series of decisions, was “broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” He rejected, however, the argument of women's rights groups that this right was absolute “and she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way and for whatever reason she alone chooses.” “With this we do not agree,” the Justice declared. “A state may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health in maintaining medical standards and in protecting potential life,” Mr. Blackmun observed. “At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become suffi‐ ciently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision.” The majority concluded that this “compelling” state interest arose at the end of the first three months of pregnancy because of the “now established medical fact” that until then, fewer women die from abortions than from normal childbirth. During this three‐month period, the Court said, a doctor can recommend an abortion to his patient “without regulation by the state” and the resulting operations can be conducted “free of interference by the state.” The “compelling state interest” in the fetus does not arise, however, until the time of “viability,” Justice Blackmun wrote, when it has “the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.” This occurs about 10 weeks before delivery. In reading an abbreviated version of his two opinions to the Court this morning, Justice Blackmun noted that most state legislatures were in session now and would thus be able to rewrite their states abortion laws to conform to the Court's decision. Both of today's cases wound up with anonymous parties winning victories over state officials. In the Texas case, “Jane Roe,” an unmarried pregnant woman who was allowed to bring the case without further identity, was the only plaintiff after the Supreme Court disqualified a doctor and a childless couple who said that the wife's health would be endangered by pregnancy. In the Georgia case, the surviving plaintiff was “Mary, Doe,” who, when she brought the action, was a 22‐year‐old married woman 11 weeks pregnant with her fourth child."
Statements by 2 Cardinals,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/statements-by-2-cardinals-cardinal-cooke-cardinal-kroi.html,"Following are statements issued by Cardinal Cooke and John Cardinal Krol, Archbishop of Philadelphik and president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, in reaction to the Supreme Court decision on abortions: Cardinal Cooke How many millions of children prior to their birth will never live to see the light of day because of the shocking action of the majority of the United States Supreme Court today? Whatever their legal rationale, seven men have made a tragic utilitarian judgment regarding who shall live and who shall die. They have made themselves a “super legislature,” They have gone against the will of those American people who spoke their minds in favor of life as recently as last November in referendums in Michigan and North Dakota. They have usurped the powers and responsibilities of the legislatures of 50 states to protect human life. I remind all Americans, however, that judicial decisions are not necessarily sound moral decisions. In spite of this horrifying decision, the American people must rededicate themselves to the protection of the sacredness of all human life. I hype and pray that our citizens will do all in their power to reverse this injustice to the rights of the unborn child. Cardinal Krol The Supreme Court's decision today is an unspeakable tragedy for this nation. It is hard to think of any decision in the 200 years of our history which has had more disastrous Implications for our stability as a civilized society. The ruling drastically diminishes the constitutional guaranty of the right to life and in doing so sets in motion developments which are terrifying to contemplate. The ruling represents bad logic and bad law. There is no rational justification for allowing unrestricted abortion up to the third month of pregnancy. The development of life before and after birth is a continuous process and in making the three‐month point the cutoff for unrestricted abortion, the Court seems more impressed by magic than by scientific evidence regarding fetal development. The child in the womb has the right to life, to the life he already possesses, and this is a right no court has the authority to deny. Apparently the Court was trying to straddle the fence and give something to everybody—abortion on demand before three months for those who want that, somewhat more restrictive abortion regulations after three months for those who want that. But in its straddling act, the Court has done a monstrous injustice to the thousands of unborn children whose lives may be destroyed as a result of this decision. No court and no legislature in the land can make something evil become something good. Abortion at any stage of pregnancy is evil. This is not a question of sectarian morality but instead concerns the law of God and the basis of civilized society. One trusts in the decency and good sense of the American people not to let an illogical court decision dictate to them on the subject of morality and human life."

Ruling Seems to Forestall Abortion Debate in Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/ruling-seems-to-forestall-abortiondebate-inalbany-rendered-useless.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 22—The United States Supreme Court's abortion decision today appeared to quash the hopes of Right to Life and other antiabortion groups for a full‐scale debate in the Legislature again this year on repealing the state's liberalized abortion law. “No way,” replied Assemblyman Constance E. Cook, a Republican of Ithaca and a sponsor of the liberalized abortion law, when asked 1f the issue of restoring the old state statute would be seriously discussed again. The liberalized state law permits a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancy. The old law permitted abortions only when a woman's life was in jeopardy. Rendered ‘Useless’ The Supreme Court's 7‐to‐2 ruling, Mrs. Cook said, rendered efforts by antiabortion lobbyists to force it to the floors of the Senate and Assembly “a useless show of strength.” Similarly, Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, Republican of Montauk, said he felt it would be “futile” to bring repeal legislation up for debate again. Well organized opponents of the liberalized abortion law succeeded in having it repealed in both houses last year despite a pledge by Governor Rockefeller that he would veto a repeal measure. The Governor kept his promise. Mr. Rockefeller, who did not comment on the court decision today pending a review of it by his legal staff, reaffirmed that he would again veto a repea measure this year, but the antiabortion groups were undaunted. Today, the comments of abortion opponents contained some of the emotional comments that the issue has always elicited here. From his newly opened lobbying office near the Capitol, Edward J. Golden, chairman of the New York State Right to Life Committee, said, “virtually all protection under law has been stripped from the unborn child.” “Our sentiments at this hour are saddened not only for those unborn infants who will never taste birth but also for our society that has soured with permissiveness,” Mr. Golden said. Senator James H. Donovan, Republican of Chadwicks and the Senate sponsor of repeal of the present abortion law, called on Congress to amend the United States Constitution to provide “the unborn” with equal protection under the 14th Amendment. The Assembly sponsor of repeal legislation, Assemblyman Edward F. Crawford, Republican of Oswego, said he thought the State's present abortion law would be left intact under the court ruling. But the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Rebublican of Binghamton—who favors the liberalized abortion law—was not so certain. “Whether or not the court's ruling requires a change in the New York law must await a full reading of the decision,” Mr. Anderson said, adding that the Supreme Court action “hopefully will clear up some of the legal questions which have clouded legislative actions in this field.” The New York Civil Liberties Union, which lobbied for the current statute, said the decision seemed “to be a complete and total victory and vindication for the right of a woman to have a safe and legal abortion if she so chooses.” Similarly pleased was Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, Democrat of Manhattan, one of the lawmakers who pioneered in the enactment in 1970 of the liberalized law. “The Supreme Court decision will open health care to women in every state of this nation,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “Backalley abortions should become a thing of the past. No longer will it be necessary for women who are residents of other states to travel to New York for help.” Representative Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, said: “Millions of women will feel more secure and more free today because of the Supreme Court ruling.” The decision also spurred proponents of the present law into seeking a further action—that of abolishing the abortion statute completely and making abortion a matter of “medical regulation and private morality.” Reaction Mixed in Jersey Special to The New York Times TRENTON, Jan. 22—In the Assembly here, where political pressure had been building for a vote on a tough abortion bill, reaction to the Supreme Court decision was mixed. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Brian Kennedy, Republican of Monmouth County, would permit abortion only if two doctors certify that it is needed to save the mother's life. “Abominable,” Mr. Kennedy said of the Supreme Court decision. He said the court was legislating for the Congress and the states. “I will have to study the deIcision to see if the language allows room for my bill,” he said, “but I will not change my bill to suit the decision.” But Assemblyman Eldridge Hawkins, Democrat of Essex County, reacted to the decision by calling for release from the Judiciary Committee or two of his own liberal abortion bills. One of them is patterned after the New York law, which basically allows abortion on demand; ‐the‐second would allow abortion for any reason through the first four months of pregnancy. The judiciary chairman, Assemblyman William K. Dickey, Republican of Camden County, said the committee would study the Supreme Court decision before deciding on the form of a bill to be sent to the floor for a vote. Hartford Law Held Imperiled Special to The New York Times HARTFORD, Jan. 22—Opponents of Connecticut's strict abortion law suggested that it could not survive under the Supreme Court's ruling, but said the Legislature might try to find some means to get around the ruling. After a three‐judge Federal court found the state's 1860 abortion law unconstitutional last year, a slightly revised version was passed—and soon found unconstitutional by the same caurt. But the state was allowed to enforce the new law pending an appeal. Kathryn Emmet, one of the lawyers representing the challengers to the law, Women vs. Connecticut, said the three judge ruling was in line with the Supreme Court's. “I think it will uphold the decision of our district court on the Connecticut statute and hopefully can prevent the Legislature from flying off the handle in the future,” she said. William Olds, executive director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, said the state might try to find some loophole to permit passage of another tough law. There was no immediate comment from Attorney General Robert K. Killian, who is appealing the three‐judge rejection of the state law. Nor did Gov. Thomas J. Meskill or leaders of the Legislature comment; they said they would wait until they had read the decision."
Cardinals Shocked —Reaction Mixed,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/cardinals-shocked-reaction-mixed.html,"Reaction to the Supreme Court decision on abortion fragmented yesterday along predictable lines, as leaders of the Roman Catholic Church assailed the ruling while birth control and women's rights activists praised it. In the forefront of Catholic reaction were Cardinal Cooke of New York and Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, who is also the president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Statements by Cooke and Krol appear on Page 20. Cardinal Cooke issued a statement calling the Court's action yesterday “shocking” and “horrifying.” Cardinal Krol called the decision “an unspeakable tragedy for this nation.” But William Baird, a crusader for birth control and abortion, called the decision “a triumph” that culminated a long struggle. “I'm delighted to see that our position—that women have the right to control their own bodies—has been vindicated,” he said. Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the decision “a wise and courageous stroke for the right to privacy, and for the protection of a woman's physical and emotional health.” “By this act,” he said, “hundreds of thousands of American women every year will be spared the medical risks and emotional horrors of backstreet and self‐induced abortions. And as a nation, we shall be a step further toward assuring the birthright of every child to be welcomed by its parents at the time of its birth.” The decision was also welcomed by the Rev. Dr. Howard E. Spragg, executive vice president of the Board for Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ, who said, “The decision is historic not only in terms of women's individual rights but also in terms of the relationships of church and state.” Dr. Spragg said: “Although religious principles often form the basis of secular law, we hold that where religious beliefs vary, American law traditionally establishes the neutrality of the state. The doctrine of one religious group is not imposed by legal fiat or enforced by criminal sanction on the rest of American society.” Women lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights praised the Court's action as a victory for the women's liberation movement and a “tribute to the coordinated efforts of women's organizations, women awyers and all women throughout this country.” But Barbara Meara, president (of the Bronx chapter of Right Ito Life, an anti‐abortion organization, said, “It is ironic that at a time when this country is trying to improve the lot of so many people and is so opposed to violence the Court should sanction the destruction of life.” The American Civil Liberties Union described the Court's decision as “an important step in the right direction.” “We trust that this is the beginning of the end for state efforts to interfere with the rights of women to secure medical abortions.”"

Excerpts From Abortion Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/excerpts-from-abortion-case-privacy-rights-unclear.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 22—Following are excerpts from the majority opinion, written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in Jane Roe v. Henry Wade, the Texas abortion case, and from the dissent written by Justice Byron R. White: Majority Opinion The Texas statutes under attack here are typical of those that have been in effect in many states for approximately a century. These make it a crime to “procure an abortion,” as therein defined, or to attempt one, except with respect to “an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.” Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of the states. It perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of states are of relatively recent vintage. Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th century. When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman. Privacy Rights Unclear The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the 14th Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the state would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be iminent. Mental and physical wealth may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. On the basis of elements such as these, appellants and some amici argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. The Court's decision recognizing a right of privacy also acknowleges that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. A state may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards and in protecting potential life. At the same point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a “person” within the language and meaning of the 14th Amendment. In support of this they outline at length and in detail the well‐known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of parenthood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life is then guaranteed specifically by the amendment. The Constitution does not define “person” in so many words. The use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally. All this, together with our observation that throughout the major portion of the 19th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word “person,” as used in the 14th Amendment, does not include the unborn. Texas urges that, apart from the 14th Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the state has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. The unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense. With respect to the state's important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother, the “compelling” point, in the light of present medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester. This is so because of the now established medical fact that until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion is less than mortality in normal childbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a state may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health. With respect to the state's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the “compelling” point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. If the state is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Dissenting Opinion At the heart of the controversy in these cases are those recurring pregnancies that pose no danger whatsoever to the life or health of the mother but are nevertheless unwanted for any one or more of a variety of reasons —convenience, family planning, economics, dislike of children, the embarrassment of illegitimacy, etc. The common claim before us is that for any one of such reasons, or for no reason at all, and without asserting or claiming any threat to life or health, any woman is entitled to an abortion at her request if she is able to find a medical adviser willing to undertake the procedure. The Court for the most part sustains this position during the period prior to the time the fetus becomes viable, the Constitution of the United States values the convenience, whim or caprice of the putative mother more than life or potential life of the fetus. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 states are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus on the one band against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial Power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but in my view its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review which the constitution extends to this court. I find no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the states. In a sensitive area such as this, involving as it does issues over which reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ, I cannot accept the Court's exercise of its clear power of choice by interposing a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it. This issue, for the most part, should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to their affairs."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/23/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-metropolitan-museum-for-whom-and-for-what.html,"To the Editor: On Jan. 16 The Times reported that the Metropolitan Museum has refused to divulge information about the terms on which it disposes of paintings in its collection, “on the broad basis that the museum is a private corporation and, in Mr. Hoving's words, ‘every work of art is entirely owned by the trustees.’” These arrogant assertions are bad law and even worse ethics. The Metropolitan is not a private corporation but a charitable corporation, a status which gives it important privileges and correlative public obligations. The trustees “own” the assets only in very limited sense; as trustees of public charity, the law places on them serious public responsibilities. It may be technically correct that there is no obligation to make public the terms on which assets are disposed of; but the trustees are accountable to the public (in the person of the State's. Attorney General) to assure that the museum's assets have not been dissipated or the terms of any trust violated. A priyate person who owns a painting is free to sell it for little or to give it away for nothing; if the trustees sold or traded the de Groot paintings on terms which are unfair to the museum, they have violated their public trust, and the public has every right to complain. Further, in connection with the de Groot paintings: Surely it is important for the museum to be free to improve its collection by selling or trading its pictures. But this does not apply to pictures which the museum accepted on the basis of a legal or moral undertaking restricting that freedom. The de Groot paintings were left to the museum on the donor's express request that they not be sold and that, if the Metropolitan did not wish to keep them, they be kept in the public domain by gifts to other museums. Under these circumstances it is disgraceful that the Metropolitan should have sold and traded those paintings into private hands. The present controversy creates an important occasion for the trustees of the Metropolitan—and other museums, too—to reassess their public responsibilities in connection with both the acquisition and the disposal of works of art. A sound first step would be to recognize that secrecy is a wholly untenable policy. PAUL M. BATOR Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 16, 1973 To the Editor: In my view the Metropolitan Museum has no business trying to be a community center with special programs for neighborhoods. A community center is a fine thing; museum is a jewel of another order. It's a museum's business to guard and display its collections, to educate in various ways, to put on the best possible special exhibitions most attractively, and to be a place to go to look at paintings and sculptures and objects of art, where, just possibly if the gallery is quiet enough and the light is right, that surprising contract between person and art may be entered. How can community service be higher than that? A great museum does not have to be a playpen. Especially if it cannot afford to, the Metropolitan should not have to go into the streets with artmobiles, looking for an audience. Anyone who gives the smallest damn about art in any borough can go to it. Now the Metropolitan is in trouble in part because those who run it have failed to believe in the power of its possessions, its art. If the museum fails to know its strength, and itself for what it is, like a person it fails its function. That is just what seems to be happening, with ghastly loss in the one thing the Metropolitan has beyond price, its art. CHARLOTTE DEVREE New York, Jan. 15, 1973 To the Editor: Thank you for publishing John L. Hess' informative news article (Jan. 14) on the secret trade between the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Marlborough Galleries. For a museum allegedly short of funds, the Metropolitan. Museum has somehow managed to pay almost nine million dollars for three paintings, i.e., $1.4 million for Moneys “La Terrasse à Sainte‐Adresse,” $2.3 million for Rembrandt's “Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer” and $5 million for the Velasquez portrait of Juan de Pereja. But was it really necessary to pay over two million dollars for a Rembrandt when the Metropolitan Museum already owns 25 other paintings plus over forty etchings and dry points by this master? Was it necessary to spend $1.4 million for Monet's “La Terrasse à Sainte‐Adresse” when the Metropolitan Museum already owns at least eight other paintings by this artist? In addition, paintings by Monet can be seen at the Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the Guggenheim Museum so that the argument about never having enough of a good thing is not very solid in this case. Then, instead of placing paintings by Boudin alongside the ones by Monet so that the visitor might get a sense of the continuity in nineteenth‐century French painting and an understanding of Boudin's influence on Monet, the Metropolitan Museum officials go ahead and sell one of the few paintings by Boudin to be seen anywhere New York in a public collection. It absolutely no consolation to know that there is in the United States a collector who owns about forty works by Eugene Boudin since the collection is not open to the public. The Metropolitan Museum of Art not serving the public interest when sells paintings in its collection to finance the purchase of contemporary works that people can see readily at the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum and even at various branches of the Chase Manhattan Bank. I, for one, would like to see the masterpieces and the so‐called “lesser works” exhibited next to one another so that I might have a chance to come to my own conclusions about which paintings belong to each of these categories. CECILE NEBEL Forest Hills, N. Y., Jan. 17, 1973 To the Editor: In 1803 the United States negotiated the Louisiana Purchase with France. In 1819 we bought Florida from Spain, and in 1867 purchased Alaska from Russia. These acts helped fulfill the manifest destiny of the United States but, almost as importantly, represented face‐saving gestures to and for France, Spain and Russia. Well, here we are in the twentieth century. So why not apply a peaceful lesson of the past? Were Israel—or the United States for Israel—to successfully negotiate the purchase of occupied Egyptian territory on a line from Rafah to Sharm el Sheikh, might that not be a similar face‐saving gesture to the United Arab Republic? If such transaction could be proved feasible, could not a similar transaction be accomplished with Syria with respect to the Golan Heights? JACK COHEN New York, Jan. 16, 1973 • Liberal Party's Leadership To the Editor: The recent political summit meeting between Governor Rockefeller and Liberal party boss Alex Rose, “the boss of bosses,” typifies the moral bankruptcy of today's Liberal party leadership. Not only has the Liberal party become one man's fiefdom but any pretense of its being a “progressive” force has been cast aside by the realities of expediency and patronage. The fact that Nelson Rockefeller and Alex Rose would sit down for two hours to try to “choose” the next Mayor of New York is not a surprise. A reactionary Governor and the boss of a geriatric political machine do have one thing in common: the pursuit of power. The reform wing of the Liberal party, Liberals for New Politics, is pledged to the pursuit of ideals —something very foreign to Boss Rose and our Governor. LLOYD MERRILL District Leader, 62 A.D. New York, Jan. 13, 1973 • Developers vs. Timberland To the Editor: Large timberland owners face the same pressures from developers as farmers near large population centers do [news story Jan. 10]. An added burden is that often timberlands are taxed at rates that would exist if the land were developed for recreation. This increases the urge to sell to developers for the growth of timber can't cover the amount of taxes to be paid. The solution to the problem is strict zoning laws. Thus timberland and farmland could be assessed at lower rates. If a zoning classification was changed to allow for development, the developer would have to pay to the community the new higher assessment for at least ten years (if not more) previous to the change of classification. This would let the developer pay the real price for developing the land plus bring increased revenue to the community. GEORGE FOWLER Assoc. Editor, The Northern Logger Old Forge, N. Y., Jan. 10, 1973 • Why Not Truman Avenue? To the Editor: I think it appropriate that some street, thoroughfare or location in New York bear the name of the late Harry S. Truman. How about finally eliminating the name Avenue of the Americas and rename Sixth Avenue Truman Avenue? RICHARD SAMUELSON Montreal, Jan. 16, 1973 Let Us Park Our Cars To the Editor: The Times recently reported that a woman driver shot three people in a car, one fatally, after losing a dispute over a parking place. To the advantages which could result from more parking space in the city must now be added another —crime prevention. Alternate side of the street parking rules were bade to free the curb periodically so machines could sweep the streets. However, casual observation reveals that a competent operator can sweep through a parking space in something under three seconds. For the remaining hours of the forbidden period the space is empty to no purpose. Why can't the game be set up so that parking is illegal only when a car happens to be actually in the way of the sweeper? Doubtless the authorities can quote a dozen reasons why this is impractical. But the obvious objections seem trivial compared with all the benefits, such as less moving traffic, less double parking, less pollution, less frustration, and fewer homicides. HUDSON HATCHER Bronxville, N. Y., Jan. 10, 1973 Report From the Middle To the Editor: I'm middle‐aged, with middle income, a husband in middle management, and originally from the Middle West, but these days I feel like I'm “in the middle” — alone. I'm very weary of having other people speak for me, about me and in my name. No, President Nixon, I am not in favor of the bombing—now or ever. A few of my Representatives in Congress are finally realizing that. On the other hand, I'm not in favor of abortion either—I still think it's murder, too (or one, if you wish to be legal). I don't want the press, radio or TV to be coerced in any way by the Government, obliquely or bliquely. 3ut do wish they would impose a few restraints of their own—on gossip and their dogged tracking of people caught up in tragedy—(“How did you feel when you came home and found all the other members of your family dead?”). If they wish to be considered professions, let them set up a few standards and then enforce them. I'm in favor of freedom for women. Much of my life has seen very little of it in the business world. But don't like gay activists or radicals to take over an important movement and leave it open to ridicule. I don't like censorship but I refuse to attend plays or movies which make me feel like an intruder—and a prurient one at that. That is the ultimate censorship. I'm against letting people starve, here or elsewhere in the world, but I'm against much that is going on in welfare circles, not because of the people who are being “helped” but because of the people who make a living out of other people's despair, and are not always too compassionate. I like to think I'm color‐blind. I'm for equal rights for all. If busing can achieve equality, great! But where is the quality in much education today? Children must be sent to school to learn, and teachers must care about their profession, rely less on “method” and stop trying to “force‐feed.” It's common in Washington circles these days to criticize the elitist East. But where did Kissinger and Dunlop, among others, come from? Let's stop being a tribal society, East against West, unions vs. management, etc. The ecologists keep telling us how close to doom we are.

Kissinger arrived in Paris last night and it was announced that his talks today with Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam would be moved to the ceremonial setting of the International Conference Center. There was no official word on how long completion of the cease‐fire agreement would take, but the choice of the center suggested that the two sides considered tomorrow's session important. [Page 1, Column 4.] International South Vietnamese troops throughout the country have been put on full alert and security measures in Saigon and other major cities are being sharply intensified in anticipation of Communist attacks before the expected cease‐fire agreement. [6:4–6.] United States air power is scheduled to be withdrawn from Southeast Asia very slowly in the initial period after any cease‐fire. A high‐ranking defense official said that very few of the approximately 1,000 Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps combat aircraft will be pulled back during the first 60 days of a truce, “until every one of our prisoners of war has been returned and the missing accounted for.” [7:1–3.) National Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th President of the. United States, died of an apparent heart attack at his ranch near Johnson City, Texas. He was 64 years old. Mr. Johnson, whose history of heart illness began in 1955, was pronounced dead on arrival at 4:33 P.M. Central time at San Antonio International Airport, where he had been flown in a family plane on the way to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio. [1:8.] Shock, sorrow and the sense of a historic leader lost were the mourning themes of public officials and private citizens across the nation as word, spread that Lyndon Baines Johnson was dead. A statement by President Nixon was among the many tributes to the 36th President. Mr. Nixon called Mr. Johnson “a dynamic leader, a unique personality, and a man of great ability and unshakeable courage.” [1:5.] Mr. Johnson's obituary appears on Pages 26 through 29. The Supreme Court, voting 7 to 2, overruled all state laws that prohibit or restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion during her first three months of pregnancy. The Court drafted an entirely new set of national guidelines that will result in broadly liberalized anti‐abortion laws in some 46 states but not abolish restrictions altogether.

[1:3.] Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, leader of the Hanafi community of Moslems in Washington, blamed the Black Muslims for the slaying last Thursday of seven of his followers, including three of his children, and he, in effect, declared war on the Black Muslims. He called on other Moslem groups in this country and abroad to assist in deposing the Black Muslims and their leader, Elijah Muhammad. Meanwhile, a team of Washington detectives went to New York today to investigate the possibility of a connection between the attempted robbery of a Brooklyn gun store and the Moslem feud, [1:4.] Metropolitan The Supreme Court's abortion decision appeared to quash the hopes of right‐to‐life groups for a full‐scale debate in the Legislature again this year on repealing the state's liberalized abortion law. “No way” replied Assemblywoman Constance E.

Abortions at Any Time Sought in State,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/24/archives/abortions-at-any-time-sought-in-state.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 23 — A bill that would allow abortions at any stage of pregnancy was introduced in the Legislature today by lawmakers who led the successful fight for a liberâlized abortion statute in 1970. At the same time; Governor Rockefeller said he did not foresee a need for any major changes in New York's abortion law as a result of the United States Supreme Court's decision yesterday. The state law permits abortion until the 24th week of pregnancy, although abortion is permitted later to protect the life of the mother. Mr. Rockefeller, who last year vetoed legislation to repeal the liberalized statute, desciibed the High Court's ruling as a wonderful thing.” The bill advanced today would abolish the state abortion law entirely and make abortion subject only to state medical practice and health codes. “We suggest now that one's own reproduction is a personal and private matter — not a suitable subject for state legislation,” Mrs. Constance E. Cook, Republican of Ithaca, said at a news conference. “In effect, abortion should be treated like any other medical problem.” Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, Democrat‐Liberal of Manhattan, said that earlier restrictions on abortion had been enacted primarily because of crude and dangerous abortion techniques and were no longer necessary. “It has become clear over the last 10 years that abortion can be medically safe, and New York's experience in the last two years has proved this,” he said. “Indeed, implementation of the current law has led to a measurable decrease in maternal mortality.” State regulations that would remain in force under the bill forbid anyone other than a doctor from performing an abortion. About 30 legislators are said to have promised their support for the bill—“it's a new ball game and everyone is reexamining his position” in light of the Supreme Court decision,” Mrs. Cook said. But the bill's prospects are uncertain. Perry B. Duryea, the Speaker of the Assembly, said yesterday that it would be “futile to bring repeal legislation up for debate again.” Mr. Duryea was referring to efforts by antiabortion forces to do away with the liberalized law. A spokesman for the Speaker said today that Mr. Duryea would probably regard a move for repeal by pro‐abortion lawmakers as equally futile at this session. It is considered likely that if the pro‐abortion legislators fail in their new bid, they would press for an amendment to the current law to allow abortions after the 24th week not only to protect a mother's life but also to protect her health. The Supreme Court ruled, in part, that any state may prohibit abortions in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy except where they may be necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Health has been defined in numerous ways in legal cases, but many courts now extend the term to include psychological as well as physical aspects."

Kissinger and Le Duc Tho had initialed an agreement in Paris yesterday “to end the war and bring peace with honor in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.” He said in a televised report to the nation that a Vietnam ceasefire would go into effect on Saturday at 7 P.M., Eastern standard time. The accord will be signed on Saturday. [Page 1, Col. 8.] Members of Congress, after years of bitter debate over the Vietnam war, united last night in voicing relief and gratitude that the conflict appeared to be at an end. However, some supporters and some critics of the Vietnam policies of two administrations sought to draw from President Nixon's announcement fresh justification for their opposite viewpoints in the long dispute that divided Congress and the nation. [1:7.] President Nguyen Van Thieu declared today that he considered the Paris peace accord only as a cease‐fire that did not guarantee “a stable, long‐lasting peace,” and said that “in the days to come we'll see if the Communists will observe the agreement.” [1:4.] In an assessment of the impact of the Vietnam war on American life, James Reston writes that one thing is fairly clear: “There has been a, sharp decline in respect for authority in the United States as a result of the war—not only a decline in respect for the civil authority of government, but for the moral authority of the schools, the universities, the press, the church and even the family.” [1:6–7.] International The United States and Japan announced a major consolidation of American military bases in Japan, United States officials said it would not significantly reduce American forces or impair American military operations in Japan, and the officials indicated that the United States would keep large bases and forces in Japan for at least five more years and probably longer. [2:4–5.] The Soviet Union followed up publication of its controversial immigration law by making public the regulations and scale of fees to be paid by emigrants as reimbursement for a free higher education. The tax duties ostensibly apply to all emigrants, but critics believe that they are directed mainly at Jews wishing to emigrate. [2:4–6.] National Thousands of Texans filed past the coffin of Lyndon B. Johnson as his body lay in state in the huge library that bears his name at the University of Texas in Austin. Mr. Johnson will be buried tomorrow afternoon at the LBJ ranch, 75 miles west of Austin, after a funeral service in Washington. His. body will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda today. President Nixon announced that tomorrow would be a national day of mourning and that all Federal offices would be closed. [1:2–3.] Before it is completed on tomorrow afternoon, the country's second Presidential funeral in less than a month will have involved several thousand Americans, in and out of uniform, and spread itself grandly across half a continent. Each element of the 36th President's last rites represents nearly five years of planning by the Army as well as feverish and frequently, frantic last‐minute scrambling. [22:1–2.] A witness said that $199,000 had been paid to a defendant in the Watergate trial in Washington during last year's campaign with the approval of former Attorney General John N. Mitchell and former Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stars. The money was said to have gone to G. Gordon Liddy, a lawyer for President Nixon's campaign organization, who had been assigned to establish what another witness described as “an intelligence gathering operation.” [1:1.] Metropolitan Presidents of 29 colleges operated by the State University will be appointed to terms limited to five years and will face intensive evaluation of their performance if they seek reappointment, under a new policy expected to be adopted today. Such a policy will place the state in the forefront of the accountability movement, which is being promoted across the country in an effort to assure that educators will have to stand or fall on their records. [45:1–2.] Federal narcotics agents, working closely with their French counterparts, smashed a major operation that smuggled some 575 pounds of heroin from France to the United States over the last three years, the Govvernment announced.

Dismissal of Abortion Cases Foreseen in Bergen,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/24/archives/dismissal-of-abortion-cases-foreseen-in-bergen-indictment-of-dr.html,"HACKENSACK, Jan. 23—The Bergen County Prosecutor Sherwin D. Lester, said today that as he “read the press reports,” the Supreme Court decision striking down laws that restrict abortions during the first three months of pregnancy “could very well” dispoae of the case against Dr. Robert M. Livingston “and all others like it.” Dr. Livingston, an Englewood Cliffs gynecologist, was indicted last August on charges of having performed an abortion. The 37‐year‐old graduate of the Yale Medical School had publicly admitted to having performed a number of such operations in what he said was an attempt to test New Jersey law. Decision Itself Not Read The Supreme Court decision yesterday said, among other things, that for the first three months of pregnancy the decision to have an abortion rested with a woman and her doctor. During that period, the Court ruled, the state's interest in a woman's welfare is not “compelling” enough to warrant intervention. Mr. Lester, who was a County District Court judge before becoming prosecutor last September, said he had read only press reports and not the Supreme Court ruling itself. Consequently, he added, he could not comment on the Livingston case in detail. He referred a reporter to State Attorney General George F. Kugler Jr. for more detail, but noted, “If the decision reads like the press reports, the probability is that the Livingston case and other investigations like it will be terminated.” Mr. Kugler could not be reached for comment. David G. Lucas, the assistant attorney general who was acting as Bergen County Prosecutor when Dr. Livingston was indicted last Aug. 24, said only that the decision was “being studied to see what it has done to our statute and common law.” Stephen N. Nagier, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that he thought the Attorney General would have to agree to the dismissal of three Federal actions to which the state was a party and to the dismissal of the state criminal action against Dr. Livingston as well. Preliminary Opinion Offered on High Court Ruling A three‐judge Federal bench ruled the 122‐year‐old New Jersey statute unconstitutional last Feb. 29. It said that the law, which made it a high misdemeanor to perform an abortion “without lawful justification,” was “void for vagueness” and provided “not a glimmer of notice” as to what could legally be done. Limited Application The decision, however, applied only to the eight physicians on whose behalf the case had been brought, and not to all physicians as a class, Further, the court declined to issue an order enjoining the state from enforcing the statute. The state appealed the Ming, and Mr. Kugler instructed his prosetutors to continue investigating abortion cases, but to hold all court actions in abeyance pending resolution of the Federal cases. Dr. Livingston said today he was “very happy” about the Supreme Court ruling, but added he did not know how “it will affect my particular case.” “The state has to go to the Federal courts first,” he said. “If nothing happens in the next couple of months, we'll move to dismiss.”"
Questions Left Unanswered by Ruling on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/24/archives/questions-left-unanswered-by-ruling-on-abortion-appears-to-conform.html,"The Supreme Court's farreaching decision Monday on abortion, hailed as an overwhelming victory for women's right to privacy and attacked as depriving the fetus of its right to life, has left unanswered a number of serious medical and legal questions. Among the questions, according to the authorities consulted yesterday, are the immediate impact on existing state laws, the role of the local health authorities in setting standards of safety for early abortions and the fate of most of the abortion clinics that now exist in and around New York City. According to the legal authorities here and in Washington, the Court's 7‐to‐2 decision, which holds that no state may interfere with a woman's right to obtain an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, has the effect of immediately invalidating all existing laws that do not conform. Appears to Conform In the strictest interpretation, only New York State's abortion law appears to conform in all details to the Court's ruling. Three other states—Hawaii, Alaska and Washington, which, like New York, have laws permitting a woman and her doctor to decide about an abortion —also have residency requirements. Such requirements have been struck down by the Court. The 46 other states and the District of Columbia will, in effect, have no abortion laws until their legislatures pass laws that conform to the Supreme Court's ruling, the legal authorities said. While a person could still be taken to court for violating a state law that did not conform to the ruling, the case would be unlikely to get very far, they said. As one authority, Mrs. Harriet Pilpel, attorney for Planned Parenthood‐World Population, said, “When the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution, the decision becomes effective immediately. I think that until new laws are passed, doctors, can go ahead and perform abortions.” To Set Up Clinics Whether doctors across the nation will take advantage of this situation remains to be seen. “Interested lay people—women, clergy and others—will have to work with the medical profession to assure that safe, humane, low‐cost abortions are made available to all women,” said the Rev. Howard, Moody, pastor of Judson Memorial Church here and director of the National Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion. Planned Parenthood expects to work with its 190 affiliates in 40 states to help those who want to set up nonprofit abortion clinics and to establish a toll‐free nationwide telephone referral system. Once such clinics are established—and those experienced in setting them up say that it takes three to six months to do so—they will almost certainly spell an end to most of the commercial abortion referral agencies and commercial clinics that have flourished since New York State liberalized its law in July, 1970. The overwhelming majority of patients served by these agencies and clinics have been women from outside New York State, who in the future will be able to obtain abortions closer to home. Medical Question Raised “But in the foreseeable future,” said Dr. Jean Pakter, director of maternity services and family planning for the New York City Department of Health, “many women will continue to use New York's services.” She said that she suspected that states closest to New York would be the slowest in setting up abortion services of their own. Another aspect of the Court's ruling that raises a host of pressing medical questions is the Justice's clear dictum against any state intervention during the first three months of pregnancy. The Health Services Administration determined yesterday that the Court had in effect ruled unconstitutional the city's health code regulations governing how and where abortions might be performed. Among other things, this code prohibits abortions in doctors' officcs and sets safety requirements for abortion clinics. Gordon Chase, health services administrator, said that the Court's decision was largely influenced by the excellent safety record that has accompanied abortions in New York City—abortions that were, for the most part performed in accordance with the health code regulations. Safeguards Are Urged He cautioned against performing abortions without essential safeguards. During the first trimester, the Court said, “the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.” “The state may define the term ‘physician’ ... to mean only a physician currently licensed by the state and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined,” the Court added. After the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the Court said, the state may intervene only to the extent of protecting maternal health by establishing requirements as to who can perform. the abortion and where. Only during the last trimester, and specifically during the last 10 weeks of the normal 40‐week pregnancy, can state regulation protect fetal life, the Court said. The Court's selection of this period was apparently based on the “potentiality of life” of a fetus during the last third of its gestation. Dr. Christopher Tietze of the Population Council said that studies had shown that infants born weighing 2.2 pounds or less (about 28 weeks of pregnancy or younger) faced a 95 per cent chance of dying within the first month after birth. After that, he said, the chances of survival—which are on a continuum based on age and weight—increase rapidly, with more than 40 per cent of those weighing between 2.2 and 3.3 pounds surviving. Age Not Mentioned But even during the last Trimester, the Court said, abortions may be performed “to preserve the life or health of the mother.” Medical authorities assume that this would apply to such problems as abortions to prevent the birth of a child with a serious congenital defect. Such defects in some cases cannot be determined with certainty until pregnancy is far advanced. The Court's ruling said nothing about the age at which a woman might obtain an abortion on her own consent. Mrs. Pilpel said that in the absence of specific legislation enabling minors to consent to an abortion, a state's law applying to medical treatment generally would also apply to abortion. Whatever the final outcome of the Supreme Court's decision, observers believe that it is certain to fall into place a lot sooner than it would have if the Court's ruling had come three years ago, before passage of New York's abortion law. This law gave tremendous momentum to lay and professional groups throughout the country who sought to make safe, inexpensive abortions readily available to women. According to Dr. Moody, these groups can now use their organizations to set up abortion services in their own states. REMEMBER THE NEEDIEST!"
Respect for Privacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/24/archives/respect-for-privacy.html,"The Supreme Court has made a major contribution to the preservation of individual liberties and of free decision‐making by its invalidation of state laws inhibiting a woman's right to obtain an abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The Court's seven‐to‐two ruling could bring to an end the emotional and divisive public argument over What always should have been an intensely private and personal matter. It will end that argument if those who are now inveighing against the decision as a threat to civilization's survival will pause long enough to recognize the limits of what the Court has done. It has not ordered any mother to have an abortion. It has left the decision where it belongs—to the woman and her physician—with the power of the state to interfere, at later stages of pregnancy, governed essentially by considerations of maternal health. The Court has performed a useful historical function by recalling that the spur for the initial adoption of state laws banning abortion nearly a century ago was the great risk of maternal death involved in the surgical procedures then used. Now the risk arises out of perpetuating such archaic statutory prohibitions. The effect of these laws has been to force women, especially the young and the poor, to resort to abortion mills instead of expert hospital care when they are determined not to have an unwanted child. The majority opinion by Justice Blackmun stops short of the absolutist view that a woman Is entitled to terminate her pregnancy whenever, however and why ever she alone chooses. Instead, it affirms the legitimate interest of the state in putting such limits on that right of privacy as are needed in advanced phases of gestation to safeguard health, maintain medical standards or protect potential life. In the process, the Court wisely avoids the quicksand of attempting a judicial pronouncement on precisely when life begins, an endeavor that has long baffled scientists, theologians and philosophers. Nothing in the Court's approach ought give affront persons who oppose all abortion for reasons of religion or individual conviction. They can stand as firmly as ever for those principles, provided they do not seek to impede the freedom of those with an opposite view. President Nixon, who intervened so gratuitously last year in an effort to upset New York State's liberal abortion law, can exercise a healing role now by acting uphold the Court's, ruling. In so doing he would be following the admirable precedent set by President Eisenhower nearly two decades ago in backing the Supreme Court's school desegregation decision, despite his own private reservations. The Court's verdict on abortions provides a sound foundation for final and reasonable resolution of a debate that has divided America too long. As with the division over Vietnam, the country will be healthier with that division ended."

However, some supporters and some critics of the Vietnam policies of two administrations sought to draw from President Nixon's announcement fresh justification for their opposite viewpoints in the long dispute that divided Congress and the nation. [1:5.] President Nguyen Van Thieu declared today that he considered the Paris peace accord only as a cease‐fire that did not guarantee “a stable, long‐lasting peace,” and said that “in the days to come we'll see if the Com. munists will observe the agreement.” [1:4.] In an assessment of the impact of the Vietnam war on American life, James Reston writes that one thing is fairly clear: “There has been a sharp decline in respect for authority in the United States as a result of the war—not only a decline in respect for the civil authority of government, but for the moral authority of the schools, the universities, the press, the church and even the family.” [1:6–7.] International The United States and Japan announced a major consolidation of American military bases in Japan. United States officials said it would not significantly reduce American forces or impair American military operations in Japan, and the officials indicated that the United States would keep large bases and forces in Japan for at least five more years and probably longer. [2:4–5.] The Soviet Union followed up publication of its controversial immigration law by making public the regulations and scale of fees to be paid by emigrants as reimbursement for a free higher education. The tax duties ostensibly apply to all emigrants, but critics believe that they are directed mainly at Jews wishing to emigrate. [2:4–6.] National Thousands of Texans filed past the coffin of Lyndon B. Johnson as his body lay in state in the huge library that bears his name at the University of Texas in Austin. Mr. Johnson will be buried tomorrow afternoon at the LBJ ranch, 75 miles west of Austin, after a funeral service in Washington. His body will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda today. President Nixon announced that tomorrow would be a national day of mourning and that all Federal offices would be closed. [1:2–3.] Before it is completed on tomorrow afternoon, the country's second Presidential funeral in less than a month will have involved several thousand Americans, in and out of uniform, and spread itself grandly across. half a continent. Each element of the 36th President's last rites represents nearly five years of planning by the Army as well as feverish and frequently frantic last‐minute scrambling. [22:1–2.] A witness said that $199,000 had been paid to a defendant in the Watergate trial in Washington during last year's campaign with the approval of former Attorney General John N. Mitchell and former Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stars. The money was said to have gone to G. Gordon Liddy, a lawyer for President Nixon's campaign organization, who had been assigned to establish what another witness described as “an intelligence gathering operation.” [1:1] Metropolitan New Jersey legislative reapportionment officials reported that they were “reasonably optimistic” that they could agree on a compromise bipartisan redistricting plan for this year's legislative elections. A member of the state apportionment commission said that it had overcome a number of major problems and that an agreement was possible within two weeks. Last May, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the existing districts were unconstitutional. [45:7–8.] Federal narcotics agents, working closely with their French counterparts, smashed a major operation that smuggled some 575 pounds of heroin from France to the United States over the last three years, the Govvernment announced. The heroin's street value was estimated at $65‐million. [81:1–7.] The Other News Vietnam Pathet Lao condemns U.S. role in Laos. Page 16 “Initialing” signals concurrence on text.

Belgian Doctor in Abortion Case Gaining Support,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/25/archives/belgian-doctor-in-abortion-case-gaining-support-rally-set-for.html,"BRUSSELS, Jan. 24—A strong wave of support has developed in Belgium for a gynecologist and leading fighter for liberalization of the abortion laws, who was arrested Jan. 17 on charges of performing more than 300 abortions between April and December, 1972. Dr. Willy Peers, 48 years old, head of the Center of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the province of Namur, was reported to have performed most of the operations during evenings at his clinic, under the guise of treating miscarriages. Justice officials in Dinant began an examination of his case when they learned that he had operated on a mentally retarded girl who had been raped. They then confiscated his private files, which contained hundreds of releases signed by women upon whom he had operated. Rally Set for Saturday Dr. Peers, who gained a wide reputation for his efforts to introduce classes of preparation for childbirth, is a cofounder of the Belgium Society to Legalize Abortion. His case has drawn support from many levels of the predominantly Catholic Belgian society. A coalition of academic, medical and feminist groups has created an ad hoc defense committee and has planned a rally in the city of Namur for Saturday. It hopes to collect 100,000 signatures on a petition demanding the doctor's release. Last weekend, the Frenchspeaking section of the Socialist party expressed support for Dr. Peers and the right to abortion. Many politicians frmm other parties have voiced support for him. trial as a forum for a full airing of the laws, which provide The only statement against him so far was made by the Catholic doctors' society. At his trial, expected to open in Liege next week, his lawyers are expected to cite Dr. Peers's idealism and the fact that he charged no extra fees for the operations. Doctors Face 20 Years So far, support for the doctor's arrest has been mainly from Catholic groups, including the Catholic Doctors' Association and the main antiabortion group, Pro Vita. But even the Catholic ranks are divided. The Namur chapter of the National Catholic Family Care organization, though it has not directly supported Dr. Peers, has called for reform of the abortion laws, and some Catholic youth groups have taken similar stands. Judicial authorities are apparently preparing to use the a maximum of five years in jail for women who undergo abortions, and 20 years for the doctors. Present law prohibits abortion except when the mother's life would be endangered by having the child. There is a proposal before Parliament to make abortions legal in cases of rape or incest, and to eliminate penalties for women who have abortions. In the last five years, about 300 people have drawn jail terms under the abortion laws, including five doctors. Nevertheless, the most conservative estimate is that 30,000 abortions are performed annually in Belgium, compared with 50,000 births. Those in the movement to liberalize the laws believe they can use the Peers case to develop public opinion against the laws."
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/25/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-vietnam.html,"THURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 1973 The Major Events of the Day Vietnam Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday that the United States had a “firm expectation” that the Vietnam cease‐fire that goes into effect Saturday would soon extend to Cambodia and Laos. Speaking at a 90‐minute news conference, Mr. Kissinger outlined the details of the accord and forcefully presented the Administration's argument that it had secured a “fair and just” settlement, which could not have been achieved four years ago. [Page 1, Column 8; Text, P. 19.] Congressional leaders, including some leading opponents of the Vietnam war, gave President Nixon a standing ovation after a White House briefing on the truce. But some expressed concern that the peace might not last very long. [1:6–7.1 Le Duc Tho, Hanoi's chief negotiator, called the agreement a “great victory,” and said the final accord was “basically” the same as the draft agreement reached in October. Gesturing in triumph as he opened a news conference in Paris, Mr. Tho said, “It is a moment of joy.” [1:5; Text, P. 22.] The text of the agreement to be signed and take effect on Saturday covers such areas as the cease‐fire, prisoners of war, troop withdrawals and supervision. [P. 15.] The accord calls for the return of American prisoners of war to begin by mid‐February and to be completed by the end of March. [18:1–2.1. The provisions for the cease‐fire call for a complex series of truce‐supervisory teams and “no‐trespass” zones. The United States is to withdraw its last 23,700 troops from South Vietnam within 60 days. North Vietnam will be permitted to retain its force estimated at 145,000 in the South, but has agreed to send no replacements. [18:7–8.1 The political future of South Vietnam will rest in part on a fragile three‐part council made up of the Saigon Government, neutralists and the Provisional Revolutionary Government, which will be charged with organizing elections and settling all internal matters. [18:3–6.] A spokesman said the Saigon government was prepared to meet with the National Liberation Front as soon as the cease‐fire was signed on Saturday. [22:6–8.1 Normal bombing raids continued, but United States strikes are expected to taper off before the cease‐fire. [24:1–2.1 International The United States Ambassador to Haiti, Clinton E. Knox, was released unharmed after being held at gunpoint for nearly 20 hours in his residence. Ambassador Knox and Consul General Ward L. Christensen were released by their captors in exchange for the release of 12 Haitian prisoners and a $70,000 ransom. [1:1.] Nobody in Prague will confirm it, but talks between the United States and Czechoslovakia have apparently begun, ending a two‐year diplomatic impasse. [3:4–6.] National. The body of Lyndon Baines Johnson was borne in a solemn procession to the Capitol, where it lay in state in the Rotunda. President Nixon led the mourners at a brief ceremony before long lines began to file past the coffin on the second day of the funeral of the 36th President. [1:3.] For only the second time in this century the United States showed a deficit in foreign trade last year, and the 1972 total of $6A‐billion was more than three times as large as the first deficit in 1971. [1:2–3.] The Justice Department charged that blacks and other minorities have been discriminated against in filling vacancies in the Boston Fire Department. In a civil suit filed in Federal District Court in Boston, the Government asked for an injunction against the Massachusetts Civil Service Commission, the City of Boston and its fire commissioner to end the alleged discrimination. [ 9:1.] Metropolitan A list of sales by the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year reveals the disposal of five more important paintings, including a Renoir and a Boudin. In addition, it was learned that the prices the Metropolitan received for six modern French masters were far less than their appraised value. [1:1–2.] Wally's bar in Maspeth is where the construction workers stop off for a beer after a day on the job, and there is a “Support Our P.O.W.'s” banner on the telephone booth and a bartender who tells of killing in Vietnam. But in a sampling of opinion a day after peace was announced the two dozen men in Wally's said they were glad the war was over and couldn't recall a single good reason for ever fighting there.

Mrs. Abzug Spurs Bill to End All Abortion Laws,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/27/archives/mrs-abzug-spurs-bill-to-end-all-abortion-laws.html,"Representative Bella S. Abzug, speaking at a news conference called by the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, said yesterday that she would work to get through Congress a bill that would go further than the Supreme Court had in its recent decision upholding abortions. The Supreme Court on Monday overruled all state laws prohibiting or restricting abortions in the first three months but gave the states some rights to regulate abortion in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Mrs. Abzug, speaking at the Overseas Press Club, said that her bill, the Abortion Rights Act (H. R. 254), would “eliminate any state laws of any nature concerning the regulation of abortion.” Lee Gidding, executive director of the association, said the organization would recommend to its affiliates across the country that they find legislative sponsors to submit bills repealing abortion laws. Assemblyman Franz S. Leichter, Democrat‐Liberal of Manhattan, said that although New York had one of the most liberal abortion laws, there were still some restrictive laws on the books. He said he would “work vigorously” to get the Legislature to pass a bill removing any existing state laws covering abortion. The repeal of such laws would then make abortion a matter between a woman and her doctor. Lawrence Lader, chairman of the association, said the organization was not advocating that women had the right to have abortions in late months of pregnancy. When a woman can have an abortion, he said, should he regulated by medical societies and health codes, not by the state."

Kissinger promised members of Congress yesterday that the Administration would consult them before making any firm commitments to North Vietnam on postwar aid programs. On the eve of the formal signing in Paris of the Vietnam cease‐fire accord, Mr. Kissinger made an unusual trip to the Capitol to brief Senators and Representatives on the agreement's terms. [Page 1, Column 1.] Polish and Canadian diplomats in Saigon said they were doubtful that the international commission that will supervise the ceasefire in South Vietnam would be able to establish a functioning headquarters within the time specified in the peace agreement's protocols. The protocols require that the headquarters “shall be operational and in place within 24 hours after the cease‐fire,” beginning at 8 A.M. Sunday Saigon time. [1:2.] Communist troops were reported to have launched an attack on the city of Tay Ninh, about 55 miles west of Saigon, early today as the deadline for the Vietnam cease‐fire, scheduled for tomorrow, drew near. [1.1]. For most of the people of South Vietnam, the end of the war—if it is the end of their war—is coming far too late for rejoicing. Few Vietnamese can recall when the war began, and most have spent the largest part of their lives at war. With about a million Vietnamese dead, there is scarcely a family without at least one missing member. [1:2–4.] National President Nixon, according to Democratic Congressional leaders, will ask Congress on Monday to approve a $268.7‐billion budget for the fiscal year 1974. The Democrats, while indicating their willingness to hold Federal spending to the level proposed by the White House, promised a battle to determine how the money should be allocated. The President, the White House announced, will discuss his budget in a radio address at 6 P.M. tomorrow. [1:8.] The Nixon Administration confirmed that it planned to abolish the Office of Economic Opportunity, the antipoverty agency established by President Johnson as one of the chief features of his Great Society. Roy L. Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget, also said that three smaller agencies would be abolished—the Office of Emergency Preparedness, the Office of Science and Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Council. [1:6–7.] Evidence that $199,000 in campaign funds had been paid to a defendant in the Watergate trial in Washington with the approval of two ranking Presidential advisers was read to the jury. Chief Judge John J. Sirica of the Federal District Court summoned the panel to hear a transcript of his examination on Tuesday of Hugh J. Sloan Jr., former treasurer of the Finance Committee to ReElect the President. [1:6–7.] William Matthew Byrne Jr., the judge in the Pentagon papers trial in Los Angeles, said flatly from the bench that the Government had its own secret studies showing that publication of some of the papers did not at all affect the national defense. This could lead to the dismissal of some of the counts against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo Jr., the defendants, or at least enable their lawyers to eventually go before the jury with the Government's documents to prove that the national defense was not affected. [1:3–4.] Metropolitan Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy announced that he would assign 1,000 extra tours of duty to policemen in 11 precincts in the Brooklyn North Command for the next 30 days to safeguard the community following the ambush shooting of two policemen in Brownsville Thursday night. The policemen on these tours will be volunteers and mostly plainclothesmen, and will drive in unmarked cars. [1:5.] A stringent 23‐point bill to regulate group medical practitioners and curb abuses in the city's $1.2‐billion‐a‐year Medicaid program was introduced in the City Council. According to its sponsor, Councilman Leon A. Katz, a Brooklyn Democrat, the legislation is aimed at saving $200‐million to $400‐million in “unnecessary and wasted” Medicaid funds. It has the backing of the Council leadership. [1:5.6.] A partially decomposed body believed to be that of Emanuel Gambino, nephew of Carol Gambino, the reputed Mafia boss, was found in a four‐foot grave in Colts Neck, N.J., by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.

[1:6‐7.] William Matthew Byrne Jr., the judge in the Pentagon papers trial in Los Angeles, said flatly from the bench that the Government had its own secret studies showing that publication of some of the papers did not at all affect the national, defense. This could lead to the dismissal of some of the counts against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo Jr., the defendants, or at least enable their lawyers to eventually go before the jury with the Government's documents to prove that the national defense was not affected.

Murphy announced that he would assign 1,000 extra tours of duty to policemen in 11 precincts in the Brooklyn North Command for the next 30 days to safeguard the community following the ambush shooting of two policemen in Brownsville Thursday night. The policemen on these tours will be volunteers and mostly plainclothesmen, and will drive in unmarked cars. [1:5.] A stringent 23‐point bill to regulate group. medical practitioners and curb abuses in the city's $1.2‐billion‐a‐year Medicaid program was introduced in the City Council.

It has the backing of the Council leadership.

Cobble Hill Is Examining The Concerns of Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/cobble-hill-is-examining-the-concerns-of-women.html,"For the next four months, an Anglican church in Brooklyn will be the scene of weekly workshops on issues of concern to women. Organized and staffed by residents of Cobble Hill, the Women's Interests Symposium is aimed at taking “an objective look at the issues facing women.” The symposiums began this month with introductions to consciousness raising. “The fact that we began in January with consciousness raising and end in May with workshops on divorce shouldn't scare anyone off,” Nancy Gould, a symposium organizer, said with a laugh. “That's just the way the order worked out.” The last introductory session will be held next Tuesday. In February, Florence Adams, author of a book on carpentry and WBAI radio personality, will teach home repair and car technology. In March, a registered nurse will guide the series on women's health — from feelings about sexuality to the issues of birth control and abortion. April will be devoted to career guidance, and May to divorce workshops, led by Carol Bellamy, the newly elected Democratic State Senator from Brooklyn. The Rev. Luis Quiroga, vicar of Christ Church and Holy Family, the Anglican Church at 362 Clinton Street, where the workshops meet, said his parishioners were “happy to open their doors” to the symposium. Proceeds from admission charges will benefit a neighborhood summer day camp in the church. Admission to Tuesday's introductory session is $4. Each monthly series thereafter costs $8. Workshops are held Tuesdays at 8 P.M. in the parish house. To inquire phone 624‐6221 until 4 P.M."
Peking Is Pressing New Campaign to Control Births,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/peking-is-pressing-new-campaign-to-control-births-grain-production.html,"HONG KONG, Jan. 27—A new birth control drive is under way in China, where the population is believed to be increasing by more than 15 million each year. The drive is aimed at reducing China's population growth by persuading young men and women to marry late and by increasing the use of contraceptives. In a work report at a conference in Hupeh Province, Tseng Ssu‐yu, first secretary of the provincial Communist party committee, declared: “We must pay attention to and carry out propaganda for late marriage and family planning.” A broadcast from Wuhan, the capital of Hupeh, said the conference had called on party officials to “take the lead in practicing birth control.” Grain Production Down In Szechwan Province, a meeting called by the provincial Revolutionary Committee in preparation for a national birth control work conference directed officials to “wash away the influence of erroneous ideas, such as many children means lots of happiness.” The new drive may reflect official concern over the pressure of population growth on China's food reserves because it follows a drop in the nation's grain production last year. Peking reported that the output of grain fell from 250 million tons in 1971 to 240 million tons in 1972. Informed sources here said that in Peking the monthly rice ration had been reduced by several pounds. The sources said that the rice ration for Canton residents was reduced 6.6 per cent on Jan. 1. Recent broadcasts have stressed the importance of saving grain “in preparation for war and natural disasters.” Mao Tse‐tung, Chairman of the Chinese Communist party, gave new impetus to this established practice in a New Year directive calling on the people to “dig tunnels deep” and “store grain everywhere.” Chinese officials have estimated that the country's population is 700 million to 800 million. Some years ago, Premier Chou En‐lai said that China's aim was to reduce the rate of population growth to less than 2 per cent, but last year he told an interviewer that it was still around 2 per cent throughout most of the country. This means that if China's population was 750 million at the beginning of 1972, it had increased by 15 million at the year's end. The Communist authorities officially frowned on birth control in their early years in power and, even though the Government instructed the Ministry of Public Health to “assist the public in birth control” after the 1953 census, this was not made public until 1957. ‘For the Revolution’ Subsequently, there have been periodic campaigns to popularize birth control, and travelers report that contraceptive pills and a form of intrauterine device are freely available. Abortions are easily available. Some Chinese in Hong Kong have gone to Canton to take advantage of the abortion facilities there. Nevertheless, according to the Szechwan meeting, there still exists a need to “establish the new ideology and habit of practicing birth control for the revolution.” Assessing the work of birth control in 16 municipalities and regions in the province, the meeting found that there had been both achievements and “discrepancies.” It asserted that a “new miss practice of birth control and promotion of late marriage” was arising “everywhere in the province.” But it also called for the further application of “Chairman Mao's instructions on birth control.” According to a broadcast from Chengtu, the provincial capital, the Szechwan meeting “demanded that party committees at all levels put birth control work on their agenda,” and that the province “rapidly train a red and expert technical force serving the people wholeheartedly.” The province must also “seriously implement contraceptive measures, popularize new midwifery methods and check on and cure diseases of women,” the meeting concluded. It added: “All places should also do a good job of conducting propaganda on and administering oral contraceptives and make a success of producing and supplying drugs to meet the needs of unfolding birth control work.”"
The Court Landmark Ruling on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/landmark-ruling-on-abortion-the-effect-will-be-farreaching.html,"The issue has been as sensitive and emotional as any in, the realm of justice, provoking mass picketing, vitriolic rhetoric — even a strong stand by the President himself. Last week the Supreme Court exercised its extra‐ordinary powers to improvise a solution to the abortion dispute that pleased some, infuriated others and surprised almost everyone. The seven justices in the majority came up with a three‐part formula that looked a good deal more like legislation than adjudication. Its practical effect: a wholesale repeal of most anti‐abortion laws in the 46 out of 50 states where they now exist. States may only prohibit abortions, Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the majority, during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, after the fetus has become “viable” or likely to survive on its own if prematurely delivered. In the normal course of events, few pregnant women wart that long. Prior to this final two months or so, a state may only attach such regulations to a legalized abortion plan as are designed to protect the health of the mother. And during the first three months, the Court specified, the patient and the doctor are free to determine “without regulation by the state” that an abortion should take place and that determination “may be effectuated...free of interference by the state.” Politically, the decision flew in the face of President Nixon's publicly expressed opposition to liberalized abortion laws. Yet three of the four Justices he had named to the High Court —Warren E. Burger, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Mr. Blackmun—voted with the majority, which based its decision on the constitutional right to privacy, a concept that has evolved out of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process of law. The seven Justices rejected the “right to life” theory that the fetus is a person with enforceable legal rights — recognizing only a “potentiality of human life” during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy. Only William H. Rehnquist among the Nixon judges joined Byron R. White in the two‐man dissent. Under the decision, almost every state legislature will have to revise its abortion laws to conform. Until they do, there will be no restrictions at all in most jurisdictions, and the Supreme. Court's ruling will bar enforcement of any stricter law. Response from the anti‐abortion forces, traditionally led by the Roman Catholic Church, was bitter, angry and outspoken. One right‐wing Catholic laymen's group, The Society for the Christian Commonwealth, even called for the excommunication of Justice William J. Brennan for his support of the majority. —WARREN WEAVER Jr. The Effect Will Be Far‐reaching The full impact of the Supreme Court's sweeping decision on abortion may not be felt for a generation or more. But experts expect it to contribute to basic changes in the nature and extent of population growth... the stability of family life...the role of women in society the health and welfare of women and children... even the methods of delivering health care. Their predictions, although partly founded in intuition, are largely based on several major studies conducted in recent years and on what has happened in New York City since July 1970 when the nation's most liberal abortion law took effect—a law that conforms in most important respects to the Court's ruling last week. •Population. The National Fertility Study of 1965 showed that at least one–fifth of all births to married women that occurred during the preceding six‐year period were “unwanted”—births that presumably would not have occurred had the couples had perfect control over their fertility; and that two–fifths of the “wanted” births were “timing failures”—children born sooner than the parents would have liked. A restudy in 1970 showed some reduction, but not elimination, of unwanted births and timing failures. Dr. Norman Ryder, Princeton sociologist and a director of the fertility studies, said the abortion ruling “may well make the difference” in how soon the population reaches a stable size. But the effect of abortion on population growth, he noted, will depend entirely on how many children women want to have. •Stability of family life. New York's experience indicates that readily available abortion will have an important impact on illegitimate births. Just eight months into the New York law, statis ticians noticed a drop in births to unmarried women—the first such decline since 1954, when the city began recording illegitimate births. This decline in illegitimacy is expected to make it increasingly difficult to obtain adoptable babies. Another consequence: Since many young people marry to legitimate conceptions, the abortion ruling could lead to a reduction in teenage marriages, which are twice as likely to end in divorce as those of older couples. •Women's role in society. Dr. Ryder said that legalized abortions probably will cut down on the number of girls forced by pregnancy to drop out of high school and college. A woman able to complete her education, he added, will have greater opportunities to develop “extra‐familial interests,” e.g. a career, which—besides fostering the goals of women's liberation—can be expected to reduce the size family she wants. Thus far, said Dr. Christopher Tietze, demographer with the Population Council, there is no sign in New York that the ready availability of abortion has made women careless about contraception. In fact, predicts Dr. Phillips Cutright, Indiana University sociologist and an expert on teenage sexuality, the abortion decision will lead to greater contraceptive use by teenagers. “Com munities, faced with pressure for increased abortions, will be more likely to make effective contraception broadly available to teenagers,” he said. •Health and welfare. New York's experience with legal abortion shows that it can have an important effect on health statistics. Maternal mortality —to which criminal abortion once contributed heavily—has fallen markedly since the state law took effect, with 28 per cent drop in pregnancy‐associated deaths during the first two years. Infant deaths dropped as births to “high‐risk” women—the unmarried, the poor, the older mothers—declined through legalized abortion to 20.3 per 100,000 live births in the first six months of 1972—an all‐time low. •Health care. The state's abortion law has spurred the establishment of non‐hospital approaches to medical care. The demonstration that abortions can be performed safely and at low cost in well‐equipped clinics may foster a move from hospital to clinic in other areas—childbirth, sterilization, some gynecological operations. Similarly, the extensive participation of lay persons in setting up abortion facilities has helped to confirm the role of the public in delivering health care—an outgrowth of consumerism that may one day change the entire face of American medicine."
...Seeds of the Future,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/seeds-of-the-future.html,"“Abroad and at home, the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism.” With these words, President Nixon has signaled his determination to place his conservative stamp on the next four years. And last week, there were new indications of the tensions this may hold for the future: Restructuring of the White House bureaucracy to bring the reins more tightly under Presidential control . . . signs of Congressional discontent as Democrats, joined by an increasing number of Republicans, sought ways to curb Presidential power (above, Mr. Nixon delivers the 1972 State of the Union message) . . . a decision by the Supreme Court that, in effect, called for a wholesale repeal of most state anti‐abortion laws—a decision that flew in the face of Mr. Nixon's expressed views."
The Sex Revolution Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/the-sex-revolution-problem-observer.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 27—H. P. Podsimmer of Old Puling, Conn., writes us about a problem that has arisen at his house in connection with the sexual revolution. He wants advice which this column, mired as it is in the anden sex regime, is unable to give. Readers who wish to be helpful may send advice to this column. It will be forwarded under plain cover. “As soon as the sexual revolution began,” writes Mr. Podsimmer, “my wife and I flung ourselves into the cause which, believe me, was not easy considering the variety of other causes to which we were then devoted. “My wife, Bessie, was into the A.C.L.U., the peace movement and the drives to legalize pot and abortion; and I was struggling with an 8 per cent mortgage, which meant I had to keep the big boys at the company persuaded that even though I might be a shade over thirty, I could still cut the mustard. As a result of this necessity, I was into three martinis at lunch and those chemical shirts with gigantic collars that need a necktie knot as big as a fist. “I mention this last only because these fashionable chemical shirts make me sweat heavily. (Notice that I say ‘sweat’ now instead of ‘perspire.’ I couldn't have done that before the sexual revolution.) After three martinis had combined with the intense sweating brought on by the youthful chemical shirts, I was exhausted. The last thing I wanted to face when I got home tired in the evening was a sexual revolution. “I told this to Bessie when the revolution began. ‘I'm disappointed in you, H. P.,’ she said. ‘When America had its leisure‐time problem, you were man enough to start listening to highbrow music. When America faced its physical fitness crisis, you didn't hesitate to get out and jog.’ “I knew what she was leading up to. She was going to accuse me of letting the country down. She was going to warn me that if I didn't accept the sexual revolution, I would soon give up chemical shirts and become indifferent to prison reform. “To make a long story short, I agreed to go along with the sexual revolution for the sake of the country and the children. We decided that Sunday would be ‘S. R. Day,’ as we called it, at the Podsimmer household. “At first the children seemed to enjoy it. Their wholesome laughter was truly something to warm a father's heart that first Sunday when I carved the leg of lamb in the nude. I had explained to them that grown people often felt an overpowering and perfectly healthy desire to take off their clothes and prance around in their pelts, and that if there was ever to be justice and love in this old world we had to quit being ashamed of our bodies and learn to carve the roast in the nude even if it did make us feel like fools. OBSERVER “Afterwards we had a candid, completely unabashed discussion of the Oedipus complex and subconscious bestiality yearnings concealed under the innocently simpering prose of ‘Heidi.’ “On subsequent Sundays we enjoyed frank, wholesome discussions of lesser‐known components of the reproductive organs such as the vas deferens and the epididymis. “Recently, however, things have begun to go badly. The change began, I think, when Billy, our youngest child, said he hadn't the slightest interest in the discussion of the corpus luteum about which we planned to have a good, sound, wholesome discussion over the Sunday fried chicken. “Carlotta, our oldest, said she didn't either. She was sure, she said, that the corpus luteum was sound, healthy and wholesome, that it was nothing to he ashamed about, and that if we could all face it honestly we would be better Americans. But the fact was, she went on, that whatever was good for you tended, like spinach, to be uninteresting. If we had to have sex every Sunday, she inquired, why could we not move ahead to stag movies? “Next Sunday Bessie and I showed stag movies while pointing out in running commentaries how this sort of material debased womanhood and reduced manhood to the level of beasthood through its sick, unwholesome, shame‐faced smirking. Though the children watched with interest the first few Sundays, after, a month or so they all said that dull as the corpus luteum might be, it was less tiresome than the psychological depression which Bessie and I produced with our lectures about the bad hygiene of obmovies. “Then, a few Sundays ago, Billy demanded to know why everybody had to talk about sex every Sunday. ‘That's right,’ Carlotta said. ‘Sex is even more boring than spinach.’ Little Melva said, ‘I hate sex, Daddy. Why don't we ever talk about mass murders?’ “From all this, you can see my problem. I want to know how to keep my family in step with the sexual revolution without making sex as depressing as looking for a downtown parking space.”"
Experts Ponder Legal Questions Posed by Advances in Medicine,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/experts-ponder-legal-questions-posed-by-advances-in-medicine-many.html,"A pregnant woman is screened for abnormalities in her unborn child and one is found, an abnormality often associated with criminal behavior. Must she have an abortion? Should a convicted murderer be required to undergo ai brain operation that reduces antisocial activity? May a hyperkinetic child be given amphetaniines because his teacher says he distracts his classmates and amphetamines will calm him down? The advances of biomedicine, mounting inexorably and in great numbers, raise these questions and countless others. But there are few answers—at least, few answers that carry the force of law. For while biomedicine has been developing—with organ transplants, prenatal testing, behaviormodifying drugs—public policy and law have not. Many Questions Posed About 100 lawyers and doctors and theoreticians gathered here recently for a two‐day conference on law and the life sciences. The meeting was billed as a workshop, and sometimes the speakers suggested policies and answers. But questions predominated both in the speeches from the podium and in the hallways of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York building, where the conference was held at a cost of $150 a participant. At the end of the second day, Prof. Paul A. Freund of the Harvard Law School, one of the country's preeminent legal scholars, spoke of genetics and commented thus: “These are moral questions, and as Einstein said, ‘Physics is so much easier than politics.’” A fellow Harvard law professor, Milton Katz, noted earlier that day that the problems raised by the new medical technology were “broad questions of societal policy” rather than technical legal or medical points. How these questions are to be approached, let alone resolved, he said, is still unanswered. The meeting was sponsored by the American Institute of Law‐American Bar Association Joint Committee on Continuing Legal Education and the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences of Hastings, N. Y. The meeting's basic concern, as the chairman described it, was “whether the interests of society should be reflected in the decisions which in the past traditionally have been made between doctor and patient.” The traditional role of medicine has been “helping man to cope with his environment,” said the chairman, Prof. Harold P. Green of George Washington University National Law Center. But now, he said, “it is becoming possible to alter the nature of man—now it can improve man.” “Can we—should we—improve man?” he asked, as the conference opened. “And who is going to decide what constitutes ‘improvement’?” The conference focused on three areas of the “new technology” of medicine: organ transplants and artificial organs; behavior modification and control and intervention in genetic processing. In each case one speaker described the medical advances to date, another raised the ethical issues, a third discussed the possible legal complications. In the area of organs, at least, the audience heard, there has been some legal development: all 50 states have passed the “uniform anatomical gift act,” which erases much of the redtape formerly involved in organ donation. The area of behavior control, through such techniques as shock treatments, drugs and surgery, raises questions that pertain to “the autonomy of man, the nature of freedom, the price of coercion,” said Dr. Willard Gaylin, professor at Columbia University's law and medical schools. Another speaker, Prof. Harold S. H. Edgar of Columbia Law School, noted that there was no specific law on the subject and suggested there was a need for stringent controls. “No one knows,” he said, “how many psycho‐surgical operations have been done and are being done.” Genetics Not Covered In the area of genetics, too, said still another speaker, Daniel M. Singer, “There is as yet no body of law.” Most lawyers have “implicit faith that it will develop,” said Mr. Singer, a Washington lawyer, “but they have no idea how or what.” At the same time, though, Mr. Singer said that the law “can't wait” for doctors to complete their research and for policy makers to resolve the broad social issues. Judges will be presented with lawsuits, he predicted—such as a malpractice case brought by a woman whose doctor said the prenatal tests showed no defects and who then gave birth to a baby with Down's syndrome—and they will have to decide them. In the field of genetics, moreover, there are some particularly delicate problems. As Dr. Robert F. Murray Jr. of Howard University described it, science now has various ways of predicting some hereditary diseases. But, he said, “the majority of people prefer not to take these tests.” And if science gets to the point where a prenatal examination can pinpoint specific “structural” defects in the unborn child, he said, another problem arises: “What kind of abnormality would one choose —a cleft palate, a club foot?—before recommending abortion?”"
Gallup Poll Finds Public Divided On Abortions in First 3 Months,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/gallup-poll-finds-public-divided-on-abortions-in-first-3-months.html,"Although the United States Supreme Court has given broad sanction to abortions, the American public is about equally divided on whether abortions ought to be permitted in the first three months of pregnancy, the Gallup Poll reported yesterday. In a survey taken well before the Court's ruling last Monday, the public was found to be 46 per cent in favor of legalized abortions, 45 per cent opposed and 9 per cent undecided. But the results also reflected an increase in support for legalized abortion over three years ago In 1969, the Gallup Poll reported, 40 per cent of those interviewed favored legalization, 50 per cent opposed it and 10 per cent had no opinion. The shift since 1969 came almost entirely among persons under 50 years old. Protestants and Roman Catholics increased their support; 45 per cent of the Protestants and 36 per cent of the Catholics interviewed favored legalization. Men were found 49 per cent in favor and women, 44 per cent; three years ago, 40 per cent of both men and women favored legalization. Among persons with college education, 63 per cent favored legalization; high school, 44 per cent; grade school, 30 per cent. The survey was based on personal interviews from Dec. 8 to 11 with 1,504 adults, 18 and older, in more than 300 localities around the country. The question asked was, “Would you favor or oppose a law which would permit a woman to go to a doctor to end pregnancy at any time during the first three months?” The Supreme Court overruled all state laws that prohibit or restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion in the first three months of pregnancy."
Hospitals Prepare for 1.6 Million Abortions Annually,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/28/archives/hospitals-prepare-for-16-million-abortions-annually-safe-in-first.html,"In the wake of the Supreme Court's sweeping decision on abortion last week, medical facilities around the country have, begun preparing to treat an estimated total of 1.6 million American women a year who will seek to terminate prtriancies. A number of hospitals have announced plans to expand their capacity to perform abortions. In Boston, for example, the Boston General Hospital for Women said that it would exIts resources to meet the sharp increase expected in abortions at the facility. At Fairview and FairviewSouthdale hospitals in Minneapolis, administrators are working on policies and procedures to meet the expected rise in abortions. Recommendations will be presented within a month, a spokesman for the two hospitals said. Owners of some New York City abortion clinics are exploring the possibility of establishing similar facilities in other metropolitan areas. Planned Parenthood ‐ World Population said that in addition to establishing abortion clinics at some of its affiliates around the country, it would set up a nationwide telephone referral service. The National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws said it would hold re gional workshops on each coast and in the Middle West to teach doctors how to do abortions and how to set up abortion facilities. But experts on abortion said that, in addition to educating doctors, most of whom have had little experience with abortion, women must be taught what an abortion is all about to be, sure they obtain the safeest possible procedures under the best possible circumstances. The legal distinctions are especially important, doctors say, in light of the legacy of adverse physical and emotional aftereffects left by centuries of criminal abortions. Safe in First 12 Weeks The Supreme Court's ruling said that no state can interfere with a woman's right to obtain an abortion during the first trimester (first 12 weeks) of pregnancy. During the second trimester, the state may intervene only to the extent of imposing regulations to safeguard the hbalth of women seeking abortions. During the last third of pregnancy, the Court said, a state may prohibit abortions except when the mother's life or health is at stake. A legal abortion performed by a well‐trained physician during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy has been found to be one of the safest surgical procedures. In New York City, under a liberal abortion law, such early abortions have been associated with less than two deaths for every 100,000 operations. Tonsillectomies, by comparison, have a death rate of 17 per 100,000, and the death rate associated with a full‐term pregnancy, delivery and postnatal period is more than 20 per 100,000. On the other hand, abortion, even early abortion, is not safer than contraception, Dr. Christopher Tietze, an associate director of the Population Council, emphasized in an interview last week. Warns of Danger Dr. Tietze, who is an international expert on abortion, warned that “a woman who throws contraception to the winds and relies solely on abortion to prevent unwanted births would need at least one abortion a year.” The risk of death associated with abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy—between 13 and 27 weeks after the start of the last menstrual period—is nearly nine times greater than the risk of an early abortion. Complications other than death are also more common in late‐in‐pregnancy abortions. Dr. Tietze and his wife, Sarah Lewitz, who conducted the first major study of legal abortions in the United States, found that complications occurred three to four times more often following late abortions. The study, the Joint Program for the Study of Abortion (commonly referred to as the “Jipsa” study), involved nearly 73,000 ‐abortions performed in hospitals' and clinics around the country. Minor complications of abortion include retention of part of the placenta, fever and small Mood loss. Major complications may include hemorrhage, serious pelvic infection, and blood clot. One in 10 patients in the Jipsa study experienced one or more complications, with major ones occurring in one‐tenth that number. Two Techniques One of two techniques is usually used to terminate a pregnancy during the first 12 weeks. The “D and C” (dilation and curettage or uterine scraping, which gynecologists are already familiar with) involves stretching the cervix to accommodate a spoon‐shaped knife that scrapes out the uterine contents. But the classic D and C is rapidly yielding to a newer, safer technique developed in China—a kind of uterine “vacuuming” known as suction curettage. Following dilation of the cervix, a small glass or plastic tube is inserted into the uterus and the contents are sucked into a jar by a vacuum pump. Both of these procedures are nearly always done with some anesthesia, usually local but sometimes general. The suction method takes only a few minutes, the D and C, about 10 minutes to half an hour. In a well‐organized facility, an overnight stay is rarely necessary. Between the 13th and 16th weeks of pregnancy, there is a medical never‐never land during which doctors find any method of abortion relatively unsafe. At that time the uterus becomes very thin and soft and can easily be pierced unwittingly by the doctor's instruments. After the 15th week of pregnancy, the most common procedure used—the saline abortion of “salting out”—involves removal of some of the amniotic fluid in which the fetus floats. Then, with an enlarged hypodermic needle inserted through the abdomen, the fluid is replaced by a salt solution. This kills the fetus and stimulates the start of a miscarriage, which usually follows within 24 to 48 hours. In rare cases of late abortions, or when the saline technique failes to cause miscarriage, the doctor may have to resort to a hysterotomy, a major operation done under general anesthesia that is akin to a Caesarean section. A hysterotomy must always be performed in a hospital, and New York City experience shows that the “salting out” is also best handled in a hospital setting, according to Dr. Jean Pakter, director of maternity services for the city's Health Department. Safety in Clinics However, Dr. Pakter said, a suction abortion and, to a lesser degree, a D and C can be performed safely either in a hospital outpatient clinic or in a well‐organized abortion clinic equipped with laboratory facilities and emergency equipment, such as a resuscitator and a blood supply. A clinic should also have a backup hospital a few minutes away to handle occasional emergency cases, he said. “It is wasteful, possibly dangerous and probably more costly to do abortions in a doctor's office,” Dr. Tietze said. He and Dr. Pakter cautioned against interpreting the Su preme Court's decision to mean that abortions can be done safely in doctors' offices or in hastily equipped clinics. Since the Court said that the state cannot intervene in the first trimester of pregnancy but after that it can impose certain restrictions to safeguard maternal health, legal experts have interpreted the ruling to mean that such safeguards cannot be imposed for early abortions. Because of Health Code Dr. Pakter declared that the good safety record that has accompanied legal abortions in New York City has been a result in large part of requirements imposed by health code regulations, which have been applied to both early and late abortions. Dr. Tietze and others emphasized that in addition to considering the physical setup in which an abortion is performed, doctors must also take into account the psychological climate. While countless studies here and abroad have long ago disproved the notion that abortion leaves serious and often permanent emotional scars, there is no question that it is an emotionally distressing experience for most women. Abortion clinics in and around New York have found that a relaxing atmosphere, often using women counselors to deal openly with the patient's fears and questions, helps to avert emotional trauma. In general, the most common reaction to abortion is a temporary feeling of depression or sense of loss. The guilt and shame that often accompanies clandestine criminal abortions rarely applies when the procedure is done legally in an appropriate setting, doctors have found."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/29/archives/letters-to-the-editor-imposing-standards-for-auto-pollutant.html,"To the Editor: Your Jan. 19 editorial “Deadline for Detroit—I” states that it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Government to grant a one‐year extension to the automobile manufacturers in their efforts to meet pollutant emission standards now required for 1975 and succeeding models. Such an extension would have serious repercussions on the economic and social fabric of New York City. New York State and New York City have jointly submitted for public consideration, as required by the Federal Clean Air Act, an implementation plan for meeting clean air standards in New York City for those pollutants related to vehicle operation by 1977. The plan includes proposals to limit the cruising of taxicabs in midtown, to require emission control devices on trucks, to require regular inspections of trucks, taxicabs and private cars, to reduce sharply the available parking spaces in midtown, to stagger work hours and days, to enforce strictly all existing traffic regulations, as well as a number of other proposals to ease the flow of goods and people. Many of these proposals have already been attacked as too repressive. However, a major strategy in the proposed plan, one that accounts for 50 per cent of the required 85 per cent reduction in carbon monoxide, is that vehicle turnover—the replacement of old cars by new ones—will be accomplished with cars that meet the 1975 standards. If, as you suggest, the 1975 deadline is extended, there will be no hope for New Yorkers to breathe the clean air to which they are entitled by 1977 without far more stringent measures being taken. These measures might include a total ban on private cars in midtown, plus much more restrictive controls on taxi and truck movements. Such steps would undoubtedly have adverse social and economic impact far greater than the current proposals. We therefore believe The Times' support for the manufacturers' fight for extension is extremely ill‐advised. You should know, further, that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's decision to deny extension was based in part on extensive testing carried out by the New York City Department of Air Resources that showed catalytic converters to be an entirely feasible device for extended service in congested urban driving conditions. In addition, most of the manufacturers have already indicated they can meet the '75 standards using this device. JEROME KRETCHMER N.Y.C. Environmental Protection Administrator FRED C. HART Commissioner, N.Y.C. Department of Air Resources New York, Jan. 19, 1973 On the Future of the Electoral College To the Editor: Recently The Times published a column by John A. Hamilton that discussed the future of the Electoral College. His concluding paragraph declal‐ed, “Well, we hope the time to clear away this constitutional clutter has come; we can hope so.” Following every Presidential election suggestions pour forth calling for the elimination of our present system. The most prominent suggestion is to choose our leaders by direct popular vote. It might be well to look into the subject from other possible angles. ¶o change the system would require a constitutional amendment. To propose an amendment demands a two–thirds vote in both houses of Congress. It then must be by by the state legislatures, or by conventions called in the states for that purpose. Ratification requires approval by three–fourths of the fifty states. The Southern states, under the present system, have some influence on the outcome. The need to receive 270 electoral votes makes the wooing of these states imperative. A direct popular vote would place the Southern states outside the interest of the candidates as they work for success in the more populous states. ¶The state legislatures, under a kind of morale persuasion, have by similar laws accepted the “general ticket system.” The candidate winning a plurality or majority of the popular vote wins all the electoral votes of the state. ¶It is possible for the state legislatures to accept the “district system” This method, if the Congressional district lines were drawn to meet the Supreme Court's rules, could help meet the challenge to the “general ticket system.” Under the “district system” the elector is voted on in the Congressional district, Adding of the total popular vote in the state determines who receives the two electors assigned for the United States Senators. ¶Proposals have been offered that would continue to use the Electoral College system in a modified way. The Lodge‐Gossett Resolution was one that stirred considerable interest. Under this resolution the candidate would not be voted for by an elector. The electoral vote would be retained, but not cast by a person. A candidate would require only a plurality to win. Mr. Hamilton must realize that until we have an election in which the winner lost the popular vote change will be difficult. The elector from New York, who is quoted by Mr. Hamilton as having stated, “This might well be the last Electoral College,” will live to see more. JAMES J. FLYNN, Chairman, Department of History and Political Science, St. Francis College Brooklyn, Jan. 15, 1973 Press Council To the Editor: It is shocking and discouraging to find The Times does not see fit to cooperate with the Twentieth Century Fund's Press Council. Can it really be that The Times feels that the fulfillment of its journalistic obligation is not even a proper subject for inquiry by a body of impeccably objective sponsorship, proposed by an equally impeccable roster of practicing journalists? Or is it that The Times feels uncomfortable with the idea of a scrutiny of the objectivity of its news columns? And, if that is so, does The Times really feel that it has rights superior to other candidates for public support and favor, such as political candidates, the fairness of whose campaigns, with the ardent support of The Times, are subject to the overview of the Fair Campaign Practices Committee? Finally, one hears with dismay the faint note of hysteria in the publisher's charge that the press council “would function as investigator, prosecutor and judge rolled into one.” This is the rhetoric of fear and to use it with respect to a body which neither has nor professes to have any of those functions suggests a nagging fear by the publisher that The Times would not emerge unscathed from an impartial survey of its objectivity. FRANCIS A. O'CONNELL Jr. Stamford, Conn., Jan. 17, 1973 • To the Editor: Your decision not to have The Times associate itself with the Press Council was, I believe, the only sensible decision for the publisher of The Times to make. The Times sets the world's standard for completeness of coverage, fairness and striving for objectivity in reporting the news. Expressions of opinion in your editorial columns and in the contributions of your columnists are clearly and unmistakably recognizable as opinion. Your superb Op‐Ed page and your letters columns provide space for the most widely dissenting viewpoints. When errors in reporting do occur, or when expressions of columnists' opinion are based on a misunderstanding of the facts, the corrections are printed promptly and conspicuously, without any prodding from a Press Council. These standards of journalism are so inestimably higher than those of the average metropolitan newspaper, let alone those of lesser stature, that a decision to associate The Times with the proposed Press Council would represent a gratuitous gesture of selfbelittlement by The Times. As you imply, today's threat against freedom of information comes not from the press—not even from the few notoriously nonobjective newspapers whose partisan extremism is self‐canceling—but from the malevolence of a power‐crazed, paranoid national Administration and its willing imitators. SIDNEY LAUREN Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Jan. 18, 1973 • Ethnic Census of Employes To the Editor: It is the ultimate of ironies that we now seem to have come full circle in seeking information as to the ethnic make‐up of employes. I can remember as a youngster that any such attempt on the part of an employer was quickly condemned by liberals as smacking of Hitlerism. Yet now $150 million annually will be withheld from the city school system by the Federal Government because of the refusal of Community School Districts 26 and 28 to participate in an ethnic staff census. Where are the voices of the “liberals”? DARRILYN DESSER Beechhurst, N. Y., Jan. 24, 1973 Subsidy for the SST To the Editor: The press, in a recent report, noted support for a statment by the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman that the United States Government has no business building an SST if it requires Government subsidies. Without debating the merits of the cases for or against the SST, I should like to point out that it has been official U.S. policy to subsidize building products or servicing things of benefit to the U.S. For example, the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 has as one of its goals the development of a new, modern merchant marine fleet. In fiscal 1971, subsidies under this act exceeded $390 million. In fiscal '72, construction differential subsidies call for building 21 new ships. Similarly, local service airline subsidies were recently estimated to be more than $63 million. I am sure that there are other important examples. Mr. Friedman says: “I oppose the governmental subsidization of the SST for exactly the same reasons that oppose governmental subsidization of food, or of automobiles, or of furniture, or of electric power. I believe in the free enterprise system. A governmental decision to produce an SST largely at its own expense is a step toward socialism and away from free enterprise.” Does Mr. Friedman really believe that our Government subsidy policies have hurt the free enterprise system? I don't think so. I think what he is really saying is that he is against the SST, period. Now that the Concorde has flown over one million miles as a prototype, my feeling is that Mr. Friedman and some of the others in the economic community should rethink the impact of this nextageneration aircraft on the future of U.S. aviation. Surely, he would not want another U.S. merchant marine debacle. ROBERT K. FRIEDMAN Chevy Chase, Md., Jan. 13, 1973 • Abortion and the Court To the Editor: The Supreme Court's abortion decision ranks in infamy with the Dred Scott decision. In 1857 the Court ruled that a Negro slave could claim “none of the rights and privileges” of the Constitution. Now the Court says, “The word ‘person’ as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.” Then the Court declared that freeing slaves would unconstitutionally violate the owners' right of property. Now it claims that forbidding abortions violates the mother's “right of privacy.” The Court's endorsement of slavery was overturned by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. We need a new amendment to overturn the endorsement of abortion. MARTIN W. HELGESEN New York, Jan. 23, 1973 • To the Editor: The United States Supreme Court did not rule that every female who becomes pregnant must have an abortion. The Court ruled that, within a certain period of time, she could have one if she wanted to. I do not see how anyone can object to that. ALICE J. D'ANGELO Malverne, L. I., Jan. 23, 1973 • Only Four Days to the Moon To the Editor: George C. Miles [letter Jan. 16] should be grateful that he receives his mail from Washington within three days. First‐class mail in Manhattan frequently takes three days to travel twenty city‐blocks. Recently, a theater six blocks from my address posted tickets four days prior to a concert. I received them the day following the performance. All this propaganda about speeding the post by using the correct zip code is so much moonshine. By the way, we can reach the moon in four days. ABRAHAM ISAAC CARMEL New York, Jan. 17, 1973"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/31/archives/letters-to-the-editor-higher-salaries-for-city-judges-compulsory.html,"To the Editor: Last November the Mayor's Com mittee on Executive and Judicial Com pensation, composed of six distin guished business executives and pro fessional men, recommended what it termed a “modest” increase of $2,500 in the salaries of the 257 judges of the New York City Civil, Criminal and Family Courts—an increase well with in the then existing Federal Pay Board limits.  Mayor Lindsay appointed the com mittee last spring following a resolu tion of the Executive Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, of which I was then president, urging these judicial salaries be increased from $31,825 to $35,000. Other bar associations have also rec ommended increases. Nevertheless, no increase has as yet been granted. Inflation has reduced substantially the purchasing value of the salaries of the judges over the last ten years. In the face of a Consumer Price Index increase of 49 per cent since the courts were consolidated ten years ago, judges’ salaries have gone up only 27 per cent. Executives and managers in city de partments have received increases in compensation of 60 per cent and unionized city employes have been given increases of from 75 per cent to 145 per cent in the same period. By the Mayor's yardstick of produc tivity, the judges of these courts have performed remarkably well. In the face of a job freeze and the resulting cur tailment of administrative and clerical resources, both Criminal and Civil Court dockets are current. The Family Court continues to keep pace with rising caseload. The Mayor has publicly praised the judges for this record and promised to recognize their efforts. Recognition in the form of the recommended increases, however, would at best only provide a belated and partial catch‐up in the cost of living for able and talented men and women. The importance of these so‐called lower courts, as I have often said, can not be overemphasized. Closest to the people, they shape the public's image of the law in action. For every litigant, witness and juror who steps into the higher tribunals, a hundred surge through these courts. But they will not continue to attract the capable and the dedicated as judges if unwarranted personal sacri fices are demanded. Simple justice calls for implement ing the reports of the Mayor's Com mittee and the bar associations. This long‐overdue increase for the judges of the busiest courts in the country should not be further delayed. Compulsory Voting Opposed To the Editor: Reuben Gabel in his Jan. 11 letter suggests that young voters should be disfranchised because only 5.3 mil lion out of twelve million new voters participated in the last election. These figures work out to 44.1 per cent of the enfranchised voters. The national figure was approxi mately 55 per cent. This difference is 10 per cent or 1.2 million voters, not an exceptionally large number. Younger voters generally are more unsettled than older ones, thus mak ing it more difficult to vote. William H. Flanigan in “Political Behavior of the American Electorate” says, “Mili tary service, new jobs, the last years of college, all contribute to postponing the establishment of residence and the initiation of political participation.” The relatively short time in which to register, the difficulty in obtaining absentee ballots and the generally unexciting campaign would also tend to reduce the number of voters. I expect that the “viable future,” just like the viable present of this country, will be drawn more from the ranks of those who vote than those who do not. Mr. Gabel finally proposes compul sory voting. True, this would produce some nice figures, but the thought of an enormous block of people (40–45 per cent of the eligible citizens) march ing to the polls under threat of a fine with little or no knowledge of the candidates frightens me. A brief look at the returns of unim portant offices in any election will show that the candidates at the begin ning of the ballot get the most votes. Required voting for any group would be madness. Improve the Product The Association for a Better New York (news story Jan. 24) “was or ganized to mount a direct media counter‐offensive against those who have been using New York as a tar get for their custard pies. . . . Now the city has a corps of articulate spokesmen. . . .” How typically Lind say‐ish. . . . If the product is not sell ing, step up the advertising. How about improving the product? Seniority System To the Editor: In the Jan. 10 issue of The Times you reported on the setback of the seniority system. In particular, this referred to the action of the Republican Senators in providing for committee members choosing their own ranking member subject to approval of the conference. While this decision was in part accurate, the article continued, “Re publicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate already select commit tee chairmen by party votes.” As to the Republicans in the House, this statement is correct. However, as to the Democrats in the Senate, the Democratic caucus can theoretically reject the choice of a committee chair man who is the most senior member. As far as I can find out, this has never occurred; and, in fact, Demo cratic chairmen are chosen by the strictest seniority on the committee. The other unmentioned matter is that Republican members of standing committees of the Senate continue to be selected strictly on a seniority basis. Senator Packwood and I fully expect to continue the effort to bring about a change that was proposed to, but rejected, by the Republican caucus of Senators. Rethinking Liberal Credo To the Editor: President Nixon has certainly done some surprising things while in the White House. His trip to China and the imposition of wage and price con trols have shown us that he is not an avowed ??aeoiogue. By these and sim ilar actions he has caused people to reconsider past policies. By bombing North Vietnam during the holiday season and by suffering such heavy losses in materiel and personnel, he has caused me to re consider one of the most fundamental positions of my liberal creed: civilian control of the military. Japan Warned on A‐Bomb To the Editor: Your Dec. 27 editorial “Man of Independence” was an excellent ap praisal of the late President, but I must correct a glaring error in your statement that Mr. Truman had to decide in his very first days in office “whether to drop, without warning, two atomic bombs on Japan.” As a former combat intelligence of ficer in the Pacific, I still have in my possession a few of the original cir culars which were dropped by our B‐29's in the millions over Japan warning the people of a “new weapon” that would be used against them un less their military regime surrendered to the Allies. The circulars were graphic and printed in Japanese. Hence, there was adequate warning. Metropolitan Museum's Deaccessioning’ and Exchanges To the Editor: Since one aspect of the “deacces sioning” of the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art concerns the collection of Adelaide Milton de Groot, I believe I can supply some pertinent information. From 1946 to April 1966 I was Di rector of the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, where about 75 paintings and a few pieces of sculpture were on loan from Miss deGroot in the early years of my tenure. As Theodore Rousseau will recall, since he claims to be partly responsible for the terms of Miss deGroot's will, it was once her intention to divide her collection among approximately six museums where the bulk of her collection was on loan in the forties and early fifties. Specifically, these museums in cities where she had family connections were: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper Union, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Wadsworth Atheneum and the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts. According to Miss deGroot's often re peated statement in those days, her will provided that any works of art belonging to her on loan at a museum at the time of her death, would be come the permanent property of that museum. Consequently, Miss deGroot's favors were courted by quite a few museum directors and curators. However, Miss deGroot took great pride in her ancestors and in cities where she had family roots. It was, therefore, the six museums mentioned that were espe cially favored, and the paintings and sculpture were valuable adjuncts to their permanent collections. All this was changed around 1950, when Miss deGroot was persuaded by the Metropolitan to withdraw all of her collections from other museums and deposit them in the Metropolitan where a vast majority disappeared in the storages, to be rarely if ever seen since. As I recall, Miss deGroot was told that her collection was too im portant to be dispersed among a num ber of museums, but they should be held together by one museum, the Metropolitan. According to my diary for May 4, 1950, I met with Miss deGroot in the office of the then director Francis Henry Taylor to go over the details of an agreement or was it a w?? which I believe I witnessed. My notes here are a bit vague, but what was definitely in the discussions and i believe in the agreement or the will was that if any works of art were not needed by the Metropolitan, they would be distributed to the other museums. I wrote then in my diary “agree ment not too good, but probably the best we can do under the circum stances.” I don't recall why I was in vited to attend my own execution, but I recall definitely that it was my un derstanding with Miss deGroot and Francis Taylor that the Metropolitan Museum would take only what it wanted. This certainly seemed to be Miss deGroot's intention when she wrote her last will as quoted in The Times of Jan. 14, 1973. Surely a lady is entitled to change her mind, but as long as I knew Miss deGroot she always said that she wished the Metropolitan to have what it wanted, but that she desired her collection to be used and enjoyed through loans and, as it turned out, through indirect bequests to other in stitutions. It is, therefore, strange that the Metropolitan has not respected Miss deGroot's wishes so that people in cities in New York State and Connecti cut could enjoy some of the “dis cards” from Miss deGroot's collection. The Metropolitan might stand a little taller if it had. Benefits for the Aged Poor To the Editor: Under present regulations, Social Security payments for retired people depend on the number of years em ployed and the amount of their earn ings prior to retirement. This system discriminates against the poorest— those who are often unemployed or who earn very low wages. These are usually also people who enjoy no pension income from other sources, and depend mainly upon Social Secu rity for a meager survival. I call upon enlightened legislators to initiate a reform of this system. The United States can afford to provide a minimum income to its senior citizens without discrimination between rich and poor, as a matter of dignity and social justice. Alone, in the Middle To the Editor: How refreshing to read Mary Mc Sloy's Jan. 23 letter about how a middle‐aged, middle‐income, middle everything American feels about the great issues of our times. With relentlessly middling logic, Mrs. McSloy condemns legal abortion in the same breath as the Nixon bomb ing policy, and shakes her middle finger at such middlemen as journal ists, who profit from the midden of human sufferings. Finally, she throws out the babies of welfare and integrated schools with the bath of middlebrow spite, and con cludes her muddle remarks by asking whether she is alone, in the middle. One can only reply, let's hope so."
Jersey Eases Standards On Abortion Prosecution,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/01/archives/jersey-eases-standards-on-abortion-prosecution-kugler-asserts-any.html,"TRENTON, Jan. 31—Attorney General George F. Kugler Jr. said today the state would not prosecute any licensed physician who performed an abortion to preserve the health of a pregnant woman. And, he added: The medical judgment by the physician may be exercised in its broadest sense and in the light of all factors — physical, emotional, psychological, familial and the woman's age — relevant to the well‐being of the patient.” The state's position on abortion had been uncertain despite the recent United States Supreme Court decision that no state could prohibit a woman from having an abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The state is still appealing a Federal court decision that overturned New Jersey's abortion law, which had been interpreted by the state and county prosecutors to forbid abortions except those performed to save the life of the woman. Physicians and hospitals around the state had been awaiting definitive word from the state on what its policy would be in light of the Supreme Court action. Mr. Kugler said today that his reading of the Supreme Court decision on abortion convinced him that the pregnant woman did not have a constitutional right to an abortion on demand. The decision must be concurred in by her physician “based upon the best clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary,” the Attorney General said, and he urged the medical profession “to live up to its high standards” and insure that an abortion was “medically indicated” before it was performed. A ‘Burden’ on Doctors He said he expected that physicians would conduct thorough examination and take “an adequate history” before deciding on an abortion, and would not agree to perform one simply because a woman said she wanted it. Mr. Kugler said the Supreme Court decision “has placed great burden on the medical profession and on its integrity,” but he added he did not intend to “second guess” the decisions of any licensed physicians regarding abortions. Richard I. Nevins, executive director of the Medical Society of New Jersey, said he could not comment fully on the Attorney General's statement until he had a chance to study it. He added, however, that it seemed to deny the “full implications” of the Supreme Court decision, which took into account the comfort as well as the health of the pregnant woman. Mr. Nevins said the Medical Society had recently liberalized its position on abortion and recommended that Governor Cahill and the State Legislature consider a statute allowing abortions up to the first 16 weeks of pregnancy if it is approved by a physician and two consultants. Jack W. Owen, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said that he had not read the Attorney General's statement, but added that the inclusion of the concept of the “well‐being” of the pregnant woman broadened the basis for allowing abortions beyond strict medical indications and appeared to be in line with the interpretation of the Supreme Court decision by special counsel for the association. The association mailed letters yesterday to member hospitals telling them they would be on firm legal ground in allowing abortions in the first three months of pregnancy, Many hospitals already have therapeutic abortion committees that decided when abortions were permitted under the New Jersey statute struck down last year by a three‐judge Federal Court as “vague” and an invasion of a woman's privacy. These committees probably would be the vehicle through which the hospitals would accommodate requests for abortions. Both Mr. Nevins and Mr. Owen said that the Attorney General's insistence on licensed physicians was a legal decision but that hospitals would insist further that the doctors be “qualified” to perform abortions. “The members of the Supreme Court might be excellent lawyers but they're not very good obstetricians,” Mr. Nevins said. Mr. Kugler said the state would continue to appeal the Federal decision that overturned the state's abortion statute. He said that he considered the statute “viable” because of the appeal now in process and that he intended to continue to prosecute anyone, other than a licensed physician, who performed an abortion. The statute declares it crime to perform an abortion in the state without “lawful justification.” A 1967 policy statement endorsed by the state's 21 county prosecutors and the Attorney General's office limited this generally to abortions performed to save the life of the woman."

Panels Already Exist The association mailed letters yesterday to member hospitals telling them they would be on firm legal ground in allowing abortions in the first three months of pregnancy.

He indicated that those involving abortions performed by licensed physicians “might be discontinued” but that those involving unlicensed persons would be prosecuted. Mr. Kugler also said he was concerned that the state might experience an “abortion mill” problem such as has plagued other states and some countries that have liberal laws. Mr. Kugler said that he would ask the State Legislature to enact a “more comprehensive” statute that would not only spell out the legal conditions under which abortions would be permitted following the first three months of pregnancy but also regulate the medical conditions under which they might be performed. Mr. Owen said that he hoped the hospitals would be called upon to give advice in this area and that any new legislation would allow hospitals the option of refusing to permit abortions. “We have enough hospitals in this state to allow those whose administrations disagree with abortion the freedom not to perform them,” he said. “This is not an emergency situation.” The Attorney General said that henceforth women eligible for Medicaid payments in New Jersey would be able to get abortions in New York under the Medicaid program. Prior to this time the Attorney General's office bid rules that these payments could not be made."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/02/archives/every-child-a-healthy-child-books-of-the-times-great-strides-since.html,"PREGNANCY, BIRTH & FAMILY PLANNING. By Alan F. Guttmacher, M.D. Viking. 365 Pages. $10. IS MY BABY ALL RIGHT? By Virginia Apgar, M.D., and Joan Beck. 492 Pages. Trident. $9.95. Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher is the Dr. Spock of unborn children. Through earlier editions of his book on pregnancy (this one is a completely revised and much expanded version of “Pregnancy and Birth”), Dr. Guttmacher has been midwife to a generation of Americans. His wisdom, refreshing honesty and practical advice have helped to lead countless mothers through worry‐free pregnancies and happy, childbirth experiences. He is the kind of physician who never talks down to his patients, who tells what he thinks and also what others who may disagree with him think. While the book is far from a do‐it‐your‐self manual on pregnancy and childbirth, it should help to assuage the fears and answer the questions of most expectant mothers and sustain them between monthly visits to the obstetrician. In addition to practical tips on such subjects as travel, sexual intercourse, exercise, breast‐feeding, diet and sleep, the book includes a detailed description of labor and delivery and thorough discussions of infertility, contraception and abortion. Sadly, the women who most need the advice and guidance Dr. Guttmacher gives —the poor and poorly educated—are the least likely to get it. Perhaps “Pregnancy, Birth & Family Planning” should be translated into ghetto language and serialized‐comic‐book style or on television. Great Strides Since 1937 Dr. Guttmacher has a lot more to say about his subject today than he did in 1937, when his first book on pregnancy was published. For, in the last four decades, obstetrics has changed from a rather simplistic and, crude art of delivering babies, to a sophisticated science of nurturing the growth and development of the fetus, with the birth marking the culmination of nine months' work by the mother aided by her doctor. Dr. Guttmacher demystifies obstetrics (and in the process strips the obstetrician of some of the idolatry to which he often subject) by giving the woman the information and encouragement she needs to participate actively in her pregnancy instead of leaving it all up to the doctor. I only wished that his enlightened view had gone one step farther—urging the pregnant woman to demand explanations and challenge her doctor's views, not for defiance's sake, but to acquire the understanding and assurance that the very best is being done for her and her unborn child. The need for this kind of assurance and understanding becomes all too obvious upon reading “Is My Baby All Right?” In it, Dr. Virginia Apgar, a pediatrician and anesthesiologist who is also a vice president of the National Foundation‐March of Dimes, and the columnist Joan Beck offer detailed descriptions of the countless things that can go wrong in the process of creating a new human life. They point out that in one birth in 16, the baby is not born “just perfect,” but might be afflicted with one of a host of congenital defects, ranging from a small mole to a life‐threatening heart defect. The book is not exactly bedtime reading for expectant parents, who updoubtedly are already worried about how their baby will turn out. But this authoritative account of the nature and causes of birth defects can help them. For Parents and Parents‐to‐Be Ideally, the book should he read well in advance of a pregnancy by all who some day hope to become parents. For some, it may provide the guidance and courage they need to be parents, despite a family history of a serious defect; for others, it may give the hope, understanding and love needed to care for an afflicted child. I found the book, despite its strong emphasis on prevention and treatment of birth defects, rather lacking a tone of optimism, which I think should naturally emerge, from the great strides made in recent years. However, it is unquestionably readable and well‐researched, avoiding obvious traps, like labeling LSD a cause of birth defects, but wisely cautioning would‐be parents to avoid all drugs that are not essential to life and health. The organization over which Dr. Guttmacher presides—Planned Parenthood‐World Population—has as its motto “Every child a wanted child.” To this, Doctors Guttmacher and Apgar and Mrs. Beck add, “Every child a healthy child.” It is a noble goal, and one that need not be too far out of reach."
Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/02/archives/metropolitan-briefs-reversal-of-abortion-ruling-sought-2-guilty-of.html,"Senator James L. Buckley announced yesterday that he would seek an amendment to the Federal Constitution to overturn the Supreme Court decisions last week severely restricting the rights of states to legislate on abortion. The Conservative‐Republican said he was consulting “men of science and law” on the form of the amendment and would introduce it as soon as possible to “undo the damage inflicted by these pernicious decisions.” There are three “options,” he said: to outlaw abortion, to put the responsibility for abortion legislation on the states or to define the word “person” in the 14th Amendment to include unborn children. 2 Guilty of Queens Blockbusting A Far Rockaway, Queens, real estate agent was found guilty by the state's Division of Licensing Services of blockbusting and was given the choice of a $500 fine or a six‐month suspension of his license. The decision, the first of its kind obtained by the city's Commission on Human Rights, is “a very real deterrent to blockbusting” according to Eleanor Holmes Norton, chairman of the commission. Seymour E. Traiger, a real estate agent with offices at 507 Beach 20th Street in Far Rockaway, and one of his salesman, Mrs. Belle Solomon, were found guilty of stirring rumors that black families were moving into Far Rockaway and of unethical sales practices. Knowlton Acquitted of Tax Charge Former State Senator Willard B. Knowlton was acquitted by a jury in Federal Court in Newark of a charge of willfully failing to file an income‐tax return for 1968. The Government had charged that he deliberately failed to file a return to conceal payments from a construction company that had been awarded a controversial highway contract. The United States Attorney for New Jersey, Herbert J. Stern, asked the court to set a date for a trial on 33 other counts against Mr. Knowlton. Appeals Unit Refuses Kawaida Case The Appellate Division of New Jersey Superior Court has refused to take up the Kawaida Towers housing controversy, leaving pickets free to demonstrate in front of the site of the proposed high‐rise project in Newark, Attorneys for North Ward residents and for Bruno J. Lucarelli, a contractor, were informed that a three‐judge panel headed by Superior Court Judge Donald G. Collester had denied Mr. Lucarelli's request to appeal a lower‐court ruling. Although the decision does not deal with the merits of the case, Henry Franzoni Jr., the attorney for the North Ward Citizens Property Protective Association, said he considered it a victory. Theodore Geiser, attorney for Mr. Lucarelli, could not be reached for comment. City Gets 10‐Day Oil Assurance Deputy Mayor Edward K. Hamilton said that arrangements between the city and suppliers of fuel oil meant there would be no shortage of the oil for at least 10 days. On Wednesday an oil shortage forced the shutting off of heat during the afternoon for occupants of more than 150,000 apartments in the city's public housing projects. Mr. Hamilton said that the fuel supplier, Asiatic Petroleum, would borrow oil from other companies. In New Jersey, State Environmental Protection Commissioner Richard J. Sullivan has refused to relax lowsulphur requirements for fuel oil ever, though a major supplier says these grades of fuel oil are in short supply. He said the request to relax low‐sulphur requirements temporarily, which New York City has done, had been made by John K. McKinky, president of Texaco, Inc."
25 Abortion Clinics Are Predicted in '73,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/02/archives/25-abortion-clinics-are-predicted-in-73.html,"ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, Feb. 1—Dr. Robert M. Livingston, the gynecologist who played important role in tests against the New Jersey abortion law, said today that about 25 abortion clinics would be opened in the state within the next year. Dr. Livingston, who was indicted by a Bergen County grand jury last August after publicly acknowledging that he had performed an abortion what he said was a test of New Jersey law, indicated that he and five other physicians hoped to open a sizable clinic of their own by next April. The creation of group medical or surgical facilities ordinarily requires a certificate of necessity from local and state medical‐planning groups before going into operation, a procedure that generally takes, at least 90 days. Dr. Livingston said, however, that he thought the recent United States Supreme Court decision prohibiting state laws against abortions during the first three months of pregnancy would make the certificate‐ofnecessity requirement moot. “The law will be operating in kind of a void,” he said, “until either the Legislature or the State Department of Health produce guidelines describing who can perform abortions and under what circumstances.” Indicating that he thought the Legislature and the state agency would be slow to act in what is an election year, Dr. Livingston said that “we will of course, comply with whatever reasonable regulations” are promulgated. “But anything that appears to be in excess of the Supreme Court ruling,” he added, “we will fight.” Dr. Livingston said he thought a dozen “major” and another dozen “somewhat smaller” abortion clinics would be opened in the state within the next year. He based his estimate on experience in New York State, where abortions besides those necessary to save a mother's life have been legal for more than two years. Dr. Livingston's assertion that abortion clinics, at least for the moment, would not need the kind of local and state approval required of group practices underscored the confusion over abortion in the state. Attorney General F. Kugler Jr. said yesterday that he would ask the Legislature to produce a statute detailing the conditions under which abortions would be permitted after the first three months of pregnancy and regulating the medical conditions under which they could be performed. The issue remains highly controversial, however, and Jack W. Owen, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said today it was “likely” that the legislators would be forced to balance out some of the same conflicting forces that the New York Legislature has had to deal with. The Morris County Right to Life Committee, for example, is urging legislators to amend the State and Federal Constitutions to protect the right of the unborn to life. Mr. Owen also said that differences of opinion as to what the guidelines should be would surface in the medical profession itself. Some hospitals, for example, have already indicated willingness to perform abortions; others, including Roman Catholic institutions, have said they will not. The New Jersey Medical Society has recommended that the Legislature consider a law permitting abortions up to the first 16 weeks of pregnancy if the procedure is approved by a physician and two consultants."
"Liberty, New and Old",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/03/archives/liberty-new-and-old-at-home-abroad.html,"LONDON, Feb. 2—At the start of his opinion for the Supreme Court in the abortion case, Justice Blackmun acknowledged “the sensitive sand emotional nature” of the issue, the “seemingly absolute convictions” it inspired. “But it is a very different thing for the Supreme Court to protect individual liberty, when there is no consensus, when the public is indifferent or even antagonistic to the fate of the individuals concerned.” “One's philosophy,” he wrote, “one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family ... are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion.” Read at a distance, those words brought out the most remarkable aspect of the whole case: that an issue so deeply controversial in social and religious and political terms should be resolved by a court at all. For no other court, anywhere, would undertake to speak for a society on such an issue. That is only another way of saying again that the Supreme Court is an amazing, and a uniquely American, institution. The abortion case was one of the great cases that, every few years, illuminate the philosophic dilemmas inherent in the character of the Court. Justice Blackmun's opinion was in the grand style. He canvassed Greek and Roman views of abortion, the English common law, modern medical and legal opinion. He showed that earlier Supreme Court cases had identified a constitutional right of intellectual and physical privacy extending to sex and marriage. That right could be overridden, he said, only by a “compelling state interest”—and none existed to justify restricting abortion in the early months of pregnancy except to assure medical safety. There was a notably interesting opinion also by Justice Rehnquist, one of the two dissenters. He rejected the majority's whole constitutional standard. If a state had to show a “compelling interest” to justify its legislation, he said, the Court would be in the position of passing on the wisdom Of legislative policy in order to decide Whether it was compelling. Justice Rehnquist is at one pole in the historic argument about the function of the Supreme Court. He would use an extremely loose standard of constitutionality, upholding any challenged law that was “rational.” He Would agree with the theme of Holmes, and more recently of Frankfurter and Harlan, that the Court should defer to the judgments of elected politicians, however foolish they may seem. The trouble with that self‐denying, formula is that judges find it so difficult to apply consistently. Even Holmes. He wrote again and again about the need to let government act without hobbling judicial control. But when some government punished a Communist or a pacifist for what he had said, Holmes was ready to invoke the full power of the Court in passionate defense of the freedom of speech. AT HOME ABROAD Justice Frankfurter, too. He was the philosopher of judicial self restraint, but he felt so deeply about some matters—wiretapping, for one, and state aid to religion—that in those areas his restraint lapsed. And Justice Harlan feeling strongly about privacy in marriage, wrote the Connecticut birth control opinion that started the Court on the road toward its abortion decision. Every Supreme Court Justice has his own idea of what is fundamental in life. He may be the most skeptical man, determined to limit any personal element in his decisions. But he is sworn to defend “liberty,” and he can only fill that empty constitutional word with what he thinks are the basic beliefs of his society. He has to make judgments. That brings us back to the significance of the abortion decision. Some commentators have read it as showing that, even, with four Nixon appointees, the Supreme Court is still “liberal,” that it can be relied upon to protect our liberties. Issues before the Supreme Court do not always, or usually, fall into neat “liberal” and “conservative” compartments. Abortion certainly did not. It was an example of a problem on which—for all the controversy—opinion was moving toward a new consensus, so that 19th‐century state anti‐abortion statutes were already being worn away by changed attitudes. In the American system, the Supreme Court is the perfect institution to register changed moral and social perceptions. When it decided the segregation cases in 1954, for example, it reflected an emerging national consensus that it was wrong to use the law, as opposed to private desire, to exclude someone from a school or public facility because df his race. But it is a very different thing for the Supreme Court to protect individual liberty when there is no consensus, when the public is indifferent or even antagonistic to the fate of the individuals concerned. It was difficult to protect freedom of speech and belief in the McCarthy period, and the Court was slow to do so. It will be difficult now to maintain the constitutional balance of powers against the pressures of a determined executive branch, or to protect scholars and journalists and citizens of all kinds from overzealous prosecutors. Those issues, not abortion, are the painful tests of liberty ahead."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/03/archives/letters-to-the-editor-ruling-of-the-supreme-court-on-abortion.html,"To the Editor: Speaking for the majority in the, Supreme Court's abortion decision, Justice Blackmun spoke of a viable baby as only a “potential” life. Also, concerning the remnant of legislative authority graciously left to the people and their representatives, he wrote in only a hypothetical vein: “If the state is interested in protecting fetal life after viability. . . .” If? Furthermore, he described the grounds for compelling state interest in the unborn as their “capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.” Meaningful? Thus the Court opened the door to weighing human lives according to comparative worthiness, or something called “meaningfulness.” Ineluctably we pass from abortion to infanticide, whether the justices know it or not. Ineluctably, because many of the reasons alleged to justify permissive abortion have equal force in justifying the killing of neonates in hospital nurseries. Long ago, from studying polls of public opinion in this country, the proabortion people decided that the only way to success for their cause was through the courts. Whoever is concerned about one‐man rule in the Presidency, to the erosion of Congressional authority, ought to be equally worried about seven‐man rule in the judiciary, gathering to itself the legislative power on Important public questions that formerly belonged to the people and their elected representatives to decide. Professor, Princeton University Princeton, N. J., Jan. 24, 1973 To the Editor: With the Supreme Court ruling promising a welcome halt to nasty arguments about legalizing abortion, the Right to Lifers and the Right to Choosers have at long last an opportunity to work together to reduce that statistic of 60 per cent of abortions being performed on unmarried women under 25 and pregnant for the first time. We would all like to see abortion used as a backstop rather than in place of contraception. Furthermore, we could all “sanctify” life more by working to reduce that estimated statistic of some 50 per cent of children actually being born who are regarded as “merely accidents.” It is demeaning to all human life that children are not planned for more seriously and responsibly. If the Right to Lifers are sincere in their wish to reduce the incidence of abortion, why don't they prove their love for children and life by now contributing their apparently abundant money, time and energy to extending family planning services, establishing much‐needed “relationship counseling” centers for the unmarried, and improving sex education for children so that biology is taught with reference to emotional relationships and social responsibilities. This would be more truly helpful than to continue running ads to “Protect the Unborn” as in the Sunday Times. KATHERINE TECK Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N.Y., Jan. 28, 1973 Lindsay's Statement on the South Bronx To the Editor: In preparing his four‐part series on the South Bronx, Times reporter Martin Tokhin asked me for a comment from Mayor Lindsay on “the impact of cutbacks by the Federal Government on the South Bronx.” Mr. Tolchin used the Mayor's comment at some length in his story. I want to emphasize that Deputy Mayor Edward E. Hamilton had previously commented on the over‐all problem of the South Bronx and that the Mayor's comment therefore was restricted solely to the impact of Federal cutbacks. The Mayor's comment was specific and to that point only. Unfortunately, your Jan. 18 editorial on the South Bronx assumed that the Mayor's specific comment was intended as a response to the total. Tolchin report, and berated Mayor Lindsay for his too‐narrow focus on the Federal role in the South Bronx. Readers of that editorial might therefore be interested in the Mayor's actual reaction to Mr. Tolchin's South Bronx series. The Mayor said: “That the South Bronx is a sorely afflicted area is beyond question. That the city must share the responsibility for healing this wounded community is self‐evident. That the city has undertaken this responsibility with determination, intelligence and understanding seems equally clear. We have not succeeded, but neither have we failed or given up. . . . [The Mayor listed some of the city's specific efforts in the South Bronx in many areas—including health, housing, parks, police, fire, sanitation and economic development—at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.] “And this massive commitment of scarce city resources to the South Bronx did not just happen; It was made possible not only because we have fought to make it happen, but also because we have seen the wounds, the pain, the suffering—and the progress that is possible—in the South Bronx. With hard work and inadequate resources, we are trying every day to find better solutions for that community and every community in this city, difficult and slow as the process may be.” To the Mayor's statement, I would only add my own belief that this administration's commitment is clear. The Mayor's relentless search for solutions to the problems of decay and addiction is a matter of record. But he knows, too, that all the time, energy, dedication, emotion and money this city can muster will never be enough without help from Albany and Washington. In any case, I think New Yorkers will be grateful for the Martin Tolchin series. Whoever may serve as our next Mayor should learn much from it—it is to be hoped he (or she) will build on the important initiatives of John Lindsay in the South Bronx. THOMAS B. MORGAN Press Secretary to the Mayor New York, Jan. 24, 1973 Watergate Testimony To the Editor: Your Feb. 1 editorial “Watergate Conviction” contains a complete distortion of the testimony of Hugh W. Sloan Jr. as it relates to John N. Mitchell and Maurice H. Stans. It is obvious you had not read the testimony but apparently relied on earlier reports in the news columns of The Times, which were also wrong and distorted. The transcript of the testimony shows Mr. Sloan, former treasurer of the Finance Committee to Re‐Elect the President, inquired of Mr. Stans whether Jeb S. Magruder could authorize expenditure of campaign funds to Gordon Liddy, then committee counsel. The transcript further shows that Mr. Sloan was told by Mr. Stans, after consultation with Mr. Mitchell, that Mr. Magruder had continuing and general authority with regard to campaign expenditures. Specific amounts were not discussed. Mr. Magruder had earlier testified that the money he authorized for Mr. Liddy was to be used for legitimate campaign purposes. To say, as The Times did editorially, that Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Stans “personally approved” the disbursement of $199,000 to carry out “political espionage” is an absolute perversion of Mr. Sloan's testimony and of the facts in this matter. DEVAN L SHUMWAY Director of Public Affairs, Committee for the Re‐Election of the President Washington, Feb. 1, 1973 An editorial on this subject appears today. Mint Ignores Price Controls To the Editor: I just received from the U.S. Bureau of the Mint an announcement that orders will be accepted for 1973 uncirculated coins. The price is $6 per set, 70 per cent over last year's price. I wonder which side the Bureau of the Mint is on, in the midst of the Government's efforts to control prices and inflation. ISIDORE GOLDSTEIN Brooklyn, Jan. 30, 1973 Philippine Conditions Under Martial Law To the Editor: In your Jan. 18 editorial “Dark Days in Manila” you stated: “The United States cannot and should not try to intervene to restore freedoms that only the Filipino people can claim and uphold for themselves.” That was a very laudable statement, worthy of The Times. In the last paragraph you unabashedly advocated, “Any American assistance for the Philippines henceforth should be clearly tied to effective reforms and contingent upon the progressive restoration of democratic institutions.” That was not worthy of The Times. The editorial painted a very somber picture of conditions in the Philippines, but in reality bright and vivid tones predominate. Consider this partial list of solid achievements which have had salutary effects on the morale of the masses and on the economy: ¶The crime rate has drastically dropped with the imposition of curfew, the confiscation of loose firearms and the meting out of stern justice to criminals. ¶The reform of the Government structure and the administrative machinery has made it more responsive to the economic and social needs of the masses. The removal from office of the misfits and the corrupt purged the Government service of a major stumbling block to efficiency and integrity. ¶The implementation of the longdormant land reform program has started to emancipate tenant‐farmers from 450 years of bondage which was one of the prime causes for peasant unrest. ¶The increase in the minimum wage, the stabilization of commodity prices and the curb on inflation have improved the quality of the daily life of those in the lower income brackets. ¶The reform in the tax law provides a more equitable and more rational system for the imposition and collection of taxes, thereby providing revenue for pending reform programs. Many more achievements can be cited. Many more problems remain. But one must not lose sight of the fact that all these problems have deep roots and will take time and singleminded effort to solve. Nevertheless, President Marcos has pledged that he will not wait until the solution of all problems before he lifts martial law. All he needs is a return of conditions to “normalcy.” It is too early to pass judgment on the long‐term effects of martial law in the Philippines. Any that is made at this time can only be a snap judgment which would be unfair to both The Times and the Philippines. ERNESTO C. PINEDA Consul General of the Philippines New York, Jan. 18, 1973 Social Security: Boon or Bane? To the Editor: Social Security increases are now in effect. They look good in the headlines, but what will they be like to live with the rest of our lives? Social Security was never meant to be a total retirement income. Rather, it was to be a “floor” under the aged so they would not be left utterly destitute. Thus, denouncing the impossibility of living on Social Security payments makes no sense. Social Security is neither a welfare program nor an investment program, although it tries to be both. As a welfare program, it is not designed to help the poor. As an investment program, it will not make payments to bona fide investors over 65 years of age if they are still working, but will make payments to those over 65 with unlimited monies from investments. But the benefits have been raised—and also the taxes. The individual earning $12,000 or more will pay $702 next year into Social Security. However, a self‐employed person earning $12,000 or more will pay 8 percent, or $960 a year. Paying $960 a year is a terrible amount for a young couple with small children for retirement forty years ahead. But a single person also pays that amount with no dependents to collect anything. Some wives whose husbands have Social Security pay the full amount for no benefits whatsoever; they will only receive their husband's benefits. If we die after our children are grown and before we retire, we get no benefits at all; Social Security is not inheritable, the Government keeps all. My husband and I will pay at least $40,000 into Social Security in our lifetime. Investing $960 a year at even 4 per cent interest would give us a total of over $90,000 in that forty‐year period. An annuity of that size would yield $630 a month for life, with the balance inheritable. Using savings accounts and annuities would make us into a nation of capitalists instead of making retirement akin to welfare. People would be encouraged to save by knowing their current worth. Further, these insurance companies and savings associations would be private enterprises, employing people and paying taxes, rather than ever more Government employes to be paid by taxes. The same type of legislation that enforces liability insurance could enforce a retirement program, or it could be deducted from payrolls into the account of the employe's choice. Does the United States really want its people to be dependent on the Government for all things? President Nixon recently said that if we make the average American “completely dependent and pamper him and cater to him too much, [we] are going to make him soft, spoiled and eventually a very weak individual.” We are frugal, able people, but we are finding it harder and harder to be self‐reliant.

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/03/archives/news-summary-and-index.html,"International A high Laotian Government official has said that the United States is strongly urging the Government of Premier Souvanna Phouma to reach a speedy cease‐fire with the Pathet Lao and that the Premier has accepted the American view despite misgivings that no accord, including adequate guarantees, can be reached. [Page 1, Col. 1.] Disagreement is reported to have broken out within the Administration over whether the United States, under the Vietnam peace agreement, can continue to provide about $500‐million a year in military aid to Laos and Cambodia. Senate Democratic sources reported yesterday that they had been informed by the State Department that the Defense Department was being urged by the State Department, and apparently by Henry A. Kissinger's White House office to continue the military aid and not to withdraw any of the military personel assigned to the two countries. [Page. [1:2.) In a radio and television address at the start of what he said was the first peaceful Lunar New Year in 18 years, President Nguyen Van Thieu announced that he had ordered a senior diplomat to begin talks in Paris with the Vietcong on South Vietnam's political future. [ [1:3–4.] Pope Paul VI nominated 30 new Cardinals from all continents, including three Americans. The Americans are the Archbishop of Boston, the Most Rev. Humbert S. Madeiros; the Archbishop of Los Angeles, the Most Rev. Timothy Manning, and the Archbishop of San Juan, P.R., the Most Rev. Luis Aponte Martinez, who will become the first Puerto Rican Cardinal in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. [1:2:4.] The West German Cabinet adopted a series of foreign exchange control measures to stem the inflow of unwanted dollars into the country, West German sources said. The Cabinet decided that nonresidents must get approval from the West German Central Bank to buy shares of West German companies on the domestic stock markets [1:5.] President Nixon, whose budget cuts and pledges to dismantle social programs have angered many members of Congress, sent Congress a State of the Union Message that was unyielding in his intention to “draw the line” on spending. “The time has come for us to draw the line,” Mr. Nixon said, “the time has come for the responsible leaders of both political parties to take a stand against overgrown Government and for the American taxpayer.” The message was the first of several on the State of the Union that Mr. Nixon plans to send to Congress in the next few weeks. [1:1.] The nation's unemployment rate declined a little more in January to 5 per cent of the labor force—the lowest since the unemployment percentage was heading upward in mid‐1970—the Labor Department reported. The December rate, revised from an earlier estimate, was 5.1 per cent. [1:5.] In blunt language, Chief Judge John J. Sirica, who presided at the Watergate trial in Washington's Federal District Court, charged that the recently concluded trial had failed to get to the bottom of the case. He expressed his dissatisfaction at a bail hearing for the two convicted defendants. [1:6–7.] Ralph Garcia, who spent more than two years in the Tombs awaiting trial, was acquitted of a double murder charge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. His case evoked widespread controversy last fall when William J. vanden Heuvel, chairman of the city's Board of Correction, cited it as a classic example of how “the city's lawyers abandon the impoverished client.” [1:6–8.] Dr. William King, a 50‐year‐old staff psychiatrist at the state prison in Trenton, was arrested and jailed, charged with attempting to get a convicted murderer in the prison to arrange the killing of his former wife and two members of her family. He had been committed to two state mental hospitals in Pennsylvania in the nineteen‐sixties, and in the Trenton prison he was primarily responsible for making psychiatric evaluations of prisoners. [1:6–7.] Twenty‐three inmates at the Camden County jail barricaded themselves inside a jail dormitory of Camden's City Hall, but surrendered when the police told them that tear gas and dogs awaited them. During the demonstration, 1,600 employes of the 18‐story building were evacuated as a precautionary measure. Firemen were called to put out blazing Mattresses.

The classifiers of classified documents are breaking their own classification rules,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/04/archives/the-classifiers-of-classified-documents-are-breaking-their-own.html,"The problem of classified documents, which has so bedeviled the Government, scholars and journalists—not to mention Daniel Ellsberg, Anthony Russo and Prof. Samuel L. Popkin—is usually discussed in a political vacuum. The three main questions hotly debated in scholarly circles are: Who should classify? What should be classified? How long should it remain classified? Whatever the right theoretical answers may be, however, they can have little to do with the real world of classified documents. In practice, the rules are largely irrelevant or illusory because there is a privileged group that does not abide by them. This group has existed for a long time; its members have systematically violated their own code with impunity and often for profit. They have created, controlled and benefited from a system which is shot through with duplicity, hypocrisy and favoritism. These are strong words, I know, but I use them advisedly. Who are the guilty ones? None other than the custodians of the classified documents. My own experience has convinced me that they, more than anyone else, constitute the main problem. The case which happened to concern me is worth relating for two reasons: It is absolutely classic its revelation of how the real system often works; it can be fully documented from beginning to end. The story may be told as it actually happened. About two years ago, I was asked by the Political Science Quarterly to review a new book, “Intervention and Negotiation: The United States and the Dominican Revolution,” by Prof. Jerome Slater. When I read the book, I was astonished to find that about half of it was largely devoted to a running polemic against my own work in which I had been highly critical of United States policy during the Dominican revolt of 1965. I was also astounded to learn from Professor Slater's preface that he had been given access “to a great number of papers, memoirs and documents which are not now in the public domain”—in other words, classified documents. In return for this favor, Professor Slater had promised to use the material on a “not‐for‐attribution” or “no‐directcitation” basis. He was not required to submit his manuscript for clearance or approval. I did not think that it was proper for me—now, so to speak, an involuntary “interested party”—to review the book. Instead, I offered to write reply, not a review, discussing the issues raised by the book. Professor Slater tried to prevent the publication of the article without success. It appeared in the Political Science Quarterly of March, 1971. The more I thought about it, the stranger the whole thing became. Here was a book, written by an academician, put out by a reputable publisher, attacking a book of mine on the basis of material which I could not consult or check. There was no way to know whether he had used the material fairly. Even if he had invented it, no one could be the wiser, though that was not a possibility seriously entertained. My own book, “The Dominican Revolt: A Case Study in American Policy,” which had appeared in 1968 but was based on articles mainly published in Commentary magazine in 1965–66, made use wholly of open sources, all of them given to the reader so that he or she could make up his or her own mind about the reasons for my reconstruction of the events and my views about them. To be attacked by someone who knew where everything I wrote came from but did not reveal where much of what he wrote came from did not seem altogether sporting. But Professor Slater was not the first or the last to benefit from this extraordinary favoritism on this very subject. In 1966, the Center for Strategic Studies at Georgetown University had brought out a book, “Dominican Action—1965,” which had also advertised that it was based on “restricted” sources. This book was backed by committee of three well‐known former United States diplomats and two Georgetown University professors. And while I was reading Professor Slater's book, I already knew that a third study of the very same subject, based on the same classified material used by Professor Slater, was on the way. This one, “The Dominican Intervention,” by Abraham F. Lowenthal, has since been published by the Harvard University Press. Still a fourth book which dealt in part with the same events on the basis of much classified material belongs in a somewhat different category because it was written by one of the actors in the story. It was “Overtaken By Events,” by John Bartlow Martin, President Kennedy's Ambassador to the Dominican Republic and President Johnson's hapless special emissary at the time of the revolt. Two or three other books might be added to the list. They were done by journalists who somehow or other managed to make use of some classified material. And, it should be remembered, we are now dealing with a single episode in American foreign policy in the last decade. All this seemed almost too much of a good thing. Or was it a good thing? Here were at least three books with some scholarly pretensions, one of them in good part directed against me, based on classified documents, obviously made available to the authors by high officials of the State Department. Yet I could not see the same material to defend myself or merely to check the books for accuracy. Or could I? After finishing Professor Slater's book, I decided to make myself a test case. I made up my mind to give the system a chance, to abide by all the rules, to do everything openly and legitimately. After all, I did not have to prove that at least two books (Lowenthal's had not yet appeared) had used classified material; they had boasted of it. All I wanted was the same privilege. So I wrote to Dr. William M. Franklin, Director of the Historical Office of the Department of State, the following letter: “I have just finished reading a recently published book by Jerome Slater entitled ‘Intervention and Negotiation: The United States and the Dominican Revolution,’ published by Harper & Row. “Professor Slater takes issue with me—I had put out a little book, ‘The Dominican Revolt,’ in 1968—partly on the basis of documents not now in the public domain, as he explains [in] his preface. These documents were evidently made available to him by the Department of State.... “Professor Slater's book seems to be the second one which was able to make use of ‘restricted’ primary sources, obviously originating in the Department of State. The first one to my knowledge was ‘Dominican Action—1965,’ issued by the Center for Strategic Studies, Georgetown University, in 1966. “I, therefore, ask for the same privilege to consult and use these documents or materials bearing on U.S. policy vis‐à‐vis the Dominican Republic in 1965. I will come to Washington at your earliest convenience.” Dr. Franklin took only a week to reply. He assured me that the Historical Office had not made any records pertaining to the Dominican crisis available to Professor Slater or to the Center for Strategic Studies of Georgetown University. He promised to investigate and to write me again as soon as he knew the facts. They're a privileged group, and they have, says the author, created, controlled and profited from a system shot through with duplicity, hypocrisy and favoritism. I promptly wrote him a second letter which went over the ground again in more detail and which read in part: “If they [the authors of the two books] did not get them [classified cables] from your office where did they get them? I applied to your office because I considered that the department has given your office the responsibility for its records. But if they can be obtained elsewhere, what is one in my position to do? Complain to the Secretary of State?” The right place to complain apparently was the Assistant Secretary of State, not the Secretary. Dr. Franklin replied 10 days later to the effect that since the Historical Office had had no contact with either Slater or the Georgetown group, he was referring my letter to the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter‐American Affairs, Charles A. Meyer. So I started all over again with Mr. Meyer. Another letter from me ended as follows: “This is a question which goes to the heart of scholarly work in contemporary history. Criticism has been made by eminent scholars of the existing regulations. But it is a scandal when the existing regulations are not equally and fairly enforced in the short period of five years. “I respectfully request, therefore, a review of the applicability of the existing regulations in my case. It is, admittedly, a special case—but it is special only in the sense that it is a documented case of how inequitably and unfairly the present system works.” Mr. Meyer mulled over the problem for a month. Then received this letter from him: “I have given your letter of Dec. 27, 1970, considerable thought, and I appreciate the reasons for your strong feelings on the matter of equal access by scholars to government documents. “I do not feel, however, that my personal sympathy for your position can override my responsibility for adhering to the regulations regarding access to classified material. ...I think strict and uniform compliance with these regulations is the only proper. course. I recognize that in the particular circumstances of your case, this may seem to be turning a deaf ear to an otherwise reasonable request. “I sincerely regret that the regulations do not allow me to be more forthcoming to your request, but I hope you will understand my unwillingness to assume responsibility for remedying the actions of predecessors when, as appears to be the case here, the cure would require a fresh departure from the regulations.” I thanked Mr. Meyer for his courtesy and candor. I took his letter to be a dead end. But one thing had been gained. As I read Mr. Meyer's letter, it came as close as could be expected in the circumstances to confirming that his “predecessors” had violated their own regulations regarding access to classified material. It should be remembered that those “predecessors” had acted less than three years earlier. I did not think that every Assistant Secretary of State should behave as if the United States Government in general and his department in particular were totally bereft of continuity and had no obligation to take so many precedents set so recently by previous officials into consideration. But there did not seem to be anything else I could do. Later I learned how Professor Slater had obtained access to the classified material. At least part of the story came out in a recent study called “Classified Files: The Yellowing Pages,” made by Carol M. Barker and Matthew H. Fox for The Twentieth Century Fund. Slater told them that in the spring of 1967 he had asked a State Department official with whom he was personally ac, quainted for an opportunity. to see the State Department records of the Dominican crisis. After some time had passed, Slater was informed that he could see the classified files, at that time only two years old. He had bypassed the Historical Office. Neither his notes nor his manuscript was reviewed for breaches of security. He was told by the State Department that there were only two restrictions on his use of the material—he could not quote directly from it or acknowledge his use of it. So much for the ardent zeal with which “security” is protected. Presumably much the same procedure was followed in the case of Dr. Lowenthal. Slater claimed that he was not told why he was given privileged access to the classified files. But he surmised, not without reason, that those in the senior levels of the department “genuinely believed that their policies and actions had been misunderstood and misrepresented, and fervently felt that if the whole truth were known, and honestly reported and evaluated, the public assessment of their policies would be very different.” In plain English, the senior levels of the department wanted Slater to go after me and thought that they could give him the ammunition to fire away by making the classified documents available to him. I don't think that Slater made a particularly good job of it, though that is for others who read his book and my reply to decide. In any case, the senior levels of the department must have been sorely disappointed by his book. Despite his efforts to undermine what I had written, he came out in the end almost as critical of United States policy as I had been and for much the same reasons. To Slater's credit, it must be said that he took the material and ran. He must have made his friend or friends in the State Department happy only in the first half of his book, not in his concluding chapter. Lowenthal's book was probably equally disappointing. From a scholarly point of view, these two books show how dangerous this under the table practice can be. Both sometimes refer to the same document without giving exactly the same version of what is in it. Yet no one else can check on them to find out just what the document did say. I can well understand why these young scholars agreed to use classified material under conditions that I, consider to be unscholarly and onerous. They were as much victims as beneficiaries of the present system. The scholarly competition is extremely keen, and anyone can justify playing this kind of questionable game on the ground that everyone else plays it—or would if he could. The Twentieth Century Fund study came to this conclusion: “The Dominican case is significant for its illustration of Government practices. State Department officials ignored the department's own rules for access to its own records; they clearly played favorites; and they violated the regulations for use of security‐classified records.” It was not always so. When William L. Langer and A. Everett Gleason wrote their studies of pre‐World War II foreign policy in the early nineteen‐fifties, “The Challenge to Isolation” and “The Undeclared War,” basing them on classified documents, they were able, according to Professor Langer's letter to The New York Times Book Review of Dec. 20, 1970, to get all such documents used by them automatically declassified. Interestingly, the only trouble encountered by them came from the Latin‐American Desk: If the previous practice were followed, much of the trouble would be avoided. For there are two main problems with the present system: (1) it withholds too much, for too long, and (2) it is not fair and equitable. The second problem is more easily solved than the first. But as long as the second problem persists, the first is often rendered nugatory. The material in the documents gets out but in the worst, most tendentious way imaginable. Not only do supposed servants of the people decide the people's fate but they reserve the right to decide when and how and what the people are going to learn about their fate. That is what more than 90 per cent of the classified documents are all about. We could live with the other 10 per cent if something could be done about the The real culprits are the high officials who use classified documents as political weapons. This practice is not restricted to the State Department. One of the most crucial and damaging (to President Johnson's Dominican mythology) documents of the Dominican crisis was shown to a well‐known Washington correspondent by a high C.I.A. official who presumably was not enchanted by the official policy. A portion of this document was quoted by the correspondent in a contemporary newspaper article and later in a book. Of course, the correspondent would have been out of his mind not to have taken advantage of this bene Another case in point was “The China White Paper” put out by the State Department in 1949. Its purpose was manifestly political—to counteract the attacks made on the Truman Administration's China policy. Towards this end, former Secretary of State Dean Acheson declassified 642 pages of documents, most of them in the “Top Secret” category. But at least the documents themselves were made available, and from a scholarly point of view, they were pure gain, even if they left something to be desired in the way of completeness. In the case of the Dominican documents, the practice vitiated whatever scholarly use they might have had. Not only were the documents themselves not made available, but the authors were not permitted to quote from them or to identify what they were using. It is of the essence of scholarly work that other scholars should be able to check on the material or to arrive at their own interpretations from the given body of evidence. A halfworld of quasi‐scholarship has been created in which the canons of traditional scholarship are perverted and, in the end, no one can be quite sure what was in the documents anyway. Congressional committees are not without fault. The Senate's high‐minded Committee on Foreign Relations held closed hearings on the Dominican crisis and classified the testimony. But one member of the committee invited two of the best‐known Washington correspondents to look at the testimony sub rosa, locked in a room with pencils and pads, and permitted to take notes (for only one hour!). Their articles on the closed hearings appeared the next day on the front pages of their newspapers. When I asked for the same privilege, it was sanctimoniously denied. THE more powerful the official, the less the classification system restrains him. The Presidents of the United States are in this respect the worst offenders. They seem to consider the entire system a convenience to give them a monopoly of state secrets until they are ready to get out their memoirs — for which publishers bid in the six‐ and seven‐figure range. If everyone followed the example set by Presidents, the classified files would be raided en masse and shred left of them. But Assistant Secretaries have also been known to take advantage of the rule that the classifier can also declassify. The same Assistant Secretary who has classified hundreds, if not thousands, of personal documents during his stay in office may, and has, declassified as many of them as he thinks necessary for that book he has in mind just as he is about to leave office. And if he is too squeamish to quote verbatim, he can always paraphrase. The New York Times recently requested the declassification of materials relating to a number of foreign‐policy questions. One of them, atcording to The Times's account of Nov. 22, 1972, pertained to “comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the Bay of Pigs invasion.” Among the requests that have not been granted was this one. If The Times's researchers will look at pages 187–190 of Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor's recent memoirs, “Swords and Plowshares,” they will find just what they are looking for. How did General Taylor happen to know so much? He was chairman of the committee appointed by President Kennedy to investigate the Bay of Pigs fiasco. His book contains an entire chapter which patently paraphrases his committee's report. If the report can come out in this form, why should it be withheld from The Times? Was the report declassified for General Taylor and no one else? Or didn't he bother to get its declassification? THE highest public officials in the land have set the example and established the tradition of using classified documents for political purposes. It is only when the example and the traditions are used against them that they call for the police, the handcuffs and the courts to uphold the sanctity of the law and the inviolability of Government regulations. It is precisely this double game that degrades the law and makes a mockery of “security.” If a plaintiff is supposed to come into court with clean hands, the Government's hands could not be The double game is rampant in Washington. For this reason there are actually two systems of classified documents. One is abstract and theoretical. The other is real and political. The arguments over first principles and fine points invariably concern the former. “Do you really mean that nothing should be classified?” “For God's sake, where are you going to stop?” The answers to such questions are not so difficult if the real, the political system is kept in mind. (1) Nothing should remain classified if the classifiers themselves do not abide by the system of classification. Whenever a classified document is made public by those in a privileged position, that document should be automatically declassified. As long as the highest officials in the land habitually use classified documents as political weapons, they cannot in good conscience deny the same use to their critics without debasing and perverting the rule of law. Every victim of the present system of classification testifies to the politicalization of the entire process and to its degeneration into a system of special privilege and bureaucratic decadence. The system needs cleaning up; it does not (2) Where should classification stop? It should stop at the borders of personal interest and partisan politics. The system of classified documents has become a scandal because it has been made to serve one‐sided personal and political ends. If the system were purged of personal selfinterest and political manipulation, many if not most of the present discontents would be greatly mitigated. There would still be problems, to be sure, but they could, be held within manageable limits and at least we would be spared the present flagrant inequities and hypocrisies. The case of the classified documents in the United States is remarkably similar to that of the woman charged with violating the antiabortion law in France. According to the report in The New York Times of Nov. 24, 1972, her action was defended in court by a French doctor, who was the dean of a Parisian teaching hospital, a practicing Catholic and an opponent of abortion on principle. But he believed that it was sometimes the best solution, and he testified that he himself occasionally performed abortions when the circumstances warranted them. The French Minister of Health summoned him imperiously for an official rebuke. The doctor protested that well‐todo women obtained abortions without risk, only the poor suffered from the law. Whereupon the Minister admonished the doctor that this was “not a reason why the vices of the rich should be made equally possible for the poor.” In American terms, this is the kind of double‐bookkeeping which, as in the case of the classified documents, protects the vices of the higher officialdom and persecutes those who are guilty of nothing else but following their example."
‘WOMEN'S LOBBY’ SEEKS NEW GOALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/04/archives/womens-lobby-seeks-new-goals-nofault-divorce.html,"A “women's lobby” and other coalitions that formed during the abortion‐defense alert, before the United States Supreme Court decision that defused their main issue, are now elated to find themselves holding together as they line up additional targets for their energies. “The abortion threat shook Ifs up and got us working together,” said Norine Connell of the New York Radical Feminists. Her group has joined the Feminist Coalition along with the Manhattan Women's Political Caucus and the New York City branch of the National Organization for Women. The statewide “women's lobby” includes various branches of the caucus; the NOW. One‐to‐One Committee, created to “monitor” individual legislators; the women's project of the New York Civil Liberties Union, and individual women from groups such as the Center for Constitutional Rights and the women's law clinic of the New York University Law School. Collective Action Their legislative “shopping lists”—a term a feminist would pounce on—are not all identical. But they are close enough to foretell collective action on “women's issues” that include the designation of pregnancy and childbirth as “temporary disabilities,” credit cards for women without reference to marital status and, perhaps, no‐fault divorce. Achieving the legislative package also will involve such questions as these: Can women under 21 be hired as train conductors? Should 14‐year‐olds be able to buy contraceptives in a candy store? Should rape be legally identical with assault? Still high on all the feminist agenda is—at the least—a wary defense against any new strategy to limit the 24‐week abortion provision and probably, beyond that, an effort to make abortion a purely medical matter by abolishing the law and any remaining legal restrictions outside of health codes. “We will also move in heavily on the campaign to wipe off the books all limitations on access to contraceptives,” said Rosalind Pulitzer, legislative chairman of the Manhattan Women's Political Caucus. “This is the obvious follow‐up to the concentration on abortion, which took priority only because it's a ‘desperation’ thing.” Contraceptives can now be sold only by licensed pharmacists and to no one under the age of 16, and cannot be advertised or displayed. May Glazer, lawyer and chairman of NOW's One‐toOne Committee, said that on some issues she was still waiting for upstate chapters to “tell me what their priorities are.” No‐Fault Divorce The New York‐NOW model divorce reform bill, drawn up last year, is not an immediate legislative demand and NOW is still debating its position on no‐fault divorce. “Divorce legislation is so complicated we'll have to look at bills as they come along,” Mrs. Pulitzer said. “You can't really legislate a 50‐50 marriage as long as there are all these women stuck with kids.” She said the “women's lobby” would support any legislation “to eliminate divorce and marriage inequities, probably including no‐fault divorce.” She predicted that divorce insurance “probably won't get off the ground—it's just an idea so far, and a tricky situation, too, if people who can't afford it just don't get married.” Linda Lamell, president of Long Bland‐NOW and chairman of the New York State Women's Political Caucus, considers that “the most immediate and crucial legislative change must come in the area of maternity leave, benefits and policies.” She and others in the lobby also give top priority to amending or repealing state laws governing disability benefits and employment practices to conform with the new Federal guidelines concerning discrimination because of pregnancy and childbirth, The guidelines have been issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Day‐Care Uppermost Most feminist groups consider day‐care to be “the next big women's issue in this state,” but say that the specifics during this legislative session depend on revenue‐sharing, and some are also waiting only for concrete legislative proposals concerning women in the prison and welfare systems. In Albany, the six women in the State Legislature—three in the Senate and three in the Assembly—are working on the own legislative “package.” “We will introduce it jointly, under all our names, in both houses,” Senator Mary Anne Krupsak said last week. “The abortion decision, coming as early as it did, took everybody by surprise, but it opened up great new possibilities. We're going over the present laws with a fine‐tooth comb, looking for sex‐discriminatory wording; we're working closely with departments and we're hearing from women all over the state.”"
‘WOMEN”S LOBBY’ SEEKS NEW GOALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/04/archives/womens-lobby-seeks-new-goals-daycare-uppermost.html,"A “women”s lobby” and other coalitions that formed during the abortion‐defense alert, before the United States Supreme Court decision that defused their main issue, are now elated to find themselves holding together as they line up additional targets for their energies. “The abortion threat shook us up and got us working together,” said Norine Connell of the New York Radical Feminists. Her group has joined the Feminist Coalition along with the Manhattan Women”s Political Caucus and the New York City branch of the National Organization for Women. The statewide “women”s lobby” includes various branches of the caucus; the NOW. One‐to‐One Committee, created to “monitor” individual legislators; the women”s project of the New York Civil Liberties Union, and individual women from groups such as the Center for Constitutional Rights and the women”s law clinic of the New York University Law School. Collective Action Their legislative “shopping lists”—a term a feminist would pounce on—are not all identical. But they are close enough to foretell collective action on “women”s issues” that include the designation, of pregnancy and childbirth as “temporary disabilities,” credit cards for women without reference to marital status and, perhaps, no‐fault divorce. Achieving the legislative package also will involve such questions as these: Can women under 21 be hired as train conductors? Should 14‐year‐olds be able to buy contraceptives in a candy store? Should rape be legally identical with assault? Still high on all the feminist agenda is—at the least—a wary defense against any new strategy to limit the 24‐week abortion provision and probably, beyond that, an effort to make abortion a purely medical, matter by abolishing the law and any rent ining legal restrictions outside of health codes. “We will also move in heavily on the campaign to wipe off the books all limitations on access to contraceptives,” said Rosalind Pulitzer, legislative chairman of the Manhattan Women”s Political Caucus. “This is the obvious follow‐up to the concentration on abortion, which took priority only because it”s a ‘desperation’ thing.” Contraceptives can now be sold only by licensed pharmacists and to no one under the age of 16, and cannot be advertised or displayed.

Court vs. Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/04/archives/whose-rules-of-evidence-court-vs-congress.html,"WASHINGTON—Can the Supreme Court make fundamental changes in the rights of accused criminals by administrative fiat? That was the question posed last November by the Court's promulgation of a new set of rules of criminal evidence for the Federal court system. Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee reacted by shooting out onto the floor a bill that would postpone the effective date of the new code until the end of 1974. At the other end of the Capitol, a special House Judiciary Subcommittee prepared to open hearings Tuesday on the specific changes the Court has ordered and the broader question of whether they might better have been achieved by legislation. Rules of evidence determine what kind of information a judge will allow a jury to hear in a criminal case and can thus materially affect its outcome. The Supreme Court has statutory authority to draft procedural rules for the Federal courts, but some critics feel that evidence limits partake more of substance than procedure. The Court's new evidence rules are not easily summarized. Until now, the Federal courts have had nothing comparable, each judicial circuit ying on a different patchwork of common law, state law and precedents. The Court's uniform code is more than 40 pages long and covers a good deal of territory, from admissibility to expert testimony to cross‐examination. There are several controversial provisions. One would set up a new “secrets of state” classification for some Government documents, thereby barring their use in Federal trials, Another would remove the present rule, in effect in a number of jurisdictions, making conversations between husband and wife privileged, or unavailable as evidence. Most Federal courts now also recognize a similar protection for communications between doctors and patients. The new code eliminates this too, only retaining a psychotherapist‐patient privilege. Critics charge that such changes in the law differ qualitatively from merely laying down procedural guidelines for criminal trial. Such basic recasting of the Federal Criminal Code, they say, should only be undertaken by Congress under full public scrutiny, not by an appointed committee and a Court whose deliberations are closed. But, most important of all, some legal authorities foresee serious trouble ahead if the Senate and House allow the Court's substantive changes to go into effect unchallenged. “Let's say John Doe is charged with armed robbery, and the new rules are in effect,” one attorney explained. “The prosecution puts his doctor on the stand and questions him about treating Doe for bullet wounds. Doe's lawyer objects on the grounds that this involves a confidential doctorpatient communication. “The prosecution argues that this privilege was wiped out by the new rules of evidence. The defense says it wasn't because the Supreme Court had no power to make such a basic change without recourse to legislative process. The judge rules for the prosecution, Doe is convicted and he appeals on the grounds that he was the victim of inadmissible evidence. “That appeal winds up before the Supreme Court, eight of whose nine members have already voted on the record in support of the rule change on which Doe's guilt or innocence hinges. Are they going to admit they made a mistake, or, even less likely, that they exceeded their judicial powers?” Such a situation is far from hypothetical in the eyes of knowledgable lawyers, who fear that it could not only create unprecedented legal problems but also tend to undermine public confidence in the impartiality of the Supreme Court. Associate Justice William O. Douglas, the sole dissenter to the Court's approval of the rules, noted that they had actually been drafted by an appointive committee and only routinely ratified by the justices, adding: “Yet the public assumes that our imprimatur is on the rules.” That imprimatur, unquestioned when it covered drastic changes in the capital punishment and abortion laws, is about to be tested by a concerned and uneasy Congress."
GOVERNOR SCORES BUCKLEY'S MOVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/04/archives/governor-scores-buckleys-move-governors-comment-pernicious-ruling.html,"ALBANY, Feb. 3—Governor Rockefeller said today that Senator James L. Buckley's plan to introduce a Constitutional Amendment to overturn the United States Supreme Court's recent abortion ruling “would feed divisiveness which the court's decision has abated.” The Governor said that the plan was “no doubt a sincere personal expression” by Senator Buckley, a ConservativeRepublican of New York. “But it has the unfortunate potential of being dangerously divisive when America needs a time of healing,” Mr. Rockefeller added in a statement issued here. Senator Buckley said in New York City two days ago that he would introduce the amendment to nullify the Supreme Court's decision of last month “at the earliest practicable date.” ‘Pernicious’ Ruling Seen Mr. Buckley described the decision as “pernicious.” He accused the High Court of abandoning “not only a long line of legal precedents in this country but also more than 2,000 years of humane wisdom.” The Senator said he was still consulting legal and medical experts before drafting the amendment. But “at the very least,” he told newsmen, “the amendment will have the effect of allowing the individual states “to make their own laws regarding abortion.” Mr. Buckley asserted that only four states have “liberal” abortion laws now and he noted that voters in Michigan and North Dakota had rejected permissive abortion proposals last November. The Supreme Court, in a 7 to 2 ruling on Jan. 22, overruled all state laws that prohibit or restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion during her first three months of pregnancy. For the last six months of pregnancy, a state may “regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health,” the court said. And, in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, the court held, a state may ban abortions, if it wishes, except where they may be necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Governor's Comment Mr. Rockefeller said this, afternoon that the court's decision “gives us a national policy in place of numerous state‐bystate abortion debates. The dedecisidn,” he said, “can have a calming effect on the potential and potent emotionalism this issue inevitably arouses.” The Governor said that the Supreme Court's ruling, like the current New York law, “does not compel any woman who opposes abortion to have one against her wishes. Nor does the decision force upon our entire society the vision of morality of one group in that society.” Mr. Rockefeller vetoed legislation last year to repeal the liberalized New York abortion statute adopted in 1970. Under the New York law abortion is permitted until the 24th week of pregnancy, and even later if the mother's life is endangered. While the Governor said last month that he did not foresee a need for any “major” changes in the law as a result of the Supreme Court decision, some legislators here say the law may have to be amended to include a provision allowing abortion in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy to protect a mother's health. Many legislators who led the fight in 1970 for the present statute have also introduced legislation to permit abortions at any stage of pregnancy."
South Korea Will Legalize Abortions in Some Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/04/archives/south-korea-will-legalize-abortions-in-some-cases.html,"SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 3 (AP)—Abortion will be legalized on a limited basis in South Korea within three months under a new health law approved by the Extraordinary State Council. The law allows abortion's when a woman is in bad health, when one of the parents suffers from a hereditary or infectious disease or when pregnancy results from incest or rape. Although abortions are now prohibited by the criminal code, many women have had them illegally. The law approved this week also provides that persons suffering from hereditary mental or physical diseases may be sterilized with the approval of the health minister."
Assembly To Consider New Statute On Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/04/archives/assembly-to-consider-new-statute-on-abortion-cahill-has-no-bill.html,"TRENTON — The Assembly's Judiciary Committee will discuss this week a new abortion statute for New Jersey. The committee's action is in response to a request by Attorney General George F. Kugler Jr., who last week released his long‐awaited views on the Supreme Court's decision on abortion — that ruling was handed down on Jana 22—and set new liberal guidelines for licensed physicians in the state. Mr. Kugler said that physicians could now perform abortions to preserve the health and well‐being of the mother, a sharp departure from the prior state policy of allowing abortions generally only to preserve the life of the mother. Because of the state's prior antiabortion policy, there are now no medical guidelines in the law books. The Attorney General said he was concerned that unsanitary, backroom abortion mills might spring up as a result of the state's new liberal position. Mr. Kugler declared that he intended to crack down hard on anyone, except licensed physicians, who performed abortions. Also, he urged the Legislature to enact a new, “more‐comprehensive” abortion statute so as to regulate the medical circumstances under which abortions can be performed and to set guidelines for when they will be permitted during the last months of pregnancy. A Repository for Bills The Judiciary Committee served as the repository for a number of abortion bills in the months before the Supreme Court decision. A conservative measure that would have permitted abortions only to save the life of the mother—it was sponsored by Assemblyman Brian Kennedy, Republican of Monmouth—had attracted the support of Roman Catholic and Protestant “rightto‐life” groups. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, it had been given the best chance of getting out of committee. Mr. Kennedy now concedes that his bill cannot stand in the face of the High Court decision, but he said he would not amend it or support a more liberal measure. Assemblyman Elridge Hawkins, Democrat of Essex, had introduced a package of three liberal bills, including an abortion‐on‐demand measure that was patterned after the New York law. He demanded the release of two of his bills immediately after the Supreme Court ruling. Assemblyman William K. Dickey, Republican of Camden and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that the committee would have to come up with its own bill, if only to set medical guidelines requested by Mr. Kugler. There is also room for establishing a more conservative policy on the last three months of pregnancy, when the fetus has a greater chance of a separate existence outside the mother. This is expected to prompt considerable debate within the committee. Cahill Has No Bill Mr. Kugler said that the Administration had no bill of its own to suggest to the lawmakers. Governor Cahill, a Catholic, has taken no position on the abortion question, but he says he will not let his personal religious convictions rule his judgment on any measure that reaches his desk after passing both houses of the Legislature. Hospital administrators also are looking for added guidance from the Legislature. Some do not want to perform abortions, and others want decision‐making procedures spelled out so that physicians are rot subjected to second‐guessing. Jack Owen, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said that hospital boards would like to see a requirement that, after the first three months of pregnancy, any abortion decision must be concurred in by a panel of doctors. The High Court ruled that abortion during the first three months was a matter between the pregnant women and her physician. Mr. Kugler also feels that the Supreme Court left several important questions unanswered because they were not specifically included in the cases under review. These include the right of the father to oppose the abortion, the right of a minor girl to seek an abortion without parental consent and the question of whether hospitals receiving state or Federal aid must accommodate abortions. Mr. Owen said hospitals should be allowed to make that decision for themselves, as they are in New York. Catholic hospitals are not expected to permit abortions, but some other institutions, including Point Pleasant Hospital, also have indicated they will adhere to their prior “no abortion” policy."
345 French Doctors Fight for Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/06/archives/345-french-doctors-fight-for-abortion-us-decision-has-impact-put.html,"PARIS, Feb. 5—In an act of defiance against both the Government and the law, 345 French doctors admitted publicly today that they had performed abortions. The signers of a manifesto for “freedom of abortion” —some highly respected in their specialities—risked penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines as high as $14,000. Theoretically, they could also be barred from practice. Their action puts the authorities and the French Medical Society into a quandary. The government of this predominantly Roman Catholic country has conceded that the existing law is outdated—President Pompidou said so himself last month—but has done nothing about it. For those who rule France the re‐igniting of such a controversial and emotional issue comes at a particularly bad time. Elections for the National Assembly are only four weeks away. Prominent and knowledgeable professionals are increasingly aligning themselves on the side of abortion and of universal, cheap access to contraception. In the provinces the Gaullist electorate tends to be conservative on matters of sex legislation. If the Government gives in on abortion, it would be certain to lose support in the provinces, as might not be the case in Paris. However, the issue transcends party lines. While the fundamentally conservative medical society, a body with absolute power to license and suspend physicians, has favored applying the abortion law strictly, it now finds that it may have difficulty enforcing its point of view against determined opposition. U.S. Decision Has Impact Moreover, the campaign to liberalize the law has been given new impetus by the recent United States Supreme Court decision giving American women the unqualified right to obtain an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. In a further development here, 250 professional people, some of them celebrated in France, are expected to issue another manifesto Wednesday. They will, in effect, announce that they consider themselves jointly responsible for abortions that physicians among them have performed over the last three months “in circumstances where interruption of pregnancy appeared an absolute moral obligation.” This group is not composed solely of doctors; the list of signers will include deans of medical schools, lawyers, Protestant clergymen, Catholic priests and members of the College de France, a renowned school of advanced studies. In the declaration published today, in the leftist weekly Nouvel Observateur, the doctors said that all France had recently become aware that this was “one of the last countries living in the Middle Ages in matters of sexuality and abortion.” ‘Put Off Indefinitely’ “Despite hundreds of thousands of clandestine abortions and their dramatic consequences, the people in power and the council of the medical society obstinately refuse to take account of this reality; they put off indefinitely all modification of existing legislation.” The manifesto pointed out that it was the poor who suffered most, while those with the means could have abortions “in all security abroad, and even in France.” “France, ‘the country’ of liberty,’ does not give women the liberty to control their own bodies,” the manifesto declared, “Sexual education does not exist. The law on contraception is not applied. Couples are deprived of information permitting them to achieve their sexual equilibrium and to choose the moment they wish to bring a child into the world.” The manifesto further asserted that the National Family Planning Program had just been refused recognition as a “useful, nonprofit organization,” preventing it from receiving state subsidies. The physicians urged that abortion be made available on demand of the woman concerned, the cost to be reimbursed by social security. They also asked that the means of contraception be made available to everyone, including minors. Ready to Face Consequences The signers said they were performing or helping to perform abortions “outside of all financial considerations.” They also “solemnly” pledged to answer for their actions collectively “before all judicial or medical authority as well as before public opinion.” The list of signers, which gave full names and specialties and the region of France in which they practice, included a number of gynecologists, pediatricians and psychiatrist's as well as other specialists. Many live in Paris and the surrounding area. They denounced “moralistic doctors—the kind who say: ‘I'm going to make it painful for those women to teach them a lesson so they will not do it again,’ and the ‘mercenary doctors’ who perform curettages without anesthesia for 1,500 francs [$300].” Sensation and Uproar The publication of the appeal has created a sensation because the signers are doctors. It is even more impressive than the publication almost two years ago in Nouvel Observateur of a list of 343 women who admitted they had undergone abortions. That list, including prominent figures in the arts, letters, theater and films, provoked an uproar. In recent months a series of court cases has focused attention on the abortion statute. The most poignant involved a 16‐year‐old girl, Marie‐Claire Chevalier, who was acquitted last October of the crime of having an abortion. Many leading intellectuals had testified in her defense. A month later Marie‐Claire's mother was given a suspended sentence for having arranged the abortion. The abortionist's sentence was also suspended."
FLEXIBILITY URGED IN NARCOTIC CAM,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/06/archives/flexibility-urged-in-narcotic-cases-conservatives-and-wright-would.html,"ALBANY, Feb. 5—The Conservative party in the state and the chairman of the Legislature's black caucus urged today that Governor Rockefeller modify his proposal for mandatory life imprisonment for all adult drug dealers. The Conservatives proposed in their annual legislative program that the life term be an “available sentence” rather than a mandatory one for street dealers. The party would leave it to the judge to decide whether mandatory life was required by the circumstances of the case. But the Conservatives also recommended that the judge have another option—the death penalty — in sentencing major importers and wholesalers of illicit drugs. Black Caucus Splitv In a separate interview, the chairman of the black caucus, Assemblyman Samuel D. Wright, Democrat of Brooklyn, said that he and some others in his group felt that Mr. Rockefeller's broad proposal should be softened to distinguish between high‐volume, professional narcotics dealers who “plague” a community and addict victims who sell mainly to maintain their habit. In the morning Mr. Wright estimated that this might be the “general view” of the caucus, but this evening, after meeting of the group, he reported: “Some members strongly favor the Governor's position and others want to soften it.” While differing with the sweep of, the Governor's proposal, both Mr. Wright and J. Daniel Mahoney, the Conservative party's state chairman, said that more stringent measures were required to deal with illegal drug trafficking. The caucus has 14 black members and four Puerto Ricans. Mr. Wright offered no breakdown on where the members stood on the issue following last night's meeting. There has been some speculation that the Governor's proposal might create special political problems for lawmakers from minority areas, whose residents suffer heavily from narcotics‐related crime. Mr. Wright said, however, that his initial reading of his constituents' reaction was “about 50‐50”—half in favor of mandatory life and half who see the need for more gradations of punishment while still strengthening the law. Victims Back Governor “Those who agreed with the Governor, of course, generally have been victims of crime,” the Assemblyman noted. “Every house, on my block, for instance, has been broken into except mine—I have two vicious dogs. I find as I explain things to the people, they see the point [about making distinctions in the Governor's proposal].” Another part of the Conservatives' program would amend the present penalties for Class A and Class B felonies, including drug violations, to provide for mandatory minimum sentences. The present range for Class B prison terms is zero to 25 years, and for Class A, 15 or 25 years to life. These sentences provide for possible parole—a contingency that would be denied under Governor Rockefeller's mandatory life plan. The Governor's proposal also would mandate life behind bars for adults who commit violent crimes under the influence of narcotics, The Conservatives issued a general call for “stringent punishment for crimes of violence.” They also would deny bail to defendants with felony records. Conservatives ‘Pleased’ Mr. Mahoney said the Conservatives' call for stricter drug penalties was basically a repetition of past policy. “We're pleased,” he said, “to see a more general and more widespread appreciation of this point by the Governor and a lot of other people.” Mr. Wright said: “My constituents are for stringent enforcement of the laws and greater penalties.” They vary on precisely what to do, he said, with the most agreement on the point that upper‐echelon dealers and profiteers deserve the worst penalties. The Conservative program also included proposals for tax reductions and tighter budget controls, a Federal Constitutional amendment to overrule the Supreme Court's decision in favor of legalized abortion, a ban against compulsory sex education and opposition to new civilian gun controls."
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/06/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1973 The Major Events of the Day International The Saigon Government has released thousands of military and civilian prisoners in the last few days despite provisions of the Paris peace agreement, sources in South Vietnam said yesterday. The prisoners—both prisoners of war and political detainees—were given the equivalent of $2.50 and turned loose, the sources said. Estimates of the number of prisoners released conflicted. [Page 1, Column 8.] International peace‐keeping teams fanned out across South Vietnam yesterday, but had not yet begun their work of monitoring violations of the cease‐fire agreement. As the teams moved into place in seven provincial centers, it became increasingly clear that the South Vietnamese Government had, in procedural matters, outmaneuvered and virtually stalemated the Communist delegates from North Vietnam and the Vietcong. [1:7.] Delegates from the Saigon Government and the Vietcong met alone together in Paris for the first time, their purpose to prepare for the South Vietnamese political negotiations provided in the cease‐fire agreements, The Paris negotiations are to test whether the two sides can eventually reach a nonviolent settlement of their generation‐long dispute. [12:1–2.] Forty‐one major paintings of the Impressionist and post‐Impressionist periods from the Soviet Union collections in the Hermitage State Museum in Leningrad and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow will be shipped to the United States next month for showing in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the Knoedler Gallery in Manhattan. It will be the first time that the Soviet Union had sent a group of paintings for exhibition here; heretofore only individual works had been loaned. [1:5.6.] National The White House reported that President Nixon was holding $8.7‐billion in reserve—substantially less than estimated by a Democratic Congressman last month. Representative Joe J. Evins of Tennessee had said that impoundments, which have become the focus of the struggle between Congress and the President, totaled at least $12.2‐billion. But the White House total did not include the $6‐billion water pollution control funds that Mr. Nixon has refused to allocate. [1:1.] The Senate voted overwhelmingly to require ;confirmation, for the first time, of the director and deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the White House. Voting 64 to 17, the Senate thus moved to create another battleground in the dispute between Congress and the White House over cuts in social spending programs in the current Federal budget and in the Administration's spending request for fiscal 1974. [1.2–3.] The nation's airports won a temporary restraining order blocking for 10 days the execution of an emergency Presidential order requiring armed local law enforcement officers to be stationed at airline gates before take‐off time of all scheduled passenger flights. The order had been scheduled to take effect at midnight last night. 11:2–3.] The Army buried Col. William B. Nolde in Arlington National. Cemetery in Virginia and laid to rest, symbolically at least, its years of torment in Vietnam, Colonel Nolde, promoted posthumously from lieutenant colonel, was the last American killed in action before the Vietnam cease‐fire took effect. He was 43 years old, the father of five children and lived in Mt. Pleasant, Mich. After the burial his widow and other members of the family visited the White House and spent about 15 minutes with the President. [1:2–6.] Metropolitan Nicholas Heil, chairman of the New Jersey Parole Board, said that the board was reviewing all paroles that were processed by Dr. William King, the state prison staff psychiatrist who has been charged with plotting the murder of his former wife and two members of her family. Mr. Heil said the board's review would cover about 400 rejected parole requests that had come under Dr. King's jurisdiction, and an as yet undetermined number of cases in which Dr. King's reports had been a key factor in granting parole. [1:6–7:] Francis Waters, who had been the principal Federal narcotics agent in the celebrated “French Connection” case of 1962, and who has been an East Side bartender and an investigator for crime writers since his resignation, has been indicted on charges of selling heroin and cocaine, Federal authorities announced, He left the now‐defunct Federal Bureau of Narcotics in 1967.

Illinois Abotiion Law Void,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/08/archives/illinois-abortion-law-void.html,"CHICAGO, Feb. 7 (UPI)—A judge ruled today that the Illinois abortion law was unConstitutional and dismissed charges against a woman accused of performing an abortion 2½ years ago. Judge Marvin E. Aspen of Cook County Circuit Court relied in his ruling on a United States Supreme Court decision of Jan. 23, which struck ddwn abortion laws in Georgia and Texas similar to the Illinois law. He threw out charges against Mary Beth Kain, 50 years old."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/08/archives/letters-to-the-editor-another-view-of-the-nixon-record-taking-the.html,"To the Editor: What is especially disturbing about President Nixon's special counsel Charles Colson's Jan. 30 Op‐Ed article, “The Georgetown Blacking Factory,” is not the importance of the charges it makes—for they are as absurd as those Mr. Colson claims were made by his “adversaries”—but the care with which, he sought to set the record straight on a matter of colossal unimportance, except for propaganda purposes. President Nixon has gathered around him a large group of P. R. men to “get the record straight” who can only be described as amateur Josef Goebbelses. Mr. Colson attempts to show that there is a “left‐wing” conspiracy to tell nasty lies about Henry Kissinger's relationship with Richard Nixon. It is made up of Dan Rather who, has “twenty million faithful followers,” the “Georgetown cocktail circuit,” Joseph Kraft of The Washington Post, George McGovern, John Osborne of The New Republic, Newsweek and Time magazines, Clark Clifford, Tom Braden, and Senator McGovern's other “fuzzyheaded friends.” It is difficult to tell whether Mr. Colson's mental impairments are congenital or feigned. On thing is “perfectly clear,” however, and that is that no one in his right mind would either equate political opposition and news reporting from other perspectives as a conspiracy or as calculated to sabotage the peace talks. Mr. Colson complains that the media have created a “myth” and “erroneous [sic] impressions” about a split in the Nixon‐ Kissinger relationship which they have “elevated to gospel,” which is “holy writ to the sellout brigades.” Mr. Colson's excessive concern with creating the right impressions about the Administration of King Richard the Last is too much to take silently. He equates reporting of unfavorable stories with “a gleeful feeling” that “the peace talks would fail.” He thus, as always in this authoritarian Administration of secrecy, “protective reactions,” “incursions,” impounded funds and paid history‐fabricators, makes opposition and reportorial disagreement (those who wished the worst for America's course in Indochina“) tantamount to treason by reason of giving aid and comfort to “the enemy.” Second, he regards the media as tools of Administration policy at home and abroad and is quick to take them to task for not telling the Administration's version of The Truth. Third is a belief that we must maintain the consistency and continuity of history even if it is made up of lies, because if people know the truth about the Indochina “war,” the Government will lose its needed support. This last antidemocratic belief is a reason for the lack of admission of a break with the goals of the Johnson Administration in Indochina and of the attempt to suppress publication of the Pentagon Papers. One might suggest that if Mr. Colson is interested in dispelling an important myth it should be the one that “peace with honor” was sought or has been achieved. What that phrase means is difficult to understand. It seems to he a catch phrase for deceiving oneself that one has not lost a war one has failed to win. If, on the other hand, “honor” means worthy of respect and dignity, one can hardly conclude that that word has anything to do with the incineration of countless men, women and children who “wished the worst for America's course in Indochina.” MARTIN SORIN New York, Jan. 31, 1973 • Taking the 5th on the 1st To the Editor: Your Jan. 23 editorial “Securing Press Freedom,” which calls for Congressional legislation to give newsmen immunity from court‐Ordered requirements to reveal their sources of information, is in effect a plea for a preferred position in American society, a position no other economic enterprise enjoys. I do not see why the press alone should be awarded protective custody of a principle which, while regarded as a universal value by the public, is more particularly a vested economic interest for the press. The news media are entitled to all rights of expression within the laws of libel, but it is preposterous to assume that the Founding Fathers intended to establish an institution above the law or to place obstacles in the way of orderly government procedure. Nor can the soph istries expressed in your editorial convince me that the Fathers proposed the First Amendment as a privileged sanctuary for any action the media feel appropriate, and expected that newsmen would take the Fifth on the First, so to speak. ALAN L. BENOSKY Garden City, L. I., Jan. 29, 1973 A Failure to Understand To the Editor: Your Jan. 24 editorial “Respect for Privacy” invites us to “pause . . . to recognize the limits” of the Supreme Court's decision on abortion: “It has not ordered any mother to have an abortion. It has left the decision . .. to the woman and her physician.” It should go without saying that this passage is—from the point of view of someone who is convinced that the unborn has a right to life which ought to be protected—as ridiculous as the following statements: “Why are you opposed to legalizing slavery? No one will order you to have a slave. The decision will be left up to you” or “Why are you opposed to permitting the oppression of women? No one will order you to do it yourself.” The passage quoted above betrays either a complete failure to understand the position against which the editorial claims to argue or an almost unbelievable degree of cynicism. FRITZ WENXSCH Narragansett, R. I., Jan. 25, 1973 Concern Over Curriculum To the Editor: James L. Buckley, Nemi York Conservative‐Republican Senator, who has been a strong supporter of the Nationalist (Chiang Kai‐shek) Chinese Government on Taiwan and who has recently “registered misgivings about President Nixon's trip to mainland China,” now, in a letter to the State Education Department, expresses anxiety over the department's Chinastudies curriculum. He says it “could constitute subtle propaganda for Peking.” Senator Buckley's suspicions apparently are aroused by the employment by the department of the wellknown sinologist Jack Chen as lecturer on contemporary Chinese affairs in state colleges and universities and to gather materials in this area for teaching in schools. Ewald B. Nyquist, State Commissioner of Education, says that Mr. Chen “is in no way developing a master curriculum for teaching about China in all schools,” adding that he believes “education is best served by permitting all points of view to be expressed.” To my knowledge, Mr. Chen is eminently fitted for this work. Son of Eugene Chen, Foreign Minister of China in 1927, he has lived in the People's Republic of China since 1950, returning to the U.S in 1971. He is a journalist and artist whose articles have appeared in many publications, here and abroad. He is internationally recognized as an authority on modern China. It seems obvious to me that Senator Buckley is attempting, for political purposes, to use the old discredited Joe McCarthy anti‐Communist tactic—questioning (usually without a scintilla of hard evidence) the fitness of some subordinate in an administrative agency with whose pdlicies the Senator disagrees, on the implication that the man is an agent of the “Communist conspiracy” to overthrow our Government. Senator Buckley is an extremely literate, well‐educated man. I am sure he is familiar with John Stuart Mill's famous dictum which is relevant here. I suggest he re‐read it, digest it and follow its wise advice. It goes like this: “He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that. Nor is it enough that he should hear the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. He must be able to hear them from those who actually believe them; who defend them in earnest and do their utmost for them.” TAYLOR ADAMS New York, Jan. 29, 1973 The Metropolitan Museum: Exchanges and Programs To the Editor: The price Marlborough Gallery had been asking since late 1969 for the David Smith “Becca” was $250,000. There is no comparable piece available from any other source. I believe David Smith to be the most important American sculptor of the twentieth century and “Becca” to be one of his greatest achievements. I twice tried to buy the sculpture with the use of general purchase funds but, because there are seventeen curatorial departments all eager to spend this limited amount of money, I failed twice. The only practical way to acquire it was through exchange. The pictures we exchanged were by artists who have painted masterpieces. None of these was a masterpiece or even of sufficient significance to hang in our galleries. Almost every great artist occasionally paints an insignificant work. By exchanging them, they went back on the market and will almost surely end up more visible than they were in our basement, whether in someone's home or in another museum. I had wanted a Richard Diebenkorn in the collection for years. After receiving independent appraisals from two well‐known New York art dealers, I requested that in addition to the David Smith sculpture, the Diebenkorn (offered for sale at $15,000) be added to complete the proposed exchange. It is a fine picture and has been on continuous view since its purchase. The David Smith “Becca” was prominently displayed in the New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970 exhibition in the fall of 1969 and will be put on permanent exhibition in the near future. HENRY GELDZAHLER Curator, Twentieth Century Art The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York, Jan. 25, 1973 • To the Editor: In response to Charlotte Devree's letter of Jan. 23, posing the question of why the Metropolitan Museum should be “in the business of trying to be a community center for neighborhoods,” I will tell you why. The Metropolitan Museum was incorporated as a not‐for‐profit institution, with its educational responsibility explicitly outlined in its charter, which specifies that the Metropolitan will “encourage and develop a study of the fine arts, and the application of arts to manufacture and practical life; advance the general knowledge of kindred subjects and to that end, furnish popular instruction.” In return for fulfillment of that edu cational obligation, including the development of the arts for the benefit of the commonweal, the Metropolitan enjoys tax exemption from Federal, state and city taxes. Further, the Metropolitan in 1972‐73 is authorized to receive $4,910,203—or approximately 18 per cent of its total operating budget for that year—from tax funds from the city. Those funds come from taxes paid to the city by all its residents—eight‐million of them. Not only does the Metropolitan have a moral responsibility to all those taxpayers, it has a legal one as well, which it is required by law to perform. Mrs. Devree is entirely correct when she states that the Metropolitan's business is “to guard and display its collection, to educate in various ways.” The crucial question here, it seems to me, is: To educate whom? Only an upper and middle class elite, accustomed to the rigorous codes of behavior required of a museum visit, an elite to whom the art on the walls of the Metropolitan is comprehensible? Valid education begins with the perceptions of the person to be educated: what he knows, feels, cares about, responds to. There are eight million people in New York City, and the Metropolitan last year registered 2.5 million Visits. The community programs which the Metropolitan is undertaking is a beginning recognition of those other 5.5‐million who will never walk through those doors on Fifth Avenue. It is an affirmation of the Metropolitan's belief in the power of art to touch all people, of the Metropolitan's moral and legal responsibility to educate beyond the 2.5 million who happen to find galleryviewing compatible with their own life style and educational traditions. I say “right on” with the Met's community programs. They are an acknowledgment that the right to share in the cultural riches of this city belongs to all its residents, and is not the privilege of the elite alone.

RHODE ISLAND'S BAN ON ABORTIONS UPSET,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/09/archives/rhode-islands-ban-on-abortions-upset.html,"PROVIDENCE, R. I., Feb. 8 (AP)—A three‐judge Federal court declared Rhode Island's strict anti‐abortion law unconstitutional today. In a four‐page opinion, it found the statute “virtually identical” with the Texas abortion law struck down last Jan. 22 by the United States SuIpreme Court. That decision, the Federal court here said, “makes it clear that the Rhode Island statute prohibiting abortions is unconstitutional on its face.” Both the Texas and Rhode Island laws allowed abortions only when they were deemed necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. The Federal court also ruled that because the anti‐abortion law is unconstitutional, the state's ban on abortion counseling is also unconstitutional. RICHMOND, Feb. 8 (AP)—Virginia's House of Delegates voted down today a bill that would have brought the state's abortion laws into conformity with the Supreme Court deciSion. The Virginia law was liberalized last year but still permits abortions only if the health of the woman is threatened or if the child appears certain to be born deformed. DO NOT FORGET THE NEEDIEST! similar material from the Congressional Record. “The Congressional Record is a public document, isn't it?” he asked. “Absolutely,” replied the general. This, of course, touched on the public domain. It was also offered apparently to show that what General Gorman considered military secrets Mr. Garver and the Congressional Record seemed to think was merely history. During his direct testimony, General Gorman gave as an example of information in the Pentagon papers that would damage the national defense tithe report on America's discovery of a surface‐to‐air missile site in North Vietnam in the spring of 1965, He said that even if that information was made available in 1969 it would damage the national defense. This afternoon, Mr. Weinglass had the general read to the jury a clipping from The New York Times giving details of the sighting several days after it had been made, a State Department press release announcing the sighting 10 days after it had been made and, finally, a report on the sighting by Adm. Ulysses S. Grant Sharp Jr., commander of American forces in the Pacific from 1964 to 1968. “Is it your testimony that Admiral Sharp gave out information that injured the United States?” Mr. Weinglass asked. “No,” was the reply."

Sues ‘Massage Parlor’ The Fire Department went to court yesterday to force a “massage parlor” to allow it to inspect the premises for compliance with fire regulations. It said a fireman had been refused admittance Jan. 24 to make such a check and was told to produce a search warrant. The department obtained a show‐cause order from a State Supreme Court justice, Abraham J. Gellinoff, directing the Gemini Club of 19 East 48th Street, and a club representative, Robert Rowland, to appear in court Friday to show why an inspection warrant should not be issued. The department said two violations had been found on routine inspections on Aug. 8 and Nov. 13 last year. According to a Fire Department spokesman, firemen have the right to force their way in to fight a fire but not to make inspections, for which a court order is required. Catholics Warned on Abortions The five Roman Catholic Bishops of Connecticut issued a reminder that any Catholic directly involved in an abortion faced excommunication from the church. The nine‐point statement was issued in the expectation that abortions would soon be legal in the state. The existing law in Connecticut allows an abortion only to save a pregnant woman's life, but that statute has been declared unconstitutional by a Federal District Court here and the matter is now before the United States Supreme Court. It recently overturned abortion laws of Texas and Georgia that were less severe than the Connecticut law. Bronx Bank Robbed of $25,000 Four men robbed a Bronx branch of the First National City Bank of $25,000 and escaped in an automobile driven by a woman. The police said the men, carrying 45‐caliber revolvers and a shotgun, entered the bank at 505 Southern Boulevard, near East 14th Street, at 10 A.M. and immediately disarmed the guard, Randolph Romero. One of the gunmen scaled the counter and ordered all the customers away from the pay windows as another forced the bank's assistant manager, Albert Randall, 53 years old, to open the Vault, Mr. Randall was struck on the head by one of the gunmen. He was not seriously hurt. After gathering up the money from the vault and the cash drawers, the gunmen fled in a 1965 blue Ford with New Jersey license plates. The car was found abandoned several minutes later at Crimmins Avenue and St. Mary's Street nearby."

The judgment was based on recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court that held that abortion laws in Texas and Georgia were invalid. One appeals court judge, Lewis Sutin, said in a separate opinion that he believed 04 entire New Mexico act was unconstitutional. The appeals court ruling reversed the conviction of a Lovington physician, Dr. John Gordan Strance, who was convicted in 1972 of criminal abortion and sentenced to one to five years in prison. The appeals court directed the Lea County District Court that had, convicted Dr. Strance to discharge him."
Suit Challenges State Law Banning Display of Prophylactics,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/11/archives/suit-challenges-state-law-banning-display-of-prophylactics.html,"PISCATAWAY A littleknown New Jersey law is being challenged in the courts by a major manufacturer of prophylactics. The company, the Youngs Drug Products Corporation of Piscataway, contends that the law, which prohibits the advertising of birth‐control devices, is unconstitutional and outdated in today's society. The measenacted in 1898. The specific issue in the suit is the display of prophylactics and literature on drugstore counters. One of the two defendants in the suit, Union County Prosecutor Karl Asch, agrees with the basis of the argument, and said so in a letter to his co‐defendant, State Attorney General George F. Kugler Jr. “My recommendation to the Attorney General was that he seriously consider agreeing with the purpose of the suit and concurring with the suggested repeal of the law, which is an anachronism,” Mr. Asch Said. He said his decision had been influenced, in part, by the recent United States Supreme Court ruling permitting abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and because birth‐control devices were commonly used and readily available. Youngs contends that its Trojan condoms are more than birth‐control devices. When properly used, they are a means of protecting a person from contracting venereal disease, the company asserts. “It's ludicrous in this day and age to prohibit the display of prophylactics,” said Milton J. Bryson, marketing director of Youngs. “Just look at the movies you can see in your neighborhood theater.” “In recent years, there has been a sharp difference in the gidel and sexual climate and, unfortunately, it has been accompanied by a steady increase in yenereal disease. And the use of prophylactics could have prevented some of the incidents.” The State Division of Venereal Disease Control said there were 16,676 reported cases of gonorrhea and 2,636 cases of syphilis in 1972, a 10 per cent increase over 1971. About 65 per cent of the cases occurred in teen agers and adults under the age of 24. Three years ago, the New Jersey Pharmaceutical Association, representing the state's 1,800 drugstores, told its members to disregard the law and place prophylactic displays and literature on store counters. Although the law has seldom been invoked (once, in 1942, with a conviction and again in 1967, with an acquittal), two drugstores have been threatened with summonses in the last month for placing on their counters displays of Youngs prophylactics and literature on their use and on venereal disease. The first incident occurred in Westfield, in Union County, and when the drugstore owner informed Youngs, the company instituted a suit in Superior Court to overturn the law. A random survey of drugstores indicated that most of the owners were unaware of the law, although some do display prophylactics, including spermatocidal jellies for women. “We feel that displaying the prophylactics is a public‐health service because of their protective nature,” said Howard Rozalsky, a co‐owner of Shoes Drugs in Elizabeth."
France,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/11/archives/war-over-abortion-france.html,"PARIS — The underground war in France, over the right to abortion burst into the open last Monday when 345 French doctors confessed publicly that they had been performing illegal abortions for the past several months. The doctors' manifesto, published in the left‐wing weekly Nouvel Observateur, challenged an embarrassed Gaullist Government. With National Assembly elections only a month away and the polls predicting a gain for the leftist opposition, the Minister of Public Health, Jean Foyer, condemned the doctors' action as a “deplorable political maneuver.” Some public groups were also angered. Dr. Jean‐Louis Lortat‐Jacob, president of the national council of the Order of Doctors, said that if the protesting group had committed an act contrary to the law, it was up to the Prosecutor of the Republic to take action. Outcries came from “rightto‐live” groups and Catholic clergymen. It is a crime in France to perform, facilitate or undergo abortion unless the mother's life is in danger. The penalties for breaking the law which even President Pompidou admitted recently Is outmoded — are particularly severe for doctors, who face up to 10 years in prison, fines as high as $14,400 and the threat of permanent suspension from practice. The pregnant woman risks a fine of up to $1,000. The strictness of the law and the potentially dangerous ways it can be evaded have been dramatized in recent months by a series of court cases. Last October, France's imagination and conscience were seized by the trial of a 16‐year‐old girl, MarieClaire Chevalier, who had undergone an abortion. Many distinguished French intellectuals testified on her behalf. She was acquitted. The doctors who issued the manifesto last week said they were “greatly encouraged” by the recent United States Supreme Court decision giving American women the right to undergo abortion during their first three months of pregnancy. They got further encouragement on Wednesday: a group of 206 doctors, lawyers, teachers, clergymen (both Catholic and Protestant) and other professionals, including four Nobel prizewinners, among them Jacques Monod, director of the Pasteur Institute, signed a “charter” in favor of legalized abortions. The charter castigated both the Government and the medical society for turning their backs on the “inadmissible social injustice” of clandestine abortions. And it laid down the a precise set of rules under which the doctors among them would medically halt pregnancy, for example: grave danger to the woman's health, the threat of malformation of the foetus, severe mental illness and cases of rape or incest."
Neither Fish Nor Fowl,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/13/archives/neither-fish-nor-fowl-in-the-nation.html,"SAN JUAN, P. R.—The major problem with the commonwealth status of Puerto Rico is that it leaves the island neither fish nor fowl. As an offshore part of the United States without much in the way of natural resources, Puerto Rico needs numerous special provisions in the mainland law; but since its people have no real political voice in mainland affairs, it has none of the usual political means to get the kind of exclusions and preferments that it needs. For only one example, the island's liberal political leaders—such as Gov. Rafael Hernandes Colon and Resident Commissioner Jaime Benitez, the nonvoting delegate to Congress—are strongly, if somewhat paradoxically, opposed to provisions in a bill to in?? the American minimum wage ?? would extend it to the Puerto Rican work force. Puerto Rican workers are, in fact, underpaid by mainland standards, particularly since the cost of living here is rising faster than in the United States, due largely to transportation costs of goods in great demand. But although Puerto Rico has one of the most prosperous economies of any Latin society and one of the highest economic growth rates anywhere in the world, unemployment here runs at an officially estimated level of 12 per cent; at any one time, it may be as high as 30 per cent. IN THE NATION Production costs on the island, despite lower wages, are actually higher than an the mainland—again due primarily to the cost of importing raw materials and transporting the finished goods to distant markets. So if the mainland minimum wage also were imposed on. Puerto Rico—which now maintains its own lower minimum wage standards through a joint U.S.Puerto Rican committee for each industry—authorities estimate that the immediate result might be the loss of as, many as 25,000 jobs, in island industries that would no longer be competitive. The longer‐term consequence, they, warn, could be renewed migration of jobless Puerto Ricans to mainland cities that already have massive unemployment, housing and welfare problems. Yet, Puerto Rico has little political clout in. Congress against the relevant part of the proposed minimum wage increase, which is believed in San Juan to be a short‐sighted effort by the A.F.L.‐C.I.O. to stop the “export” of American jobs to Puerto Rico. For another example, questions have been raised in the Puerto Rican press and elsewhere as to whether the recent Supreme Court decision substantially eliminating state prohibitions on abortions applied to the largely Catholic population of Puerto Rico, which is not a state. Gov. Hernandes Colon, a lawyer, believes the decision probably does apply, since the ruling was based on constitutional questions; but no quick or agreed upon machinery exists for testing such questions, particularly decisions which are not constitutional but are based instead on the interpretation of statutes. Examples abound. Mainland surplus food programs are not compatible with the traditional island diet. Phase 2 wage and price controls did not apply here. Federal housing regulations favor big housing developments not especially adapted to the needs of a lowincome people on an overpopulated semitropical island. Puerto Rican radio and television do not much interfere with the mainland airwaves, but they are as subject to Federal control as if they did. More dramatically, on the controversial Culebra question, Puerto Rico basically must depend on friends and the American sense of fair play, not on its own raw political power. Culebra is the inhabited island just off Puerto Rico which is used by the U.S. Navy as a gunnery range; just before going out of office, former Defense Secretary Laird reversed himself and declared that the Navy would continue to use Culebra for its target practice. These are not only practical political problems; they are at the root of the so‐called “status issue” which has kept Puerto Rico enough interested in either statehood or independence so that commonwealth status has never been accepted here as a final arrangement. In the sixties, a special commission recommended that the President and the Governor of Puerto Rico jointly appoint a number of mainland‐Puerto Rican committees to consider a variety of such issues and make recommendations to Congress — not only for specific solutions to existing problems, but for institutional methods of resolving knotty questions as to which laws and court decisions must apply to Puerto Rico, and which should take notice of the island's traditions, culture and special circumstances. Governor Hernandes Colon says he wants above all to restimulate Puerto Rico's basic economic growth, and for this purpose he has recalled Teodoro Moscoso, major architect of the boom of the 1940's and 1950's. But the Governor hopes also to cope decisively with the unresolved problems of commonwealth status—a goal, he freely concedes, which Is highly dependent upon the cooperation of President Nixon and Congress."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/14/archives/letters-to-the-editor-pregnancy-abortion-and-the-supreme-court.html,"To the Editor: The decision to grant what is tantamount to abortion on demand sets the profession of medicine and civilization back 2,500 years to a time when the doctor and sorcerer were the same individual with the power to kill as well as to cure. Though Justice Blackmun conveniently dismisses the Hippocratic oath as élitist on the basis of a dead scholar's fragile hypothesis, Margaret Mead reminds us according to a 1972 Study by Maurice Levine that the oath marked one of the turning points in the history of man. She states that “for the first time in our tradition there was a complete separation between killing and curing.” She added that “it was the Greeks who made the distinction clear and delegated to one profession, Medicine, a complete dedication to life under all circumstances.” Dr. Mead emphasizes what Justice Blackmun failed to appreciate: that this radical separation of killing, and curing “is a priceless possession which we cannot afford to tarnish, but society always is attempting to make the physician into a killer—to kill the defective child [or] the cancer patient.” The majority opinion of the Supreme Court has disregarded her conviction that “it is the duty of society to protect the physician from such requests.” By this failure the Court has recycled today's obstetrician back to the dark ages of the sorcerer, who for a fee will kill or rescue the smaller of two patients in a pregnancy on the basis of the woman's request. Furthermore, the majority opinion insures that a killing operation will become the most prevalent operation performed in the United States, as it is in New York State today. HERBERT RATNER, M.D. Director, Dept. of Public Health Oak Park, Ill., Feb. 1, 1973 • To the Editor: Most of the comments on the recent Supreme Court ruling on abortion, both pro and con, overlook the purpose of the Count in our system of checks and balances. The Supreme Court's main function, since the case of Marburg v. Madison, 1803, has been to interpret the Constitution. It has not been to apply “the will of the people,” whatever that may be at a given time. This function protects us from what has been called by many famous statesmen the tyranny of the majority. Possibly, most Americans might be in favor of prayers in the public schools, yet the Court has stated that this is unconstitutional. In its abprtion decision the Court was asked if state laws limiting abortions violated a mother's constitutional protections to privacy, equal protection of the laws, and life and liberty. The Court decided that such state laws did violate such, protections and were therefore unconstitutional. The fact that most Americans approve or disapprove is irrelevant. Questions of constitutional law are never decided by a poll of the people. The Supreme Court, with its power of judicial review, has played a large part in making our Constitution the oldest document of its kind still in use today. Let us resist the impulse to amend it every time a large group of people disagree with judicial decisions, or it may become, to use Thomas Jefferson's phrase, a ball of wax.” In these times, we need a firmer foundation than that. MICHAEL J. FRISCHBERG Matawan, N. J., Feb. 4, 1973 • To the Editor. The recent dec:smn of the Supreme Court on abortions, in particular its pronouncement regarding when life begins, reminds me of the parent who tells the child his decision about a matter, when in reality it may be far from the truth. The following is based on twenty years' work in this field, apart from any known religious influence. Concerning when Iife begins, a particular aggregate of hereditary tendencies (genes and chromosomes) is first assembled at the moment of fertilization when an ovum (egg) is invaded by a sperm cell. This restores the normal number of required chromosomes, 46, for survival, growth, and reproduction of a new composite individual. By this definition a new composite individual is started at the moment of fertilization. However, to survive, this individual needs a very specialized environment for nine months, just as it requires sustained care for an indefinite period after birth. But from the moment of union of the germ cells, there is under normal development a living, definite, going concern. To interrupt a pregnancy at any stage is like cutting the link of a chain; the chain is broken no matter where the link is cut. Naturally, the earlier a pregnancy is interrupted, the easier it is technically, the less the physical, objective encounter. To deny a truth should not be made a basis for legalizing abortion. LANDRUM B. SHETTLES, M.D. The Presbyterian Hospital New York, Feb. 5, 1973 • To the Editor: We wish to comment on the Feb. 3 letter of Katherine Teck admonishing our “Protect the Unborn” ad that we ran in the Times Jan. 28. This Supreme Court ruling will bring “to society only the truly divisive society” to quote our ad of Feb. 28, 1971, and not the “welcome halt to nasty arguments” as Katherine Teck states in her letter. We have no intention of joining anyone in allowing “abortion used as a backstop rather than in place of contraception”; no more than we will join in using infanticide as a backup for abortion, and genocide used as a backup for infanticide. It is demeaning for anyone to ever use the words “merely accidents” when one refers to any child unless the new criteria for life are to be decided on the basis of being a “planned” birth; a “planned” lifespan and a “planned” death. When the Supreme Court said that the unborn are not “persons in the whole sense,” let the ill, the aged and the disabled ponder those two words “whole sense” with utmost concern. As we read the Preamble, to our Constitution we feel that some day its words “the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity” will extend to every unborn child for they are the true posterity and our hope for a better world. WILLIAM OUST Jr. President, Non‐Sectarian Committee for Life Mount Vernon, Feb. 6, 1973 • To the Editor: In the recent Supreme Court abortion decision, Justice Blackmun has argued that since there is doubt as to when life begins we may abort the unborn. One wonders if the Court will next argue that when an accused murderer's guilt or innocence is in doubt he may legitimately be put to death. So much has been written and said about the “presumption of innocence” in our legal system as the protection of individual rights against unjust accusations. How much more important would it have been if the Court had created a “presumption of life” in those cases where legal existence is in doubt. The Court has made a, serious mistake in taking these issues away from the people and attempting to substitute its will for the people's will as expressed in legislatures and referendums. ALBERT E. GUNN, M.D. Springfield, Va., Feb. 2, 1973 • To the Editor: Now that the Supreme Court has settled the issue of whether or not abortions are to be legal, and safe, I hope that both sides of the abortion controversy will join (each in its own way) in rendering most abortions unnecessary. Never, even in the most emotional moments of the fight, has anyone suggested that abortion is anything better than a necessary backup for human or contraceptive failure. Surely it is now up to all of us (1) to educate our young according to our various moral traditions and to inform them of the acceptable methods of birth control, (2) to make available to all who want it good medical care in family planning, (3) to support the research necessary to develop contraceptives that do not have the medical disadvantages which make the pill unsafe for many women and that do not have the 5 to 20 per cent failure rate of other methods and (4) to include in all our counseling of problem pregnancies the assurance that there are alternatives to abortion. There are, I think, as many concerns in common between the two camps as there are differences. We all yearn for a better world with more peace and more love and more understanding. We all want our children to be loved and raised wisely. Let us now concentrate on these positive things insteads of the last bitter remnants of an unhappy fight. MARIAN F. WILLIAMS Chappaqua, N. Y., Feb. 2, 1973 After the Murder Of Amilcar Cabral To the Editor: The assassination of Amilcar Cabral, leader of the independence movement in Portuguese Guinea, is a tragic event for all those—African or non‐African, black or white‐‐who believe in the right of people to govern themselves. As the U.S. Ambassador to Guinea, 1963–65, I came to know Amilcar Cabral since he was officially accepted as a member of the diplomatic corps in Conakry. I knew him as a passionate fighter for the rights of his people but also as a reasonable man with no animosity toward the American people, despite our self‐defeating policy of “purchasing” military bases in Portuguese colonies. It is perhaps significant that this essentially moderate man had achieved more in his battle for independence than all the “ranters and ravers” who speak so stridently and glibly in the name of revolution. In paying tribute to Amilcar Cabral, I would also express the hope that President Sékou Touré of Guinea will not use this tragedy to continue or increase the violence with which, in recent years, he has treated Guinean patriots, formerly members of his Government, whom he has executed, jailed or forced into exile on the basis of obviously forced confessions. Violence inevitably breeds violence. All friends of Guinea—and I still count myself a friend despite the events of the past few years—hope that President Touré will once again turn to the principles of progressive, compassionate statesmanship as the only sound foundation for Guinea's future. JAMES I. LOEB Cabin John, Md., Jan. 23, 1973 City Trees' Best Friend: New York Style To the Editor: A recent letter writer [Inge Kessenich] pointed out that the German city of Munich uses tank trucks to water street trees in tubs. She asked: “Is this too much to ask for the City of New York?” I am sure the writer and those who read her letter will be pleased to know that the New York Parks Department has been using similar trucks for the same task. Maintaining trees in street pots is difficult because it is an unnatural setting. While we ask merchants and residents along these streets to help us by watering the trees periodically, we also dispatch these water trucks when needed. THEODORE MASTROIANNI Deputy Commissioner Department of Parks New York, Jan. 29, 1973 Inviting Investments From Abroad To the Editor: In his Feb. 2 column (“Dollars and Sense”) C. L. Sulzberger comments on the present imbalance between huge direct American investments in the nine countries of the European Common Market and the comparatively small direct investments by European firms in the United States. In this connection, Mr. Sulzberger mentions that “U.S. law does not permit foreign investment in various categories of industries....” I doubt whether even a single European firm has been prevented from investing in the United States by the few insignificant legal restrictions that exist in certain fields of foreign firms operating in this country. Quite the contrary, for the last few years our Federal Government and the New York State Department of Commerce through its European trade development office in Brussels have actively sought out, encouraged anal counseled a great number of European firms on establishing manufacturing facilities here. While the main obstacle to these programs seems to have been a psychological one, it would appear from all indications that the attitude of European management is beginning to undergo a change and that the imbalance referred to by Mr. Sulzberger will be reduced to a certain extent in the foreseeable future.

CATHOLICS WARNED TO AVOID ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/15/archives/catholics-warned-to-avoid-abortions.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (AP) —Roman Catholics have been warned by church leaders that they face excommunication if they undergo or perform an abortion. “Those who obtain an abortion, those who persuade others to have, an abortion, and those who perform the abortion procedure are guilty of breaking God's law,” a.pastoral message of the National Council of Catholic Bishops said yesterday. It said that Catholics who underwent or performed abortions “place themselves in a state of excommunlcation.” John Cardinal Cody, Archbishop of Chicago, said excommunication meant that the subject could not receive the sacraments. The, pastoral message termed as “entirely contrary to the fundamental principles of morality” the recent decision of the Supreme Court that had the effect of legalizing abortion. Cardinal Cody said at a news conference that the church hoped to bring about a reversal of the court's decision. “We have legal experts trying to come up with a proposition,” he said."
Shanghai Tops Tokyo and New York As the World's Most Populous City,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/15/archives/shanghai-tops-tokyo-and-new-york-as-the-worlds-most-populous-city.html,"UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Feb. 14—Shanghai has moved, into first place as the world's most populous city, oustripping Tokyo and New York. The Chinese city was given top position in the United Nations Demographic Yearbook, published today, containing the first official figures from mainland China in more than a decade. The demographers gave front) rank to Shanghai on the basis of the latest data, which showed Shanghai in 1970 with a population of 10,820,000 followed by Tokyo with 8,841,000 and New York with 7,895,000. The total for New York was limited to the five boroughs—Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx. Peking in Fourth Place On the basis of the latest figures from China, demographers classified Peking, with a population of 7,570,000, as the fourth largest city. Next in population the yearbook listed London, Moscow, Bombay, Seoul, Sao Paulo and Cairo. Past editions of the yearbook had showed Tokyo and New York in close contention for first place but statistics for Shanghai were based on 1957 data. Official Chinese figures were not available in the late fifties or during the sixties. The last edition of the yearbook estimated Tokyo's population at 9,005,000. The present figure reflects a recent census. The newer figures on China were taken from official publications brought back by a United Nations official from a visit to China. Although Peking was seated in the United Nations in October, 1971, it has so far not supplied demographic data directly to the world organization. The yearbook figures on population together with informaton from other sources show Shanghai with a population density of 36,000 persons per square mile. Tokyo, covering a smaller area, has a density of 39,680 persons per square mile. New York has an overall density average of 26,340 per square mile, ranging from Staten Island with only 5,140 persons per square mile to Manhattan with 67,810. Demographers regard density statistics as an indicator of the quality of life. The statistics would not show, however, such facts as how many people living outside the city pour into it daily during working hours or what form of transit they use. Population Is 3.7 Billion The United Nations yearbook, published since 1948, is regarded as the world's most comprehensive compilation of demographic data. The new 814‐page edition emphasizes population and vital statistics obtained in censuses in 1970 and 1971. The yearbook reported that world population reached 3,706 million in mid‐1971 and said that if the annual growth of 2 per cent was maintained, the population would double by the year 2006. China, the world's most populous country, had 78746,000 people and India was in second place with 550,374,000, according to the yearbook, which estimated that one out of every two persons in the world is an Asian. The yearbook said 2,104 million people lived in Asia, 56.7. per cent of the world total. The yearbook also shows a continuing downward trend in much of the world infant mortality rates — regarded by demographers as a good indicator of the general health and welfare. The Netherlands and Sweden have the lowest infant mortality rate — 11.1 deaths per 1,000 live births. Low infant mortality rates were reported for Finland (11.8), Japan (12.4) and Iceland, Norway, Denmark and France. The United States ranked 22d in the listing, with 19.2 deaths per 1,000. The yearbook showed the infant mortality rate for South Africa's white population is 19.4 and for the nonwhite population as 121.3. West Germany reported the lowest birth rate in the world —12.8 births per thousand population. This is in part because West Germany, like other prosperous countries, has an “aging” population living longer past the child‐bearing span. The African country of Swaziland had the highest rate, 52.3 per thousand. Taiwan Not Listed Nigeria, Upper Volta, Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), India, Cambodia, Jordan and Pakistan were the only countries listed where men had a longer life expectancy than women. At the insistence of Peking, United Nations demographers for the first time did not list Taiwan separately, which the Chinese Government maintains is part of China's territory. Taiwan, with a population of 15 million, is nowhere mentioned in the current volume although earlier editions furnished detailed demographic data that specialists regarded as expertly gathered and particularly use ful in gauging sociological developments, such as industrial or educational trends. The figures were given for the central city, or city proper, since information was not available for suburbs in all instances. Such figures were lacking on Shanghai and Tokyo. The yearbook showed a New York combined total of 11,572,000 with the counties of Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester included with the five boroughs. Abortion Figurbes Given The new yearbook includes for the first time some abortion statistics. Only 22 countries, most of them in Europe, are included but demographers decided on the basis of these data that the most liberalized abortion laws existed in Denmark, Hungary, Singapore and England, Wales and Scotland. The experience has been that after the initial publication of a table, additional governments are prompted to supply data. Information for the yearbook comes from responses to questionnaires sent to governments and from statistical offices and other sources. New tables, such as the abortion table, are added periodically. The series is published by the United Nations Statistical Office. The year‐book, put out in paperback at $18.50 and cloth at $28 in a limited edition of 8,000, is as close as any United Nations publication comes to being a best‐seller. The copies usually are ordered quickly by governments, libraries and commercial buyers."
States and Doctors Wary On Eased Abortion Ruling,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/16/archives/states-and-doctors-wary-on-eased-abortion-ruling-states-and-doctors.html,"State governments and the American medical profession have thus far moved with extreme caution in implementing the Supreme Court's ruling of 25 days ago giving women the right to obtain abortions. Meanwhile, women seeking abortions continue to be referred to such states as New York, where abortion laws were liberalized previously. And the anti‐abortion forces, caught off guard by a ruling far more liberal than they had expected, are quickly mar sharing support for a constitutional amendment to grant the fetus the rights of a person. They may also seek from the President an executive order of noncompliance with the Court's ruling. Ruling on challenges to the abortion laws of Texas and Georgia, the Supreme Court said on Jan. 22 that the state could have no voice in a woman's, decision to have an abortion during the first third of her pregnancy. In the second trimester, the Court said, the state cannot limit the grounds for abortion but can institute medical regulations to protect maternal health. The Court held that the fetus had no constitutional rights and that the state could prohibit abortion to protect fetal life only in the last third of pregnancy and only if the woman's life or health was not at stake. The abortion laws in all 50 states contain restrictions that go beyond the Court's ruling, and in all but four states these restrictions limit the grounds for abortion in early pregnancy. Since the Court's ruling, a state‐by‐state review by The New York Times has shown, at least nine states have introduced legislation that would bring their laws into conformity with the decision and an equal number are working on new legislation. But the one state legislature that has acted so far —Virginia's —rejected a bill that would have brought the law into line with what the Court said. In more than a dozen states, Attorneys General or local courts have declared existing abortion laws null and void, but in at least five states legal or judicial the old have supported the old restrictive laws. In a number of states, however, it seems that no one is ever, it seems that no one is Attorneys to make the first move: Attorneys General say that they are waiting for state legislatures or local courts to act, and doctors say that they are awaiting clarification from Attorneys General. Even in those states where legal or judicial opinions have declared state laws unconstitutional, the medical profession has taken little action. In some cases, medical leaders have said that the profession would continue to exercise restraint in agreeing to perform abortions. In Texas, for example, where the law was struck down by the Supreme Court and where the State Attorney General issued a clarification of the decilion, Breckenridge Hospital in Austin thus far has refused to allow abortions, saying that it is waiting for an opinion from the Austin City Attorney on legal ramifications. In Iowa, where the Attorney General declared the state law null and void, Dr. Kenneth Lister, president of the Iowa Medical Society, said: “Iowa doctors are not going to change until this matter is settled in the courts or by the legislature. Even if the law is relaxed, they will not be nearly as permissive as the doctors have been on abortion in New York.” And in Tennessee, where a United States District Court has declared the state law unconstitutional, Jack E. Ballentine, executive secretary of the Tennessee Medical Association, said, “Everybody is in limbo. Our attorney is studying the Supreme Court decision to see what our options are. I don't know of any physician who will perform an abortion on request right now.” In a few states, official action has served to delay implementation of the Supreme Court's decision. Louisiana's Attorney General, William Guste, said that the stale could still revoke a doctor's license for performing an abortion, and the State Board of Medical Examiners said that it would move to stop doctors from doing abortions. Ten days after the Court's ruling, Circuit Court Judge Daniel A. Covelli in Cook County, Ill., issued a temporary restraining order blocking three physicians from performing 30 scheduled abortions. In some states, legislators who oppose abortion are formutating bills that they hope will stem the expected demand for abortion. State Senator John W. De Camp of Neligh, Neb., has introduced a bill that he said “will attempt to restrict to the degree possible the butchery of babies in the State of Nebraska.” Among other things, the bill would impose tight restrictions on the grounds for abortions done in the second trimester, with an amendment requiring doctors to report the names of all women who undergo abortions. Aryeh Neier, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the organization's affiliates would take action against any state that enacted laws not in conformity with the Supreme Court's ruling. He said that the organization would also act against restrictive practices by publicly funded hospitals, restrictive provisions in health codes, refusal to provide Medic aid payments and requirements for the husband's consent to abortion. Faced with reluctance on the part of local doctors and hospitals, abortion referral services throughout the country said that they were continuing to refer patients to the same places they had before the court's decision. In most cases, an abortion in a clinic in New York or Washington is likely to be far less costly — even with transportation costs—than the same operation in a hospital elsewhere. New York City health officials reported yesterday that there had been no perceptible change in the numbers of outof‐state women receiving abortions here. There have been few moves to set up clinics in other states. Earlier this week, the Massachusetts Public Health Council approved a clinic to be operated by the Florence Crittenden League, which is seeking clinics in other states as well. In New Jersey, where Attorney General George F. Kugter Jr. said that the state would not prosecute doctors for performing abortions, some doctors expect thee establishment of as many as 25 clinics. Several experts on abortion said that the high court's rul ing could have the ironic effact, at least temporarily, of raising the cost of abortions everywhere, since the economics of low‐cost abortion clinics are dependent on large volume. Antiabortion forces have likened the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion to the Dred Scott decision of 1857 declaring that. Negores were not cit??. That decision was over turned 11 years later by the passage of the Fourteenth Amdendment. May Joyce, a board member of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, said, “Now we will have to work for an equal‐right‐to‐life amendment that covers from conception to natural death.” Legislators in at least 15 states are seeking to introduce resolutions that would ultimately give the fetus constitutional rights. Although few people outside the right‐to‐life movement expect such measures to succeed, it appears likely that such vocal resistance to the decision could delay the establishment of abortion facilities in some areas, particularly in states where medical leaders share the movement's views."
‘Second‐Generation’ Environmental Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/16/archives/-second-generation-environmental-issues-news-analysis-political-hot.html,"LOS ANGELES, Feb. 15—The so‐called energy crisis has made many people aware that a “second generation” of environmental problems is closing in President Nixon, in his third environmental message to Congress today, took partial note of this. But he indicated that there were some things he preferred to worry about later. To wit: a population policy and a resource policy above and beyond the matter of fuels. Environmental problems divide roughly into two categories. One is the various kinds of pollution, with which the nation has been preoccupied up to now and whose solution is estechnical. News Analysis The other is a set of problems of vastly greater magnitude, whose solution involves changes in deep‐rooted social mores and beliefs. Political Hot Potatoes Generally grouped in this category are the energy pinch, the land‐use problem, the global “population bomb” and a relative newcomer, the “resource crunch.” Mr. Nixon talked about progress against the pollutions and about the energy squeeze, and reiterated what he had said before about the need for landuse planning legislation. He did not mention either population, or the problem of the United States' and the world's rapidly dwindling store of basic materials, such as minerals. Both these matters are political hot potatoes. At least one inference likely to be drawn from their absence from the environmental message is that they are problems for which Mr. Nixon and his advisers have not yet been able to formulate policies deemed politically viable. In a message to Congress in July, 1969, announcing the creation of a. Population Study Commission, Mr. Nixon said: “Informed observers agree that population growth is among the most important issues, we face. They agree that it can be met only if there is a great deal of advance planning.” Warning on Population In another environmental message 13 months later, alluding to growing concern over the fact that the world's population is doubling every 30 years, he said, Population growth poses an urgent problem of global dimensions. If the United States is to have an effective voice in world population policies, it must demonstrate willingness to face its own population problems at home.” But several things have happened since then. Last May the Commission of Population Growth and the American Future, after two years of study, produced a report recommending zero population growth, facilitated by liberalized abortion and liberalized birth control services, including making contraceptives available to minors. Mr. Nixon cold‐shouldered the report, saying, “I consider abortion an unacceptable form of population control” and let it lie. Last December, Federal population experts reported that births over amine‐month period had dropped below the “zero growth” level, but warned that such short‐term fluctuations could be deceptive. Finally, the United States Supreme Court, of Jan. 27, gave abortion new status by invalidating all state laws restricting a woman's right to obtain an abortion during her first three months of pregnancy. All of which poses a big question mark over prospective United States policy for the global conference on population problems that the. United Nations is convoking in 1974, “World Population Year.” If population limitation is touchy, the problem of material resources is more so. Not everyone is interested in babies, but everyone has economic interests that will be affected by the resource crunch. The crunch is that at present rates of consumption of a score of basic materials such as copper, lead, zinc, tin, gold, silver and magnesium, many experts are predicting exhaustion of prime world supplies in as little as 30 yeats. A ‘Global Crisis’ Only this week the National Commission on Materials Policy reported that the United States must reduce its consumption of some materials to help avert a “global crisis.” The crux of this problem is that historically raw‐material prices have reflected only the cost of production and distribution, as if the supply were unlimited. Rapidly gaining support among economists and other specialists is the concept that there should be “built into” prices of materials a reflection of the fact that they represent depletion of a very limited natural bank account and that today's consumers are in effect mortgaging the future and using up things that perhaps should be husbanded for their grandchildren. Rejiggering prices in this way would mean incorporating what amounts to a depletion tax—the opposite, of the “depletion allowance” treasured by the oil and timber industries. The commission alluded to such innovations as “deep changes in the market system” —an exercise no one in public office likes to talk about before he has to."
Issues Have Moved to the Right for 7 Candidates for Maryor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/16/archives/issues-have-moved-to-the-right-for-7-candidates-for-mayor.html,"Crime community control and the delirvery of city sere ices are the “in” issues, and the middle class the “in voter bloc for seven Democrats already campaigning feverishly for their party's mayoral nomination. ?? TWO of the seven — City Councilman Robert I. Postel and Representative. Edward I. Kech, both of Manhattan—have formally announced their candidacies, while the five others are expected to announce within the next month. They are 12epresentatives Herman Badillo and Mario Biaggi, both of the Bronx; Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal and Jerome Kretchmer, the outgoing Environmental Protection Administrator, both of Manhattan, and City Council Pres ident Sanford D. Garelik of the Bronx. Two other possible candidates, Mayor Lindsay and City Controller Abraham D. Beanie, have not said even privately whether they will run. However, they can afford to wait, until early March, six weeks before the April 12 deadline, for filing petitions for the Democratic primary. This is because both are well known, Mr. Lindsay can count on the support of the City Hall apparatus and Mr. Beame is certain of the fealty of the Brooklyn Democratic organization and other regular Democrats. Their “campaigning” also can take the more subtle form of municipal in the line of municipal duty before civic and fraternal groups. ?? He spends ids more and more time visiting middle‐class areas and functions in Brook lyn; Queens and the Bronx, he is preparing to add 3,150 policemen to a police force that is already larger than many armies and he has set aside, $5‐million in the upcoming City budget for disbursement by corhmunities. Procaccino Is Recalled The question of community control, or neighborhood participation in city services such as education, sanitation and police, has undergone a radical transformation in six years. Originally, the issue was pressed by blacks and Puerto Ricans interested in controling school boards in their areas and, as such, was opposed by many white politicians. Now community control means white middle‐class participation in decisions affecting their neighborhoods and as such, the appeal has become something akin to motherhood among the Democratic candidates. The liberal Mr. Badillo typifies the, mood of the candidates when he describes crime as the issue of most concern to city residents and emphasizes that the problems of crime and the “delivery of city services” provide “a community of interest among all the peoples of the city.” They also provide Mr. Ba ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? stresses how, as deputy min ority leader of the Assembly, he has learned that the 14 reform Democratic votes in the lower house are far short of the 76 needed to pass bills. Dealing With DeLury Like Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Kretchmer also seeks to tone down his one‐time image as one of the most vocal liberals in the Assembly. Speaking before the Queens Democratic executive committee, Mr. Kretohmer, who has the only mustache and the longest hair of the mayoral candidates, described almost apologetically his “hard, aggressive and sometimes angry way as a legislator.” “I think I have changed some; I have learned how to deal with John DeLury and the sanitationmen,” said the 38‐year‐old Mr. Kretchmer, whose jurisdiction as Environmental Protection Administrator included the Sanitation Department and negotiations with Mr. DeLury, the feisty head of the sanitationmen's union. Mr. Kretchmer uses in his stock speech adjectives once reserved for blacks and Puerto Ricans to describe the white middle class as “the tensest, angriest and most unhappy” group in the city. “The fact that the middle class feels ignored is a fact that the city has to deal with,” he adds. The 33‐year‐old Mr. Postel, the youngest of the candidates and the least seriously regarded by the political pros, also touches on the crime issue as he recounts various reforms he has proposed, mostly in vain, in the City Council. He notes, for example, that he suggested the assignment of 100 judges to handle narcotics cases before Governor. Rockefeller took up the, issue. Equally emphatic but more predictable — are the views of the two most conservative Democrats in the mayoral race, the 55‐year‐old Mr. Biaggi and the 54‐year‐old Mr. Garelik, on the crime, city services and middleclass issues. With the exception of Mr. Beame, who will be 67 next month, the two are also the oldest candidates in the race. In his speech, Mr. Garelik, who was chief inspector of the Police Department when he entered politics four years ago under the wing of Mayor Lindsay and Alex Rose, the Liberal party leader, assails what he calls the Lindsay administration's “simplistic approach” and “laissez faire attitude” toward crime. He rarely mentions that he was elected on the Lindsay ticket in 1969. Mr. Garelik also talks of “one of the great migrations in the history of the world,” the departure of two million “economically advantaged” from the city and the arrival of two million “economically disadvantaged” into the city. Mr. Biaggi, a former police lieutenant who has built his career on the law and order issue, is the only one of the candidates who has received Conservative party endorsement (in his race for Congress last November). He also has at least a fair chance of winning the Conservative endorsement for Mayor. Mr. Biaggi, who with Mr. Garelik is considered by political observers to be the least articulate of the wouldbe candidates, doesn't miss an opportunity to twit his opponents “belated” discovery of the crime issue. “All the others ran from the issue four and eight years ago,” Mr. Biaggi says. “Who will the voters believe?” Mr. Biaggi is obviously trying to broaden his law‐andorder base, and spends much of his standard speech recounting his efforts on behalf of the mentally retarded, Soviet Jewry and even baseball's first woman umpire. Like the other candidates, Mr. Biaggi's “solutions” for the crime problem are somewhat vague. He calls for better use of the police, the use of Governors Island as a treatment center for drug addicts, and the appointment of a chief magistrate, “a tough taskmaster who would make judges perform.” If their “solutions” are open to question there is no doubt about audience reaction to the candidates emphasis on crime and middle‐class problems. Charge Affects N.D.C. The loudest applause at a Brooklyn meeting of elderly people addressed by Mr. Garelik came when a man in the audience shouted bring back the electric chair.” In East New York, which, with its ruins of buildings, looks like a combat zone, an elderly woman describing the crime problem to Mr. Badillo declared: “We have a war here.” At the Hyde Park Jewish Center in East Flatbush, Rabbi Joseph Frankel was apparently speaking for his audience when he said: “Our sages said pray for the welfare of government because without the government one man would swallow another. Government at this moment is failing in its primary function— one person should not be afraid of another, should not have to look back when walking down the street.” In political clubs affiliated with the liberal New Democratic Coalition, there is not as much spoken concern about the crime issue. But also there are no outraged cries of “racism,” which greeted candidates concentrating on crime and middleclass concerns four years ago. With the crime and middleclass issues blurred by the across‐the‐board emphasis on them, the candidates have been hard put to distinguish themselves from their competition. Mr. Badillo speaks of his experiences as a Bronx Borough President, as a city relocation commissioner and as The Candidates Balk At Supporting Rivals Would the several Democratic candidates for Mayor rally around the party's eventual nominee, whoever he might be? At the moment, at least three of the mayoral contenders are not certain whether they could support their competitors, while three others have expressed doubts about specific rivals. “I'm not making any pledges of support,” said Representative Herman Badillo, echoing two other contenders, City Council President Sanford D. Garelik and Representative Mario Biaggi. Jerome Kretchmer, the outgoing Environmental Protection Administrator, said that he “probably could not support” either Mr. Garelik or Mr. Biaggi. Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal “reserves decision” on, Mr. Garelik, but adds that Mr. Biaggi appears to be “staying within the framework of what I think is the Democratic party position.” Mr. Koch said he could support all his competitors, although Mayor Lindsay would be “a hard one.” However, Mr. Koch had a possible solution to that. “I can't believe the town would be so dopey as to elect him,” he said. an accountant and lawyer. He also notes that he came from the poor and is now middle class, so he knows the problems of both groups. Mr. Garelik refers to his background in police administration and tells his audiences: “I have a B.S. in economics.” Mr. Blumenthal leans heavily on his role as deputy minority leader end a leader in the fights for abortion, liberal divorce, and open enrollment and free tuition at the City University. “I've been a more effective politician than any of them,” he says. Mr. Postel describes himself as the “no‐nonsense” candidate, and says that, unlike the others, he will not accept any contributions from the real‐estate, banking and other “special interests” of the city. Mr. Kretchmer lays claim to being the only candidate who “has delivered an essential city service”—collecting garbage. He also often refers to his management experience as Environmental Protection Administrator and his switching of the tailpipes on garbage trucks to extend into the air rather than behind the truck to cut down on carbon monoxide inhalation by sanitationmen as they load the trucks. Mayor Is Ignored Mr. Koch describes himself as a nonideological, sane and rational liberal who is not leaving the crime issue to “the right wing.” He also says that as a Congressman he has become an expert on mass transit. There is no disagreement, however, on the candidates' approach to Mayor Lindsay. All of them, including Mr. Kretchmer, who was appointed to the environmental post by the Mayor, virtually ignore Mr. Lindsay in their speeches. The most critical are Mr. Garelik and Mr. Koch, and the least critical are Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Kretchmer. Mr. Badillo explained this tactic: “Most people are overwhelmingly anti‐Lindsay. don't even bother knocking him. If he decides to run, he will become the issue, but everybody assumes his administration is a disaster and lets it go.”"
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/16/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1973; International The Laotian Government and the Pathet failed to reach a predicted cease‐fire agreement yesterday. The United States was partly blamed for the failure, the Laotians saying that Washington had insisted on revisions after the two sides had reached an understanding. That insistence, a principal Vientiane Government negotiator said, caused the Communists to increase their bargaining demands. [Page 1, Column 1.] The Pentagon announced a significant increase in American air strikes against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao troop and supply movements in Laos. Spokesmen said the strikes were a reaction to a substantial rise in the flow of military matériel, from North Vietnam and stepped‐up fighting. [1:2:] South Vietnam threatened to hold up the scheduled release of Communist prisoners of war if the Communists delayed the release of captured Government troops. The threat from a military spokesman came after the Vietcong reportedly failed to meet a promised deadline for the release of 320 South Vietnamese prisoners. [12:1–3.] The United States and Cuba signed an agreement intended to stop hijacking, but Secretary of State Rogers said the United States would not ease its diplomatic and economic boycott of Cuba until “the policies and attitudes of the Cuban Government” changed. The hijacking agreement, worked out through Swiss intermediaries, was signed simultaneously in Washington and the Cuban capital. [1:5; Text, P. 4.] Israeli and Egyptian planes fought a brief air battle over the Gulf of Suez with no losses reported. Later, Israeli artillery exchanged fire with Syrian batteries near the Golan heights, the first clash across the cease‐fire line there since Jan. 8. [3:1.3.] National President Nixon asked Congress to return agriculture to a free market economy by phasing out crop allotments and direct farm subsidies that have cost the nation $48‐billion in the last dozen years. The plan was the main new proposal in the President's message on the environment and natural resources, which also called for Federal standards for the purity of drinking water and the extension of the national wilderness to Eastern areas. [1:8.] At his first news conference since the recent devaluation of the dollar, Secretary of the Treasury George P. Shultz said the Administration wants the dollar to drop even more than it has in world currency markets. Mr. Shultz refused to disclose a target value, but indicated the hoped‐for decline would not involve another formal devaluation of the dollar. [1:6.] Wholesale prices, a major inflation index, rose sharply, by 1.1 per cent, in January, according to the Labor Department. Once again food prices recorded the biggest gains in the composite index. [1:7.] Like to borrow millions of dollars from the Government, interest‐free? That, according to Senator William Proxmire, is what at least five major defense contractors have done by a kind of ledger legerdemain. The contractors, Mr. Proxmire charged, have set aside Government money destined for employe retirement programs and used it for up to 21 months before depositing it in the retirement funds. Mr. Proxmire said the practice costs the Government money, and he wants it stopped. [46:4.] America's Pioneer 10 spacecraft has emerged unharmed after its seven‐month passage through the asteroid belt, which turned out to be less of an obstacle than had been feared, Pioneer 10 is scheduled to arrive near Jupiter on Dec. 3, and is to make the first close‐up investigation of the solar system's largest planet. (46:1–3.) Metropolitan Mayor Lindsay, who has denounced Governor Rockefeller's proposal of mandatory life sentences for narcotics dealers, offered his own solution to the drug problem: stiffer penalties, more judges, less plea bargaining and a unified law‐enforcement effort. Several of the Mayor's proposals seemed to be echoes of the Governor's plan, but Mr. Lindsay continued his opposition to mandatory life sentences. [1:4.] Four names were added to the list of six suspects sought in the recent ambushes on policemen. In announcing the names, Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy refused to say whether they were connected with the so‐called Black Liberation Army. Mr. Murphy also announced the arrest of a bank‐robbery suspect identified as an accomplice of one of the four. [43:3–8.] The Other News International Cambodia, shaky, looks to U.S. for help.

States and Doctors Wary On Eased Abortion Ruling,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/16/archives/states-and-doctors-wary-on-eased-abortion-ruling.html,"State governments and the American medical profession have thus far moved with extreme caution in implementing the Supreme Court's ruling of 25 days ago giving women the right to obtain abortions. Meanwhile; women seeking abortions continue to be referred to such states as New York, where abortion laws were liberalized previously. And the anti‐abortion forces, caught off guard by a ruling far more liberal than they had expected, are quickly mar shaling support for a constitutional amendment to grant the fetus the rights of a person. They may also seek from the President an executive order of noncompliance with the Court's ruling. Ruling on challenges to the abortion laws of Texas and Georgia, the Supreme Court said on Jan. 22 that the state could have no voice in a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first third of her pregnancy. In the second trimester, the Court said, the state cannot limit the grounds for abortion but can institute medical regulations to protect maternal health. The Court held that the fetus had no constitutional right and that the state could prohibit abortion to protect fetal life only in the last third of pregnancy and only if the woman's life or health was not at stake. The abortion laws in all 50 states contain restrictions that go beyond the Court's ruling, and in all but four states these restrictions limit the grounds for abortion in early pregnancy. Since the Court's ruling, a state‐by‐state review by The New York Times has shown, at least nine states have introduced legislation that would bring their laws into conformity with the decision and an equal number are working on new legislation. But the one state legislature that has acted so far — Virginia's — rejected a bill that would have brought the law into line with what the Court said. In more than a dozen states, Attorneys General or local courts have declared existing abortion laws null and void, but in at least five states legal or judicial authorities have supported the old restrictive laws. In a number of states, however, it seems that no one is willing to make the first move: Attorneys General say that they are waiting for state legislatures or local courts to act, and doctors say that they are awaiting clarification from Attorneys General. Even in those states where legal or judicial opinions have declared state laws unconstitutional, the medical profession has taken little action. In some cases, medical leaders have said that the profession would continue to exercise restraint in agreeing to perform abortions. In Texas, for example, where the law was struck down by the Supreme Court and where the State Attorney General issued a clarification of the decisinn, Breckenridge Hospital in Austin thus far has refused to allow abortions, saying that it is waiting for an opinion from the Austin City Attorney on legal ramifications. In Iowa, where the Attorney General declared the state law null and void, Dr. Kenneth Lister, president of the Iowa Medical Society, said: “Iowa doctors are not going to change until this matter is settled in the courts or by the legislature. Even if the law is relaxed, they will not be nearly as permissive as the doctors have been on abortion in New York.” And in Tennessee, where United States District Court has declared the state law un‐constitutional, Jack E. Ballentine, executive secretary of the Tennessee Medical Association, said, “Everybody is in limbo. Our attorney is studying the Supreme Court decision to see what our options are. I don't know of any physician who will perform an abortion on request right now.” In a few states, official action has served to delay implementation of the Supreme Court's decision. Louisiana's Attorney General, William Guste, said that the state could still revoke a doctor's license for performing an abortion, and the State Board of Medical Examiners said that it would move to stop doctors from doing abortions. Ten days after the Court's ruling, Circuit Court Judge Daniel A. Covelli in Cook County, Ill., issued a temporary restraining order blocking three physicians from performing 30 scheduled abortions. In some states, legislators who oppose abortion are formutating bills that they hope will stem the expected demand for abortion. State Senator John W. DeCamp of Neligh, Neb., has introduced a bill that he said “will attempt to restrict to the degree possible the butchery of babies in the State of Nebraska.” Among other things, the bill would impose tight restrictions on the grounds for abortions done in the second trimester, with an amendment requiring doctors to report the names of all women who undergo abortions. Aryeh Neier; executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the organization's affiliates would take action against any state that enacted laws not in conformity with the Supreme Court's ruling. He said that the organization would also act against restrictive practices by publicly funded hospitals, restrictive provisions in health codes, refusal to provide Medic aid payments and requirements for the husband's consent to abortion. Faced with reluctance on the part of local doctors and hospitals, abortion referral services throughout the country said that they were continuing to refer patients to the same places they had before the court's decision. In most cases, an abortion in a clinic in New York or Washington is likely to be far less costly — even with transportation costs—than the same operation in a hospital elsewhere. New York City health officials reported yesterday that there had been no perceptible change in the numbers of out‐of‐state women receiving abortions here. There have been few moves to set up clinics in other states. Earlier this week, the Massachusetts Public Health Council approved a clinic to be op, erated by the Florence Crittenden League, which is seeking clinics in other states as well. In New Jersey, where Attorney General George F. Kugter Jr. said that the state would not prosecute doctors for performing abortions, some doctors expect the establishment of as many as 25 clinics. Several experts on abortion said that the high court's ruling could have the ironic effact, at least temporarily, of raising the cost of abortions everywhere, since the economics of low‐cost abortion clinics are dependent on large volume. Antiabortion forces have likened the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion to the Dred Scott decision of 1857 declaring that Negores were not citizens. That decision was over"
‘Mary Doe’ Has Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/17/archives/mary-doe-has-abortion.html,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 16 (UPI) — “Mary Doe,” the 23‐year‐old woman who filed a successful suit against Ohio's abortion law, had an abortion in a hospital yesterday, one day after a Federal judge ruled that the law was unconstitutional. “She has had the abortion and is doing fine,” said Leonard Schwartz, general counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, which initiated the court challenge."
HUNGARY OFFERS FAMILY BENEFITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/17/archives/hungary-offers-family-benefits-shortage-of-living-space-and-birth.html,"BUDAPEST, Feb. 9 — “The women of Hungary are so beautiful, but the birth rate is so low. It makes one wonder.” A foreign resident in Budapest, who keeps an eye, on the birth rate as well as the women, mused aloud as he gazed out of a cafe window at long‐haired women in short skirts, hurrying from shops along Vaci Street to their offices after lunch hour. The Hungarian Government has also been wondering — and worrying about future labor shortages—as it contemplates statistics showing a trend toward one‐child families. A serious housing shortage, compelling many newly married couples to crowd into one or two rooms with parents, is a major deterrent to having Children. Another factor is the need of most women to work to supplement their husbands' incomes. Abortion Rate Cited As a result, according to leading Budapest gynecologist, 230 abortions are being performed for every 100 live births. In a campaign to encourage couples to have at least two children, the Hungarian authorities have introduced benefits believed to exist in no other country. An important inducement is housing assistance to newly married couples who promise to have at least one child, within a specified time. Then there is a generous system of maternity leave. Under a law that took effect in 1967, a working woman receives three years of leave with partial pay for each of her first, two children, plus five months of leave at full pay immediately after a birth. During the three years, the mother receives 600 forints, on $22, a month, close to a third of the average wage of women in factories or offices here. The leave time is counted toward retirement and the woman retains rights to her old job. The paid‐leave system had a quick effect on the birth rate. In 1966, a year before the plan. 138,500 children were born in Hungary. In 1968, a year after the plan had been put into effect, births had risen to 154,000. Births have begun to decline again, however, to 150,000 in 1971. Within Budapest, it was reported that there were more deaths than births in 1971. But that was offset by moderately high birth fates in some rural districts of the country. The birth rate in Hungary has gone down sharply in the last two decades or so. In 1949, there were 21 births per 1,000 inhabitants. By 1962, the rate was down to 12.9. The maternity ‐ leave plan raised the rate to 15.1 in 1968, but it is again under 15 per 1,000. Most recent statistics show a rate of 18.9 per 1,000 in neighboring Yugoslavia, 44 per 1,000 in Egypt, 18 in the Soviet Union and 15.7 in the United States. The housing inducements for young couples to have children were explained, by Tibor Nimes, an official of the Budapest City Council, in an interview. “We take 20 per cent off the initial apartment payment, up to 28,000 forints,” he said, “if the couple vows to have one child within three years. The payment is reduced by 45 per cent if they pledge to have two children within six years.” If nature refuses to cooperate with the couple, Mr. Nimes said, they can adopt one or more children before the deadline and still retain the benefits. Similar reductions of prices, tied to pledges to have children, are granted for stateassisted cooperative apartments. Low fixed prices on children's clothing and school materials are among other benefits offered to couples with children."
Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/18/archives/counterattack-by-the-bishops-abortion-religion.html,"Since the establishment of American Roman Catholic Hierarcl in 1789, the bishops have been virtu apostles of respect for civil lai Thus, the action the bishops took abortion last week was without pre edent in American Catholic history. In the wake of the Jan. 22 Supreme Court decision striking down restrictive abortion laws, the American bishops drewtime battle lines in a “pastoral message” and pointed their artillery at, civil authorities and at Catholics themselves. The bishops served notice on civil authorities that they considered the Court's ruling “erroneous, unjust and immoral.” and that they, as spiritual leaders, of the nation's 48 million Catholics, rejected the ruling. The condoned civil disobedience to “any civil law that may require abortion.” The bishops also warned Catholics that any who undergo or are parties to abortions are automatically excommunicated from the church and thus would be excluded from the sacraments, including the eucharist and marriage, and barred from receiving a Catholic burial. The application of excommunication to abortion is not new in Catholicism, which tends to look on abortion as a form of infanticide; the novelty of the bishops' announcement was in its explicitness and its no‐nonsense tone. The bishops' counsel on civil disobedience is directed primarily at Catholics, though it is apparent that the bishops would not be averse to others following their direction. Right now, that counsel is largely academic. There are on the books no laws of the type the bishops seem to be drawing a bead on Rather, the bishops appear to be looking ahead to a range of legal liabilities, imposed on institutions and individuals by the Supreme Court's decision. Mentioned specifically was the Wisconsin. Legislature's consideration of a law which could threaten the license of a doctor or nurse who refused to perform an abortion. Obviously, too, the bishops are concerned about statutory protection for the 718 Catholic general hospita's of the country which last year treated almost 23 million patients. As public institutions, many of them receiving some public funds to aid in construction, research and other programs, these hospitals could conzeivably be vulnerable to legislation which mandated medical services approved under law and within the hospitals' medical and physical competencies, including abortion. The bishops' statement—issued in Washington by the Administrative Committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops—foreclosed the possibility of Catholic hospitals being adapted as abortion facilities. It likewise foreshadowed a major churchstate confrontation if an effort is made to legislate abortion services Into Catholic hospitals, or to place on Catholic doctors, nurses and other personnel the legal necessity of tarrying out or cooperating in abortion procedures. The pastoral message is a test for he bishops in relation to civil authorties. The bishops have laid their full piscopal prestige on the line, and will soon learn how much the gesture counts. Some fear they are in for a disappointment on the ground that ouch of the bishops' credibility and lout drained away in their dogmatic oposition to birth control and their lability to convince all Catholics of he validity of their points of view. As for the Catholics, the statement a challenge for the bishops. Cathocs generally have responded posively to the bishops' firm stance gainst abortion, a marked contrast the opposition that exploded after Humanae Vitae, the papal encyclical of 1968 forbidding Catholics to use artificial birth control. There has been some Catholic dissent to certain tactics of the bishops in their anti‐aboron fight, but on the whole there appers to be a wide and in some guarters deeply felt Catholic sharing of the bishops' concern for the integrity of fetal life. On the other hand, not all Catholics are in lockstep with the bishops on every detail of the abortion issue. In some theological circles, the ancient question is being reopened: At what point is human life present in the womb and the fetus in fact a person? It is a crucial question, because it the embryo to a given stage is were tissue, then there is much less of a moral problem about its abortion, if indeed a moral problem at all. Catholic moralists have long held that life is present from the moment of conception, but some theologians cite new biological knowledge, especially concerning the process of twinning, which would seem to require a rethinking of the question. Twinning, or the splitting of the formative cells into two lots to form twins, is thought now to occur two or three weeks after conception, thus bringing into dispute old theories of life beginning at conception. There is also within the Catholic community some question about exceptions to be allowed within the church's anti‐abortion code. Presently the bishops are not budging from what is already permissible in Catholic moralty: the “accidental” expulsion or a fetus during a medical procedure or operation on a seriously ill woman for reason other than procuring expulsion of the fetus. Catholics term this “indirect abortion.” Some Catholic theologians, however, would broaden moral grounds to allow abortion in a variety of hardship instances, covering not only endangerment of the mother's life; but also such cases as incest, rape and malformed fetuses. There is considerable room for new contention between the bishops and the church's more advanced theolo‐. gians. Yet, if opposition does develop to the bishops' hard line, it is more apt to come from the laity than from theologians. The opposition of the laity, should it come, s likely to display itself in a quiet disregard for the bishops' moral counsel. Already a certain independence is evident. A Gallup Poll of last August showed that 56 per cent of Catholics believed abortion was a matter to be decided solely between a woman and her doctor. —JOHN DEEDY Mr. Deedy is managing editor of Commonweal magazine."
Adoption Costs Soar as Births Decline,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/20/archives/adoption-costs-soar-as-births-decline.html,"Childless New York couples, made desperate by the current shortage of healthy white infants, are turning to the legal but often expensive field of private adoption. In this nonagency procedure—widely known as the “gray market”—lawyers arrange for couples to acquire a baby at a total cost, including legal and medical expenses, that may range as high as $25,000. Although the procedure is legal in all but two states (Connecticut and Delaware), critics have questioned the high costs. Behind the baby shortage lie the pill and other modern contraceptive devices, liberalized abortion laws and the lessening of the stigma once attached to unwed motherhood. The adoption agencies, which once were able to provide a steady stream of white infants at fees ranging from $500 to $2,000, have found that their sources have virtually dried up. One result is waiting lists of from three to five years for a baby. The agencies have shifted their emphasis to children who used to be classified as “hard to place”: They are either black or of mixed race, over the age of 2, or physically handicapped. The Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare estimates that 60,000 of these children are now available for adoption, 1,050 of them in New York City. “Gray market” adoption differs from “black market” adoption—which is illegal—in that the black market involves bypassing legal procedures to directly sell a child for something of value (usually money), or it involves outright fraud—such as the falsification of a birth certificate. But what both the “gray” and “black” procedures boil down to is the ability to pay. And generally, the fees are sky high. “There is no law about legal fees—we can charge any fee that we want to,” said Walter Lebowitz, a Miami lawyer who was acquitted there last November on charges that he sold an inrant to a couple for $7,000—$5.500 jn legal fees and $1,500 in medical menses. The judge ruled that the case was a legal adoption and that the fees were all legitimate adoption expenses. Since then Mr. Lebowitz has written 200 pages of a book about himself and the case, with the working title of “The Baby Seller.” He hopes that it will become a best seller. And what does he define as a black market adoption? “Oh, we recently had one of those in Florida,” he replied. “A lady sold her baby for a car. Now that's clearly black market.” In private adoption (known as “independent adoption” in some states), a couple generally go to an adoption lawyer who is either already in touch with a pregnant woman or knows other lawyers who may be, (There is a group of about 40 lawyers across the country who frequently work together.) The couple then agree to pay the mother's medical expenses and all legal fees. Of course, the use of a second lawyer raises the cost. In any event, the total rums from $3.000 to $25:000. Once the mother officially relinquishes the baby in court, adoptive parents in New York are investigated by the city and the report is turned over to either Surrogates or Family Court, which have the final say on whether the adoption will be permitted. Court approval means the parents will receive a birth certificate in their name and that the original certificate will be locked away. In agency adoptions, the agency does all of the investigating — before the baby is given to the couple. With private adoptions, the city investigation comes after the placement and is much more cursory. The private placements, however, are rarely turned down. “We have to find something really drastic for that to happen,” a city investigator said. According to Joseph H. Reid, executive director of the Child Welfare League of America, a total cost of $10,000 for a baby involved in a “gray” or a “black” procedure is becoming “rather normal,” “What we're hearing about these days are $25,000 babies,” Mr. Reid said. “This is a very serious situation and one that may develop into a very critical one. “The baby business is expanding rapidly all over the country, judging from what people in the child welfare field are telling me,” he added. “These profiteers are using any method they can, including hiring someone on a campus to keep an eye out for pregnant girls, hiring someone to watch maternity homes for new arrivals — and even accosting doctors, lawyers and social workers for the names of pregnant girls.” • There is very sketchy evidence available as to the extent of such adoption abuses as sky‐high fees, falsification of records, illegal payments to mothers and blackmail following some illegal transactions. Court cases such as the one involving Mr. Lebowitz are rare, although district attorneys in New York and Miami, where many of the shadier dealings occur, said “investigations” in this area were now under way. In New York, selling babies is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a one‐year jail sentence and a $1,000 fine for each act. In Florida, it is a felony, and the offender faces a fine of up to $5,000 and up to 5 years in prison. “You rarely find prosecution in this area,” Mr. Reid said, “because it is a very messy situation, There is a baby involved, and a family involved, and they generally don't want to testify.” Nationally, the percentage of private adoptions compared with agency adoptions has held steady over the years, even though the total number of adoptions is rapidly declining due to the baby drought. In 1970, the last year for which Government figures are available, 69,600 children were adopted through agencies and 19,600 were adopted privately. In New York State, the figures for 1971– 72 were 4,457 agency placements and 1,637 private placements. Ten New York area couples who were interviewed about their experiences with private and black market adoptions all vehemently refused to have their names used, for fear of cutting off their contacts for future adoptions, or because they feared that the children they had already adopted in this manner might somehow be taken away from them. Here are some of their stories: ¶A Brooklyn Heights couple learned through a lawyer friend of a man who allegedly had a steady supply of white babies horn of prostitutes. The man visited the couple at their home a few nights later and said he knew of two babies who would be born in a few months. If the couple agreed to his $5,000 fee, he said, one of the pregnant women would check into a hospital under the name of the Brooklyn Heights wife, and the baby's birth certificate would bear the couple's names, No adoption proceedings would therefore be necessary. The couple pondered this highly illegal offer for an hour, then dismissed it as “sordid.” ¶An East Side couple in their early 40's, who had been rejected by an adoption agency as being “too old” to adopt, received a telephone call one evening. It was from a Manhattan litwyer whom they had never met, or even heard of. “I may be able to help You,” he said, sympathetically. “If you like, I wit mail you photographs of some handsome single young men and beautiful single young women. For $10,000, you can choose the couple you want to make the baby for you.” At last report, the couple were still considering the offer. ¶A Jewish couple from the Caribbean decided they wanted that rarest commodity in the baby market—a Jewish baby. So they called a Miami lawyer and said that money was no object. A few days later they flew to Miami with $12,000 in cash and flew home the same day with the baby. • Several of the couples who have adopted privately spoke highly, almost reverently, about their lawyers, and said they would have no hesitancy about going through the process again. “The only thing that bothered me was the $700 that was unaccounted for in our adoptions,” said a Westchester County woman who, with her husband, adopted two babies privately through a Manhattan lawyer before the market dried un. (Each adoption cost around $2,500, including legal and medical fees.) “But my husband says that's the way you play this game,” she added. Other lawyers, such as Helen Hope of Miami, a former airline stewardess who is one of about 10 Miami lawyers who specialize in private adoptions, send itemized lists to their clients showing every single expense involved in the adoption. When does the cost of a private adoption become “excessive”? Observers of the adoption field say anything more than $1,000 for the lawyer and a total cost of more than $3,000 is questionable, with certain exceptions. Sometimes, for example, the cost can soar much, higher due to unexpected medical expenses. A New Jersey couple who had planned to pay $3,000 wound up paying $6,500 because the mother required extensive surgery following the birth of her baby. Lawyers hear of babies in several ways: Referrals from obstetricians, and abortion counselors, who, lawyers say, often get kickback fees; contacts on college campuses; from the pregnant woman or her family, and from prospective adoptive couples who find pregnant women through their own sources. Among the better known adoption lawyers in New York are Joseph Spencer, of 545 Fifth Avenue, who is sometimes called “the dean of private adoption”; Terry Milburn, who works out of her home at 670 West End Avenue; Stanley B. Michelman, of 250 West 57th Street, whose specialty is babies born in this country of visiting German and Austrian mothers; Leonard N. Tarr, of 40 Exchange Place, whose babies are sometimes called “Tarr babies,” and Emanuel H. Paysner, of 630 Third Avenue. Mr. Tarr, who was also a stockbroker, could not be reached for an interview. He is serving the eighth month of a two‐year prison sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn., for perjury in Securities and Exchange Commission case. He will be paroled March 7. Mr. Paysner received a three‐year suspension last March from the Association of the Bar of the City of New York for “converting to his own use” money he received as a guardian for two elderly men designated as “incompetents.” The sums involved were $17,690 and $17,887, according to bar association records. Mr. Paysner, who is still arranging adoptions, was one of three Dilanhattalawyers who were visited recently by a New York Times reporter and a male friend who were posing as a prospec. tive adoptive couple. At the meeting, which was held on a Saturday morning, the day after the initial telephone conversation, Mr. Paysner told the couple that for $10,000 they had a good chance of getting baby by the end of February. He did not mention his suspension, but said that another lawyer would handle the court proceedings. • The parents, he said, were an 18‐year‐old Jewish girl and a 19‐year. old Protestant boy, both college students from middle‐class backgrounds. He said the girl did not know she was pregnant until it was too late for an abortion. Mr. Paysner, a modly dressed man in a navy turtle‐neck and a goatee, spent 20 minutes taking a thorough written aioaraphy of the couple, including detailed information about their financial status. Then he said that if the couple were interested, they would have to pay him $10,000, which would be put in escrow in case the baby was not perfect. “If the baby has any defects or is a mongoloid,” he told the couple, “you will get the next available baby.” Mr. Paysner said that both the couple and the pregnant girl and her family would be given each other's names which is in opposition to agencies' policies of strict anonymity — and each would have the right to decide on the other's qualifications. Mr. Michelman, the second lawyer who was visited, told the, couple that for approximately $6,200 he could probably arrange for them to have a baby within six to eight months. The mothers he deals with, he said, are German and Austrian girls who are found by his associates in Europe. “The mother flies to New York in her ninth month and is housed in a private home until she gives birth at Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals,” he said. “I work with three German‐speaking doctors there, and they give The girls excellent care.” Mr. Michelman said he had arranged 15 similar adoptions, and that, so far, only one woman had decided to keep her baby and take it back to Europe. He said his portion of the $6,200 would be $2,250. “I know that's a lot of money for an hour's paper work and two court appearances,” he said, “but we do take very good care of the girl while she's here.” When the couple called Joseph Spencer, they were told that he would be enable to see them before the end of March, and that he charged $100 for an hour's consultation. He added that the “situation was grim,” and that the couple would probably have to wait two years for a baby. However, when the “husband” indiated that money was no object, Mr. Spencer told him, “Well, I do take certain cases in my home in Jackson Heights.” An appointment was set for the following week in his office. Two days later. Mr. Spencer called the couple and told them that a Philadelphia lawyer, who usually handles babies from Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia, knew of a white American infant who was about to be born. The cost was $9,500, plus an additional $2,500 fee for Mr. Spencer. “If you're not interested,” Mr. Spencer said, “we can still have the meeting in my office on Monday.” The appointment was confirmed the next day by letter, which informed the couple that Mr. Spencer's fee for an hour's consultation had risen to $250. The couple canceled the appointment. The following week, Mr. Spencer was interviewed in his office by the reporter, whom he did not know was a member of the couple who had seemed so eager to adopt a baby. The lawyer, a wizened man with full head of silver hair, refused to discuss his fees, saying only that “when you go to the best, you pay more. That's why Louis Nizer can command $5,000. That's why I get more than other people.” Mr. Spencer said he abhorred the practices of certain profiteering lawyers whom he called “buccaneers,” but said he often dealt with them when his clients desperately wanted a baby and agreed to pay their inflated fees. “Money talks in this business,” he said. “It's Rotten to the point where babies that are supposed to go to my clients are being snatched right out from under our noses for more money. There's, a terrific hunger out there, and the people who will suffer are those in the $15,000‐$16,000 salary bracket or less because they'll never be able to afford to adopt — unless they have wealthy. parents.” Mr. Spencer said that even though it was illegal, he thought there was nothing wrong with an adoptive couple giving a gift of money to the mother for her baby in addition to legal and redical expenses. The way to circumvent the law in this case, he said, is to give the mother $750 to $1,000 “for living expenses.” “I feel philosophically that a mother who is doing this noble thing should be rewarded for her pain and suffering,” he said. Many child welfare experts say the only answer to adoption abuse is to put all adoptions in the hands of agencies. Such a situation now exists in Connecticut and Delaware, and similar legislation has been introduced but defeated in recent years in Florida and California. “The all‐agency system has been absolutely successful in preventing independent adoptions in Connecticut,” said Robert Budney, that state's chief of adoption and unwed mother services. “About a dozen couples try to arrange independent adoptions a year, but that's only because they're ignorant of the law.” The system has been in effect there since 1959, and allows adoptions only through public or private adoption agencies. The public agencies charge no fee; the private agencies' fees are figured on a sliding scale based on a couple's income. Religion becomes a factor only when a mother requests that her child be placed with a couple of a particular faith. Proponents of private adoption in New York are critical of what they consider to be the archaic and santic rnonious practices of agencies as they are now set up here, as well as of the agencies' long waits for babies, their impersonality, and their rigid requirements that make it difficult for middleaged people to adopt and virtually bar adoptions across religious lines. “We just didn't want to go, throughthe humiliation that applying at an agency involves,” said one Queens mother who had adopted a child privately. “They ask you such personal questions, like all about your sex life and the size of your house.” Judge Nanette Dembitz of the New York City Family Court, who has presided over hundreds of adoption proceedings, said that the occasional result of a system in which money is the most important factor in getting a child was the “obnoxious practice” of babies going to “undesirable parents.” “I think all private adoptions should be abolished,” she said. “But first we must have a sufficient network of agencies that are truly nonsectarian and do not act arbitrarily. That would be the ideal situation.”"
TV: ‘Brand New Life’ Proves a Compliment to A.B.C. Viewers,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/20/archives/tv-brand-new-life-proves-a-compliment-to-ab-c-viewers.html,"Most made‐for‐TV movies emerge like assembly‐line lard, but “A Brand New Life” is a joy. Intelligent adults or young people, or even bright children, who watch the 90‐minute “Tuesday Movie of the Week” tonight at 8:30 over the American Broadcasting Company network can almost take it as a compliment. Tonight's drama, co‐starring Cloris Leachman and Martin Balsam, is the story of the first unexpected pregnancy of a 40‐year‐old wife and its consequences and adjustments. Literate, moving, amusing and genuinely sophisticated in its quiet, observant wisdom, the program is beautifully written, performed, directed and produced. Compared to a snickering Broadway hit about middle‐years pegnancy called “Never Too Late” and compounded by Hollywood, tonight's show is, refreshing. Indeed, the striking color photography of the Los Angeles settings — handsome, meticulous offices and apartment sand the city's sumptuous opera house (where the pregnant heroine works) —may seem at first to be cushioning reality. Not at all, in the calmly inclusive script by Jerome Cass and Peggy Chantler Dick, which subtly sidesteps clichés under Sam O. Steen's deft direction. Scene after scene works persuasively. There is Miss Leachman's biting counsel from a matron friend (Marge Redmond), the brisk encouragement of a young obstetrician and one scene of bloodcurdling gentility with the heroine's invalid mother (Mildred Dunnock), who advises abortion. Balancing this, and including a tasteful sequence of a class in natural childbirth, is Miss Leachman's friendship with an unwed, radiantly expectant girl (exquisitely played by Karen Philipp). Above all, this is a deeply felt love story, and the best scene is the last, a small gem of touching trivia. • Miss Leachman and Mr. Balsam are, of course, splendid. Effective, too, are Wilfrid Hyde‐White as a wry, opera‐house chief, Gene Nelson as a friend of the couple, and the actress who briefly portrays a peppery but warmhearted prima donna (unlisted in the written credits). And let's not forget Billy Goldenberg's score and David M. Walsh's camera work. Robert W. Christiansen and Rick Rosenberg have produced a made‐for‐TV movie studiously not to be avoided."
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/20/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1973 The Major Events of the Day International Fighting in South Vietnam declined substantially during the last 24 hours, the Saigon military authorities reported today, leading to the belief that an urgent appeal by the Four‐Party Joint Military Commission to end all hostilities might be having some effect at last. The decline in the fighting was the first since the commission issued its appeal on Saturday. [Page 1, Column 3.] An official investigating group discovered that the coffin containing the body of Marshal Henri‐Philippe Pétain, the hero of Verdun and the head of the government that collaborated with the German occupiers in World War II, has been stolen from a tomb on the Ile d'Yeu, south of Brittany off the French Atlantic coast. The disappearance of the body of the most controversial figure of 20th‐century France has political significance at the closing of the campaign for National Assembly elections, to be held early next month. A cease‐fire without a formal settlement has been proposed for Laos by Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Communist‐led Pathet Lao. His initiative, though rejected twice within the last week by the Laotian Government, is under renewed consideration by Prince Souvanna Phouma, the Premier, and his Cabinet. A strong possibility of its acceptance is seen. [1:4.] National Judge Otto Kerner, former two‐term Governor of Illinois, was found guilty in Federal District Court in, Chicago of conspiracy, accepting, a bribe, income tax evasion, mail fraud and perjury. Theodore J. Isaacs, his friend and business associate, was also found guilty on similar counts except perjury. Mr. Kerner, 64, is a United States Court of Appeals Judge far the Seventh Circuit. He faces a maximum sentence of 83 years in prison, and fines of $93,000 on the 17 charges against him. He is free on bond. [1:1–2.] President Nixon told a cordially attentive meeting of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O. Executive Council in Bat Harbour, Fla., that he would ask Congress for broad discretionary powers to negotiate a “safeguard system” of trade agreements in the national interest. George Meany, president of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O., said at a news conference later that he found the President's idea “attractive.” [1:5–6] President Nixon also told, the union leaders that rises in food prices would continue for at least several months and then tend to level off. He also said the Administration Would take steps to increase the food supply and discussed the removal of meat import quotas. [48:3–4.] Metropolitan Italian authorities are conducting two separate investigations to determine if the 2,500‐year‐old Greek vase acquired last year by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, reportedly for. $1.3‐million, was smuggled out of Italy. If the authorities decide that the vase was smuggled, it is possible that they will request the cooperation of the United States Government in returning it to Italy. [1:1.] Dietrich von Bothmer the Metropolitan Museum's curator of Greek and Roman art, said that Robert E. Hecht. Jr., who sold and delivered the vase to the museum, had acted on behalf of an Armenian collector. [1:2.] The State, Commission of Investigation charged that the city's Tax Commission had improperly reduced real‐estate tax assessments by millions of dollars through blind acceptance of incomplete, irregular and sometimes, patently false applications from large property owners. In some cases, the state commission said a report, “the possible influence of political campaign contributions” might hive been allowed to “taint” and influenee the reductions. [1:8.] Reinforced with 10 additional staff members, the State Commission of investigation has begun an examination of some of the most complex problems of the police, prosecutors and judges in New York City. [39:2.] The recant lifting of all Federal rent tontrols, after a year and it half price regulation, has brought tenants in many of the metropolitan area's suburbs to a new level of militancy and has intensified political pressure for new controls. [1:7.] Childless New York couples, made desperate by the current shortage of healthy white infants, are turning to the legal, but often expensive field of private adoption in which an infant may cost as much as $25,000. Behind the baby shortage are the pill and other contraceptives, liberalized abortion laws and the lessening of the stigma of the unmarried mother.

Adoption Costs Soar as Births Decline,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/20/archives/adoption-costs-soar-as-births-decline-private-adoption-costs-soar.html,"Childless New York couples, made desperate by the current shortage of healthy white infants, are turning to the legal but often expensive field of private adoption. In this nonagency procedure—widely known as the “gray market”—lawyers arrange for couples to acquire a baby at a total cost, including legal and medical expenses, that may range as high as $25,000. Although, the procedure is legal in all but two states (Connecticut and Delaware), critics have questioned the high costs. Behind the baby shortage lie the pill and other modern contraceptive devices, liberalized abortion laws and the lessening of the stigma once attached to unwed motherhood. The adoption agencies, which once were able to provide a steady stream of white infants at fees ranging from $500 to $2,000, have found that their sources have virtually dried up. One result is waiting lists of from three to five years for a baby. The agencies have shifted their emphasis to children who used to be classified as “hard to place”: They are either black or of mixed race, over the age of 2, or physically handicapped. The Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare estimates that 60,000 of these children are now available for adoption, 1,050 of them in New York City. “Gray market” adoption differs from “black market” adoption—which is illegal—in that the black market involves bypassing legal procedures to directly sell a child for something of value (usually money), or it involves outright fraud—such as the falsification of a birth certificate. But what both the “gray” and “black” procedures boil down to is the ability to pay. And generally, the fees are sky high. “There is no law about legal fees—we can charge any fee that we want to,” said Walter Lebowitz, a Miami lawyer who was acquitted there last November on charges that he sold an infant to a couple for $7,000—$5.500 in legal fees and $1,500 in medical expenses. The judge ruled that the case was legal adoption and that the fees were all legitimate adoption expenses. Since then Mr. Lebowitz has written 200 pages of a book about himself and the case, with the working title of “The Baby Seller.” He hopes that it will become best seller. And what does he define as a black market adoption? “Oh, we recently had one of those in Florida,” he replied. “A lady sold her baby for a car. Now that's clearly black market.” In private adoption (known as “independent adoption” in some states), couple generally go to an adoption lawyer who is either already in touch with a pregnant woman or knows other lawyers who may be, (There is a group of about 40 lawyers across the country who frequently work together.) The couple then agree to pay the mother's medical expenses and all legal fees. Of course, the use of a second lawyer raises the cost. In any event, the total ranaes from $3.000 to $25:000. Once the mother officially relinquishes the baby in court, adoptive parents in New York are investigated by the city and the report is turned over to either Surrogates or Family Court, which have the final say on whether the adoption will be permitted. Court approval means the parents will receive a birth certificate in their name and that the original certificate will be locked away. In agency adoptions, the agency does all of the investigating — before the baby is given to the couple. With private adoptions, the city investigation comes after the placement and is much more cursory. The private placements, however, are rarely turned down. “We have to find something really drastic for that to happen,” a city investigator said. According to Joseph H. Reid, executive director of the Child Welfare League of America, a total cost of $10,000 for baby involved in a “gray” or a “black” procedure is becoming “rather normal,” “What we're hearing about these days are $25,000 babies,” Mr. Reid said. “This is a very serious situation and one that may develop into a very critical one. “The baby business is expanding rapidly all over the country, judging from what people in the child welfare field are telling me,” he added. “These profiteers are using any method they can, including hiring someone on a campus to keep an eye out for pregnant girls, hiring someone to watch maternity homes for new arrivals — and even accosting doctors, lawyers and social workers for the names of pregnant girls.” • There is very sketchy evidence available as to the extent of such adoption abuses as sky‐high fees, falsification of records, illegal payments to mothers and blackmail following some illegal transactions. Court cases such as the one involving Mr. Lebowitz are rare, although district attorneys in New York and Miami, where many of the shadier dealings occur, said “investigations” in this area were now under way. In New York, selling babies is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a one‐year jail sentence and a $1,000 fine for each act. In Florida, it is a felony, and the offender faces a fine of up to $5,000 and up to 5 years in prison. “You rarely find prosecution in this area,” Mr. Reid said,‐ “because it is very messy situation, There is a baby involved, and a family involved, and they generally don't want to testify.” Nationally, the percentage of private adoptions compared with agency adoptions has held steady over the years, even though the total number of adoptions is rapidly declining due to the baby drought. In 1970, the last year for which Government figures are available, 69,600 children were adopted through agencies and 19,600 were adopted privately. In New York State, the figures for 1971‐ 72 were 4,457 agency placements and 1,637 private placements. Ten New York area couples who were interviewed about their experiences with private and black market adoptions all vehemently refused to have their names used, for fear of cutting off their contacts for future adoptions, or because they feared that the children they had already adopted in this manner might somehow be taken away from them. Here are some of their stories: ¶A Brooklyn Heights couple learned through a lawyer friend of a man who allegedly had a steady supply of white babies horn of prostitutes. The man visited the couple at their home a few nights later and said he knew of two babies who would be born in a few months. If the couple agreed to his $5,000 fee, he said, one of the pregnant women would check into a hospital under the name of the Brooklyn Heights wife, and the baby's birth certificate would bear the couple's names, No adoption proceedings would therefore be necessary. The couple pondered this highly illegal offer for an hour, then dismissed it as “sordid.” ¶An East Side couple in their early 40's, who had been rejected by an adoption agency as being “too old” to adopt, received a telephone call one evening. It was from a Manhattan lawyer whom they had never met, or even heard of. “I may be able to help You,” he said, sympathetically. “If you like, wit mail you photographs of some handsome single young men and beautiful single young women. For $10,000, you can choose the couple you want to make the baby for you.” At last report, the couple were still considering the offer. ¶A Jewish couple from the Caribbean decided they wanted that rarest commodity in the baby market—a Jewish baby. So they called a Miami lawyer and said that money was no object. A few days later they flew to Miami with $12,000 in cash and flew home the same day with the baby. • Several of the couples who have adopted privately spoke highly, almost reverently, about their lawyers, and said they would have no hesitancy about going through the process again. “The only thing that bothered me was the $700 that was unaccounted for in our adoptions,” said a Westchester County woman who, with her husband, adopted two babies privately through a Manhattan lawyer before the market dried un. (Each adoption cost around $2,500, including legal and medical fees.) “But my husband says that's the way you play this game,” she added. Other lawyers, such as Helen Hope of Miami, a former airline stewardess who is one of about 10 Miami lawyers who specialize in private adoptions, send itemized lists to their clients showing every single expense involved in the adoption. When does the cost of a private adoption become “excessive”? Observers of the adoption field say anything more than $1,000 for the lawyer and a total cost of more than $3,000 is questionable, with certain exceptions. Sometimes, for example, the cost can soar much, higher due to unexpected medical expenses. A New Jersey couple who had planned to pay $3,000 wound up paying $6,500 because the mother required extensive surgery following the birth of her baby. Lawyers hear of babies in several ways: Referrals from obstetricians, and abortion counselors, who, lawyers say, often get kickback fees; contacts on, college campuses; from the pregnant woman or her family, and from prospective adoptive couples who find pregnant women through their own sources. Among the better known adoption lawyers in New York are Joseph Spencer, of 545 Fifth Avenue, who is sometimes called “the dean of private adoption”; Terry Milburn, who works out of her home at 670 West End Avenue; Stanley B. Michelman, of 250 West 57th Street, whose specialty is babies born in this country of visiting German and Austrian mothers; Leonard N. Tarr, of 40 Exchange Place, whose babies are sometimes called “Tarr babies,” and Emanuel H. Paysner, of 630 Third Avenue. Mr. Tarr, who was also a stockbroker, could not be reached for an interview. He is serving the eighth month of a two‐year prison sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn., for perjury in Securities and Exchange Commission case. He will be paroled March 7. Mr. Paysner received a three‐year suspension last March from the Association of the Bar of the City of New York for “converting to his own use” money he received as a guardian for two elderly men designated as “incompetents.” The sums involved were $17,690 and $17,887, according to bar association records. Mr. Paysner, who is still arranging adoptions, was one of three Manhattalawyers who were visited recently by a New York Times reporter and a male friend who were posing as a prospective adoptive couple. At the meeting, which was held on a Saturday morning, the day after the initial telephone conversation, Mr. Paysner told the couple that for $10,000 they had a good chance of getting baby by the end of February. He did not mention his suspension, but said that another lawyer would handle the court proceedings. • The parents, he said, were an 18‐year‐old Jewish girl and a 19‐year‐old Protestant boy, both college students from middle‐class backgrounds. He said the girl did not know she was pregnant until it was too late for an abortion. Mr. Paysner, a modly dressed man in a navy turtle‐neck and a goatee, spent 20 minutes taking a thorough written biography of the couple, including detailed information about their financial status. Then he said that if the couple were interested, they would have to pay him $10,000, which would be put in escrow in case the baby was not perfect. “If the baby has any defects or is mongoloid,” he told the couple, “you will get the next available baby.” Mr. Paysner said that both the couple and the pregnant girl and her family would be given each other's names which is in opposition to agencies' policies of strict anonymity — and each would have the right to decide on the other's qualifications. Mr. Michelman, the second lawyer who was visited, told the, couple that for approximately $6,200 he could probably arrange for them to have a baby within six to eight months. The mothers he deals with, he said, are German and Austrian girls who are found by his associates in Europe. “The mother flies to New York in her ninth month and is housed in a private home until she gives birth at Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals,” he said. “I work with three German‐speaking doctors there, and they give The girls excellent care.” Mr. Michelman said he had arranged 45 similar adoptions, and that, so far, Only one woman had decided to keep her baby and take it back to Europe. He said his portion of the $6,200 would be $2,250. “I know that's a lot of money for an hour's paper work and two court appearances,” he said, “but we do take very good care of the girl while she's here.” When the couple called Joseph Spencer, they were told that he would be unable to see them before the end of March, and that he charged $100 for an hour's consultation. He added that the “situation was grim,” and that the couple would probably have to wait two years for a baby. However, when the “husband” indicated that money was no object, Mr. Spencer told him, “Well, I do take certain cases in my home in Jackson Heights.” An appointment was set for the following week in his office. Two days later. Mr. Spencer called the couple and told them that a Philadelphia lawyer, who usually handles babies from Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia, knew of a white American infant who was about to be born. The cost was $9,500, plus an additional $2,500 fee for Mr. Spencer. “If you're not interested,” Mr. Spencer said, “we can still have the meeting in my office on Monday.” The appointment was confirmed the next day by letter, which informed the couple that Mr. Spencer's fee for an hour's consultation had risen to $250. The couple canceled the appointment. The following week, Mr. Spencer was interviewed in his office by the reporter, whom he did not know was a member of the couple who had seemed so eager to adopt a baby. The lawyer, a wizened man with full head of silver hair, refused to discuss his fees, saying only that “when you go to the best, you pay more. That's why Louis Nizer can command $5,000. That's why I get more than other people.” Mr. Spencer said he abhorred the practices of certain profiteering lawyers whom he called “buccaneers,” but said he often dealt with them when his clients desperately wanted a baby and agreed to pay their inflated fees. “Money talks in this business,” he said. “It's gotten to the point where babies that are supposed to go to my clients are being snatched right out from under our noses for more money. There's, a terrific hunger out there, and the people who will suffer are those in the $15,000‐$16,000 salary bracket or less, because they'll never be able to afford to adopt — unless they have wealthy. parents.” Mr. Spencer said that even though it was illegal, he thought there was nothing wrong with an adoptive couple giving a gift of money to the mother for her baby in addition to legal and redical expenses. The way to circumvent the law in this case, he said, is to give the mother $750 to $1,000 “for living expenses.” “I feel philosophically that a mother who is doing this noble thing should be rewarded for her pain and suffering,” he said. Many child welfare experts say the only answer to adoption abuse is to put all adoptions in the hands of agencies. Such a situation now exists in Connecticut and Delaware, and similar legislation has been introduced but defeated in recent years in Florida and California. “The all‐agency system has been absolutely successful in preventing independent adoptions in Connecticut,” said Robert Budney, that state's chief of adoption and unwed mother services. “About a dozen couples try to arrange independent adoptions a year, but that's only because they're ignorant of the law.” The system has been in effect there since 1959, and allows adoptions only through public or private adoption agen; cies. The public agencies charge no fee; the private agencies' fees are figured on a sliding scale based on a couple's income. Religion becomes afactor only when a mother requests that her child be placed with a couple of a particular faith. Proponents of private adoption in, New York are critical of what they consider to be the archaic and sanctic rnonious practices of agencies as they are now set up here, as well as of the agencies' long waits for babies, their impersonality, and their rigid requirements that make it difficult for middleaged people to adopt and virtually bar adoptions across religious lines. “We just didn't want to go, throughthe humiliation that applying at an agency involves,” said one Queens mother who had adopted a child privately. “They ask you such personal questions, like all about your sex life and the size of your house.” Judge Nanette Dembitz of the New York City Family Court, who has presided over hundreds of adoption proceedings, said that the occasional result of a system in which money is the most important factor in getting child was the “obnoxious practice” of babies going to “undesirable parents.” “I think all private adoptions should be abolished,” she said. “But first we must have a sufficient network of agencies that are truly nonsectarian and do not act arbitrarily. That would be the ideal situation.”"
"Abortion Law Linked in Study To 19,000‐Birth Drop in City",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/21/archives/abortion-law-linked-in-study-to-19000birth-drop-in-city.html,"Legal abortions performed on New York City women during the first two years under a liberalized abortion law led to a decline of about 19,000 births beyond what would have otherwise occurred, a statistical analysis has indicated. This would mean that legal abortions accounted for about half of the 25 per cent decline in births, in New York City between 1970 and 1972. The remaining decline would be attributable to such factors as improved contraceptive practices and changing family preferences. In addition, the analysis by Dr. Christopher Tietze of the Population Council disclosed, legal abortions here supplanted an estimated 100,000 illegal abortions during theh two‐year period. Dr. Tietze, a biostatistician and international expert on the effects of abortion and contraception, predicted in an interview yesterday that if abortions became readily available throughout the country under the Supreme Court's recent ruling, they could lead nationally to an additional drop of 300,000 to 400,000 births a year. Dr. Charles Westoff, a Princeton sociologist and expert on national fertility trends, said in an interview that Dr. Tietze's estimate “would mean a 10 per cent drop in births over and above the influence of all other factors,” He said, “There hasn't been such a large drop in births in at least the last 15 years.” Such a drop in births, he said, “would drive the national fertility rate substantially below replacement level.” In anticipation of widespread abortions throughout the country, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued medical guidelines yesterday for the performance of early abortions (through 13 weeks of pregnancy) outside of hospitals. The college recommends, among other things, appropriate surgical, anesthetic and resuscitation equipment and immediate hospital backup facilities in case of emergencies. Beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, the college said, all abortions should be performed in hospitals. Dr. Tietze's analysis of the impact of legal abortion here, to be published in the forthcoining issue of Family Planning Perspectives, is based on a complex juggling of the number of abortions performed on resident women between July, 1970 (when the abortion law took effect), and July, 1972, and the corresponding drop in live births in 1971 and 1972. In the first, year under the law, 67,400 legal abortions were performed on resident women. The number rose to 75,100 the second year. In 1971, the city recorded an 11.6 per cent decline in births, or 17,300 fewer than the previous year. In 1972, births dropped by another 16,400. Dr. Tietze concluded that approximately 30 per cent of the legal abortions on resident women prevented births that otherwise would have occurred in 1971 and 1972, with the remaining 70 per cent of legal abortions replacing about 50,000 illegal procedures each year. Since many of the abortions were done on unmarried women (they had about 1,500 abortions for every 1,000 live births, compared with 100 abortions per 1,000 births among married women), Dr. Tietze concluded, that legal abortion was “a major factor accounting for the unprecedented decline in the number of illegitimate births in New York City.”"

A BELGIAN PHYSICIAN FREE PENDING TRIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/21/archives/a-belgian-physician-free-pending-trial.html,"BRUSSELS, Feb. 20—A Belgian gynecologyst whose arrest Jan. 17 on charges of performin over 200 abortions touched off a wide debate on strict abortion laws here was released from prison today by a court. Judicial officials, who gave no basis for the action, said that the trial of Dr. Willy Peers, a noted advocate of free abortion and contraception laws, would go ahead “with objectivity, serenity and total independence.” A court in nearby Liege had overruled a similar order to free Dr. Peers. Today a court in Namur laid down no special conditions, but further abortions would clearly weigh against Dr. Peers at his trial. After a strong public outcry over the Peers case, the Minister of Justice, Helmand Vanderpooten, a liberal, announced Saturday that he would propose changes in the law at least to permit abortion when the mother's health is in danger and in cases of, incest and rape. The present law, which is weakly enforced, forbids abortion except those to save the mother's life."
The Birth Pill Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/23/archives/the-birth-pill-dispute-fda-approval-of-chemical-unlikely-to-resolve.html,"The decision by the Food and Drug Administration to give official approval to the use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) as a “morning‐after” contracentive has formally settled a longstanding debate, but it is unlikely to resolve the complex Issues that gave rise to the con troversy. These issues Include a number of problems that typically complicate the use and testing of drugs in this country. One is the difficulty of weighing benefits versus risks when the benefits are immediate and the risks may be decades off, and when the “patients” are essentially healthy. News Analysis Other problems are the inability of the F.D.A. to prevent the use of a marketed drug for an unapproved purpose or to enforce restrictions on an approved use, and the financial, organizational and legal obstacles to adequate testing of drugs under a proprietary system. Diethylstilbestrol is a manmade chemical with many of the properties of the natural female sex hormone, estrogen. It has been approved for use medicinally for many years for such conditions as menopausal symptoms, swelling of the breasts after childbirth, cancer of the prostate and certain uterine disorders. It has also been widely used to speed the fattening of animals. Studies conducted in monkeys and women over the last 10 years, and particularly those by Dr. John M. Morris of Yale University, demonstrated the ability of DES to prevent pregnancy if taken in high enough doses starting within three days after an act of unprotected sexual intercourse. Thousands Given Pill By last year, tens of thousands of womep—mostly college coeds — had been given DES as a morning‐after pill, even though it had not been approved for this use, and most of the women were not participating in an F.D.A.‐approved research study. An F.D.A. official said last fall that the agency had been unable to interest any drug company in conducting controlled studies of DES as a contraceptive. Collating the studies of many different groups, Dr. Morris reported last month that when properly used, in the right dose and at the right time, DES prevented pregnancy in all but about three cases in 10,000. But just when the contracepdye successes of DES were being most widely heralded, it came under attack as a dangerous chemical long known to cause cancer in several kinds of laboratory animals. Consumer groups charged that cancer‐causing DES was contaminating the American food supply through its widespread use in animal feeds. Last fall, the F.D.A. banned DES for this use. The agency was prompted to act by a report from a Boston research team that cancer of the vagina had developed in eight girls whose mothers had taken DES during pregnancy to prevent possible miscarriage (a use of DES which had never been proved to be effective). Limited Use Stressed The F.D.A.'s newly approved, labeling for DES says that it can be used for contraception “provided the patient is offered the option” of an abortion if the drug fails to prevent pregnancy. The label also says that a pregnancy test should be done first and, if it is positive. DES should not be used. But its most important caution—that DES “is to be considered as an emergency treatment only and not as a method for birth control with continuous or frequently repeated therapy”—has already become a new focus for controversy. A spokesman for the drug agency said that it was up to the doctor to define “emergency.” “For us to do so would be to interfere with the practice of medicine,” he added. Nor can the F.D.A. enforce its caution against “frequent” use of DES, for a licensed physician can write a prescription for any amount of the drug however often lie wants to. A similar caution that used to appear on the label of oral contraceptives limiting the time period over which they could be used safely was widely ignored by physicians. “‘Emergency’ has no meaning at all,” said Anita Johnson of Ralph Nader's Health Research Group, an organization that had previously condemned the “unapproved” use of DES as a morning‐after pill. “Far more women will, now take it with fewer safeguards,” she said, citing a study that indicated that many women given DES were not told of its potential hazards, were not adequately followed up and were not screened for factors that might make them peculiarly susceptible to adverse side effects."
Columbia U. Seeks to Combine Humanities and Career Studies,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/24/archives/columbia-u-seeks-to-combine-humanities-and-career-studies-columbia.html,"Columbia University undergraduates would get more technical career‐oriented courses and graduate students would get more humanities studies under a plan made public yesterday. W. Theodore deBary, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost of Columbia, gave the University Senate the plan for a broad reorganization of the curriculum to start next fall. He described the plan, the result of a year's study, as a way of combining the professional's need for knowledge of social and philosophical values that affect his work with the growing demand for technical and “useful” instruction. “The educational problem,” he told the University Senate, “is one that has to deal with the fact that many students do want serious, specific training in disciplines with career value, but who, while concerned with this training, also want to continue a broader education the social and humanist values in which these disc plines are being conducted.” Although no specific course have yet been devised undi Dr. deBery's broad proposal his plan noted how this al proach might be applied medical studies, As part what Dr. deBery called “cor tinuing general education, medical students would stud the historical, legal and ethical, aspects of such question as the right to health care mental retardation, drug addic tion and abortion as well as the technical and clinical aspects. Under the plan, undergradu ates would be able to star taking courses in professiona disciplines possibly as early as their sophomore year, and corn bine these courses with ongoing studies in “general education” that would extend into their graduate training. One major result of the planned changes, Dr. deBary noted, might be a shortening of the amount of time needed to earn an undergraduate degree. Explains Focus of Plan The central thrust of his plan, Dr. deBary said, was to end the separation between the general education in broad historical and philosophical subjects that currently dominates the undergraduate cur riculum, and the narrowly defined technical training of professional studies. “While recognizing the need for general education as an essential part of the undergraduate experience,” Dr. deBary said in his plan, “we also realize that no such experience can be isolated from the complexities of the contemporary world which are reflected in the expending fields of knowledge to which graduate and professional education address themselves. “What we propose, then, is a program of general and continuing education with its base in the college [undergraduate] experience, but its core extending upward into advanced fields of study, so that the trunk and branches of the university tree feed and sustain each other's growth.” Would Lead to Multiversity Such an interdisciplinary approach, he suggested, with lawyers, doctors, historians, writers, architects and engineers teaching and learning from each other, would help bridge the gulfs that have widened between Columbia's various schools and departments, making Columbia a “Multiversity” instead of a true “university.” Dr. deBary's plan represents the first major reform in the university's curriculum since Columbia pioneered the concept of “general education” following World War I. The university's well‐known “Contemporary Civilization” program was initiated then to give students a broader grounding in the arts, natural sciences and social history than did the unstructured system of “electives” offered at the time. It represented the beginning of today's familiar “required courses” that other institutions borrowed from Columbia's early reforms. Trend Is Spreading Other colleges and universities across the country are also considering reforms similar to Dr. deBary's. The Claremont Colleges in Claremont, Calif., for example, are drawing up plans to combine undergraduate and graduate training in law and business administration. Nearly all major colleges and universities, moreover, have begun to take an interdisciplinary approach to a broad range of subjects, or have established interdisciplinary “institutes” where multifaceted subjects such as urban problems or the environment are approached from the standpoints of science, economy, ethics and engineering. The first steps in the new plan will be taken next fall, Dr. deBary said. A university‐wide seminar of selected faculty members and students will meet to present their ideas on how they might work together to enrich each other's programs. He said some sophomores and juniors might be able to take advantage of a limited number of specialized professional courses as early as next fall. He stressed, however, that the university would approach the reforms selectively and throughout a process of “trial and error” at first. Senate approval of the plan is expected before the end of the current school year. Eventually, the plan would affect all 18,000 undergraduate students at Columbia and at its sister school, Barnard College. Its graduate schools offer training in law, medicine, engineering, business and commerce and the sciences. Criticizes Federal Policy Dr. deBary said one of the reasons his plan was needed was that Federal education policy had developed a “heavy emphasis on vocationally oriented education and the acceleration of degree programs of all sorts.” “It is easy to see in this trend,” he said, “a threat to liberal education and the humanities as most likely to be expendable in the process.” He made it clear, in an interview before his Senate speech, that one of his purposes was to protect the interests of humanism and the liberal arts in a society increasingly preoccupied with technical and “useful” knowledge. “You known damn will that if you put the pressure on for a speed‐up without providing for liberal education, something's got to give,” he said. Another reason for the re forms are changes in student values, he wrote in his plan. “Neglect of general education in favor of high‐powered specialization” has taken “its toll as students shrank back from success‐oriented careers and could only ‘find’ themselves or grope for their bearings through endless, aimless wandering she away from the university”, he said."
Columbia U. Seeks to Combine Humanities and Career Studies Studies,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/24/archives/columbia-useeks-to-combine-humanities-and-career-studies-columbia.html,"Columbia University undergraduates would get more technical career‐oriented courses and graduate students would get more humanities studies under a plan made public yesterday. W. Theodore deBary, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost of Columbia, gave the University Senate the plan for a broad reorganization of the curriculum to start next fall. He described the plan, the result of a year's study, as a way of combining the professional's need for knowledge of social and philosophical values that affect his work with the growing demand for technical and “useful” instruction. “The educational problem,” he told the University Senate, “is one that has to deal with the fact that many students do want serious, specific training in disciplines with career value, but who, while concerned with this training, also want to continue a broader education the social and humanist values in which these disciplines are being conducted.” Although no specific course have yet been devised uncle Dr. deBery's broad proposal his plan noted how this al proach might be applied medical studies. As part what Dr. deBery called “continuing general education,” medical students would study the historical, legal and ethical, aspects of such questions as the right to health care, mental retardation, drug addiction and abortion as well as the technical and clinical aspects. Under the plan, undergraduates would be able to star taking courses in professional disciplines possibly as early as their sophomore year, and combine these courses with ongoing studies in “general education” that would extend into their graduate training. One major result of the planned changes, Dr. deBary noted, might be a shortening of the amount of time needed to earn an undergraduate degree. Explains Focus of Plan The central thrust of his plan, Dr. deBary said, was to end the separation between the general education in broad historical and philosophical subjects that currently dominates the undergraduate curriculum, and the narrowly defined technical training of professional studies. “While recognizing the need for general education as an essential part of the undergraduate experience,” Dr. deBary said in his plan, “we also realize that no such experience can be isolated from the complexities of the contemporary world which are reflected in the expanding fields of knowledge to which graduate and professional education address themselves. “What we propose, then, is a program of general and continuing education with its base in the college [undergraduate] experience, but its core extending upward into advanced fields of study, so that the trunk and branches of the university tree feed and sustain each other's growth.” Would Lead to Multiversity Such an interdisciplinary approach, he suggested, with lawyers, doctors, historians, writers, architects and engineers teaching and learning from each other, would help bridge the gulfs that have widened between Columbia's various schools and departments, making Columbia a “Multiversity” instead of a true “university.” Dr. deBary's plan represents the first major reform in the university's curriculum since Columbia pioneered the concept of “general education” following World War I. The university's well‐known “Contemporary Civilization” program was initiated then to give students a broader grounding in the arts, natural sciences and social history than did the unstructured system of “electives” offered at the time. It represented the beginning of today's familiar “required courses” that other institutions borrowed from Columbia's early reforms. Trend Is Spreading Other colleges and universities across the country are also considering reforms similar to Dr. deBary's. The Claremont Colleges in Claremont, Calif., for example, are drawing up plans to combine undergraduate and graduate training in law and business administration. Nearly all major colleges and universities, moreover, have begun to take an interdisciplinary approach to a broad range of subjects, or have established interdisciplinary “institutes” where multifaceted subjects such as urban problems or the environment are approached from the standpoints of science, economy, ethics and engineering. The first steps in the new plan will be taken next fall, Dr. deBary said. A university‐wide seminar of selected faculty members and students will meet to present their ideas on how they might work together to enrich each other's programs.

Senate approval of the plan is expected before the end of the current school year. Eventually, the plan would affect all 18,000 undergraduate students at Columbia and at its sister school, Barnard College. Its graduate schools offer training in law, medicine, engi‐, neering, business and commerce and the sciences. Criticizes Federal Policy Dr. deBary said one of the reasons his plan was needed, was that Federal education policy had developed a “heavy emphasis on vocationally oriented education and the acceleration of degree programs of all sorts.” “It is easy to see in this trend,” he said, “a threat to liberal education and the humanities as most likely to be expendable in the process.” He made it clear, in an interview before his Senate speech, that one of his purposes was to protect the interests of humanism and the liberal arts in a society increasingly preoccupied with technical and “useful” knowledge. “You known damn will that if you put the pressure on for a speed‐up without providing for liberal education, something's got to give,” he said.

The bloody pressure on 22 million Americans,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/25/archives/the-bloody-pressure-on-22-million-americans-a-street-in-harlem-more.html,"Of all the rituals, that mark the routine physical examination, the measurement of blood pressure has always suffered for want of glamour. The simple two‐figure readings based upon the quick adjustments of the inflatable cuff, the asthmatic pumping of the rubber ball, the jerky climb and precipitous fall of the thin mercury line, seem primitive compared to the complex ciphers that represent the fracturing of a drop of blood into calcium, phosphorus, glucose, proteins and, of course, the various assortments of artery‐plugging fats carried by the blood stream. But almost suddenly, blood pressure—specifically high blood pressure, or hypertension—has come upon the medical world as a troubling, enigmatic and frustrating phenomenon. Troubling because afflicts an estimated 22 million Americans; enigmatic because in 85 per cent of the cases there are no discernible reasons for the disease; frustrating—at least to the more knowledgeable physicians—because many doctors ignore high blood pressure, despite convincing proof that treatment of the disease reduces the patient's vulnerability to coronary heart disease, blood‐vessel disease and kidney disorders. High blood pressure, health experts think, plays a direct role in the deaths of at least 60,000 men and women a year by placing severe strain on their hearts, slowly forcing them to fail. The disease, Elliot L. Richardson told the National Medical Association convention last October when he was still Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, also plays a significant, though indirect and as yet ill‐defined, role “in the more than one‐and‐a‐half million heart attacks and strokes Americans suffer each year. Nearly half of these heart‐attack and stroke victims die, and the majority of those who don't die are paralyzed or severely restricted activity.” While high blood pressure takes a significant toll among all Americans, its presence is most strongly felt in the nation's black communities. Government officials estimate that one in seven blacks has high blood pressure. Other estimates range even higher. “Four of 10 blacks you see walking in the street have high blood pressure,” says Dr. Frank Finnerty Jr., a Washington, D. C., physician and professor of medicine at Georgetown University. “Furthermore, hypertension is different in blacks in that it develops at a younger age, frequently in teen‐agers, and is usually more severe.” Among black men between the ages of 25 and 44, the death rate from hypertension‐related heart disease is 15 times greater than it is among white men. Among black women it is 17 times greater than it is among white women. “Hypertension kills more than 13,500 blacks every year, compared with sickle cell's toll of 340,” Secretary Richardson said. “The death rate points up the racial disparity even more sharply: The nonwhite death rate for hypertension is 58.4 per 100,000, or more than twice the 27.1 rate for whites.” BLOOD pressure is the force with which blood pushes through the arterial system to bring nourishment to the body's tissues. Since the need for nourishment varies from tissue to tissue and moment to moment, a complex regulatory system, sensitive to varying tissue conditions, functions by means of hormones and chemicals to widen or narrow arterioles, the microscopically small access arteries used by blood to reach the tissues. As the arterioles narrow, pressure in the larger arteries rises —just as the pressure rises in a hose when the nozzle is turned tight. In some men and women, this regulatory system runs amuck, ordering simultaneous and continuous constriction of the arterioles over the entire body. As the small vessels blood pressure goes up and stays up. Medical researchers know that in 10 to 15 per cent of the hypertension cases, a definite physiological cause can be found. In a healthy person, the adrenal glands manufacture carefully controlled quantities of aldosterone, a hormone that helps the kidneys keep salt and water levels in the body at an adequate level. But tumors in the adrenal gland can cause an excessive secretion of aldosterone, leading to excessive fluid retention in the kidneys. As fluids accumulate there, fluids that would normally be carried to the kidneys by the blood stream back up in the circulatory system, raising bloodpressure levels as if someone had turned up the faucet without increasing the nozzle opening on the hose. The healthy kidney manufactures renin, a substance that is both an enzyme and a hormdne, which influences the contraction of arterial walls and also continually influences the production of aldosterone. In both cases, it plays an important role in maintaining proper blood‐pressure levels. But some kidney diseases will lead to an excessive secretion of renin, which in turn results in a continuous and generalized increase in blood pressure. But beyond the very broad outlines of the regulatory mechanism and some understanding of the few known physiological causes behind some cases of hypertension, everything else about high blood pressure remains a mystery and a source of debate. To begin with, there is the question of what constitutes a safe blood‐pressure level. There seems to be agreement that normal pressures should run between 100 and 120 over 60 to 80; that is, when measured on a sphygmomanometer, normal arterial blood pressure should, at its maximum, drive a column of mercury in a glass tube to a height of 100 to 120 millimeters. At its lowest, it should allow the column to fall to a height of 60 to 80 millimeters. There is also agreement that pressures that continuously stay at the 250‐millimeter level are dangerous. But there is virtually no agreement about the meaning of blood pressure readings that fall between 120 and 250. Some physicians, convinced that moderate elevations blood pressure are inevitable with advancing age, have adopted 160/90 as the cut‐off point between normal and high blood pressure. But other doctors question the establishment of a demarcation line for “high” blood pressure. Trying to define “high” in relation to blood pressure is, they feel, as futile as trying to define the adjective “tall.” “When researchers around the world started to study hypertension, they found that they could not compare results because they all had different views about what levels constituted hypertension,” Dr. John Chapman of the U.C.L.A. School of Public Health says. “So to achieve some basis on which comparisons could be made, the World Health Organization recommended that the point at which high blood pressure is defined be set at 160/90. But there is nothing magical about that figure, and there is really no fixed point above which you could say that a patient is in danger aid below which he might be safe.” Those experts who refuse to assign a precise cut‐off point for normal blood pressure feel that any patient who shows a rising blood‐pressure level during different examinations should be carefully followed because increased cardiovascular complications are involved in every permanent increase in blood pressure, no matter how moderate. “Insurance companies have shown that even within the range some accept as normal, those pressures at the higher end of the scale have a higher mortality risk than those at the lower end of the scale,” says Dr. Maurice Sokolow, chief of cardiology at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. “Someone with a 150/90 pressure would have a higher risk, using actuarial data, than someone with a pressure of 125/75.” Again, there is the problem of physiological and nonphysiological causes. Although they know that elevated blood‐pressure readings can be correlated with increased cardiovascular problems, researchers do not really know what is behind that correlation. “We know that high blood pressure leads to an increased and early incidence of heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease and aneurysms due to atherosclerrosis,” Dr. Vincent E. Friedewald, a cardiologist at the Arizona Heart Institute in Phoenix, says. “But the hard‐nosed question we have not been able to answer is why that should be. There is at least one theory that states that the increased pressure in the arteries forces fat out of the blood stream and into the arterial wall, but nothing has been proved.” Nor do scientists have explanations for the causes of hypertension in the patients where no physiological factors can be discerned. “Undefined or essential hypertension,” says Dr. Morton H. Maxwell, chief of the nephrology and hypertension division of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, “is an embarrassingly large slice of the pie.” To break up that slice, researchers are pursuing many leads. Psychologists and sociologists are intent on proving that psychological problems, including anger and frustration triggered by a hostile environment at home, in the office or in the community, may be the real causes of hypertension. When anger or frustration is vented, some accompanying psychological manifestations — emergency outpourings of adrenalin, a shift in blood supplies to muscles that might be, involved in responding to the source of anger, in fact a temporary increase in blood pressure as the body mobilizes its supplies—are soon dissipated. But if anger or frustration is internalized, the body, in effect, must go on spinning its wheels. In time, as the source of anger and the anger itself remain, some psychologists reason, the higher blood pressure becomes permanent. The incidence of high blood pressure in ghetto areas, some argue, is prime evidence that psychology, not physiology, is the original determinant. “In studies in Detroit, we found that blood‐pressure readings in black middle‐class males were no different from those in white middle‐class males,” Dr. Ernest Harburg, a social psychologist at the University of Michigan, says. “And, in general, we found that in black middle‐class people, both males and females, there was a significantly lower blood pressure than among lower‐class blacks who live in high‐stress areas where the 1967 riots broke out. We also found that those blacks in the high‐stress areas who kept their temper when confronted by a hostile situation, like an aggressive policeman or an uncooperative landlord, had the highest levels of severe hypertension and of borderline high blood pressure.” Researchers struggling to pinpoint physiological causes of high blood pressure are not convinced by these arguments. “You can hypothesize that an emotion could send a signal to the blood vessels to make them constrict and that in time this constriction might become permanent and cause hypertension,” says Dr. Sokolow, the San Francisco cardiologist. “But there is no proof that this occurs.” Laboratory experiments with animals, other researchers add, have also failed to prove stress induced by anger or frustration to be a causative factor behind hypertension. “We have stressed monkeys artificially and have induced rises in blood pressure in them,” Dr. Dorothee Perioff, associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, says. “But when that stress was removed, the pressure always came down. The laboratory work tends to confirm that you cannot get sustained high blood pressure if there is no physiological predisposition to it. The same is true of people. You can't take someone who has never been hypertensive and would never be hypertensive and get him to develop high blood pressure by frustrating him. You can shake normal people up and elevate their blood pressure, but ultimately that pressure will come down.” To say that stress does not cause permanent high blood pressure, these experts add, is not to say that stress plays no role at all in sustained hypertension. In some people, a predisposition to high blood pressure may be “uncovered” by stress and frustration. In others, already existing high blood pressure may be aggravated by emo tional factors. At the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, for example, some high blood pressure patients have been outfitted with portable blood pressure recorders. The patients also have been asked to keep a diary of activities while the recorder is in use. On the patient's next appointment, the physician has tried to correlate elevated blood pressure recordings with specific events noted in the patient's diary. “We think that it is possible in individual instances, by relating the events of the day with blood pressure recordings, to sit down with someone who has high blood pressure and say these are things that are particularly stressful for you and are the things you should avoid,” Dr. Sokolow says. “We had one businessman whose blood pressure went up When he was on the phone trying to persuade someone to do some thing. When he was interacting personally with someone his pressure was not as high. Other people, who might love to talk on the phone but can't deal with people face to face, might react the other way around.” Research into physiological causes of the disease includes a study of hypertension in certain Colorado communities by Dr. William E. Morton, head of the environmentalmedicine division at the University of Oregon Medical School. Dr. Morton found that the incidence of high blood pressure was greatest in towns where water tables had excessive amounts of nitrates—a pollutant left by human and animal wastes, plant wastes and fertilizer residues. “We are quite cautious about our findings,” Dr. Morton says. “But another team at Colorado State University has already done some follow‐up work in six communities near Hypertension country Fort Collins, Colo. Three had high nitrate levels and three did not. Reviewing the records of people hospitalized for hypertension problems, the team found no substantial difference in the incidence of the disease. They did find, however, that those who were hospitalized in the high‐nitrate communities were on the average 10 years younger than those hospitalized in the low‐nitrate communities.” Because laboratory ‐ produced nitrates are the base for successful drugs like nitroglycerin, Dr. Morton's views are met skeptically by doctors. “Frankly,” Dr. Morton says, “I couldn't find one physician who would take my findings seriously. On the other hand, doctors are not aware that among workers who handle the nitrates in the explosives industry in Pennsylvania, the coronary artery disease mortality has been reported to be 10 to 15 times greater than the rate among other Men. Thus, the relationship between nitrates and hypertension should be pursued.” Other researchers are following more conventional though no less controversial lines of inquiry. While most experts agree that salt plays a major role in aggravating existing high blood pressure by inducing the body to retain fluids, Dr. Lewis K. Dahl of the medical department of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., believes the high salt intake that marks the American diet from infancy is directly responsible for the onset of the disease. “Back in 1948,” Dr. Dahl says, “there was a tremendous furor over a ricefruit diet as treatment for high blood pressure. We studied the diet and found its low sodium content was paramount in its success. I wondered whether, if low sodium could ameliorate the disease, high sodium could not only exacerbate it but play a causal role.” To verify his theory, Dr. Dahl studied two Japanese communities and one Eskimo tribe where salt intakes were known and where blood pressure could be measured. “We found in general that as the salt level in the community increased, so did the prevalence of hypertension,” Dr. Dahl says. “That didn't establish a cause‐effect relationship but it did establish a correlation.” To pin down the cause‐effect relationship, Dr. Dahl, over a span of 20 years, bred 32,000 rats, feed ing some massive doses of salt. A substantial number of those rats fed salt virtually from birth developed hypertension. Dr. Dahl became convinced that in some humans —as in some rats—a high salt consumption from infancy leads to high blood pressure. This, he suspects, is especially true of the United States “where we go on a high salt diet the minute we come off the breast.” Dr. Dahl's hypotheses—especially his ideas that babyfood manufacturers are heavyhanded in salting their products—are dismissed by other experts. Even if manufacturers were not to add salt to baby food, Dr. Dahl's critics say, women would, following some biological impulse, add their own salt to the baby's food. Dr. Dahl shrugs. “The animal and human data are so strong,” he says, “that it is difficult for me to comprehend why the resistance is so strong. As for babies needing salt for biological reasons, that is baloney—pure, ordinary, undiluted. There have been at least two reported series of babies that were put on identical baby food, except for salt content, and the babies ate one with the same relish as the other, gained weight and developed normally. The metabolic requirements for salt are so minuscule, we can't avoid getting enough.” According to Dr. John H. Laragh, professor of clinical medicine at Columbia‐Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, patients with essential hypertension can be divided into several categories on the basis of (among other things) the level of renin in their blood. Though he has found no physiological explanations for the variations in renin levels—and although others regard his conclusions as pre mature—Dr. Laragh believes that his recent research demonstrates that the level of renin is crucial in determining the course of hypertension. “We believe that patients with high levels of renin have a more severe form of hypertension, a much poorer prognosis, have higher pressures and don't seem to live as long,” Dr. Laragh says. “Low‐renin patients have considerably fewer heart attacks and strokes, a little more than zero per cent as compared to 11 to 14 per cent for highrenin patients.” The incidence of hypertension among blacks, Dr. Laragh says, bears out his con tentions. Blacks between the ages of 25 and 40—the group with the severest forms of hypertension — have high renin levels, he has found. Other, older blacks in whom milder hypertension prevails have low renin levels. High‐renin patients, Dr. Laragh believes, suffer from more strokes and heart attacks because renin attacks blood‐vessel walls, forcing the body to deposit excessive amounts of calcium and fat to repair the damage, in the process blocking off the vessels. “Cholesterol is a tired, tired horse as a risk factor in heart disease,” Dr. Laragh says. “Something like renin, which shreds the blood vessels, is a much more meaningful factor as far as I am concerned than eating an egg in the morning.” While Dr. Laragh and others pursue substances that play a role in the onset of essential high blood pressure, a few scientists are exploring the possibility that the absence of some vital substance may lead to high blood pressure in some cases. More and more hypertension researchers are turning their attention to prostaglandins, mysterious substances in the body that act like hormones although they are fatty acid compounds. Concentrated amounts of prostaglandins can cause the uterus to contract and are now used to induce abortion. They also seem to have a salutary effect on intestinal activity when administered in sufficient quantities, and some physicians hope to adapt them for ulcer treatments. But more important, prostaglandins seem to be linked to blood pressure. “When prostaglandins were first discovered in the nineteen‐thirties in human semen,” says Mount Sinai's Dr. Maxwell in Los Angeles, “they were found to have a lowering effect on blood pressure in laboratory animals but nobody paid much attention and prostaglandins just sat around for 30 years. Now there is a theory that prostaglandins, which are produced in the kidneys as well as the testes, have an antihypertensive function. Laboratory tests with animals show that if you take out the kidneys, blood pressure goes up. But if you put the kidneys back in or just their medulla, the innermost part of the organ where the prostaglandins are manufactured, or if you inject just the substance into the animals, blood pressure goes back down. Some recent work with people with high blood pressure shows that prostaglandins also reduce blood pressure in humans. It is perfectly possible that an organic inability to produce prostaglandins causes some people to have high blood pressure.” Many researchers are convinced that no individual line of study will make much sense until the fundamental process controlling blood pressure gives up all its secrets. “We have learned that sodium, renin, aldosterone are all terribly important,” says Dr. Harriet Dustin, vice‐chairman of the research division of the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. “But the next question has to be whether anything at all can trigger hypertension unless you have a fundamental deficiency in arterial pressure control. For example, we knew that some women on birth‐control pills were developing hypertension. But only now are we beginning to realize that in order for that type of hypertension to occur, it is very likely that there had to be something else going on first.” THAT something else, some feel, may be some genetic factor that predisposes an individual to high blood pressure. The exact role that is played by the genes in the onset of hypertension is a mystery, even to those who firmly believe in the heredity‐hypertension link. Genes control the development of the body and its various systems. They also control all bodily functions throughout life by regulating the production of various substances that govern the chemical reactions in the body—the production of enzymes that facilitate the conversion of food into fuel, for example, or the production of hormones connected with beard growth. Both of these genetic functions can be adversely affected by a mutation that is passed on from generation to generation. Thus, some geneticists speculate, a mutated gene—or set of genes—could produce an unstable blood‐pressure control mechanism which triggers an elevation in blood pressure when influenced by some abnormal stimulus, be it an overabundance of renin or salt, a virulent kidney disease or an environmental factor like pollution or stress. Even a genetic mutation not directly related to the blood‐pressure control mechanism could lead to hypertension, some researchers feel. Calcium is crucial to the body's ability to metabolize salt, and a proper balance between calcium and salt seems to be necessary to maintain normal blood‐pressure levels. But in order for the body to use it properly, calcium too must be adapted to the body's chemistry. The adaptation depends on an enzyme whose production is controlled by a gene or set of genes. If the genetic machinery has deviated from normal, some researchers feel, the body may not be able to use the calcium it receives in various foods. As a result, the calcium‐salt balance is disturbed and, as salt exceeds calcium, blood pressure goes up and stays up. Japanese experimenters have bred rats that develop hypertension by the third month of life and die of the disease within 13 months. In hypertensive rats exposed to environmental stresses such as noise, blood pressure rises even higher and does so faster than in hypertensive rats living in quiet surroundings. Even the critics of Dr. Lewis Dahl's salt theory agree with him that his work has demonstrated that genetic influences must be present if salt is to trigger hypertension. In breeding his legions of rats, Dr. Dahl developed one strain virtually immune to high salt consumption and hypertension and one highly susceptible to sodium and high blood pressure. “If it is likely that there is a genetic difference in the abilities of rats to handle salt,” Mr. Dahl says, “it would be likely that the same is true of people. And we would say that other hypertension problems, whether they are caused by the kidneys or by hormones, can develop only if there is a genetic predisposition.” Many experts who have studied the incidence and distribution of various diseases among population groups tend to agree that genetics plays an important role in high blood pressure. Surveys have indicated that it tends to follow familial patterns: Children of hypertensive parents are more likely to develop the disease themselves later in life than children whose parents had normal blood pressure. Although it is a touchy matter, many population experts are convinced that genetic differences account for differences in the incidence of hypertension among the races. Genetics, these authorities say, accounts for the vast numbers of blacks who suffer from the ailment. “I'm fairly certain that genetic factors play a role in black hypertension and are exacerbated by life styles,” says Dr. Jan Howard, a research sociologist at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. “A number of my colleagues, especially black physicians, reject the idea. When you argue that it has been impossible to induce sustained high blood pressure in laboratory animals by subjecting them to stress, they answer that you cannot duplicate in a laboratory the repressed aggressions, the constant conflicts and constant humiliations that are a part of black people's lives for 40 or 50 years. “And until recently when you started talking genetics, people would say, ‘That can't be right, look at Africa.’ Early data, which were collected in southern and eastem Africa, suggested that hypertension was minimal there and the argument was made that if these African blacks did not have high blood pressure, and American blacks did, obviously the disease could not be genetically determined. But more recent studies, conducted in western and central Africa, are not at all inconsistent with the genetics theory. The studies are still preliminary and small in number, but they show that in these areas hypertension is a problem, especially as people move into the urbanized areas and are living long enough to be subject to the so‐called disease of civilization, cardiovascular disease. This is important because the American black slaves were brought from western and central Africa, not the eastern or southern areas. “At this point we can no more explain exactly why blacks should be more genetically disposed to hypertension than we can explain why Japanese women have far less breast cancer than American women. But the probability of a genetic determinant must be considered.” One set of statistics that disturbs many experts is the estimate that only half of the 23 million American hypertensives know they have the disease, and, of those who know, perhaps no more than 12 per cent are receiving adequate care. This is particularly discouraging to those who know that patients treated with antihypertension drugs, such as methyldopa, reserpine, the diuretics and thiazides, suffer far fewer heart attacks, strokes and other complications than patients who do not receive treatment. Several surveys have indicated that many doctors all too often pass up opportunities to diagnose and treat hypertension. “When we examined the charts of 200 patients admitted to hospitals in Oklahoma,” says Dr. Edward Frohlich, professor of medicine and director of the division of hypertension at the University of Oklahoma, “we found that one out of every four patients didn't have their blood pressure taken on examination by a doctor.” Experts who had despaired when Dr. Frohlich's report was published hoped that a study by Dr. Edward Freis and a group of Veterans Administration hospital researchers would stimulate better treatment of hypertensives. In veterans with severe hypertension, the Freis group reported, the risk of death dropped from one in five to virtually zero when antihypertensive drugs were used. In the same group, risk of serious complications congestive heart failure, cere bral hemorrhage — dropped from one in three to one in 36 with the application of drugs. Even more important were the results attained with patients who had only mildly elevated blood pressures. Among this group, Dr. Freis reported, the risk of serious and sometimes fatal complications, such as congestive heart failure and kidney failure, was reduced by as much as 300 per cent by proper medication. The Freis report gained wide circulation and publicity — especially after Dr. Freis was awarded the 1971 Albert Lasker Award for his work. But the hoped‐for assault on high blood pressure by physicians has yet to materialize. In Chicago, four researchers studied 22,929 patients who had come under a doctor's care following publication of the Freis study. The researchers — Dr. James A. Schoenberger, Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, Richard B. Shekelle and Susan Shekelle — found that 4,625 patients were suffering from high blood pressure but that almost 60 per cent of them did not know they were hypertensive. Almost 1,400 — 29 per cent knew about their hypertension but almost half of these were receiving no treatment while the other half were not receiving treatment adequate to bring their blood pressure under control. Of the 4,625 hypertensives, only 11 per cent were under proper care. “Since 90 per cent of the women and 75 per cent of the men screened had seen their doctors in the preceding two years,” the researchers reported in the Oct. 30, 1972, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, “it must be concluded that physicians had never made the diagnosis of hypertension or had deliberately not informed their patients.” To some extent the experts are sympathetic to a physician's hesitation in treating elevated blood pressures. “When you try to decide when to treat patients with drugs,” says. Dr. Sokolow, the San Francisco cardiologist, “the physician is faced with the situation of whom to treat and at what level to start. Since none of the drugs is completely innocuous and since they are expensive, the decision to treat is a major one.” But some experts also agree that a massive reorientation in attitudes is necessary, that physicians must be encouraged to take high pressures more seriously and efforts must be made to reach the nation's millions of undiagnosed hypertensives as well as hypertensives who are not taking their conditions seriously. “To a lot of laymen,” Mount Sinai's Dr. Maxwell says, “the hypertensive person is the nervous person. These people either don't go to see the doctor or don't take medicine when it is prescribed because they say to themselves, ‘I'm not nervous so I can't be hypertensive.’ But there is no personality that has ever been defined as prone to hypertension, and the calm, cool and collected individual could by dying of hypertansion. “These are the people we have to spot. And to do it, it may very well be that we will have to do as some people suggest and sit a bunch of kids in supermarket lots — white kids in white neighborhoods, black kids in black neighborhoods — train them to take blood pressures and, if they find anyone with elevated pressure, to hand him a bottle of pills, tell him to start taking them and to report to a clinic or to a doctor immediately.”■"
The Sputnik Rapist,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/25/archives/the-sputnik-rapist-cappella.html,"As novel, “The Sputnik Rapist” is something of an oyster; it rewards more for occasional digressions than for its natural business. Carl Jonas has a drawling, broad wit that's best when caught young and unawares. Fed into the unwieldy plot contraption—a thing for which you properly need maps, miner's lamp and a trail of croutons behind—wit can degenerate to slapstick or, worse, sentimentality. But Jonas's asides, particularly those aimed at the education industry, are succulent. I throw you some: an entire faculty terrified of losing, not salary, not tenure, but its parking permits; a college president out of the phys. ed. department who did his doctoral thesis on The Fair Catch; the ambitious Wasp professor who has changed his name to Dr. Irving Loeb and now complains about Jewish anti‐Semitism. These are marvelous; Jonas made me laugh regularly. Still—and I don't mean to seem ungrateful —“The Sputnik Rapist” is somewhat too rambunctious, out of hand. Jonas's first‐person style is loose, glib: talky conversation that uses colloquialisms, harmless four‐letter words, as one might ordinarily use commas. The protagonist is familiar enough: twice divorced, fortyish, on the alert for meanings, unmotivated but strong, in the male menopause. A character that, with variations, has served both Hemingway and Spillane. The nation, too, has menopaused: it is the moment of Sputnik I, which Jonas isolates as the watershed time —end of Eisenhower complacency, beginning of our present muscular chaos. The protagonist is embroiled, against his will, in a Shakespearean plot: twins, wedding‐night substitutions, child‐switching (four infants squared to 16 possibilities, a family tree that looks like Brer Rabbit's briar patch) and an un Shakespearean conglomerate that manufactures artificial cornfields, lawns, cows. It's supposed to be open‐ended fun. Often it succeeds. “The Sputnik Rapist” is about identity: we make ourselves and, as a by‐product, our gods. But when moving from nonsense to seriousness Jonas has some trouble with his shift gear. He tends to italicize: so much of the book is boisterous, undisciplined that this late philosophizing doesn't convince. At the end he disinters another convention: a young girl appears, might as well be the new year in diapers. The protagonist announces, “you, too, are the future” and “there was a nimbus of light around her like there had been around the Sputnik.” Somewhat sententious, given the circumstances. “The Sputnik Rapist” is an entertainment. You will laugh and that's worth a great deal these days. If not impeccably humorous, it is impeccably good‐humored. A pleasant book. Cappella By Israel Horovitz. 182 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $5.95. I think something fine has been achieved in “Cappella.” I think. The novel has absurdist affiliations: these irritate. Two men — an old Jew, a middle‐aged writer—pass 30 years in a hospital: taxing their Blue Cross coverage somewhat. They have unhealed wounds, an absurdist favorite. The writer, Byron, is operated on 20 times plus, line of scar after line of scar, until his stomach skin resembles the Rosetta Stone. There is the standard paraphernalia: pains, exaggerations, nightmares, super‐meaningful glances, a clash of symbols. Byron's train of consciousness runs like a 5 o'clock local from Hoboken, all stops, complete with its own amanuensis, as if author and secretary were some sophisticated form of schizophrenia. A good deal is frankly impenetrable and annoying. God and gastronomy have the same liturgical significance. This comes with the absurdist franchise after all. Yet, quite reluctantly at first, I forgave. “Cappella” is also an entertainment. The novel as oyster, soliloquy, folk‐legend, anti‐climax This is the first novel of Israel Horovitz, a double‐OBIE playwright. As might be expected, Horovitz has a glib knack for soliloquy. His words decant without sediment; they purl. And it is here that the enjoyment of “Cappella” is located: up front, on the apron edge, in a single spotlight. Three quarters of the book is an extended story telling. And the stories engross, they make thick laughter; their tone and accent, their circular movement is suave, accurate. By some ethnic prerogative the old Jew, Cappella, is the most articulate. His stories mature. They begin with a catalogue of proctological concern's —hemorrhoids and constipation—one thinks sadly, with a little Preparation H, a little Exlax, much of our American Jewish literature would never have been written. But his range swells out, becomes less bodily parochial: trust grows between teller and listener. He passes on to snow—which, in the “Oxford English Encyclopedia of Symbolic Meaning” (Vol. IX, page 184c) invariably stands for death. Then Cappella and “Cappella” move even beyond that: toward grace, I suspect. Wounds close. The painful but comfortable, orderly operations cease. A penchant for suffering and narcotics is outgrown. Lies told in the early pages are corrected. Cappello, is no longer A. Cappella, unaccompanied; he becomes part of Byron. At first they live saprophytically on each other, trading character qualities, then there is symbiosis. Finally separate health. They leave the hospital for God knows where in an absurdist terrain. It is intriguing. Hard work, but Horovitz has hung a good‐sized carrot on the end of his stick. I found “Cappella” worth the effort. Judah the Pious By Francine Prose. 279 pp. New York: Atheneum. $6.95. “Judah the Pious” astounds. Not superficially; not superficially at all. The novel reads as if it were some bad translation of itself: bald, literal, rather like the much overrated Jerusalem Bible, dry. Francine Prose (great Trollopian name for a novelist) freeze‐dries her writing, presumably so that stylistic and metaphorical pleasures will not distract. I'm disposed, as you notice, to make her the beneficiary of my doubt. Vocabulary is familiar; is, to be honest, quite banal. For example, at random: shrill, piercing screams; grains of truth; fitful dozing; wilds of Africa; longawaited day and other clever turns of language. Descriptions unfurl in series: predictably three sentences or a bracelet of three phrases linked by semi‐colons, or three words. The author has staked a first novel reputation on the inherent, elemental force of her narrative. Not even that: on the force alone of its splendid conclusion. For the narrative is provisioned with folk‐legend staples. Story‐telling inside story‐telling: young ruler educated by a wise rabbi. Unknown paternities; the quest through suffering and disillusionment; a conception that seems immaculate, give or take a few maculae. There is a Laputastyle academy of sciences which temporarily deludes Simon ben Judah, the hero. A medicine show vagabond. A fairy‐tale declension of three noblewomen: rich, less rich, least rich. There are sufficient eerie happenings to maintain interest, but not an overabundance, as the genre goes. Yet the conclusion fascinated me; fascinates me still. It is at once reversal and consummation. I cannot abstract it fairly here, but God and Judah the Pious (a great Jewish saint) are found to be mountebanks and finaglers of a kind: yet their fraudulence only serves somehow to confirm holiness. As a Christian novelist‐reviewer I was reminded of matters that I have tended to forget. That the New Testament has oversimplified the Old, has bowdlerized it in a sense. That the Son—mediator and advocate—has also distanced the Father I share with the author. That “The Lord, thy God, is a jealous God”—not to mention angry, fickle, full of humor, and closer to an Old Testament people who have always better understood those mysterious words “made in His image.” A God who is willing to let His grace, His revelation be made known by methods that a liberal priest or rabbi might condemn in ... well, in The New York Times. That's a lot to learn; or be reminded of, in just one novel. I don't think my reaction can be altogether due to a special sensitivity; this is available more or less to anyone who reads “Judah the Pious.” At 25, Francine Prose appears to perceive more than a writer of that age decently should. I cannot, in good conscience, say that she is a novelist yet. But she may well be a prophet, no small thing. The Columbus Tree By Peter Feibleman. 472 pp. New York: Atheneum $8.95. The first four pages of “The Columbus Tree” are daunting, superb, all anvil blows. I jotted in the margin, “Feibleman can write.” The four pages tell of a tidal wave: perhaps the theme elevated momentarily. I was excited. At this Valkyrie pace, 400‐plus pages had to mean masterpiece. But then a dog is run over; a young boy feels the first coy beckoning of manhood. Feibleman has shot his wad, but quick. There is left only the Charles Atlas physique of yet another logy, pompous blockbuster novel. After its prologue, “The Columbus Tree” is 100 per cent anticlimax. Feibleman is too fond of his people. When they are good, they are very, very good. Or very, very bad or sophisticated or primitive. Feibleman writes doggedly in the unannounced first person: an omniscient observer that verbalizes as young boy, fisherman, whatever. This produces enormity on top of enormity. The old peasant woman: “... then the big sneeze, and now there was more silence. It was a sneeze sandwich with silence for bread.... So life is a sneeeze sandwich, and it isn't even silence that is the bread. You are the bread.” Or the pregnant woman: “... the baby was going to change things too ... babies always change things, that's why they're babies.” Or the young adolescent: “He was born out of death, into the in‐between of wars. It was like death was really his father. So he was an in‐between person. That was what worried him. Right there. It worried him that he would always be in‐between.” I could go on and on. Feibleman does. You notice, too, the ritual, exasperating use of repetitions. I'd rather listen to Feibleman's fingernails scraped on a blackboard. And then we have the Columbus tree itself. This is intended as a unifying image: semi‐supernatural, satanic, power‐granting, a mirror of the emotions. It is too awkward a contraption by far. Nearly all the characters must punch in on its symbolic time clock. Apparently the Columbus tree can even manage an orgasm or two: “... the great tree hissed louder and she felt its breath on her face. Then the hissing changed and there was a single gasp, and then one long vast endless sigh of the tree, and the breath of it was strong on her hands and arms and face, and it was over.” Give Feibleman credit. With sex a resourceless, used subject in fiction, he's come up with a case history of arbor‐eroticism. Moreover, “The Columbus Tree” is hard to get through. It is a Book of the Month alternate because it weighs over six pounds. But the novel hasn't even best‐seller qualities. Not all that much happens—one inconsequential murder, one pregnancy‐abortion, one costume party, one death, some torture, much internal musing of the sneeze sandwich kind. On the evidence of four pages, I would guess that Feibleman probably can write well. The jacket reviews indicate that he has written very well before. He has not written at all well in “The Columbus Tree.” ■"
On original sin and conservatives,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/25/archives/on-original-sin-and-conservatives-along-the-conservative-spectrum.html,"Philosophers carry few precincts. Nevertheless they are not without value to men of power. Programs and policies gain added legitimacy if they appear as expressions of more enduring principles. At the same time, those talented in establishing these connections lean mainly to the left. The very epithet “intellectual” conjures up at least a McGovern supporter, if not more radical affinities. Moreover, when Richard Nixon expounds his views of self‐reliance or abortion, the arguments seem not simply shallow but untouched by academic influence. In fact the country does have conservative intellectuals, most of them quite capable of providing Presidential proposals with a theoretical framework. Yet even as the country has veered to the right, these thinkers remain less well‐known than liberals like Arthur Schlesinger and John Kenneth Galbraith or radicals such as Herbert Marcuse and C. Wright Mills. Names of the order of Leo Strauss, Robert Nisbet, Ernest van den Haag and James Burnham, usually encounter nonrecognition, even in circles where their writings might best be appreciated. In a way, this is not surprising. Conservatives have traditionally been doers, with little time or taste for heavy reading and abstract ideas. While William Buckley's National Review dutifully gives space to rightward scholars, one suspects that the typical subscriber skips those sections in favor of the magazine's more down‐to‐earth diatribes. But then a mistrust of theory has always been part of the conservative canon. Edmund Burke himself warned against “literary men” with their proclivity for “metaphysical abstractions.” As one who occasionally travels in this company (I once wrote a book review for the National Review), I am concerned over the country's inattention to its conservative scholars. One reason, certainly, is that these thinkers can provide some insight into the assumptions entertained by more practical men like Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, or William Rehnquist and Richard Kleindienst. But a more important reason lies in the need of both liberals and radicals to examine their own philosophical premises; and the best way to do this by bouncing your own ideas off their polar opposites. The only real dialectic we now have within the left: Galbraith modifies Mills, Marcuse rejects Reich, with disagreement more over details than basic principles. I must begin with a monstrous simplification: I will speak of the philosophical left as if it were an undivided entity. I realize as well as anyone that liberals can be hawks or doves; that radicals can be black or white; that within the left there are endless debates over integration, decentralization, due process, academic freedom, whether one can work within the system. In fact, liberalism itself has become more conservative in recent years. Regular contributors to magazines like Commentary and The Public Interest—Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, Andrew Greeley, Sidney Hook, James Wilson and Seymour Martin Lipset—seem to have given up on most efforts to combat poverty and discrimination. Even so, these writers represent an ideology closer to Hubert Humphrey's than Richard Nixon's. They remain mildly optimistic, so long as the pace remains prudent and discourse stays civil. But I am writing about political philosophy, not the current contours of opinion and policy. Today is Sunday, and we can leave such issues to the middle of the week. My plan is to focus on the recent writings of a half‐dozen or so thinkers who, in my judgment, are some of the most serious intellectuals along the conservative spectrum. Conservatism has always had a straightforward theory of human nature. “History,” wrote Edmund Burke, “consists for the greater part of the miseries brought upon the world by pride, ambition, avarice, revenge, lust, sedition, hypocrisy and all the trains of disorderly appetites which shake the public.” A shorter way to say this asserts that man is infected by the virus of Original Sin, a position that James Burnham and other conservative scholars are prepared to argue. Burnham, a one‐time Trotskyite and a philosophy professor at New York University until the mid‐nineteen‐fifties, holds to “the traditional belief, expressed in the theological doctrine of Original Sin ... that man is partly corrupt as well as limited in his potential.” Adam's fall, whether an article of faith or a figurative metaphor, underlies every conservative conclusion. It implies that man is prone to perversity; that the best‐intentioned plans will have self‐defeating consequences; that no society can ever attain consensus. The conservative case for capitalism, capital punishment, for believing that people prefer loafing on welfare to working for a living, all arise from this view of human nature. One problem is that the left is unwilling to come to grips with this conception. In earlier centuries the debate among radicals, liberals and conservatives was clearly delineated: those on the left were prepared to assert that man was essentially good (Rousseau), inherently rational (John Stuart Mill) and capable of ordering his own and society's destiny (Thomas Jefferson). In fact, the left still holds to this outlook—why else do they continually come forward with plans and proposals to remedy the maladies of our time?—but its adherents have become too sophisticated for so simple an affirma tion. Nevertheless the assumption of altruism slips through. Hence the surprise in liberal quarters when account books of ghetto programs fail to balance. (They would be on safer ground, intellectually as well as financially, in providing beforehand for a little pilferage.) Conservative scholars therefore devote a great deal of their time to opposing proposals for reform, especially those promising to cure causes ratherthan modify effects. Ernest van den Haag, a Dutchborn psychoanalyst, sociologist and philosophy professor at the New School, specializes in such deflation. To him the riot‐prevention recommendations of the Kerner Commission seemed so much “pathetic hand wringing,” accompanied by “pompous reassurances” about our ability to eliminate slums. Arson, looting and criminal violence are expressions of the human condition, at least as it manifests itself in this country at this time. To assume that we know enough to diagnose causes (derelict housing, bad schools, unemployment) or to bring about cures (jobs, slum clearance, better education) is a monumental delusion. The conservative prescription is to bring criminality under control. Force has been a corollary of conservative thought: how else do you deal with perversity? Hence the readiness to send F.B.I. agents onto campuses, the National Guard into ghettos, the bombers over Hanoi. Polite persuasion may be preferable, but the ambit of affairs wherein human listen to reason is distressingly small. Or take the fad for sex education. To van den Haag, such schooling is “a useless enterprise,” rather like trying to “repeal the Original Fall by an Act of Congress.” Premarital pregnancies and loveless marriages result from the recklessness and selfishness endemic in us all, and are certainly impervious to remedy by teachers armed with the latest instructional manuals. Van den Haag admits that all too many Americans have unsatisfactory sex lives; but there is no evidence that classroom counseling will not make matters worse. Hence his nonsolution: “People should be allowed to learn some things from experience with each other, without official schooling.” (Of course, experiments often go awry. Van den Haag is liberal on abortion.) When you don't know what you're doing, the prudent course is to do nothing at ail. This view suffuses the work of the University of Pennsylvania's Edward Banfield, one of the few conservatives at an Ivy League university, whose books about cities are notable for not concluding with pleas for more money, massive programs and renewed moral commitment. “The fundamental problem of the central cities,” he has written, “is of such a nature that it cannot be ‘solved,’ or even much relieved, by government action at any level.” The beginning point of urban analysis must be that the American people have made Clear their opposition to higher taxes and racial commingling, and that every step toward change will meet sabotage from some entrenched quarter. Most reviewers have branded Banfield's summing up (“social problems sometimes disappear in the normal course of events”) as selfish or insensitive. However, middle‐class liberals will have to return from the suburbs and send their children into inner‐city schools, before they will be taken very seriously. In addition, Banfield follows the classical conservative willingness to talk quite openly about class characteristics. (The left has always treated this topic very gingerly. Liberals tend to act as if the subject did not exist, while radicals are apt to ascribe all manner of virtues to their underdog of the month.) “So long as the city contains a sizable lower class,” Binfield says, “nothing basic can be done about its most serious problems.” Moreover, he is candid in generalizing about the traits found in this segment of the citizenry: “The lower ‐ class individual lives from moment to moment.... Impulse governs his behavior. ...Whatever he cannot consume immediately he considers valueless.” So far as the here and now and the foreseeable future are concerned, this happens to be a valid depiction of the attitudes and behavior of many Americans. Yet we have reached the point where it is not deemed permissible to consign such truths to cold type. (I should add that Banfield is just as scathing about the pretensions of the upper ‐ middle class as he is about the poor.) BEGINNING well before Burke, conservatives have chosen to stress the differentials in quality and character encountered in any population. While Stefan Possony of Stanford's Hoover Institution is best known for his anti‐Soviet scholarship, he has also turned his talents to recording the “differences which separate individuals, classes, peoples, races in inherited intellectual ability.” His argument is not simply that people have hitherto performed unequally: it is that they vary genetically in their basic potential. Even if everyone were brought up (or hauled back) to an identical starting line, before the race had reached its midpoint, some would be well ahead of others, thus bringing us back to the problem we had in the first place. (Liberals who plead for “equality of opportunity” seem to assume that, after being given a fair start, those who end up last will accept their incompetence gracefully. Conservatives know there is no such thing as a good loser.) But is it possible to prove that some people are genetically superior to others? Proof requires persuading accredited colleagues, using commonly accepted evidence; and the question whether men are or are not created equal is not one susceptible to scientific validation. (The contretemps started a few years ago by Prof. Arthur Jensen is a case in point. Nothing came of it because, in this field at least, each researcher's ideology determines his approach to the data.) Yet in “The Geography of Intellect,” Possony tries to support his case by citing endless statistics ranging from the number of Nobel Laureates per 100 million (Holland has 111 to Yugoslavia's 7) to intelligence tests taken by Hawaiian highschool seniors. The reader discovers that “the risorius muscle, which has much to do with the capacity for facial expression, is found among 80 per cent of whites, 60 per cent of Negroes, but only 30 per cent of Hottentots.” Hence no surprise that the world's grinningest nation was the first to get a man on the moon. I would suggest that conservatism is at its best following the deductive method: start with an initial insight, then select a few illustrative facts to make your original proposition sound persuasive. (There is nothing disreputable about such an approach. Most scientific advances start with an inspired hunch under the apple tree or in the bath.) Conservative writers like Possony are much better at speculation than statistics, as he has shown in his approach to international politics. Virtually all conservative scholars are hard‐line anti Communists. (Possony: “Always remember that the Communists have not changed and remain committed to ... seizing power everywhere, by any means fair or foul.”) But so are some liberals, witness John Roche or Sidney Hook, who combine tough lines on Soviet expansionism with at least lip service to civil rights and other progressive causes. But while conservatives and liberals can believe that the national interest calls for holding the Communist world at bay, quite different assumptionc produce this posture. The liberal affinity for international adventures has stemmed from a desire to save some portion of the world's population from commissarial rule. They have been concerned when political and intellectual freedom has been denied to the Czech in the street or the Cuban in the canefield. The Marshall Plan, Point Four and the Peace Corps were all liberal creations aimed at thwarting totalitarian take‐overs. But so were NATO, the Bay of Pigs and our intervention in Southeast Asia. Foreign aid leads to military aid, and winning hearts and minds turns into taking lives. The Vietnam war was a logical and tragic consequence of a humanitarian foreign policy. American conservatives have tended to have a less complicated approach to Communism. (There have been exceptions, like Whittaker Chambers.) Red regimes have been seen as expressions of unalloyed evil, more as metaphysical essences than as countries inhabited by ordinary human beings. Hence the conservative habit of talking about “the nature of Communism,” suggesting that we have been facing a philo sophical antithesis. Hence, too, the tendency to give a literal reading to the threatsand tactics promised by Marx and Lenin; and allusions to the “so‐called” SinoSoviet split—since Communism, according to its nature, is intrinsically monolithic. And of course diplomacy is out of the question. (Possony: “The Soviet purpose in negotiating is ... to facilitateconquest on the installment plan.”) Trips to Moscow and Peking are dangerous exercises in self‐delusion. The deductive method has several advantages. When the enemy embodies an antithetical philosophy, the struggle takes on a clear‐cut character, with eradication of an idea overriding emancipation of people as the major aim. Few conservatives support sacrificing American lives to save the average Oriental from a fate worse than death. Given their attitudes toward welfare mothers and migrant workers here at home, one cannot expect much conservative solicitude for peasants in far‐off paddy fields. The real anxiety is that if South Vietnam becomes Communist, even more divisions will augment the enemy side. The foundation of conservative scholarship is best exemplified in the work of Leo Strauss, a professor at the University of Chicago for 20 years until his retirement in 1968. Unlike others, Strauss seldom addresses himself directly to conditions of the contemporary world, for his major interest lies in interpreting the classical texts. However, there is a good deal more ideology to Strauss than first meets the eye. As a teacher, he displays a quiet charisma which has led literally hundreds of students to become intellectual disciples. Many are now professors themselves, imparting the Straussian writ to countless undergraduates in outposts like Toronto, Kenyon, Cornell and the Claremont colleges. While on the surface they are explicating the great books—Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes — what also comes through is a philosophical conception (“all natural beings have a natural end, a natural destiny”) having contemporary applications and practical consequences. If man has a “natural destiny,” he cannot always be relied upon to understand this ultimate end. His reason may be led astray, particularly when alluring‐movements pervert philosophical values. A Strauss student willing to apply his teacher's assumptions, is Walter Berns, one of Cornell's most popular profesSOTS, who moved to Canada following the 1969 student disturbances. “The purpose of law is and must be to promote virtue,” Berns has written. Thus freedom of expression should be granted only to “citizens of good character.” Indeed, “no citizen has a right to free speech, whatever the Supreme Court has said in the past or will say in the future.” Berns would change the First Amendment, introducing italics: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of good speech.” Attorneys General, once taught to recognize virtue and good character, could prosecute remarks undeserving of protection. The intriguing thing about the Straussian system is how it moves from detailed textual analysis (an entire term spent on the opening 10 pages of Aristotle's “Politics”) to vehement attacks on welfare legislation, X‐rated movies and the Soviet Union. One of Strauss's inner circle, Prof. Harry Jaffa of Claremont, wrote the famous extremismis‐no‐vice speech for Barry Goldwater while others were fervent hawks and unabashed patriots. My feeling is that the real mainspring lies in Strauss's own magnetism; had his personal persuasion been radical, his followers would have been finding passages in “The Republic” to support Jane Fonda instead of Nguyen Van Thieu. Thus the answer may be personal rather than philosophical, lying in the lifelong hold his ideas seem to have over those who study with him. Few teachers anywhere have had an influence so penetrating. ROBERT NISBET, a sociologist at the University of Arizona, differs from most of his conservative colleagues in that he writes regularly for the scholarly quarterlies and keeps abreast of the jargon, models and matrixes peculiar to his discipline. Nisbet is best‐known for his writing on community, work long antedating the rise of radical interest in this idea. And his concern with the problems and nonparticipation equals that of any Marxist. While radicals and conservatives share some common misgivings about contemporary society (both, for example, are unhappy over the impact of industrialization) and agree that life can best be lived in small and encapsulated settings, their conceptions of community differ in important particulars. Community, as perceived from the left, tends to be ahistorical, carrying over few customs or institutions from the society which preceded it, and as often as not, rising fully developed from the ashes of revolution. In Nisbet's conservative — contrasting — view, “past and present have a creative relationship,” and only through “stable ties with preceding generations” can individuals learn who they are and the options life offers them. A presumption favoring tradition not only insures stability, but also places the burden of proof on those seeking to innovate. (It can also institutionalize injustice by calling it custom.) The conservative community assumes a deferential citizenry, one willing to accept prevailing arrangements and obey those administering them. While the sharp edges of hierarchy may be hidden, this model can encompass a feudal manor or a modern Midwestern town where the local gentry still call the tune. “Apart from authority,” Nisbet believes, “there can be no really vital social relationship in society.” Authority, tradition and stratification combine to reinforce common values, insuring, that citizens adhere to predictable patterns of behavior. This image has served as an ideal for Americans who are not ashamed to express their patriotism and piety and who look back on the days when the lower orders knew their proper place. The problem, of course, is that fewer and fewer of us have a temperament suitable for the conservative communal life. Most of us have too high an estimate of our own opinions to remain silent for the sake of stability. (Burke warned against this in an earlier age: “Everything is to be discussed, as if the constitution of our country were to be always a subject rather of altercation than enjoyment.”) A proclivity for questioning authority undermines traditional controls, weakening the legitimacy of what were once accepted standards. We have, I fear, become too argumentative for such citizenship, whether in communes of the left or self‐taxing suburbs. On philosophical points, I am inclined to give the game to Nisbet, if only because he acknowledges men's need for myths to soften their tendency to unruliness. The chief danger to community lies not in the state, but rather in the technology of an open society. The promise of greater enjoyments and opportunities lures people from small towns, at the same time subverting the standards of those who remain. Agrarian America owes its decline not to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, but rather to Henry Ford and General Motors. Thus the weakest link in the conservative canon —its willingness to support corporate capitalism — can only undermine the intimate relationships conservatives have traditionally cherished. Boeing Company is not a blacksmith's shop, and the 747 is not a horse‐drawn surrey. European conservatives saw Adam Smith as the real enemy. America's love affair with the marketplace has become a Trojan horse its conservatives cannot handle. And this is why I have omitted a revolutionary like Milton Friedman from my original listing. I want to return to the question I raised at the outset of this article: why the scholarly community contains so few conservatives. The greater part of the answer lies in an examination of our colleges and universities, the major place of employment for the country's intellectuals. A Carnegie Commission survey of 60,000 professors found fewer than a quarter willing to characterize themselves as conservatives, and those who did were mainly in such fields as agriculture, engineering and physical education. Among professors of English, sociology, psychology, economics, philosophy, history and political science, almost 70 per cent labeled themselves either “left,” or “liberal,” eschewing not only the conservative designation but a “middle‐of‐the‐road” alternative as well. Only 25 per cent of professors in the social sciences admitted to voting for Richard Nixon in 1968; and, according to a survey by Everett Ladd of the University of Connecticut and Seymour Martin Lipset of Harvard, only 29 per cent of that group voted for Nixon in 1972. And the higher one climbs on the prestige ladder, the less likely are conservatives to be found on the faculty. (In fact, the chief clusterings tend to be either in Catholic colleges or small schools like Wabash and Rockford, where local Rotarians take an interest in academic appointments.) Few conservatives are fired. Rather, they tend not to be hired in the first place, although most departments aver their readiness to consider a “qualified” candidate—if ever they come across one. Yale's Political Science Department had a conservative until several years ago: Wilhnoore Kendall, a brilliant but erratic scholar whose presence caused his colleagues continual discomfort. (At department meetings, during discussions of staffing and suchlike, Kendall's contribution might be: “And how do you explain Alger Hiss?”) He had tenure, but was consigned to the minimum salary, and students were not encouraged to take his courses. Kendall himself finally offered Yale the opportunity to buy up his contract, a procedure hitherto unheard‐of in academe but one accepted with alacrity. Thus Yale's last conservative left New Haven with $60,000 in his pocket, the price of intellectual comity. So if it comforts the White House speechwriters, this time the facts are on their side: the great majority of liberal‐arts professors are liberals—as one wag put it, “liberalism is the theory of the theoried classes” —or even further to the left than that. In one sense, the situation is understandable: like recruits like, and in this college faculties are no different from police departments. However, focusing on hiring policies simply skims the surface. The more important issue concerns character of scholarly knowledge. At the present time, most scholarship—that is, the body of information and interpretation created and accumulated by academics—is liberal in contour. This was not always the case. During the last century, for example, economics tended to be Ricardian; philosophy, Hegelian; sociology, Darwinian. Conservatives like Josiah Royce, William Graham Sumner and Arthur Twining Hadley held the eminent university positions, while such liberals as Thorstein Veblen and Lester F. Ward found it difficult to get or keep academic jobs. Yet scholarship in the past was a form of belle lettres: highly speculative and usually idiosyncratic. Publication consisted chiefly of essays, written from the fastnesses of Cambridge and Ann Arbor quadrangles. But amateurism of this sort could not survive the scientific revolution which began to engulf the country's campuses after World War II. Systematic research replaced speculation, first in the social sciences, then in history and philosophy, and now well into the humanities. And science is not neutral; the rules of research affect a scholar's im pression of reality, shaping his sensibilities along ideological lines. Above all else, science is a liberalizing process. It carries, to begin with, the liberal presumption that the mind of man can in fact comprehend the major parameters of the world we inhabit. Given appropriate conditions and encouragement, this presumption runs, there is no reason why the human intellect cannot eventually explain the origins of wars, the persistence of poverty or how to build housing projects fit for human occupancy. Conservative intellectuals, who harbor some doubts about the depth of man's faculties, find themselves ill at ease amid these pretensions. Since much of reality still defies rigorous description, the new scholarship settles for selecting those aspects which seem intellectually manageable. This is why social scientists rely so heavily on the data derived from sample surveys, census tables or experiments on their own sophomore classes. If science cannot yet tell us the causes of social disruption, we can at least ask the participants their own opinions. (“Do you feel alienated?” Yes: 23.8 per cent. No: 42.7 per cent. Don't Know: 33.5 per cent.) Those engaging in this kind of research reflexively admit they are, taking only a small first step. However—and this is where the liberalism creeps in —they will go on to proclaim that theirs is a progress which will ultimately broaden our understanding. A parallel approach occurs in academic philosophy, with its stress on linguistic analysis. Rather than wasting time on abortive intellectual forays (“What is the Nature of Justice?”), better to pose questions we can probably answer (“What are the various ways people use a word like ‘justice’?”). It is at this point that radicals often make common cause with campus conservatives, wondering whether contemporary scholarship has not become an expensive exercise in evasion. A further development lies in the recent willingness, again essentially liberal, to look at virtually anything that attracts an investigator's curiosity. Nothing remains sacred; little is profane. As a result of Masters' and Johnson's labors, for example, we now know a good deal about the physiology of the orgasm that we simply did not know before. Their plastic phalluses, equipped with minicameras, have produced information on vaginal coloration, clitoral distention and correlations between penile length and partner satisfaction. Several conservative scholars have argued that this research ought never to have been undertaken. The very possession of these findings makes it difficult to sustain the myths and mysteries which give love and sex so much of their meaning. (Supporters of Masters and Johnson will, of course, reply that for far too many people, sex is not a passion play but a frightful mess.) However, the view that certain things should be withheld from our microscopes or minicameras is hard to defend in an academic setting. And the more empirical knowledge we have, the more likely we are to excuse behavior once considered antisocial or immoral. Comprehension breeds compassion. Do we really want to know that a majority of robbers and rapists come from unhappy homes;, or that most people on welfare are too old or too young or too sick to work; or even that viewing pornography does not lead to molesting small children? Factual understanding is not an unalloyed blessing. The process of uprooting misconceptions also erodes social controls which make for stability and public order. Hence the conservative conviction that science, when applied to human affairs, becomes a substitute for moral responsibility. (Notice that, during the Vietnam war, conservatives did not try to excuse Lieutenant Calley on the ground that he was a lower‐middle‐class dropout.) If I have been describing the outlines of current scholarship, I would only add that this body of knowledge also finds its way into classroom assignments. Thus it is no accident that the political continuum among students often runs parallel to the grading scale. This is not because professors favor, left‐of‐center students, but rather because the kind of knowledge which undergraduates are expected to learn is more easily assimilated by those of progressive persuasion. Put very simply, conservative students find it hard to get the hang of just what it is they are supposed to know. Seniors with an aptitude for academic knowledge go on to graduate school, eventually becoming profes sors themselves and thus regenerating the cycle. (Radical students do well, even if they find many of their subjects silly, because their suburban homes and high schoels have taught them how to handle liberal learning.) The last problem I will mention extends beyond the academic arena. A major reason why it is difficult for in tellectuals to be conservatives lies in the shallowness of their putative constituency. Admirals, executives and rightof‐center officeholders have little appetite for philosophy; if they want a Burkean quotation for a speech, they can always find it in Bartlett's. Thus, while liberal writers have a generous book‐buying and lecture‐going clientele, conservative authors remain unknown and unappreciated by the segments of society which should be their natural audience. Indeed, the antiintellectualism of self‐made businessmen and lower‐middle‐class neighborhoods can disillusion any save the hardiest of conservative scholars. James Burnham and Willmore Kendall have made valiant attempts to expound on the virtues of voters who support California's Ronald Reagan and Philadelphia's Frank Rizzo, but the amount of enthusiasm they have been able to muster among their intellectual colleagues remains extremely limited. Popular conservatism, as expressed at the polls, seems to do quite well without scholarly stimulation. And this may be the crux of the matter. Conservatism is essentially a prescientific and predemocratic creed. It had its origins in aristocratic ages, in societies peopled by nobles and peasants. The values of conservatism—deference, culture, civility—find little respect or representation in a world of homeowners, taxpayers and elected office holders. Attempts to apply traditional principles always go just a bit awry: what for Leo Strauss seems the glory of ancient Greece becomes an apologia for censorship and conspiracy trials. Robert Nisbet's conception of community refuses to take root in Westchester; and Edward Banfield's and Ernest van den Haag's arguments against well‐meaning meddling fail to dissuade a generation of self‐anointed problem‐solvers. But none of this will surprise a wellschooled conservative. The fault lies not in the philosophy but in the perversity of the human condition. In short, Original Sin. ■ Along the conservative spectrum"
The World and Doomsday Fads,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/25/archives/the-world-and-doomsday-fads.html,"“The human race; to which so many of my readers belong,” wrote G. K. Chesterton at the beginning of one of his novels, “has been playing since the beginning of time at the game of ‘Cheat the Prophet’” It has been playing it with particular vivacity since the end of World War II. Every few years since then there has been a great outcry among the most distinguished decision‐influencing people that the world is heading for grave and permanent shortage of some particular things. The short‐term result has almost always been a glut within about ten years of those very things. The usual arguments are that a world which continues to increase industrial production is going to run into terrible shortages of food and raw materials, irretrievably to pollute its biosphere and suffer from rising world population. We are now being subjected to both propagandist and market incentives to subsidize agriculture excessively, economize on raw Materials, counter pollution, and control births. Consequently, by the early nineteen‐eighties, we may run into: • Another food glut on the scale of Europe's butter mountain and America's cereal stockpiles of a few years ago. • Enough economies in the use of raw materials to turn the terms of trade against raw‐material producing dountries (especially oil producers) • A temporary excess of controls on new pollution. I think that the creation‐by‐hysteria of an excess supply of controls over new pollution may be necessary in order to make up for a while for our foolish lack of a market mechanism to provide proper incentives for clearing up all pollution (both old and new) Up to the early nineteen‐sixties it had seemed that world population was much more likely to increase exorbitantly. But in the last ten years the growth of birth control technology has “We need an alternative to today's fashion of making prophecies through sudden hysterias.” been bigger than anybody would have forecast (e.g., the pill, birth control advertisements, and abortions becoming more respectable and efficient). The change in attitudes toward birth control has also been greater than expected. One of my conclusions from current events is that in all parts of all our societies nowadays we need to remodel our forecasting mechanisms very drastically. We should be both less dogmatic and yet also try to be more specific in our forecasts. We should have a variety of public and private forecasting institutes that set down lots of possible scenarios of ways in which events might develop, without committing ourselves with hysteria to saying that one scenario is much more likely than another. We should then be checking all the time with current statistics to see which of these possible trajectories of events we do seem to be moving along. In this checking computers provide us with a modern tool for the monitoring process. Note, however, that computers cannot help much, other than as aids in storage and rearrangement of data, because the job needs the exercise of human imagination. We should try to keep constant tabs on the “evolving elasticity of supply” for different things. In my broadened definition, a thing is In elastic supply if the devotion of 1 per cent more effort to producing it—an increase in effort that can be brought about either by the expectation (often wrong) of a 1 per cent higher real price or sometimes by encouragement from government — brings forth more than a 1 per cent increase in output. In today's world of advancing technology, the evolving elasticity of supply for things from which business can make, a profit is very high indeed; I think it is less high in greatly desired services for which we haven't devised a market system (i.e., crime protection). The real problems ahead are likely to be of a totally different order from those set by small assumed inelasticities in arable land, raw materials, pollution control: This is why I believe that we so urgently need the sorts of forecasting system, checking system, monitoring system that I advocate — as an alternative to today's fashion of making prophecies through. sudden hysterias. We probably will have a population crisis in the next eighty years, arising not out of excessive births but insufficient deaths. I think that it is quite probable that doctors will make a breakthrough in curing the great debilitating diseases and thus enable us to live longer than we logically should want to do. We are not nearly prepared for how we should make democratic decisions about this. Massive and dangerous problems really are going to arise if technological knowledge moves forward into these fields, because we have not begun to evolve reasonable democratic (or even undemocratic) systems for smoothly running societies in which both knowledge and the potentiality for creating wealth may be more than 32 times greater than they are today by the time 1972's babies die. The danger is, accentuated by the present fad, among the Club of Rome and others, of saying that perhaps, because of present difficulties, the world is going to stand still."
Women's Movement,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/25/archives/nowa-wide-spectrum-of-groups-womens-movement-the-nation.html,"It was exactly 10 years ago that Betty Friedan published “The Feminine Mystique,” which told American women that if discontented, with a life limited to caring for their husbands, homes and children, they were neither wrong nor alone in wanting something more. Over the past two weeks, almost as if marking the anniversary, the country's two largest feminist organizations—both founded with the help of Mrs. Friedan—held national conventions. The participants of the two groups, their actions and their distinctively different styles, said a lot about the current status of the women's rights movement. The National Women's Political Caucus met first, in Houston, 1,200 strong at the convention representing some 30,000 members in 50 states. The Caucus counted, among the major accomplishments of its first 18 months of life, huge increases in the number of women delegates to both the Democratic and Republican Presidential nominating conventions and a rise of 20 per cent in the number of women elected to public office in 1972—although the increase still leaves the proportion of women office‐holders at only a little more than 5 per cent of the total. The Houston meeting was the first national convention for the Caucus and the delegates had to tackle basic structural issues: the distribution of voting strength on its various governing bodies; minority representation, and states' rights vs. strong national leadership. The Caucus also elected its first national leader—Chairperson is her title—Frances Farenthold, an experienced politician who ran strongly in the Texas gubernatorial race last year. Perhaps the convention's most significant action, however, was the decision to rededicate the Caucus to broad, social objectives, not solely feminist aims. The Caucus has carved out for itself two basic goals: the election and appointment of more women to public office; and the achievement of a whole galaxy of objectives—focusing largely on the needs of minorities and the poor—through legislation. The National Organization for Women is different, as the back‐toback conventions — N.O.W.'s was in Washington—made clear. While N.O.W. also is concerned with some of the same broad social issues as the Caucus, the emphasis is different, as is the relative priority assigned to social and feminist issues. It was evident that the 2,000 delegates representing 35,000 N.O.W. members see their organization as the cutting edge of the women's movement. N.O.W. members, and its top leaders, including president Wilma Scott Heide, advocate radical “unpopular” forms of change. The radicalism has caused some dissension within the ranks. In 1968, when N.O.W. first advocated repeal of all laws restricting abortion, a substantial proportion of its members resigned because they feared such a stand could destroy not only N.O.W. but also the whole women's movement. Today there are those who fear that N.O.W.'s advocacy of the rights of lesbians—who claim they constitute 10 per cent of N.O.W.'s membership—will hurt both the organization and the movement. But the convention last week publicly pledged N.O.W. to work against discrimination based on “sexual preference.” (The Caucus, by contrast, literally tried to keep secret its commitment to place one avowed lesbian on its 94‐member steering committee). Another example of radical N.O.W. thinking—not yet embodied in a formal policy statement but perhaps soon to be—is the idea that the whole pay structure in the nation should be reexamined. The issue is not the relatively noncontroversial one of equalpay for equal work but rather of equal pay for equal skills. To put the matter as N.O.W. members state it: Is greater skill really required for such traditionally male jobs as printer than for such traditionally female ones as secretary? If not, why should the average printer make so much more than the average secretary? The Nation Raising such questions has made N.O.W. unpopular with both women and men: But N.O.W. members argue that their very act of taking a “shocking” stand—for abortion on demand, for example—makes it less shocking thereafter to the nation. This enables less radical groups, such as the Caucus, to take up the issue and perhaps persuade the political establishment to act. N.O.W. is also more radical in other ways. For example, it is currently threatening harassing actions, and even civil disobedience, in its drive for ratification of the equal rights amendment. Once N.O.W. members have threatened state legislators—the socalled “strategic theory” goes — other women's groups can be more reasonable about achievement of the common goal. Today on the issue of the equal rights amendment, those groups include such staid organizations as the League of Women Voters—six times larger than either the Caucus or N.O.W.—which in 1972 voted to support the amendment after decades of avoiding purely feminist Issues. The League's endorsement of the amendment emphasizes the emerging picture of the women's movement as embracing a whole spectrum of organizations with different degrees of ties to the establishment, and varying popular appeal—but all increasingly concerned with the issues raised by the contemporary feminist movement. Yet despite the growing organized support for the equal rights amendment—including the support of increasing numbers of union women—ratification is in serious doubt. Twentyeight of the necessary 38 states have now approved it, but the last 10 are clearly going to be hard to come by. It is difficult to judge what the effect of defeat of the equal rights amendment, or prolonged postponement of ratification would be on the women's movement. The deadline for ratification is 1977, and some women's movement strategists suggest putting the whole project on a back burner until 1976—the next Presidential election year, when politicians may be more responsive to pressures—if the amendment is not ratified this year. Other women's movement leaders say that if ratification does not come this year, the job for the next couple of years will be to defeat enough of the state legislators who voted against ratification to scare the daylights out of the rest."
Abortion to Mean Expulsion For Catholics in Cleveland,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/26/archives/abortion-to-mean-expulsion-for-catholics-in-cleveland.html,"CLEVELAND, Feb. 25 (UPI)—The 880,000 Roman Catholics in greater Cleveland were told totray that Catholic hospitals Would remain a “safe haven” eon abortions, and that members of the church participating to abortions would be excommunicated. The Most Rev. Clarence G. Is. senman, Bishop of the Cleveland Diocese, also ordered that special prayers against abortion be included in the “prayers of the faithful” part of all masses until further notice."
Supreme Court Bars a Review of Abortion Decision,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/27/archives/supreme-court-bars-a-review-of-abortion-decision-spending-by-cia.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 26—The Supreme Court refused today to reconsider its decision liberalizing abortion laws in most of the country and dismissed a challenge to the New York law. In a series of unanimous orders, the Justices invalidated lower court decisions that had upheld anti‐abortion laws in nine states and sent the cases back to lower courts with instructions to apply its five. week‐old ruling. At the same time, the high court dismissed without a hearing an attempt to overturn as unconstitutional the New York statute permitting abortions luring the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Its sponsors argued that the fetus has a “right to life.” The Court said, however that there was no “substantial Federal question” involved in he New York case. On Jan. 22, the Court ruled 7 to 2 that states could only prohibit abortions during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy and hen only to preserve the life or health of the mother. Under the ruling, states may set health regulations for abortions during the last six months but not the first three months of pregnancy. States in which the Court or dered anti‐abortion rulings altered to conform to its man. date were Connecticut, Illinois, Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota Texas and Utah. In Connecticut, a three‐judge Federal district court had held the state's 1972 anti‐abortion law unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court invalidated that finding and sent the case back, presumably because the district court decision did not fully reflect the high court's ruling five weeks ago. The New York challenge had been brought by Robert M. Byrn, a criminal lawprofessor at Fordharn University, wile had been named legal guardian for a group of unborn children in an effort to protect their rights. His campaign to halt the state abortion law was successful in State Supreme Court but was reversed by the Appellate Division, Second Department. Only in very‐rare instances does the Supreme Court grant a petition for rehearing once it has decided a case. Several other decisions were made by the Justices today. SPENDING BY C.I.A. The Court agreed to a request from the Justice Department that it review a ruling enabling a taxpayer to use the Federal courts in an effort to pierce the veil of secrecy involving spending by the Central Intelligence Agency. At issue is whether an individual taxpayer has sufficient legal standing to question the right of Congress to keep C.I.A. appropriations secret and permit the director of the agency to allocate the money as he sees fit. The suit was brought by William B. Richardson of Greensburg, Pa., who lost, in Federal District Court but won a 6‐to‐3 decision from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The appeals court held that Mr. Richardson had right to learn how his tax money was being spent for intelligence purposes. The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to review the case on grounds that the Court of Appeals ruling “goes far beyond” the previously limited right of taxpayers to compel public examination of Government spending figures despite statutory restrictions by Congress. DRIVER LICENSE LOSS In a case that prompted sharp procedural dissent, the Court decided, 5 to 4, to set aside a decision of the California Supreme Court that uninsured drivers must receive post‐accident hearing before their licenses can be suspended. The majority sent the case hick to the California court to resolve a question of whether it had based its decision on the state or Federal Constitution. Justice William O. Douglas, dissenting, expressed little sympathy with the majority decision. Because the issue seemed certain to reappear before the Supreme Court, Mr. Dotiglas protested that the Justices' docket was already large “and it hardly comports with the messages of distress which have emanated from here for us to, seek to gather in more casts.” Chief Justice Warren E. Burger has been among those arguing that the Supreme Court is currently overworked and that some of the minor cases that now reach the high court should be screened out by a new national court of appeals. Chief Justice Burger was in the majority in the California case. Joining him were Associate Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmn, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist. ARRESTS OF VAGRANTS The Court also affirmed a decision that most of a Texas vagrancy statute was unconstitutional, including its authorization to arrest “tramps wandering or strolling about in idleness,” “all companies of gypsies,” “clairvoyants or fortune‐tellers,” people without a “reputable livelihood” and anyone engaging in “lewdness.” The decision upheld had been handed down by a three‐judge Federal district court in Texas in 1971.

Bui Tin, accused the United States of “encouraging the Saigon Government to create obstacles and difficulties for the. Joint Military Commission, and said that Saigon had conducted 20,000 military operations since the cease‐fire began a month ago. [Page 1, Columns 5–8.] The international conference on Vietnam opened in Paris yesterday with a proposal by Canada for a forum that could act on any future breakdown of the cease‐fire. Canada's suggestion, by External Affairs Minister Mitchell W. Sharp, was that the United Nations Secretary General be empowered to call the 13‐party conference back into session if fighting resumed. His plan drew general approval from Secretary of State William P. Rogers, but was rejected by the Vietnamese communists. [1:6–7.] Tomisaburo Hashimoto, secretary general of Japan's governing Liberal‐Democratic party, accused the world's major powers of excluding Japan from important international councils, including the conference on Vietnam that has begun in Paris. He said that “in the process of problem solving, I do not remember any case in which we were properly consulted.” [1:7–8.] National The Administration's two foremost Inflation fighters insisted that President Nixon was keeping 5.5 per cent as a standard for annual wage increases. However, Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz and John T. Dunlop, the new director of the Cost of Living Counsel, did not dispel the impression that the Administration was moving away from a specific standard to a more flexible approach to wage regulation. [1:1–3.] The Executive Council of the A,F,L.‐C.I.O, voted to oppose extension of the economic stabilization law unless Congress adopts a series of specific measures to elimipate “glaring inequalities” in the wage‐price controls program. George Meany, president of the A.F.L.‐C.I.O., indicated that he expected no problem to arise from the formal retention of a 5.5 per cent guideline for wage increases.

Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/27/archives/letters-to-the-editor-a-nation-in-search-of-more-energy-the-life.html,"Your Jan. 31 editorial “Research for Power” called for the Federal Government to carry out a comprehensive research effort aimed at developing new energy sources to meet this country's pressing needs. To the Editor: I believe that comprehensive research into new energy sources is vital to our nation's interests. Indeed, normal supply‐deniand forces in the marketplace are already stimulating very serious consideration of alternate energy sources by Individual oil companies, and the, proposed research by the Federal Government, complementing the efforts currently being pursued by private industry with its own funds, can do much to speed up the commercial development of promising new energy sources. These alternate sources include oil shale, tar sands, geothermal heat, tidal energy, agricultural products, coal gasification, fast breeder nuclear reactors and even the power of the sun. At present, all of these so‐called exotic sources combined provide slightly less than one per cent of our requirements. Until research can solve the technical problems of making such alternate sources available in adequate and dependable quantities at competitive costs, however, we will have to continue to place our primary dependence on conventional energy, sources. Petroleum now supplies about 77 per cent of our nation's needs, coal 18 per cent and hydropower 4 per cent. This basic situation is not likely to change significantly in the years immediately ahead. Oil and gas are expected to continue to supply more than 60 per cent of our needs in 1985, and‐ about 50 per cent at the end of this century. The reason is simple: The necessary technology is not yet available to develop alternate energy sources at competitive costs, and even if this technology were available today, there would be an inescapable lead time of some years before the necessary facilities could be constructed and placed in operation. With these facts in mind, I believe our, nation should pursue a comprehensive research program, funded by both the publinand private sectors, into alternate energy sources. Nevertheless, we should recognize that a national energy policy should provide for realistic environmental regulations and economic incentives for domestic exploration and refinery expansion to enable our petroleum companies to operate, efficiently hi meeting this nation's rising energy needs. MAURICE F. Gamville Chairman of the Board, Texaco, Inc. New York, Feb. 13, 1973 • To the Editor: The power failure of Feb. 20 in New York City is another stark reminder of the consequences of the lack of a national energy policy. Considering the President's innocuous pronouncenients about energy and his meager budget for research meet the country's energy needs, it is small wonder that there have been no major achievements or breakthroughs in this field and that they hold fittle promise for the future. Billions of dollars are needed to develop new sources of energy, and the finite resources of oil and gas must be carefully managed. While rhetoric about energy crisis rings in the halls of Congress, urban centers like New York City are experiencing its harsh, realities in a succession of brownouts, blackouts, gas curtailments, oil shortages and an increasing rise in utility costs. Aside from what appears to be increasing support for establishing a new Department of Natural Resources, the Administration's main thrust is, on ways to aid the energy industry—tax advantages and higher rates to stimulate gas and oil production and ease environmental requirements. After years of indoctrination on the glories of electricity, the public must realize that the way to a good life is not paved with electricity, as this in dustry's propagandists would have us believe. The fact that electricity is “clean” form of energy obscures the fact that vast quantities of oil and gas are wasted in making it, and this waste pollutes our air and waters. Of every, ten barrels of oil used to make electricity, seven to eight produce nothing but heat that is spewed into the surrounding environment. Inducement to use more electricity must therefore be stopped. In addition, there is no justification for selling electricity at or below cost to stimulate its use. This untenable practice is often compounded by central metering at a housing or office Complex. The lack of individual metering may save billing and collection costs, but it eliminates an incentive for conservation. Above all, ways must be found to reduce capital expenditures by utilities encouraging builders of large housing and business communities and hospitals to include their own electric generating plants, and to use the waste heat for heating and cooling. Local and state governments should be prepared to help finanee construction of such plants with low‐interest loans and tax abatements. Meantime, the nation hopes that the second Presidential message on energy will give bold and concrete new direction. MILTON MUSIUS Chairman, N. Y. C. Interdepartmental Committee on Public Utilitiei New York, Feb. 21, 1973 • The Life Among Us To the Editor: Many critics of the Supreme Court abortion decision seem to be arguing not only that there is a dignity to life as such but a unity of life as well. The fertilized egg is life, and the dying cancer patient is life too. And no judgment of the law can make it otherwise. I wish all these people concerned about the unity of life had stood up for life during the long years of death in Vietnam, when the consequences of their Government's policies were the condoning of torture, the bombing of innocent civilians, the uprooting of whole communities and the destruction of living environments. The North Vietnamese are life, and so are Vietcong sympathizers. And in our own society, the welfare mothers and children are life, and the degraded rural poor are life, and all those killed needlessly by our law‐andorder forces at Kent, Attica, Detroit and Watts were life too. What hypocrisy to uphold the life of the unborn and yet deny a decent life, or life itself, to those among us on earth. Care for the life among you and deserve the life to come. NEIL G. KOTLER Hanover, N. H., Feb. 14, 1973 For a Free Press To the Editor: In his Feb. 21 letter Max M. Kampelman argues for restraints on the “unbridled power” of the press. He favors a press council to review complaints, suggests a formal code of ethics and alludes to the licensing of reporters. A free press—unbridled, if you please —seems to me to fit Churchill's description of a democracy. It is the worst kind except for all the alternatives. Certainly there is a risk in allowing free people freely to print. It is a risk based on the presupposition, as Judge Learned Hand wrote in 1943, “that right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues than through any kind of authoritative selection.” “To many,” Judge Hand continued, “this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all.” As for requiring anyone who writes for a newspaper to hive a license, what a multitude of tongues that would silence—from the part‐time stringers for hundreds of weeklies and small dailies to the illustrious contributors to The Times' Op‐Ed page. Indeed, how would the Max Kampelmans of the land get their views published? Finally, Mr. Kampelman laments the fact that, the press, “in its obdurate way,” always seems to respond to criticism “by retreating to the Constitution.” Some retreat. JULES LOH Old Tappan, N. J., Feb. 21, 1973 • An Egg for the Guggenheim To the Editor: The top brass of the Guggenheim Museum are brazen indeed to announce plans for grafting a glass eatery ontd Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, the only New York City building by the greatest architect of our century. We might recall the words of Berlioz, who in his lyric monodrama “Lélio” took aim at those who were tampering with, the scores of Beethoven and other masters: “Worst of all are those desecrators who dare to 14 their hands on original works, and inflict on them horrible mutilations, which they call ‘refinements and improvements.’ To hell with them! These outragers of art are like the vulgar birds that people our public gardens, perch arrogantly on our most beautiful statues, and, after dirtying the brow of a Jupiter, the arm of a Hercules or the breast of Juno, strut about proudly and triumphantly as though they had just laid a golden egg.” The museum officials will indeed lay an egg—and there'll be no gold involved. Can nothing be done to trammel these treacherous trumpeters of trumpery? CALDWELL TITCOMB Auburndale, Mass., Feb. 19, 1973 • ‘Special Treatment to Our Champions’ To the Editor: One of the inadequacies of the democratic process is its mishandling of exceptional people. Many years ago Charlie Chaplin ran away from our shores under allegations of tax evasion and‐moral turpitude. It was more our loss and our disgrace than that of Chaplin's. We were all grateful and shed a tear when the great old clown came to Hollywood last year. Now it is Dr. Lillehei, whose work and genius have extended life to thousadds of people, who has been abused and scandalized for income tax fraud. Should we not have the grace to give special treatment to our champions? JOSEPH DEUEL SULLIVAN, M.D. New York, Feb. 17, 1973 City Prisons: The Case Against a Central Psychiatric Facility To the Editor: Conditions in New York City prisons are already so well known that there is little reason to recall them, except when they get worse instead of better, Currently, the Department of Correction, hand in hand with the Health Services Administration, threatens to destroy one of the most valuable programs in the city prisons by adopting a concept already discredited in therapeutic circles. It is currently the plan of the Department of Corrections to convert, the old Queens House of Detention into a central psychiatric, facility without any major renovation. The old Queens House of Detention is an outdated facility consisting of one floor with tiers of small, closed, primitive cells stacked five high on either side of a small, open, central area. Mental health teams of professionals and paraprofessionals serve the city prisons with a wide range of on‐site services ranging from crisis intervention, wards, group therapy, to what amounts to outpatient facilities which answer referrals from any inmate within the prison. Although, badly understaffed, these teams have been on site and able to deal with problems ranging from overt psychosis and suicidal depression to the kinds of emotional problems connected with prolonged incarceration. Perhaps most important to the inmates of the city prisons is the presence of a number of civilians who, over a period of some fourteen months, have established a trust relationship with inmates through hard work and honest concern. It is not beyond possibility that this is exactly what motivates the corrections officials to remove the program. With a centralized hospital, the Department of Corrections will create an “asylum” and a dumping ground for administrative problems. The concept of centralized mental hospitalization has long been argued. It is a sigp of just how backward the health facilities are in the prisons that such highly questionable and ineffective policy is the best answer to come forward. Anyone familiar with the treatment of the mentally ill realizes that a centralized hospital will result in institutionalization rather than treatment, further illness rather than help. Even the New York State hospitals serving the criminally insane are making a real effort to decentralize, to utilize out‐patient clinics and community mental health centers—to unchain the mentally ill. In addition, this appears to herald a trend back to “cold turkey” instead of group therapy for addicts, to locked cells instead of therapeutic communities. Is it desirable to have the equivalent of a community mental health program removed from the prisons at a time when penologists are more and more turning to small half‐way houses as the most effective approach to real rehabilitation? It speaks pointedly to the effect of the current program that, while suicides are common in the city prisons, only one death has occurred at the mental health facility which houses 100 inmates in New York City's worst prison—the “Tombs.” Daylight has begun to reach into the prisons. Daily, inmates see an alternative to despair and punitive approaches. We cannot afford to lose this. We must save on‐site mental health facilities in the city's prisons. We must save them and expand them. The day of the “insane asylum” is past and we must fight this destructive expenditure by security‐minded corrections officials and Health Services people who have rarely entered a prison. M.

"Campaign in France: No Hoopla, Little TV",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/01/archives/campaign-in-france-no-hoopla-little-tv-television-little-used.html,"PARIS, Feb. 28—Picture a hotly contested national election in which a corpse, a 15‐year‐old alleged arsonist and a group of respected abortionists have all figured as big political issues. That is France in 1973. But this is also France, and more truly so: an election devoid of hoopla, presidential coattails, advance men, political ads on TV, motorcades or mass airport rallies with high‐school bands and nubile drum majorettes. French politics is also distinctive in other ways: ¶A prominent, elected member of the party in power must buy his own stamps like any outer member of Parliament, spend the evening with his wife and daughter folding his own campaign literature and then carry it down to the post office next morning. ¶The official television time allotted on the three Government channels, the only ones that exist, totals three hours and seven minutes for all political parties in a three‐week electoral campaign. ¶The party faithful are whipped up at a major rally with the opening theme of “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” made famous in the film 2001.” ¶And it is more important for a candidate to be seen with the local mayor than with the President of a country of 51 million. The campaign will culminate in the election of a new National Assembly in voting Sunday and a runoff a week later. Aside from the fact that the Gaullists are running scared for the first time in the 15 years of the Fifth Republic, there have been three sensations in the campaign. Last week the body of Philippe Petain—considered a hero‐statesman by a few French and a traitorous or tragically misled leader of the Vichy Gov ernment during World War by many others—was, snatched from its grave on his island of exile by a group of right‐wing Petain‐worshippers. The ringleader, Hubert Massol, was a candidate from Paris. He said he wanted a more honorable burial place for Pétall?. Last night he withdrew, saying he did not want the incident to be interpreted as “political maneuver.” The week before, a teen age boy was accused of setting school fire in Paris in which 20 persons perished. It precipitated a national uproar about permissiveness, radical agitaion and Government neglect involving shoddy school construction. The tragedy engaged leaders through the spectrum of political opinion, who lost no time in blaming those who did not share their ideological viewpoint. Two weeks ago, almost 400 French doctors publicly admitted they had repeatedly broken a law carrying severe penalties by performing aborions. The Gaullist Government, which has conceded the existing law is outdated and possibly inhumane but has done nothing about changing it, was embarrassed. Television Little Used All this has lent spice and controversy to the French election as the balloting approaches. But even television, with its immense potential for influencing the electorate, has not been used significantly to change either this campaign or the deeper emphasis throughout the history of modern French electioneering — physical contact with individual voters. Moreover, every survey shows that the French in overwhelming numbers switch off political broadcasts. There is no local television or radio campaigning. Only the national leaders get electronic exposure, and this is limited. The bulk of the candidates have to make do with simple posters and school meetings, or just taking nose‐to‐nose with constituents. Two weeks ago, a Socialist candidate arrived at a scheduled late‐evening meeting in the town hall of Ouges, a hamlet of 700 in Burgundy. One constituent showed up. “What, no customers?” He asked. But the candidate persuaded him to remain, and the two men talked politics for 90 minutes while the voter fought to keep from falling asleep. A French campaign has its folksy and intimate side, but the big guns generally keel their distance from the voter: —even from the candidates of their own parties. Nowhere car one see a picture of a candidate shaking hands with President Pompidou or Premier Pierre Messmer. The other night, Mr. Messmer touched down in Nantes, Brittany, for a rally. He and his entourage got into cars, drove to the fair grounds —where 6,000 who had bought tickets in advance at Gaullist headquarters were the only ones allowed in — and Mr. Messmer delivered his speech. He did not mention any members of his party running for office from that district or anywhere else. Mr. Pompidou, the chief of state as well as chief of his party, has appeared only once, in a carefully arranged television interview a few days before the formal opening of the campaign. In his news conference at the beginning of the year, Mr. Pompidou hinted that he was planning a fairly active campaign role. This has not materealized. He has never gone to the voters in person. Reports have been circulating widely among Paris insiders on the state of his health. Officials have said that Mr. Pompidou has been suffering from recurrent bouts of influenza. It has also been reported but never confirmed that he is taking heavy doses of cortisone for rheumatism, which caused an excessive puffiness of his face during the televised January news conference. But Americans accustomed to the most excruciatingly detailed bulletins about Dwight Eisenhower's lower intestine and heart, John Kennedy's bad back Lyndon Johnson's gall bladder and Thomas Eagleton's shock treatments for depression will find nothing remotely comparable here. An inquiry at the Elysée palace about President Pompidou's physical state brings a frosty reply: “It's a personal, private matter. The President's health is nonetheless an important political matter. In the French situation the spread of doubts about his possible ability to complete his term would help the Government, rather than the opposition. Both sides have been arguing about the effects a leftist victory in the. Assembly would have on the national equilibrium The left has said that it would not upset everything since Mr. Pompidou would remain as President until the end of his term in 1976. But if he were really ill, there would have to be a Presidential election which could put a leftist in the Elysee Palace. The state of political party financing is as muffled as the state of Mr. Pompidou's health. The conservative newspaper Le. Figaro recently mentioned rumors that the French equivalent of the National Association of Manufacturers had contributed some 2.2 million francs ($478,000) for the Gaullist party and its political allies, and that, in addition, private businessmen were shelling out as much as $4.5‐million for the campaign. The Gaullist party has given each of its candidates the equivalent of $2,000 for his campaign. Jean‐Jacques ServanSchreiber's opposition reformist coalition has donated $400 for each campaign. A subscription among Communist party members to help their candidates raised, at last count, $100,000. But, with a monthly salary of $1,740, most deputies find it hard to keep going; let alone bear the cost of campaigning. In addition, there is, this hard fact of life: Erik Hintermann, running for parliament for the first time from the CharentesMaritime region on France's Atlantic Coast, had to pay the Socialist party headquarters out of his own pocketior printing his campaign posters."
Abortions ‘Cheaper Than Anywhere Else’ Planned,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/02/archives/abortions-cheaper-than-anywhere-else-planned-125-maximum-fee.html,"ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, March 1—An outpatient abortion and sterilization clinic, the Palisades Medical Group, is scheduled to open here April 15, according to Dr. Robert M. Livingston, who with 19 other Bergen County obstetricians and gynecologists will staff the new facility. Dr. Livingston, who was cleared of charges of conspiracy to perform an abortion when an indictment against him was dropped yestetday on constitutional grounds in Bergen County's Superior Court, said the clinic would resemble similar facilities in Manhattan. $125 Maximum Fee “We are planning to do abortions at a cheaper rate than anywhere else in the country, to the best of my knowledge,” Dr. Livingston said today. “The maximum fee will be $125, and the minimum fee for indigent patients zero.” Sterilizations of both men and women will be performed once the clinic is in full swing, Dr. Livingston said. Pleased over the quashing of the indictment, he said Dr. Bernard Greenspun, a general practitioner from Paterson who had been indicted along with him, was disappointed by the decision. “At the time of the indictment, I had been performing therapeutic abortions for months, waiting to be arrested as a test case,” Dr. Livingston recalled. “Dr. Greenspun had no part in this and little interest,” Dr. Livingston went on with a chuckle. “He merely referred to me a patient who had a normal pregnancy complicated by bleeding. I, in turn, sent her to the hospital, and the next thing we knew we were both under indictment. Two weeks later the patient on whom we had allegedly conspired to perform the abortion had a five‐pound, four‐ounce boy, and Dr. Greenspun is disappointed now that the indictment is dropped because he cannot offer him in evidence.” One reason for the new clinic, Dr. Livingston said, is that many New Jersey hospitals still refuse to do abortions. “A number of New Jersey hospitals are really dragging their feet,” the YaIe‐trained obstetrician said. “As it is, most hospitals are not equipped to handle the between 10 and 20 women that are expected to need an abortion daily.” The alternative is to use the doctor's office, which is not equipped for any emergencies that might arise, Dr. Livingston said. Operating Room Facilities “The clinic will have laboratory and operating‐room facilides, recovery rooms and counseling facilities,” he said. “Birth‐control information will be mandatory. We will refuse to do an abortion on any patient who will not at, least allow herself to be informed about the facts regarding birth control. What she does after that is her own business.” The clinic will also maintain a liberal policy toward abortions for teen‐agers. “In all probability, parental consent for a girl of 17 will not be required,” Dr. Livingston said. The new 9,000‐square‐foot facility is being constructed from a former office building that is being rebuilt."

U.S. Birth Rate Drops to a Record Low,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/02/archives/us-birth-rate-drops-to-a-record-low-birth-rate-drops-to-record-low.html,"WASHINGTON, March 1—American birth and fertility rates last year dropped to their lowest levels in history, and even the absolute number of babies born was the smallest in 27 years. Births declined so sharply in 1972, according to Federal statistics published today, that the fertility rate has now fallen to 2.03 children a family, significantly, below the “replacement level” of 2.1 children. A decline In births and rates was evident in 1971 and has already been dubbed “the birth dearth” or “the baby bust.” But the new data show that this decline intensified sharply in 1972. Population; authorities for the most part welcome the drop and caution against exaggerated fears of a decline in national virility. They cite parallel birth trends in other industrialized countries. Experts also caution against exaggerated optimism. Despite the low rates, the day of zero population growth remains distant. One reason is that fertility rates are extremely volatile. Another is that zero growth could come only if low fertility rates continued for some 70 years. In the short term, however, the new 1972 figures were dramatically low by every standard measure: ¶The general fertility rate —births per thousand women age 15 to 44 — dropped from 82.3 in 1971 to 73.4 in 1972. The previous low was 75.8 in 1936, during the Depression. ¶The estimated total fertility rate — in effect, the average number of children born to each family — dropped from 2.28 in 1971 to the current figure of 2.03. The previous low was 2.12, also in 1936. ¶For the last half‐ of 1972, this rate fell even more dramatically — to 1.98 children per family, compared with 2.08 for the first half. ¶The crude birth rate—births per thousand population—dropped to 15.6. In 1971, the previous low year, the figure was 17.3. ¶According to calculations by Campbell Gibson, a Census Bureau authority on fertility, the population last year grew by a smaller number of persons than in any year since 1945. The total growth rate in 1972 was 0.78 per cent—less than half the peak rate of 1.83 per cent in 1956. In 1945, it was 0.71. ¶Even beyond rates, the actual number of births dropped to 3,256,000 in 1972, a 9 per cent decline in one year. Two Reasons Cited Demographers found this particularly striking for two reasons. One is that the decrease of 303,000 births came despite an increase of 878,000 women of child‐bearing age—as the post‐World War II baby boom continues to mature. The second reason is the contrast between 1972 and 1946, the previous low birth year of the post‐war period. Then, 33,290,000 women of child‐bearing age had 3,411,000 births. In 1972, 44,340,000 potential mothers‐33 per cent more—had only 3,256,000 babies‐4 per cent less. It is the presence of so many potential mothers in the population that impels demographers to warn against optimism. Even a small upward rise in fertility rates could turn the trend lines upward again. And larger rises could send them shooting up as fast as they have recently gone down. In the view of Philip M. Hauser, a noted University of Chicago demographer, “there is still population bomb” latent, but armed, in present society. “The birth rate is notably fluid and capricious — strongly affected by such psychological factors as the economy or changing attitudes about the role of women,” Bickley S. Dodge, a spokesman for the 21,000‐member Zero Population Growth Movement, said today. The disproportionate number of young women in the population also explains why zero population growth would take some 70 years, even though the fertility rate has dropped below the 2.1‐child replacement level. There are, for example, 1.1 million women who are now 39 years old, but 2.1 million who are 13. Even if the 13‐year‐olds merely replace themselves as they go through the child‐bearing years, they will be producing twice as many babies as the 39‐year‐olds did —continuing to increase the population. A Stable population could come only after the passage of a full life‐span, about 70 years, at the 2.1‐child level, and without immigration. If, theoretically, that level were maintained for the next 70 years, the population would level off at about 320 million people. The population is now estimated at 209.7 million, compared with 203.2 million at the time of the 1970 census. The Census Bureau estimates that the population in the year 2000 will be between 251 million and 300 million. Experts are unwilling to predict that low fertility rates will continue for the long term but they do identify a series of reasons for the current decline. All appear to be of continuing force and, thus, low rates are likely at least for the short term. “For one thing,” in the view of Paul C. Glick, a Census Bureau demographer, “women are getting married later and getting divorced more. Both factors depress fertility.” Another factor is the rapid increase in the proportion of women at work. Still another explanation is the increased use of contraception and the steady liberalization of abortion laws. Some authorities believe that abortions may account for a quarter of the decline. The new Federal findings are contained in the monthly Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 21, No. 11, published by the National Center for Health Statistics, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Rockville, Md., 20852."
Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/04/archives/each-change-has-vast-impact-birth-rate.html,"WASHINGTON—“None Is Fun,” read the lapel buttons sent out by mail. “Stop at Two,” say the leaflets handed out to motorists steaming in endless traffio jams. “Zero population growth,” urge thousands of members of the National Z.P.O. movement that has, in four years, transformed demography from a dry, academia concern studded with soporific statistics into a topic of urgent public debate. Last week, with the publication of national vital statistics for 1972, it became evident that such efforts had. been rewarded. The findings were unusually clear, even hietoric: The absolute number of births was the smallest in 27. years. The birth rate dropped to its lowest level ever, declining 10 per cent just since 1971. And the fertility gate the average number of children a woman has over her lifetime‐plunged for the first time, below, the symbolically important “replacement level” of 2.10 children per family, averaging 2,03 for the year. This was not zero population growth. For that to occur, very low fertility rates would have to persist for some 70 years — until existing bulges, like the postWorld War, II baby boom, work their way through the age structure of the population. No reputable authority would predict that such low rates will continue for long; fertility rates are notoriously volatile and unpredictable. Nevertheless, the new statistics, showing an intensification of declines already evident in 1971, meant a period —perhaps a long period—of much slower national population growth. And that meant changes, in coming years, affecting almost every aspect of American society. Most authorities believe these changes will be beneficial. They confidently dismiss fears, for example, that slow population growth will produce a stagnating economy. In the first place, observes Michael F. Brewer, president of the Population Reference Bureau in Washington, the population — and demand — will still grow, even if more slowly. Further, average income will increase regardless of population size because of technological advancement. A Presidential ocamnissien on population growth last year calculated that by the year 2000, family income would climb from $12,000 to $20,000 in current There would thus be less demand for school shoes but more of one for ski boots; a diminished market for baby food, but a growing one for gourmet restaurants; a smaller number of home buyers but a larger number of second homeowners. Such economic gains and adaptations are likely to reinforce social changes. No one is sure whether women are having fewer children because they want to work or are working because they have fewer children. Either way, the proportion of women in the work force is rising steadily—adding further to average family income. Another likely effect, indicated by findings of a National Fertility Study in 1970, is that fewer children mean fewer unwanted children. That, in turn, could well mean fewer poor chil dren, whose presence dilutes family Income and deters mothers from working. Changes in education are already evident in empty primary grade seats around the country. There were about four million first graders going to school in September, 1968, The new figures mean that in 1978, there Will hi only about 3.2 million. And gradually the empty geats will be seen in progressively higher grades. On the other hand, an everincreasing proportion of teenagers is going on to community colleges. Adult education is booming. The environmental impact of slower population growth is almost certain to be beneficial. Experts may argue about which factor puts more relative pressure on the environment, the size of the population or the affluence of the population. But there is no arguing that size is of some importance. The Presidential population commission estimated that fertility rates averaging two rather than three children per family would reduce the pressure on recreational facilities by as much as 30 per cent by the year 2000. The impact of slower population growth on political life is imponderable. Slower growth certainly means older voters. According to one set of Census Bureau projections, the median age would rise from 28 to 36 between. 1972 and 2000. Slower‐growth appears to have brought rising conservatism in some countries like France, but not in others. Sweden remains in the forefront of social change. The most ironic impact of slower population growth Is that which is increasingly felt by the Z.P.G. movement. Its starting point was the publication in 1968 of “The Population Bomb” by Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford biologist. From such cradles as a garage‐turned‐office in Los Altos Calif., the movement soon encompassed 300 local chapters around the Its rapid spread notwithstanding, the underlying reasons for the declining birth and fertility rates go much deeper than the Z.P.G.. Well before the movement began, steady increases were evident in the number of women at work, later marriages, deferred births, divorces, abortions and women who want smaller families. At the same time, demographers credit the movement—and the parallel movements on behalf of the environment and women's liberation — with important attitudinal effects. “We've been doing the right things,” says Carl D. Pope, Z.P.G.'s Washington political director. “We've turned the population into something the man in the street can understand. And we took it to the grass‐roots, to the neighborhoods. Z.P.G. isn't just some name, some group of experts in Washington. or New York. Still it's just not plausible any more to say that America is facing an immediate population crisis.” Nevertheless, the bomb is still there, ticking, in the. current population. Since there are so many young women — children of the baby boom — now entering the child‐bearing years, even a small increase in the fertility rate would bring an enormous increase in births. That is one of the dangers the Z.P.G. movement will seek to guard against through continued public education and lobbying. Another target is the unquestioned “growth mania” present for example in elementary school textbooks that often glorify large families but almost never depict happy singles. In addition, says Judith Senderowitz, a Z.P.G. vice president, “the mechanism to achieve Z.P.G—like available abortions and contraception, dr removing conformist pressure to marry and have children almost automatically — is absolutely desirable and necessary even apart from the population problem. They are ways to increase personal freedom and improve the quality of life.” Still, news of the fertility decline has posed a special kind of population problem. A year ago, the Z.P.G. movement had 30,000 members, now the figure is 21,000."
Surfacing,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/04/archives/surfacing-clearing-a-canadian-space-by-margaret-atwood-224-pp-new.html,"Margaret Atwood's “Surfacing” invites comparison with Sylvia Plath's “The Bell Jar”: both novels by poets, both about a young woman who has been made desperate by a stifling social milieu and who can find relief only by abandoning what those around her have defined as sanity. Yet Plath's novel, written 10 years ago, expresses only a pure and private suffering; her heroine, Esther, can make no more impression. on the conditions of her life—those of New England suburbia in the Eisenhower years—than a fly on the walls of the jar enclosing it. The sixties, whatever else they left unchanged, at least broke open that particular doll's house. By Margaret Atwood. 224 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $6.95. Miss Atwood's nameless heroine expresses a more sweeping revolt than Esther, but she is able at the novel's end to come up for air, to move confidently out of the destructive element and into freedom. The more recent novel, then, avoids the tone of flat, sealed‐off resignation on which “The Bell Jar” ends; rather, it invigorates by its heroine's resolve to trust herself to the world while refusing, at the same time, to be a victim of it. Victimization, and how to avoid it, is also the theme of Miss Atwood's companion volume to “Surfacing”—“Survival” (1972), a thematic guide to Canadian literature. In the latter book she indicts the literary tradition of her country for perennially reducing its heroes to victims, whether of confining social institutions, Canada's harsh‐ geography, American power, or just their own inanition. Together, “Surfacing” and “Survival” have brought into sharp focus for Canadian literary intellectuals the problem of their country's cultural identity in the seventies. Miss Atwood, at 33, has thereby outsoared her previous status as a widely‐respected younger poet, author of five volumes of verse; she has become the literary standardbearer of a resurgence of nativism and nationalism in Canada, eclipsing established Canadian writers of more cosmopolitan outlook such as Mordecai Richter, Leonard Cohen. and Irving Layton. Her work is also distinguished from theirs by its acute responsiveness to the Canadian landscape; we are constantly reminded that her formative years were passed largely in the sparsely settled “bush” of Northern Ontario and Quebec, rather than in the cities adjacent to the United States border. “Surfacing” begins on a note of simple escapism as the heroine, her lover Joe and a married couple, David and Anna, travel from the city towards her family cabin on a remote Quebec lake, Their mission is to investigate the disappearance of the heroine's father, a botanist for a paper company, though at first this duty does little to becloud their mood. But when the father remains lost and they decide to stay on at the lake for a week, the underlying strains of their relationships begin to take effect. David and Anna reveal the hidden resentments of their marriage, while Joe withdraws into sullen dissatisfaction with the heroine as she pursues, with increasing selfabsorption, the secret clues she believes her parents (the mother dead already for some years) have left for her somewhere in the bric‐a‐brac of her childhood home. In a final episode, gripping in its vivid evocation of the invasive powers of nature, the heroine flees from them all to embark on a psychic voyage that society would define as breakdown, but which for her is a necessary submission to all the submerged or distorted voices of her past, and of her unconscious. She must make contact with her parents, who had before seemed to her painfully vague and unaiding; with the apparition of the child she lost in an unwanted abortion; and with the indigenous spirits of The place, the Indian gods who “here on the shore or in the water, unacknowledged or forgotten, were the only ones who had ever given her anything she and freely.” The action of “Surfacing” resembles that of old tales recounting journeys from the, city to the wilderness, where some ordeal or initiation must be undergone. Atwood's heroine doesn't develop her character through engagement with the social world; rather, she progressively strips off the encumbrances and falsities that society has imposed on her over the years. In so doing, she finds that experiences she had thought lost or discarded have only been submerged. They have therefore remained menacing, like the lake's infestation with deadheads, “old pieces of tree waterlogged and partly decayed, floating under the surface.” Her alienation from the empty camaraderie of her friends, run‐of‐the‐mill urban neurotics, clears the way for her initiation into the savage mind, in the experience of a shamanistic possession wherein the voices of nature demand that she avoid all things made or cultivated, all places enclosed by human hands. Against this primitivism Atwood counterposes a malignant cluster of forces subsumed under the name of “American,” and ‘marked especially by violence and the mechanical pillage of nature. This creeping menace appears symbolically in the novel's first sentence, which notes in passing that “the disease [a tree infestation] is spreading up from the south.” Not that Canadians have any native immunity to the disease; they cannot easily resist, or avoid, “secondhand American . . . spreading . . . in patches, like mange or lichen.” If the novel's anti‐Americanism lacks ideological rigor, it is at least true to life: Canadian resentment of the United States is unique in its intimate appreciation of the enemy, and in its rueful awareness that in the sellout of their nation Canadians themselves have usually been the most eager brokers. Within the novel, anti‐Americanism serves to construct a new version of the 19th‐century contrast between the English novel, concerned with man as he is shaped by social institutions, and the American romance, concerned with man in relation to moral absolutes and to nature. Then, the typical American hero was represented as an innocent being, untainted by Europe's moral obliquities. But now, when America's claim to innocence has been discredited by the brutalities of power politics, Atwood can assert the Canadian's claim to have virtue in his very powerlessness and uncertainty about his mission, if not in any more positive quality. Like her mute and destructive heroine, he must “clear a space” before he can know who, or where. In Canada, this novel suggests, one Can clear that space most easily by simply retreating into the vast northern bush, still largely untouched by civilization. But nature there is so threatening that the retreat can hardly be comfortable or secure one will not find Horatian country villas on the Laurentian shield. At the end of “Surfacing” the heroine, bowing to the approach of winter and the news of her father's death, must return to city life. There she will have to resume a profession, and to risk with her lover a more open relationship—though one still uneasy and likely to fail. Yet she will no longer be a passive victim of her past, or of casual companions. She is ready to take an identity, and to bear a child. At a time when many novelists restrict themselves to a single mode of expression, such as documentary realism or unrestrained fantasy, Miss Atwood has undertaken a more serious and complex task. Denying Emerson's maxim that The true art of life is to skate well on surfaces, she shows the depths that must be explored if one attempts to live an examined life today."
Up from the kitchen floor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/04/archives/up-from-the-kitchen-floor-kitchen-floor.html,"It is a decade now since the publication of “The Feminine Mystique,” and until I started writing the book, I wasn't even conscious of the woman problem. Locked as we all were then in that mystique, which kept us passive and apart, and kept us even from seeing our real problems and possibilities, I like other women, thought there was something wrong with me because I didn't have an orgasm waxing the kitchen floor. I was a freak, writing that book—not that I waxed any floor, I must admit, in the throes of finishing it in 1963. Each of us thought she was a freak 10 years ago if she didn't experience that mysterious orgastic fulfillment waxing the kitchen floor as the commercials promised. However much we enjoyed being Junior and Janey's or Emily's mother, or B.J.'s wife, if we still had ambitions, ideas about ourselves as people in our own right—well, we were simply freaks, neurotics, and we confessed our sin or neurosis to priest or psychoanalyst, and tried hard to adjust. We didn't admit to each other if we felt there should be more in life than peanut butter sandwiches with the kids, if throwing powder into the washing machine didn't make us relive our wedding night, if getting the socks or shirts pure white was not exactly a peak experience, even if we did feel guilty about the tattle‐tale gray. Some of us (in 1963, nearly half of all women in the United States) were already committing the unpardonable sin of working outside the home to help pay the mortgage or grocery bill. They felt guilty, too, about betraying their femininity, undermining their husbands' masculinity, and neglecting the children by daring to work for money at all—no matter how much it was needed. They couldn't admit, even to themselves, that they resented being paid half what a man would have been paid for the job, or always being passed over for promotion, or writing the paper for which he got the degree and the raise. A suburban neighbor of mine named Gertie was having coffee with me when the census taker came as I was writing “The Feminine Mystique.” “Occupation?” the census taker asked. “Housewife,” I said. Gertie, who had cheered me on in my efforts at writing and selling magazine article; shook her head sadly: “You should take yourself more seriously,” she said. I hesitated, and then said to the census taker, “Actually, I'm a writer.” But of course, I then was, and still am, like all women in America, no matter what else we do between 9 and 5, a housewife. It seems such a precarious accident that I ever wrote the book at all—and, in another way, of course, my whole life had prepared me to write that book. All the pieces finally came together. In 1957, getting strangely bored with writing articles about breast‐feeding and the like for Redbook and the Ladies' Home Journal, I put an unconscionable amount of time into a questionnaire for my fellow Smith graduates of the class of 1942, thinking I was going to disprove the current notion that education had fitted us ill for our role as women. But the questionnaire raised more questions than it answered for me — education had not exactly geared us to the role women were trying to play, it seemed. The suspicion arose: was it the education or the role that was wrong? McCall's commissioned an article based on my Smith alumnae questionnaire, but the then male publisher of McCall's, during that great era of togetherness, turned the piece down in horror, despite underground efforts of female editors. The male McCall's editors said it I was next commissioned to do the article for Ladies' Home Journal. This time, I took it back, because they rewrote it to say just the opposite of what, in fact, I was trying to say. I tried it again for Redbook; each time I was interviewing more women, psychologists, sociologists, marriage counselors and the like, and getting more and more sure I was on the track of something. But what? I needed a name for whatever it was that kept us from using our rights, that made us feel guilty about anything we did, not as our husbands' wives, our children's mothers, but as people ourselves. I needed a name to describe that guilt—like The guilt women used to feel about sexual needs, and the guilt they felt now about needs that didn't fit the sexual definition of women, the mystique of feminine fulfillment—the feminine mystique. The editor of Redbook told my agent, “Betty has gone off her rocker. She has always done a good job for us but this time only the most neurotic housewife could identify.” I opened my agent's letter on the subway taking the kids to the pediatrician. I got off the subway to call my agent and told her, “I'll have to write a book to get this into print.” What I was writing threatened the very foundations of the women's magazine world—the feminine mystique. Giving it a name. I knew that it was not the only possible universe for women at all, but an unnatural confining of our energies and vision. But as I began following leads and clues from women's words and my own feelings, across psychology, sociology and recent history, tracing back—through the pages of the magazines for which I'd written—why and how it happened, what it was really doing to women, their children, even to sex, the implications became apparent and they were fantastic! I was so surprised myself at what I was writing, where it was leading. After I finished each chapter, a part of me would wonder, am I crazy? But there was also a growing feeling of calm, strong, gut sureness as the clues fitted together, which must be the same kind of feeling a scientist has when he or she zeroes in on a discovery one of those true scientific detective stories. Only this was not just abstract and conceptual —it meant that I and every other woman I knew had been living a lie, and all the doctors who treated us and the experts who studied us were perpetuating that lie, and our homes and schools and churches and politics and professions were built around that lie. If women were really people, no more, no less—then all the things that kept them from being full people in our society would have to be changed. And women, once they broke through the feminine mystique and took themselves seriously as people, would see their place on a false pedestal, even their glorification as sexual objects, for the putdown it was. Yet if I had realized how fantastically fast that would really happen—already in less than 10 years' time—maybe I would have been so scared I might have stopped writing. But during that February, March and April of 1963, when the book first came out, all I felt was a terrible urgency. Psychologist Abraham Maslow, who had spent a whole day explaining to me how his concept of self‐actualization did not apply to women, sent me a telegram saying that he had stayed up all night reading “The Feminine Mystique,” and had changed his mind. Professor Mary Ellen Chase wrote me from Smith College, likening the book's importance to the pro nouncements of the prophets of my Jewish ancestry. However, my publisher had seen fit to print only 3,000 copies. Then, breaking every rule, both the Ladies' Home Journal and McCall's printed pieces of the book, and The Herald Tribune book section carried a front‐page review by Marya Mannes; I began to be treated almost like a writer who had written a big book. (I say “almost” advisedly; more like a housewife who had accidentally written a big book.) I began to get letters from other women who now saw through the feminine mystique, who wanted to stop doing their children's homework and start doing their own; they were also being told they really weren't capable of doing anything else now but making homemade strawberry jam or helping their children do fourth‐grade arithmetic. It wasn't enough just to take yourself seriously as a person. Society had to change, somehow, for women to make it as people. It really wasn't possible to live any longer as “just a housewife.” But what other way was there to live? I remember getting stuck at that point, even when I was writing “The Feminine Mystique.” I had to write a last chapter, giving a solution to “the problem that has no name,” suggesting new patterns, a way out of the conflicts, whereby women could use their abilities fully in society and find their own existential human identity, sharing its action, decisions and challenges without at the same time renouncing home, children, love, their own sexuality. My mind went blank. You do have to say “no” to the old way before you can begin to find the new “yes” you need. But giving a name to the problem that had no name was the necessary first. step. I couldn't operate as a suburban housewife any longer, even if I had wanted to For one thing, I became a leper in my own suburb. Women in other suburbs were writing me letters as if I were Joan of Arc leading them out of the wilderness, but I practically had to flee my own crabgrassovergrown yard to keep from being burned at the stake. Although we had been fairly popular, my husband and were suddenly no longer invited to our neighbors' dinner parties. My kids were kicked out of the car pool for art and dancing classes. We had to move back to the city, where the kids could do their own thing without my chauffeuring and where I could be with them at home during some of the hours. I now spent commuting. I couldn't stand being a freak alone in the suburbs any longer. At first, that strange hostility my book—and later the movement—seemed to elicit from some women amazed and puzzled me. Even in the beginning, there wasn't the hostility I had expected from men. Many men bought “The Feminine Mystique” for their wives and urged them to go back to school or to work. realized soon enough that there were probably millions of women who had felt as had, like a freak, absolutely alone, as a suburban housewife. But if you were too afraid you wouldn't really make it, too afraid to face your real feelings about the husband and children you were presumably living for, then someone like me opening up the can of worms was a I didn't blame women for being scared. I was pretty scared myself. It isn't really possible to make a new pattern of life all by yourself. I've always dreaded being alone more than anything. The anger I had not dared to face in myself during all the years I tried to play the helpless little housewife with my husband — and feeling more helpless the longer played it—was beginning to erupt now, more and more violently. For fear of being alone, I almost lost my own self‐respect trying to hold on to a marriage, and to what was no longer love, but dependent hate. It was easier for me to start the women's movement which was needed to change society than to change my own personal life. IT seemed time to start writing that second book, but I couldn't find any new patterns in society beyond the feminine mystique. I could find a few individual women, knocking themselves out to meet Good Houskeeping standards, trying to raise Spockian children while working at a full‐time job and feeling guilty about it. And conferences were being held about the availability of continuing education for women because all those aging fulltime housewife ‐ mothers, whose babies were now in college, were beginning to be trouble—drinking, taking too many pills, committing suicide. Whole learned journals were devoted to the discussion of “women and their options”—the “stages” of women's lives. Women, we were told, could go to school, work a bit, get parried, stay with the children 15 to 20 years, and then go back to school and work—no problem; no need for role conflicts. The women who were advancing this theory were among the exceptional few to reach top jobs because they somehow had not dropped out for 15 or 20 years. And these same women were advising the women flocking back to their continuing education programs that they couldn't really expect to get real jobs or professional training after 15 years at home; ceramics, or professional volunteer work—that was the realistic adjustment. Talk, that's all it was, talk. In 1965, the long‐awaited report of the President's Commission on the Status of Women detailed the discriminatory wages women were earning (half the average for men), and the declining ratio of women in professional and executive jobs. The commission recommended that women be counseled to use their abilities in society, and suggested that child‐care centers and other services be provided to enable women to combine motherhood and work. The President's Commission report was duly buried in bureaucratic file drawers. That summer of 1965, I got a third of the way through the book I wanted to write about going beyond the feminine mystique; by then I knew that there weren't any new patterns, only new problems that women weren't going to be able to solve unless society changed. And all the talk, and the reports, and the Commission, and the continuing education programs were only examples of tokenism—maybe even an attempt to block a real movement on the part of women themselves to change society. It seemed to me that something more than talk had to happen. “The only thing that's changed so far is our own consciousness,” I wrote, closing that second book which I never finished because the next sentence read, “What we need is a political movement, a social movement like that of the blacks.” I had to take action. On the plane to Washington, pondering what to do, I saw a student reading, a book, “The First Step to Revolution Is Consciousness,” and it was like an omen. I went to Washington because a law had been passed, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, banning sex discrimination in employment along with race discrimination. The sex discrimination part had been tacked on as a joke and a delaying maneuver by a Southern Congressman, Howard Smith of Virginia. At the first press conferences after the law went into effect, the administrator in charge of enforcing it joked about the ban on sex discrimination. “It will give men equal opportunity to be Playboy bunnies,” he said. In Washington I found a seething underground of women in the Government, the press and the labor unions who felt powerless to stop the sabotage of this law that was supposed to break through the sex discrimination that pervaded every industry and profession, every factory, school and office. Some of these women felt that I, as a nowknown writer, could get the public's ear. One day, a cool young woman lawyer, who worked for the agency that was not enforcing the law against sex discrimination, carefully closed the door of her office and said to me with tears in her eyes, “I never meant to be so concerned about women. I like men. But I'm getting an ulcer, the way women are be ing betrayed. We may never have another chance like this law again. Betty, you have to start an N.A.A.C.P. for women. You are the‐ only one free enough to do it.” But I wasn't an organization woman. I never even belonged to the League of Women Voters. Hovirever, there was a meeting of state commissioners on the status of women in Washington in June. I thought that, among the women there from the ‐various states, we would get the nucleus of an organization that could at least call press conference and raise the alarm among women throughout the country. Lawyer Pauli Murray came to that meeting, and Dorothy Haener and Caroline Davis from the U.A.W., and Kay Clarenbach, head of the Governor's Commission in Wisconsin, and Katherine Conroy of the Communications Workers of America, and Aileen Hernandez, then a member of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. I asked them to come to my hotel room one night. Most didn't think women needed a movement like the blacks, but, everyone was mad at the sabotage of Title VII. The consensus was that the conference could surely take respectable action to insist the law be enforced. I went to bed, relieved that probably a movement wouldn't have to be organized. At 6 the next morning, I got a call from one of the top token women in the Johnson Administration, urging me not to rock the boat. At 8 the phone rang again; this time it was one of the re, luctant sisters of the night before, angry now, really angry. “We've been told that this conference doesn't have the power to take any action at all, or even the right to offer a resolution. So, we've gotten a table for us all to eat together at lunch, and we'll start the organization.” At the luncheon we each chipped in a dollar. I wrote the word NOW on a paper napkin; our group should be called. ‐the National Organization for Women, I said, “because men should be part of it.” Then I wrote down the first sentence of the NOW statement of purpose, committing ourselves to “take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof, in truly equal The changes necessary to bring about that equality were, and still are, very rev olutionary indeed. They involve a sex‐role revolution for men and women which will restructure all our institutions: childrearing, education, marriage, the family, medicine, work, politics, the economy, religion, psychological theory, human sexuality, morality and the very evolution of the race. I now see the women's movement for equality as simply the necessary first stage of a much larger sex‐role revolution. I never did see it in terms of class or race: women, as an oppressed class, fighting to overthrow or take power away from men as a class, the oppressors. I knew the movement had to include men as equal members, though women would have to take the lead in the first stage. There is only one way for women to reach full human potential—by participating in the mainstream of society, by exercising their own voice, in all the decisions shaping that society. For women to have full human identity and freedom, they must have economic independence. Breaking through the barriers that had kept them from the jobs and professions rewarded by society was the first step, but it wasn't sufficient. It would be necessary to change the rules of the game to restructure professions, marriage, the family, the home. Equality and human dignity are not possible for women if they are not able to earn money. But the importance. of work for women goes beyond economics. How else can women participate in the action and decisions of an advanced industrial society unless they have the training and opportunity and skills' that come from participating in it? Women also had to confront their sexual nature, not deny or ignore it as earlier feminists had done. Society had to be restructured so ‐ that women, who happen to be the people who give birth, could make a human, responsible choice whether or not—and when—to have children, and not be barred thereby from participating in society in their own right. This meant the right to birth control and safe abortion; the right to maternity leave and childcare centers if women did not want to retreat completely from adult society during the childbearing years; and the equivalent of a G.I. bill for retraining if women chose to stay home with the children. I couldn't define “liberation” for a woman in terms that denied the sexual and human reality of our need to love, and even sometimes to depend upon, a man. What had to be changed were the obsolete feminine and masculine sex roles that dehumanized sex, and women, making it almost impossible for women and men to make love, not war. How could we ever really know or love each other as long as we played those roles that kept us from knowing or being ourselves? Weren't men as well as women still locked in lonely isolation, alienation, no matter how many sexual acrobatics they put their bodies through? It seemed to me that men weren't really the enemy — they were fellow victims, suffering from an outmoded masculine mystique which made them feel unnecessarily inadequate when there were IN these past years of action, I have seen myself and other women becoming both stronger and more gentle, taking ourselves more seriously yet beginning to really have fun as we stopped playing the old roles. We discovered we could trust each other. I love the women with whom I took the brave and joyous actions of these years. No one realized how pitifully few we were in the beginning, how little money we had, how little experience. What gave us the strength and the nerve to do what we did, in the name of American women, of women of the world? It was, of course, because we were doing it for ourselves. It was not charity for the poor; we, the middleclass women who started this, were all poor. It was hard even for housewives whose husbands weren't poor to get money to fly to board meetings of NOW. It was hard for women who worked to get time off from their jobs, or take precious weekend time from their families. I have never worked so hard for money, gone so many hours with so little sleep or time off to eat or even go to the toilet as in these first years I was subpoenaed, Christmas Eve, 1966, to testify before a judge in Foley Square, because the airlines were so outraged at our insistence that they were guilty of sex discrimination by forcing stewardesses to resign at age 30 or upon their marriage. (Why, I had wondered, are they going to such lengths? Surely they don't really think men ride the airlines because stew ardesses are nubile. And then I realized how much money the airlines saved by firing those pretty stewardesses before they had time to accumulate pay increases, vacation time and pension rights. And how I love it now, when stewardesses hug me on an airplane and tell me they are not only married, and over 30, but can even have children and keep flying!) Woman power I felt a certain urgency of history, that we would be failing the generation coming up if we evaded the question of abortion now. I also felt we had to get the Equal Rights Amendment added to the Constitution despite the claim of union leaders that it would end “protective” laws for women. We had to take the torch of equality from the lonely, bitter old women who had been fighting all alone for the Equal Rights Amendment, which had been bottled up in Congress for nearly 50 years since women had chained themselves to the White Rouse fence to get the vote. On our first picket line at the White House fence, (“Rights not Roses”) on Mother's Day in 1967, we threw away chains of aprons, flowers and mock typewriters. We dumped bundles of newspapers onto the floor of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in protest against its refusal to enforce the Civil Rights law against sex‐segregated “Help Wanted: Male” ads (for the good jobs), and “Help Wanted: Female” ads (for gal Friday‐type jobs). This was supposed to be just as illegal now as ads reading “Help Wanted, White” and “Help Wanted, Colored.” We announced we were going to sue the Federal ,Government for not enforcing the law equally on behalf of women (and then called members of our underground in the Justice Department to see if one could do that)—and we did. I gave lectures in Southern finishing schools and commencement addresses at outof‐the way colleges of home economics—as well as at Yale, U.C.L.A. and Harvard‐to pay my way in organizing NOW chapters (we never did have money for an organizing staff). Our only real office in those years was my apartment. It wasn't possible to keep up with the mail. But when women like Wilma Heide from Pittsburgh, or Karen De Crow in Syracuse, were so determined to have NOW chapters that they called long distance when we didn't answer their letters—the only thing to do was to have them become local NOW organizers. I remember so many way stations: going to lunch at the for‐men‐only Oak Room at the Plaza Hotel with 50 NOW women and demanding to be served. . . . Testifying before the Senate against the nomination to the Supreme Court of a sexist judge named Carswell who refused to hear a case of a woman who was fired because she had preschool children. . . . Seeing the first sign of a woman's underground in the student movement, when I was asked to lead a rap session at the National Student Congress in College Park, Md., in 1968. After resolution for liberation of women from the mimeograph machines was laughed down at the S.D.S. convention, hearing the young radical women telling me they had to have a. separate women's lib group—because if they really spoke out at S.D.S. meetings, they might not get married. . . . Helping Sheila Tobias plan the Cornell intersession on women in 1968, which started the first women's studies programs (how many universities have them now!). . . . Persuading the NOW board we should hold a “Congress to Unite Women” with the young radicals despite differences in ideology and style. . . . So many stations. I admired the flair of the young radicals when they got off the rhetoric of sex/class warfare and conducted actions like picketing the Miss America beauty contest in Atlantic City. But when TiGrace Atkinson — whom originally pushed forward in NOW because her ladylike blond image would counteract the man‐eating specter—told establishment women at the National Conference of Christians and Jews that the prostitute was the only honest woman, did it build the women's movement or alienate women? The media began to publicize, in more and more sensational terms, the more exhibitionist, down ‐ with ‐ men, down with ‐ marriage, downwith‐childbearing rhetoric and actions. Those who preached the man‐hating sex/class warfare threatened to take over New York NOW, and National NOW, and drive out the women who wanted equality, but who also wanted to keep on loving their husbands and children. Kate Millett's “Sexual Politics” was hailed as the ideology of sex/class, warfare by those who claimed to be the radicals of the women's movement. But after the manhating faction broke up the second Congress to Unite Women with hate talk, and even violence, I heard a young radical say, “If I were an agent of the C.I.A. and wanted to disrupt this movement, that's just what I would do.” BY 1970, it was beginning to be clear that the women's movement was more than a temporary fad, it was the fastest‐growing movement for basic social and political change of the decade. The black movement had been taken over by extremists; the student movement was immobilized by its fetish for leaderless structure, and by the growing alienation from extremist hate rhetoric. Someone was trying to take over our movement too — or to stop it, immobilize it, splinter it a guise of radical rhetoric, and a similar fetish against leadership and structure. “It's fruitless to speculate whether they are C.I.A. agents, or sick, or on a private stupid,” a black leader warned me. “If they continually disrupt, you simply have to fight them.” The, disrupters of the women's movement were the ones continually trying to push lesbianism or hatred of men, even though many weren't lesbians themselves and didn't act privately as if they hated men. They even tried to push purple armbands saying “We Are All Lesbians” on women attending a march on abortion and child care at Gracie Square. The responsible lesbians in the women's movement fought these disrupters. Who or what was really behind it? Some of the disruption seemed to be instigated by extreme left groups. Also, I never told anyone, but very early, Ti‐Grace Atkinson took me to lunch in Philadelphia with the wife of a top C.I.A. official, .who offered to help us. I told Ti‐Grace we didn't want any help from the C.I.A. Sometime in 1968, we heard that 200 women had been trained by the F.B.I. or the C.I.A. to infiltrate the women's movement—as is known was done by the F.B.I. in the student and radical move In the spring of 1970, a very troubled woman whom I had trusted came to see me one night. She told me a story I could hardly believe. The lesbians were organizing to take over NOW and the women's movement, she said; they had used me, since they needed me for respectability and for my “contacts”; and she said they had given her the assignment to “seduce” me and blackmail me into silence. It seemed dangerous then to publicize this attempted lesbian take‐over—even if it were true. I was considered square, uptight, old‐fashioned, conservative, etc., about lesbianism; and considering my Middle American background, maybe I was. I think everyone has a right to sexual privacy —and to each her/his own (as long as it doesn't hurt or exploit anyone else). But it was both hurting and exploiting the women's movement to try to use it to proselytize for lesbianism because of the sexual preferences of a few. This could only subordinate the great issue of equality for women, the opportunity and institutional changes that all women so desperately need. As president of NOW, I never knew, or wanted to know, any woman's sexual preferences. But I warned those who were pushing lesbianism in New York NOW that they were creating a sexual red herring that would divide the movement and lead ultimately to sexual McCarthyism. It seemed to me the women's movement had to get out of sexual politics. I thought it was a joke at first—those strangely humorless papers about clitoral orgasms that would liberate women from sexual dependence on a man's penis, and the “consciousness ‐ raising” talk that women should insist now on being on top in bed with men. Then I realized, as Simone de Beauvoir once wrote, that these women were, merely acting out sexually their rebellion and resentment at being “underneath” in society generally, being dependent on men for their personal definition. But their resentment was being manipulated into an orgy of sex hatred that would vitiate the power they now had to change conditions resented. THE disrupters who are viciously promulgating, or manipulating, this man‐hate may be very few. (Others, like Kate Millett, Shulamith Firestone, Robin Morgan, Ti‐Grace, Flo Kennedy and — somewhat more subtly — Gloria Steinem, seem to be honestly articulating the legitimate and too‐long‐buried rage of women into a rhetoric of sex/class warfare, which I consider to be based on a false analogy with obsolete or irrelevant ideologies of class warfare or race separatism.) The manhaters are given publicity far out of proportion to their numbers in the movement because of the media's hunger for sensationalism. (For instance, at last month's NOW convention in Washington, the television cameramen only turned their lights on for the resolutions on lesbianism and rape, ignoring the hundreds of other resolutions on economic, political, social and educational breakthroughs.) Many women in the movement go through a temporary period of great hostility to men when they first become conscious of their situation, but when they start acting to change their situation, they outgrow what I call the pseudoradical infantilism. But that man‐hating rhetoric increasingly disturbs most women in the movement, in addition to the women it keeps out of the movement. On the plane to Chicago, preparing to bow out as president of NOW, feeling powerless to fight the man‐haters openly and refusing to front for . them, I suddenly knew what had to be done. A woman from Florida had written to. remind me that Aug. 26, 1970, was the 50th anniversary of the constitutional amendment giving women the vote. We needed to call a national action—a strike of women to call attention to the unfinished business of equality: equal opportunity for jobs and education, the right to abortion and childcare centers, the right to our own share of political power. It would unite women again in serious action—women who had never been near a “women's lib” group. (NOW, the largest such group, and the only one with a national structure, had only 3,000 members in 30 cities in 1970.) I remember that, to transmit this new vision to the NOW convention in Chicago, warning of the dangers of aborting the women's movement, I spoke for nearly two hours and got a standing ovation. The grass‐roots strength of NOW went into organizing the Aug. 26 strike. In New York, women filled the temporary headquarters volunteering to do anything and everything; they hardly went home at night. Mayor Lindsay wouldn't close Fifth Avenue for our march, and I remember start ing that march with the hoofs of policemen's horses trying to keep us confined to the sidewalk. I remember looking back, jumping up to see over marchers' heads. I never saw so many women; they stretched back for so many blocks you couldn't see the end. I locked one arm with my beloved Judge Dorothy Kenyon (who, at 82, insisted on walking with me instead of riding in the car we had provided for her), and the other arm with a young woman on the other side. I said to the others in the front ranks, “Lock arms, sidewalk to sidewalk!” We overflowed till we filled the whole of Fifth Avenue. There were so many of us they couldn't stop us; they didn't even try. It was, as they say, the first great nationwide action of women (hundreds of men also marched with us) since women won the vote itself 50 years before. Reporters who had joked about “the braburners” wrote‐that they had never seen such beautiful women as the proud, joyous marchers who joined together that day. For all women were beautiful on that day. On Aug. 26, it suddenly became both political and glamorous to be a feminist. Politics, at first, had seemed to be something altogether separate from what we were doing in the women's movement. The regular politicians, right, left, center—Republican, Democrat, splinter—certainly weren't interested in women. In 1968, I had testified in vain at the conventions of both political parties, trying to get a single word about women in either the Republican or Democratic platform. When Eugene McCarthy, the chief sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment, announced he was going to run for President to end the Vietnam war, I began to connect my own politics, at least, to the women's drive for equality. I called Bella Abzug and asked how I could work for McCarthy. But not even the other women working for him thought the women's issues were relevant politically, and many NOW members were critical of me for campaigning openly for McCarthy. At the 1970 NOW convention in Chicago, I said we had a human responsibility as women to end the Vietnam war. Neither men nor women should be drafted to fight an obscene, immoral war like the one in Vietnam, but we had to take equal responsibility to end it. Two years earlier, standing outside the Conrad Hilton Hotel in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention in 1968, I had watched helmeted troopers clubbing down the long‐haired young, my own son among them. I began to see that these young men, saying they didn't have to napalm all the children in Vietnam and Cambodia to prove they were men, were defying the masculine mystique as we had defied the feminine one. Those young men, and their elders like them, were the other half of what we were doing. And during that summer of 1970, I started trying to organize a woman's political caucus; later, it stuck together enough to get Bella Abzug elected to Congress. She and Gloria Steinem joined me as conveners of our Aug. 26 Women's Strike for Equality march. So many women who had been afraid before joined our march that day; we, and the world, suddenly realized the possibilities of women's political power. This power was first tested last summer in Miami when, for the first time, women played a major role in the political conventions. Although inexperienced caucus leaders may have been too easily co‐opted by Nixon or McGovern, they brought change to the political arena. They won commitments from both parties on child‐care, preschool and after‐school programs. And Shirley Chisholm stayed in the Democratic race right to the end—and, by 1976, I predict that even the Republicans will have a woman running seriously for Vice President, if not President. AND so, by now, most of the agenda of Stage I of the sex‐role revolution—which is how I now see the women's movement for equality—has been accomplished, or is in the process of being resolved. The Equal Rights Amendment was approved by Congress with hardly a murmur in either house after we organized the National Women's Political Caucus. The amendment's main opponent, Emanuel Celler, has been retired from Congress by one of the many new young women who, these days, are running for office instead of looking up Zip Codes. The Supreme Court has ruled that no state can deny a woman her right to choose childbirth or abortion. Over 1,000 lawsuits have been filed forcing universities and corporations to take affirmative action to end sex discrim tions that keep women from getting top jobs. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has been ordered to pay $15‐million in reparations to women who didn't even apply for jobs better than telephone operator because such jobs weren't open to women. Every professional association, newspaper office, television station, church, company, hospital and school, in almost every city, has a women's caucus or a group taking action on the concrete conditions that keep women down. Lately, I've been asked to lead consciousness‐raising sessions for the men who plan the training of guidance counselors in New York and Minnesota, in a Senate subcommittee on health and housing, among cosmetic salesmen in Virginia, at the Air Force Academy in Colorado, and with investment bankers in Florida. The State Department has said that women can't be fired from the Foreign Service just because they are married, and secretaries can't be told to go for coffee. Women are beginning to change the very practice of medicine by establishing self‐help clinics that enable women to take active responsibility for their own bodies. Those at psychoanalytic conferences ask me, and other movement women, to help them change their definition of feminine and masculine. In the women's movement itself, 2,000 women from 400 cities met at the NOW convention in Washington last month, and women from 50 states met at the National Women's Political Caucus in Houston. The rhetoric of sex/ class warfare was forgotten in the urgency of blocking the John Birch‐inspired campaign to prevent states from ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. At the NOW convention, a major effort to recruit men for Stage II of the sexrole revolution was proposed; an attempt to delete from our Statement of Purpose the words “fully equal partnership with men” died for lack of support. The women's movement is no longer just an American possibility. I've been asked to help organize groups in Italy, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Sweden, France, Israel, Japan, India and even in Czechoslovakia and other Socialist countries. I hope that by next year we'll have our first world conference of feminists, perhaps in Sweden. The. United States Census reports a drastic decline in the birth rate, which I credit as much to women's new aspirations as to The Pill. The women's movement is strong enough now to bring out into the open real differences in ideology: I think my view of the sex‐role revolution will emerge as the belief of those in the mainstream, and the man‐hating fringe will evaporate, having represented a temporary phase, or even a planned diversion. It would be unrealistic, of course, not to expect forces threatened by the women's movement to try to organize or provoke a blacklash—as they are doing now in many states to prevent ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. For example, women were given a week off by employers in Ohio, bused over the state line and put up in motels in an attempt to pressure the Kentucky Legislature to block the Equal Rights Amendment. But I ‐remember that the liquor companies spent millions of dollars to prevent ratification of women's right to vote in Tennessee 50 years ago. And today, who is financing the campaign to stop the final act of the women's movement for equality? Not a conspiracy of men to keep women down; rather, it is a conspiracy of those whose power, or profit, rests on the manipulation of the fears and impotent rage of passive women. Women the last and largest group of people in this nation to demand control of their own destiny—will change the very nature of political power in this country. IN the decade since the publication of “The Feminine Mystique,” the women's movement has changed my whole life too, no less powerfully or joyfully than the lives of other women who stop to tell me about themselves. I couldn't keep living my schizophrenic life: Joan of Arc leading other women out of the wilderness, while holding on to a marriage that destroyed my self‐respect. I finally found the courage to get divorced in May, 1969. am less alone now than I ever was holding on to the false security of my marriage. think the next great issue for the women's movement is basic reform of marriage and divorce. My life still keeps changing, with Emily off to college in the fall, Danny getting his Ph.D. at Princeton, and Jonny using his talents in a carpen try collective. I've finished my first stint as a visiting professor of sociology at Temple University, and I've written my own uncensored column for McCall's. I've moved high into an airy, magic New York tower, with open sky and river and bridges to the future all around. I've started a weekend commune of grownups for whom marriage hadn't worked—an extended family of choice, whose members are now moving into new kinds of marriages. The more I've become myself—and the more strength, support and love I've somehow managed to take from, and give to, other women in the movement — the more joyous and real I feel loving a man. I've seen great relief in women this year as I've spelled out my personal truth: that the assumption of your own identity, equality and even political power does not mean you stop needing to love, and be loved by, a man, or that you, stop caring for your kids. I would have lost my own feeling for the women's movement if I had not been able, finally, to admit tenderness. One mystical footnote: I used to be terribly afraid of flying. After I wrote “The Feminine Mystique,” I suddenly stopped being afraid; now I fly on jets across the ocean and .on one‐engine air taxis in the hills of West Virginia. I guess, existentially, once you start really living your life, and doing your work, and loving, you are not afraid to die. Sometimes, when I realize how much flying I do, I think there's a possibility that I will die in an airplane crash. But not for quite a while, I hope, because the pieces of my own life as woman with man‐ are coming together in a new pattern of human sex and human politics. I now can write that new book. In fact, with these words, I have it. I think the energy locked up in those obsolete masculine and feminine roles are the social equivalent of the physical energies locked up in the realm of E=MC2— the force which unleashed the holocaust of Hiroshima. I believe the locked‐up sexual energies have helped to fuel, more than anyone realizes, the terrible violence erupting in the nation and the world during these past 10 years. If I am right, the sex‐role revolution will liberate these energies from the service of death and will make it really possible for men and women to “make love, not war.” ■"
WOMEN'S BENEFITS ADDED BY A UNION,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/04/archives/womens-benefits-added-by-a-union-most-members-women.html,"In a step described as a “breakthrough” for women, the trustees of the welfare fund of the Social Service Employes Union, Local 371, announced yesterday that they would begin making disability payments to women incapacitated because of pregnancy or childbirth. Albert E. Alexander, chairman of the board of trustees, said that as far as he knew most welfare funds providing for disability payments excluded the payment of benefits to women for disability resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, mis. carriage or abortion. “It was a phony situation that nobody had ever examined,” he said. “We were doing it, too. But we got some protests and we stopped to reexamine our policy.” Mrs. Linda Shah, a former caseworker in the Bureau of Child Welfare, was one of those who raised the issue after she became pregnant last year. She said that she considered it discriminatory to deny women benefits for pregnancy or childbirth disabilities, and that she had contacted various agencies, the union and health agencies. Files Complaint With City She said she also filed a complaint with the City Commission on Human Rights and contacted the local's welfare filed, telling them what she had done and that she considered the exclusionary clause a violation of the Civil Rights Act. Mr. Alexander and the other trustees of the fund were sympathetic and voted to eliminate the exclusion. Members with a disability stemming from pregnancy or childbirth will be paid a benefit of $75 a week, the same as others would receive for a disability resulting for example, from a heart attack or a broken leg, he said. The benefits, following a 30‐day waiting period, will be paid up to 39 weeks in a two‐year period, he said. A woman with a disability because of pregnancy or maternity, could file a claim as do others with a disability and submit her doctor's statement and prognosis to the welfare fund, he said. Most Members Women Local 371 represents 15,500 employes of the Department of Social Services and the Human Resources Administration, Mr. Alexander said, with 55 per cent of the members women and more than half of the women of child‐bearing age. The welfare fund of the local he said, is financed by an annual city contribution of $250 for each employe, and is administered by the union trustees subject to review by the City Controller. The fund also provides for dental work, accidental death, prescription drugs, optician costs, emergency hospital rooms and supplemental money to help defray maternity hospital costs above those paid by Blue Cross, he said. Susan Rosenfeld, who heads Women in City Government United, said her organization was urging other unions representing city, employes adopt the same policy as the Local 371 welfare fund."
New Archbishop of Washington William Wakefield Baum,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/06/archives/new-archbishop-of-washington-william-wakefield-baum-influence-on.html,"WASHINGTON, March 5—The new Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington is returning to the city where he began to make his mark in 1964. In that year. William Wakefield Baum became the first director of a committee set up by the bishops of the United States on ecumental and in terreligious affairs. He has never lost interest in achieving closer relations with other religions. Man in the News Bishop Baum's appointment by Pope Paul VI as Archbishop of Washington, succeeding Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle, was announced today in Rome by the Pope. Influence on Ecumenism The Rev. John Hotchkin, who is the director of ecumenical affairs for the National Conference of Bishops, said that the new Archbishop “set the pace and pattern of our ecumenical movement.” He continued, “There are seven consultations, of one sort or another, now working between Catholic bishops and other churches, all begun when Bishop Baum was director.” While seeking for many years to make the Roman Catholic Church aware of other religions Archbishop Baum has also tried to discuss the doctrines of the church in relation to change in society. “The Supreme Court says abortions are legal,” he said in a telephone interview, “and the church says abortions are immoral. What we must do is to help people make the distinctions between what is legally permissible and what is morally right.” Archbishop Baum favors the new Catholic liturgy because “there is so much participation.” But he added: “Latin masses could be helpful. I think there should be a diversity of liturgical experiences. The folk mass has its place and the Latin mass could have a place.” Regarding the problem of maintaining Catholic schools in the face of financial pressures, he said: “I believe that Catholic schools are immensely helpful in creating a religious climate. I don”t think we”ve found a substitute form of education as helpful as Catholic schools. Where it's possible I think the schools should be present.” Archbishop Baum, who was born in Texas on Nov. 21, 1926, was deeply involved in the church from childhood. At the age of 10 he became an altar boy, and when he was about 12 he began a practice he has followed every day since—mass and communion every day. Pastor ‘a Model for Me’ The Rev. James McKay, his pastor, “was a model for me,” the new Archbishop said. “He helped me through so much of my life, even through seminary school.” “As I grew older, I had to cross the mountains of crisis in the seminary,” Archbishop Baum said of his days at Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis. “I had doubts about my capacity and if this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life—problems everyone in the priesthood suffers—but I had so much spiritual direction to help. Even then Father McKay was helping me. Ecumenical Career Begins “On two occasions when I was in the seminary I even thought of leaving. After his ordination in 1951, he studied at the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome where he earned a doctorate in theology. He then taught at Avila College in Kansas City for nine years and served in parishes throughout Missouri. In 1964 he began to distinguish himself in ecumenical work as the director of the bishops committee. His ecumenical mission then led him to become the only Catholic member from North America of the Joint Working Group of the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches. This group has been meting about mice a year in cities throughout Europe since 1965 and, in addition to providing the opportunity for Archbishop Baum to engage in ecumenical work, the meeting also enabled him to travel extensively. “I am an avid sightster,” he says, “and I have an insatiable desire to visit old churches and museums.” After his ecumenical assignment he was sent back to Missouri to get some experience in chancery work. In 1970 he was consecrated Bishop of Springfield‐Cape Girardeau, Mo., and in 1971 Pope Paul VI appointed him a delegate to the World Synod of Bishops at the Vatican Archibishop Baum says of his new pod in Washington: “I see myself as a pastor for the diocese and a teacher. But I know my duties are as an administrator as well.”"
ABORTION LAW UPSET Br COURT IN INDIANA,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/06/archives/abortion-law-upset-by-court-in-indiana.html,"INDIANAPOLIS, March 5 (AP)—A three‐judge Federal panel ruled today that Indiana's abortion laws were unconstitutional, applying the United States Supreme Court's decision in two recent cases. Judge Luther M. Swygert, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and United States District Judges S. Hugh Dillin and James E. Noland of Indianapolis issued the decision granting a summary judgment for the plaintiffs in a law suit filed in 1970. The suit had been filed by a group composed of clergymen and physcians who favored abortion, and was handled by six cooperating attorneys of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union. The court struck down four laws that have been on the books since 1905. DENVER, March 5 (AP)—The Colorado Supreme Court struck down much of the Colorado Criminal Abortion Act as unconstitutional today, citing the United States Supreme Court's decision on abortion and decisions in other courts. The Colorado court removed virtually every major requirement under current law, leaving only the provision that a doctor perform the abortion."
Population Dynamics,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/06/archives/population-dynamics.html,"The sharp decline in this country's birth rate last year to the lowest level in American history has attracted wide attention. Last year 300,000 fewer babies were born than in 1971, even though the number of women of childbearing age increased appreciably. The demographers who a few years ago were widely prophesying a “baby boom” are finding that mechanical extrapolations of past trends were inadequate guides in this era of increasing availability of legal abortion as well as wider employment of contraceptive techniques. As usual in recent years, the 1972 death rate was essentially unchanged, so that the declining natural population increase last year reflected primarily the fall in the birth rate. About 3.3 million babies were born in 1972 and slightly less than two million persons died, so the net natural population gain was about 1.3 million. The number of marriages rose by about 73,000 last year to 2,269,000. But the number of divorces and annulments rose even more rapidly to 839,000. Statistically, therefore, more than one‐third as many marriages broke up legally last, year as were entered into. And the number of divorces was more than 80 per cent higher than a decade earlier. Clearly, major changes are taking place in the stability of the American family and in that family's procreation pattern—an area of fundamental importance deserving much more research and explication."
"Women's Lobby, in Albany, Urged to Avoid ‘Separatism’ Appeal",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/07/archives/womens-lobby-in-albany-urged-to-avoid-separatism-appeal-mayoral.html,"ALBANY, March 6 — Representatives of the National Organization for Women gathered today to lobby for a package of bills and were cautioned by a woman member of the Legislature to guard against “boxing people into men and women” categories. The advice was offered by Senator Carol Bellamy, a Brooklyn Democrat, who warmly welcomed the group of lobbyists embarked on the group's new “one to one” program, in which they plan to have a lobbyist in the home district of each of the 210 legislators. Several dozen members of the women's‐rights group visited the Capitol to press for changes in a dozen areas of the law, including a proposal that maternity benefits be supplied. under Workmen's Compensation. Senator Bellamy and her colleague, Senator Mary Anne Krupsak, Democrat of Canajoharie, warned against using the rhetoric of “separatism” in making their pitch to the Legislature. Assemblyman Rosemary R. Gunning, Republican of Brooklyn, said they should emphasize that the bills were concerned with matters of justice that benefit men as well as women. Asked whether they had experienced male‐chauvinist bias in the halls of the Capitol, Senator Krupsak said she was not sure. “I've never been able to tell whether it's because I'm a woman or a Democrat,” she said. Senator Bellamy said she had found no bias beyond the routine slurs and distinctions offered by male legislators in a spirit of old‐fashioned gallantry. “A kick in the ankle” was her reaction to such treatment when she first became interested in women's liberation, she said smiling, but now she deals with it by offering a “sickening smile” to offenders. Miss Gunning said she had met no mass of male bias. “I've never been known to sufler in silence,” she said. In predicting success for the lobbying effort, the women's group's spokesmen, Nola Claire and May Glazer, said that the group sought to end certain employment bars, abolish all remaining controls of abortion, end jury duty exemptions for women, repeal, strictures on the sale and use, of contraceptives, amend the rape‐law requirement that victims have a corroborating witness and mandate large companies to supply day‐care services. Among other developments in the state capital: PRISONER RIGHTS The Senate passed and sent to the Assembly a bill allowing for the release on his own recognizance of a defendant awaiting grand‐jury action on a misdemeanor charge if no action had been taken for 45 days after his arrest. The law currently provides for the release of a defendant charged with a felony who is in similar circumstances. MAYORAL RACE Republican county leaders met with Governor Rockefeller to discuss a possible fusion candidate for Mayor in the forthcoming New York City elections. While no decision was reached, they said that they would meet again in a week to discuss a possible choice. They said no meeting wtih Democrats was planned at this time and that the only possible candidate they ruled out was Mayor Lindsay. They noted that no firm decision had to be made for two weeks, so that nominating petitions could be circulated. BANKING BILLS The Senate passed and sent to the Assembly a bill requiring that insurance‐premium finance companies send certified or registered letters with return receipts requested notifying insured persons that their insurance was being canceled. The Senate passed another bill protecting depositors from unauthorized withdrawals from their savings, accounts by means of forged or unauthorized signatures. It would make the bank liable for any loss. PENSION BILL A measure that would change various temporary pension plans to permanent ones was in troduced by Senator John E. Flynn and Assemblyman Alvin Suchin, Westchester County Republican. They emphasized that the bill would not affect contrpversial proposals to restrict pension plans for future Government workers, but only end the Legislature's annual need to extend several existing plans, which would not be subject to the reform proposals. REGENTS WANT MORE AID The State Regents issued a lengthy report, urging a clearer definition of the Federal role in education and more aid. The report, a brochure to Federal officials, asserts that the first priority of Congress must be in developing Federal financing of elementary and secondary education."
Cooke Calls for Sacrifices During Lent,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/08/archives/cooke-calls-for-sacrifices-during-lent.html,"Cardinal Cooke, Archbishop of New York, urged Roman Catholics in an Ash Wednesday message yesterday to return to traditional fasting and self‐sacrifice this Lent as penance “for the horror of abortion and the other grave sins of selfishness in our society.” The Cardinal also pressed. ashes to the foreheads of worshipers at St. Patrick's Cathedral during a morning mass. Lines of worshipers extended out into the street during the lunch hours, and nearly 12,000 visited the cathedral during the day. Ash Wednesday marks the start of the 40‐day Lenten season, which symbolizes the 40 days that Christ spent in the desert preparing for his ministry. The season is followed by Easter Sunday, the feast of the Resurrection. Cardinal Cooke's message was read by the cathedral administrator, Msgr. James F. Rigney, and is to be read at all masses here Sunday. “Selfishness and the inordinate, craving for pleasure and personal satisfaction has led to such tragedies as abortion and drug abuse and alcoholism,” the message declared. “The Church pleads with us to reset the balance by our sacrificial lives.” Only by “voluntary sacrifices and prayers,” the Cardinal continued, will society be preserved “from God's awful wrath as the voices of the slain innocent unborn children cry to heaven for vengeance against our times and the new paganism of our culture.” Recommending fasting — that is, eating only lightly—on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, and abstinence from meat on Fridays during Lent, Cardinal Cooke said, “In a special way, self‐restraint and temperance in the use of alcohol would be a most worthy, offering to the Lord.” He also urged Catholics to attend mass daily during Lent. The church required abstinence from meat on all Fridays until 1966. The Lenten observance recommended by Cardinal Cooke was described as voluntary. The ashes distributed yesterday were a remainder of the belief that man is dust and will return to dust. The ashes were from the burned palms of the previous Lenten season and were blessed by the Cardinal."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/08/archives/parenthood-vs-marriage-books-of-the-times-good-parents-bad-mates.html,"THE SINGLE PARENT EXPERIENCE. By Carole Klein. 241 pages. Walker. $7.95.. Which Which is better for a child‐kine good parent or two bad ones? One bad parent or one bad and one good? Can two parents create more problems than one? What is the difference between an “unwed mother” and a single parent? Are only “ideal” marriages good models for children? How many married couples could inept the standards set by responsible adoption agencies? Why is it that some people can love only children and not adults? Is vulnerability a prerequisite to love? Can a deeply dependent person achieve true intimacy? Can a single father teach his daughter to be a woman, or a single mother make a man out of her son? Can a male or female homosexual bring, up a heterosexual child? Who has more difficulty establishing a sexual identity today—the homosexual or the heterosexual? These are the kinds of questions Carole Klein raises—and often answers—in “The Single Parent Experience.” They are not mere theoretical issues either, for the single parent may well be our next publicized and problematical minority. In the last 20 years, illegitimate births have increased front one‐fifth to one‐third of the new population, and a recent study showed that, in conservative Boston for example, 45 per cent of single mothers were keeping their children as against 10 per cent 10 years ago. Single mothers do not always give birth to their children; sometimes they adopt them. Single fathers may rear their natural children when circumstances warrant, and they too can now apply to adoption agencies. For the first time, avowed homosexuals are permitted to adopt children—although they may find themselves rather low on the priority list. “The Single Parent Experience” cites the case of one Man, not homosexual, who wanted a child so badly that he showed the typical symptoms, of false pregnancy. Goad Parents, Bad Mates Miss Klein is impatient with stereotypes, stanchly defending the unwed mother against the image of the promiscuous, lazy, “fallen woman.” She names Vanessa Redgrave and Bernadette Devlin as two unwed mothers who defy, this description. Nth. is the “independent” woman necessarily a “hard,” “tough” man‐hater. If single man or woman adopts a child, says the author, this should not be condemned as, a neurotic expression of misdirected love—for even if it sometimes begins that way, the new mother or father will often make an excellent adjustment. Some single parents see marriage as “the great substitute” for personal growth. Moved to metaphor, Miss Klein says that too many women tied on stoicism with aprons and wore it through countless washings of regret. Personal happiness is the current battle cry—even if it means down with cultural stability. For some single parents, the child—not marriage—is the meaning of this life. If it takes two to build a relationship, one of them can be a baby. Having, a child structures their lives, some say; it gives them a sense of limits, an antidote against an overdose of freedoth. The author has a few tart things to say about the quality of the counseling given to unwed mothers by social agencies. Instead of attempting to understand each woman's individual situation, some counselors apply standard bureaucratic rhetoric. Women asking for advice on how to support or look after their children might be pressed instead to Put them up for adoption. One woman solved her first‐year problem by taking her infant to work, with her. She was executive assistant to a department chairman in a large urban university, and with her employer's permission, she simply set up her baby's portable crib‐pen in one corner of her office. The Weekend Father For other single parents, some form of communal living is the answer if they are unable to afford help. Among the more difficult problems is sheer fatigue; the working parent is often too tired at night,. to be a resourceful mother or father. Sexual relationships, may be clandestine or open—and the child may'be confused by the absence of adult love in the parent's own life or overwhelmed by a succession of weekend “mothers” or “fathers.” A recent study of single parenthood showed that fathers and mothers had about the same emotional problems. However, while mothers were willing to have men sleep overnight, the author found that fathers sent their women home. Though Miss Klein does her best to be objective, one senses that she is pulling hard for the single parent, especially the woman. Most of the parents she quotes seem well above average in understanding and articulateness. She says very little, too, of what will happen to the structure of the single parent's life when the child reaches adolescence and demands its freedom—a time, unhappily, when mother or father may find it difficult to form new attachments. To meet this and other eventualities, the single parent is expected to be something of a sociological hero: “The tools for living today include the, ability to question rather than accept, to be adaptable, to experiment, to be ready to abandon old answers willingly, and to be alopen to new ones.” Miss Klein, who teaches creative writing, has a nice sense of irony, uncluttered by bitterness. She points out, for exam, ple, that abortion is now an “Establishment thing,” which turns counterculture kids against it. They would say she is right on, too, in her suggestion that a single mother or father tends to dissolve the inherent “pomposity” of the parental position. Her ultimate recommendation is a bit breathtaking, but it does have a fine, contemporary ring: “The only valid socialization, she says,‐“is to show people how to be flexible enough to enter the unknown unafraid.”"

Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/09/archives/how-badillo-lost-crucial-ndc-vote-rules-suspended.html,"At last week's designating convention of the New Democratic Coalition, Representative Herman Badillo's campaign manager declined to cast a vote that could have blocked the mayoral endorsement of Mr, Badillo's main opponent, Assemblyman Albert Blumenthal. A knife in the back? An oldfashioned political doublecross? “Nothing of the sort,” a friend of the Badillo aide said yesterday when the story became known. “It was his conscience. He just felt the N.D.C. shouldn't fail to have a candidate.” That is how it is with the coalition—the umbrella of the Democratic party's reform movement — whose political weight is being called into question by Badillo backers fighting to retain the allegiance of clubs that had voted initially to support him. Clubs are not bound to follow the convention line. Most of the 76 in the city are voting this week and next on what to do, with predictions of the percentage that will stick with the designation varying between the 95 per cent estimate of an N.D.C. official and the 65 per cent of a Badillo supporter. Rules Suspended The rules, limiting the number of ballots to six, had to be suspended to permit the seventh ballot on which Mr. Blumenthal passed the 60 per cent point and became the designee. A two‐thirds vote was required for the rules suspension, and the count came to precisely that‐130 to 65. But Mr. Badillo's campaign manager, Charles Kinsolving, a delegate, declined to vote, Had he done so there would have been no seventh ballot and the next day's newspaper accounts would have had to describe Mr. Blumenthal not as the official designee but as the leader in an inconclusive count. “Sure, my vote made the difference,” Mr. Kinsolving said yesterday. “But I thought it would be an inconsistent position—I had been calling for an endorsement for six weeks, when we thought we had it for Herman. How could I, by my vote, deny an endorsement?” His conscience soothed and his candidate beaten, Mr. Kin solving is now trying to persuade as many clubs as possible to defect from the convention's decision. Paul O'Dwyer, the grandfather figure of the reform Democrats and their designee this year for City Council President, argues that it would be a serious political mistake to discount the impact of the N.D.C. with its dedicated petition ‐ carriers, doorbell ringers and literature distributors. “In the first place,” he said the other day, “they carry nominating petitions. Their imiprimatur carries weight. I've seen it from both ends. In 1965 I made the mistake of thinking they didn't count, and I got slaughtered by Bill Ryan.” In that year Mr. O'Dwyer sought his party's nomination for Mayor.

Founded in opposition to the Tammany Hall leadership of Carmine G. De Sapio, it rose to real power in 1961 when Mayor Robert F. Wagner said he was a reformer, ran against his own record and the regulars who had helped him make it, and won. Mr. Wagner did not let the politicians who helped elect him dominate him. “The movement was practically dead by 1967,” Mr. O'Dwyer recalled. What saved it was the peace movement's fervor in the drive to “dump” President Lyndon B.

France and the Abortion Struggle,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/10/archives/france-and-the-abortion-struggle.html,"PARIS—Whatever the results of tomorrow's parliamentary elections, the new Assembly is expected to end the almost total ban on contraception and abortion which for decades has kept French women back in the Middle Ages. Because information is largely unavailable, less than 10 per cent of French women use contraceptives. Hence every year 350,000 to a million women undergo illegal abortions out of ten million women of child‐bearing age. As they cannot afford medically secure operations in England or. Holland, this is their only way out. France holds the unenviable record for tragedies resulting from kitchen‐table butchery. Estimates of the mortality rate run from 1 per cent to 3 per cent, not counting physical and psychological damage, traces of which remain with millions of women for their entire lives. Six months ago no one could have predicted the powerful wave of indignation which has recently rocked the country, brought about by the repeated refusals of the Government to face the problem. Throughout the 53‐year reign of one of the toughest antiabortion laws in the world, French courts have applied it unmercifully with the approval of political, medical and religious authorities. During the wartime Nazi occupation, a woman was actually condemned to death and guillotined. In the course of a normal year, dozens of trials wind up with prison sentences or heavy fines for the defendants, and if one of them is a doctor he is barred from practicing his profession. Public apathy to this situation was the result of press censorship on matters of abortion trials. The guilt‐ridden victims themselves did not dare speak up until the day in 1971 when 343 women signed a manifesto declaring they had had abortions and demanding reproductive freedom. The Government, intimidated by international approval of the women, did not react. Emotions receded, nothing changed. Other confessions appeared, petitions circulated, signatures piled, up. Still nothing changed. Suddenly, last October, the unexpected happened. In the industrial suburb of Bobigny, outside Paris, a routine trial had not‐so‐routine outcome. Marie‐Claire, 16 years old, had refused to bear the child fathered by a hoodlum who threatened her into submission. She was denounced and prosecuted. Backed by Choisir, France's leading pro‐abortion organization, the girl's mother decided to fight. Together, the women asserted their conviction that what they had done was right. They felt no remorse. They did not beg the court for pardon. They asked only for justice. It was not they who infringed upon the law, it was the law which infringed upon their most basic rights. Against all expectations, the judges acquitted the young woman. The struggle for reproductive freedom was launched. The accomplices in the case, brought to court during the weeks which followed, received immense popular support. Dozens of prominent people, feminists, Nobel Prize winners, physicians, actresses, politicians, all denounced the repressive law. They also demanded sex education in schools, the development of contraception and the opportunity for free abortion. Since the outset of the campaign, the political parties, anxious to coddle their Catholic constituents, have avoided committing themselves on their post‐election plans. But conservatives and liberals alike realize they will have to act soon. Hitherto, religious pressure groups and population growth maniacs who dream of an enormous France with 100 million inhabitants have called the shots. Unable to continue, they may now settle for a prettied up version of an old proposition authorizing abortion in a few cases only. But such watered‐down measure is unacceptable; a recent poll in France disclosed that 75 per cent of women favor free abortion. As soon as the new Government is formed, pro‐abortion groups will take serious action in order to obtain the suspension of current prosecutions, the postponement of scheduled trials and a general amnesty. If they do not succeed, new test cases will mobilize further support. For instance, JeanYves Legrand, 23, already the father of three infants, is accused of homicide. His fumbling efforts to terminate his wife's fourth pregnancy killed her. He will be tried in the spring. Dozens of people such as he, treated as criminals when they are in fact victims, will no longer let themselves be punished and remain silent. The believers in reproductive freedom all over the world can now point to the United States Supreme Court's historic decision as proof that the defense of human rights is at the basis of their action."
Mail to Davits and Buckley Dominated By Letters From the Foes of Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/10/archives/mail-to-javits-and-buckley-dominated-by-letters-from-the-foes-of.html,"WASHINGTON, March 9—What are New Yorkers writing about most to their Senators these days? Food prices? New York City problems? The answer is abortion, according to tabulations compiled separately for Senators Jacob K. Javits and James L. Buckley by their mailroom staffs. Of the 10, 301 letters sent to Mr. Javits, in February, 1,136 — the most on any subject—deal with the abortion issue, with most of the mail running against the recent Supreme Court decision liberalizing abortion laws in most of the country. Notes On Metropolitan Congressmen The mail to Mr. Buckley, a Conservative‐Republican, topped 2,000 letters a day on all subjects in the week ended March 3, according to an analysis prepared for the Senator by his mail‐room staff. Again, the abortion issue was the prime topic. The mail room did not say in its memorandum to the Senator how many letters had been received on the issue, although it told Mr. Buckley that the mail was running strongly in favor of his proposal for a Constitutional amendment to nullify the Supreme Court decision. “The opposition mail has almost stopped coming in,” the memo said. Senate aides said that some of the mail had obviously been the product of groups opposed to a liberalization of abortion laws, but that many of the letters appeared from concerned individuals as well. Another issue drawing considerable mail is whether the United States should provide aid to rebuild North Vietnam. The Buckley office said 98 per cent of its mail was strongly opposed to any kind of aid for North Vietnam and noted: “This mail does not represent any type of an organized campaign. The letters are for the most part handwritten and come from all over the state.” The Javits office said it had gotten 557 letters on the same subject—all against aid. Mr. Buckley has even gotten a few envelopes containing a total of 24 cents in pennies for President Nikon, apparently from persons who regard the President as a penny‐pincher, according to the mail room. • The time‐honored practice of Senators and Representatives announcing Federal grants for their states and districts was jolted this week when Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican of Connecticut, announced that his office would no longer “burden the public and the press with the grandiose declarations on contracts we did — or did not — secure.” Mr. Weicker added: “There is not one member of the Connecticut Congressional delegation, or any other delegation for that matter, who is not storming the bureaucratic bastions daily in an effort to secure vital Federal funds for his state or district. But the scurrying to release unworked‐on publicity blurbs, hand‐delivered by Government flacks, has only contributed to the credibility gap. “I only reserve the right to protect my political flank by reminding the people of Connecticut once a year that this is my policy.” There was no immediate indication that the 99 other Senators and the 435 Representatives would follow Mr. Weicker's lead. • The struggle over the Congressional seniority system will fade away soon, Representative John W. Wydler, Republican of Nassau County, said in his latest weekly newsletter, because a number of liberal Representatives who complain about the system are moving up the seniority ladder themselves and will eventually replace the Southerners and conservatives who now head a number of committees. “When the seniority system loses its Southern drawl,” Mr. Wydler said, “I predict many liberals will find it a very acceptable part of polite society.”"
The Supreme Court as Moral Arbiter,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/10/archives/the-supreme-court-as-moral-arbiter.html,"SYRACUSE, N. Y.—As a citizen of the United States, a Catholic priest and a teacher of law, I was not only shocked by the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision on abortion, but I felt oddly reduced by it. I shall try to explain why. Last year I conducted a seminar on problems in law and morals, touching, a bit loosely at times, on questions ranging from civil disobedience and privacy to genetic control and abortion. We spent almost a month on abortion and the law, however. Among the members of the seminar, positions on abortion covered the spectrum. For one thing, we had to consider the sources and quality of the different arguments concerning the morality of abortion and its implications for law. For another, we explored positions, such as Thomas Aquinas', that law should not attempt to restrain all immoral acts, but only the graver ones, since if law attempted to restrain all such acts it would be ineffective and the common good of the political community itself would he injured. Although abortion is considered by many to be a gravely immoral act, one had to add that in a pluralistic society faced by division and uncertainty over the morality of abortion, the law might have to reflect some compromise. That was last year, however. In the case of Roe v. Wade, decided on Jan. 22, the Supreme Court of the United States has declared (1) that a constitutional right of personal privacy entitles a woman to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion, (2) this right is a right to noninterference by the law during the first six months of pregnancy (except for some health regulations) because the state has no compelling interest in the life of the fetus during that time, and (3) after viability of the fetus (in the 24th to 28th week), the personal right to an abortion can be limited by the state's power to require that the abortion be necessary for the life health of the woman. In the Court's peculiar language, when the fetus has the capability of “meaningful life” outside the mother's womb, the state's interest in potential life is “compelling” enough to allow the state to “go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.” The health of the mother is so broadly defined in the companion case of Doe v. Bolton that it amounts to a judgment of a physician that an abortion is indicated. The judgment appears to be entrusted to any physician, including one who serves in an abortion clinic. The Supreme Court has decided the moral and legal issues I had thought so serious and so difficult for society. The decision comes in the guise of legal question, a constitutional right of privacy, but if the only question had been the privacy of the woman, we could all have gone home long ago. Those who believe that the state should prohibit or restrict abortions have insisted that a fetus is human life or at least potential human life and that, as with all human life, the law should respect and protect it. Just as the old “freedom of contract” turned the Constitution into barrier against social legislation, the new right of personal privacy bars laws protecting the fetus. The Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade made much of saying that the arguments against abortion were based upon “one theory of life,” but the Court has now erected into constitutional law its own theory of fetal life. The Court's theory, simply stated, is that fetal life, even to the moment of birth, has only the barest claim to protection (if any) when measured against a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. Since the seminar last year, my own position on abortion has included a deep concern for the life of the fetus, especially as the fetus advanced toward birth, and a conviction that our society must have moderate laws aimed at recognizing and protecting fetal life while not prohibiting all abortions. I expected to work for amendment of the New York law, which allowed abortions on demand up to twentyfour weeks. Even an eighteen‐week limit, I thought, would help to prevent live babies from being left to die after an abortion. I hoped and expected that the people of New York and the nation would react against the excesses of the pro‐abortion movement and of course I thought that I would have, as a citizen, the opportunity to try to convince my fellow Americans of this position. But the Supreme Court has spoken and these concerns for the protection of potential human life by the law can not be advanced anymore. I cannot hope that the law will vindicate them. Acting as moral arbiter for me and my fellow citizens, the Court has decided with precision the relative value of fetal life in an abortion and has foreclosed for us one of the profound issues of our time. That is why the decision is not only shocking; it reduces us. We are not children and the Supreme Court is not our moral arbiter. The Rev, Daniel A. Degnan, a member of the Jesuit order, is also a lawyer. He teaches law at Syracuse University."

The Presidential press secretary said Mr. Chou had agreed to commute the sentence of John T. Downey of the United States Central Intelligence Agency and allow him to leave China on Monday. Mr. Nixon had sent word that Mr. Downey's mother was critically ill. [Page 1, Columns 1–4.] Lieut. Gen. Tran Van Tra, chief of the Vietcong delegation to the Joint Military Commission, has disclosed that the Vietcong's Provisional Revolutionary Government and the Saigon Government have begun discussions about the joint cease‐fire body they are to form. The two‐party‐military commission would succeed the present commission, in which the South Vietnamese parties are joined by North Vietnam and the United States. [3:1–2.] The United States offered today to cooperate with the European Economic Community to help settle the most severe monetary crisis since the nineteen‐thirties and to “insure jointly an orderly exchange‐rate system.” A 500‐word communiqué issued after a nine‐hour, 15‐nation meeting indicated no substantive decisions were made, but some understandings were reached, implying American policy changes. [1:1–2.]. The terrorists who set off two large explosions in central London were described as members of a special squad sent within the last 10 days by the Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army. Police were cautious about identifying the bombers, but other authorities expressed the belief that the bombings were the work of the I.R.A. [1:3.] In Northern Ireland, the Protestant majority voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to keep Ulster in the United Kingdom, as 591,820 such votes were cast, Many of the Roman Catholic minority did not vote, and only 6,463 votes were in favor of union with the Irish Republic. [5:1.] National The White House served notice that President Nixon would veto a variety of bills pending in Congress and, as a last resort, would attempt to impound the funds necessary to implement them if his veto was overridden. The announcement was the latest in a series of challenges and counterchallenges between the President and Congress over the issue of final authority in Federal spending. [1:8.] President Nixon's re‐election committee said that it, had returned $655,000 to three big contributors, including $100,000 to Robert H. Allen, a Texas oilman who was the source of $89,000 that passed through a Mexican bank to the leader of the alleged political espionage operation against the Democratic national headquarters in Washington last June. [1:6–7.] The nation's unemployment rate increased slightly in February despite another big increase in total employment, according to the Department of Labor, which reported a rise in the jobless rate to 5.1 per cent from 5 per cent of the labor force. [1:5.] McGeorge Bundy, who was special assistant for national security affairs to President Kennedy and President Johnson and one of the architects of America's Vietnam war policy, testified at the Pentagon papers trial in Los Angeles that the public disclosure of three of the Pentagon documents had not damaged the national defense. [1:6–7.] Department of Justice officials said that they had “reached an agreement in principle” that could end the 11‐day standoff between Federal forces and dissident Indians who are occupying the community of Wounded Knee in South Dakota. [1:7.] Metropolitan Federal authorities announced the indictment of 19 reputed heroin traffickers, dealers and couriers and the further disruption of the “Latin‐American connection,” The ring was said to have smuggled more than two tons of heroin into this country. Among those arrested in several countries and the United States were five employes of Aerolineas Argentines, a steward for Venezuela's Avianca Airlines and a Cuban voodoo high priest from Washington Heights.

Mice once came from unwashed laundry,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/11/archives/humanly-possible-authors-query-mice-once-came-from-unwashed-laundry.html,"Time is long past when anybody could be equally at home in all branches of science. A scientist is perforce a specialist, because scientific knowledge has grown far beyond the capacity of even the most brilliant and retentive mind to absorb it. A specialist has his field of vision more and more restricted the narrower his field of specialization. He is often accused of knowing more and more about less and less. It is more accurate to say that he masters smaller and smaller fractions of the total store of knowledge in order to contribute to the growth of this total. The prevalence of specialists is relieved by mile generalists. A generalist is able to gain a broad overview, if not of science as a whole, then at least of some major field, without necessarily being himself an active researcher in any particular speciality. Jean Rostand is the venerable dean of biological generalists. “Humanly Possible” is the latest of several collections of his fascinating and informative essays on biology and its humanistic implications. Rostand is at his best viewing modern biology in the perspective of its history. Three of the seven essays deal with the problem of the origin of life. Remarkably enough, the proposed solutions of this problem have gone through almost a full circle. From Aristotle in the fourth century B.C. to Pouchet in the eighteen‐sixties, it was credited that while some organisms always come from parents similar to them, others arise “spontaneously” from various substances—fish from river silt, frogs from rotting matter, lice from “excremental humors,” mice from unwashed laundry, and (according to Avicenna around 1000 A.D.) even new races of men from human corpses washed ashore. The Italian Redi in 1668 dealt a blow to these tales by showing that no maggots arise in rotten meat if adult flies have no access to it to deposit their eggs. But soon thereafter the invention of microscopes led to the discovery of the hitherto unknown world of micro ‐ organisms. Must these arise only from parents of their own species? Three more centuries and the genius of Pasteur was needed to rule out spontaneous generation in micro‐organisms. Pouchet, Pasteur's valiant opponent, seemed to have evidence to the contrary, the sources of error in which were not too obvious. But after Pasteur the problem appeared to be resolved once and for all‐life comes only from life of the same species. Only during this Lysenkoist delirium in Russia, one Madam Lepeshinskaia claimed to have seen cells generated from noncellular materials. Yet the problem has reappeared in a new guise. Life must have arisen on earth, perhaps 3 billion or more years ago, from nonliving matter. Ingenious models of its origin under conditions that prevailed on earth long ago have been worked out by several eminent biochemists. More than that, some exobiologists, students of extraterrestrial life, believe that, given the above hypothetical conditions, the origin of life was not merely a possibility but a necessity, and not only on earth but in many places in the cosmos. And they speculate further that the extraterrestrial life must have evolved more‐or‐less similarly to the terrestrial one, hence rational beings analogous to men reside on planets in other solar systems and in other galaxies and are eager to communicate with us. Unfortunately, this delightfully romantic story may be quite devoid of substance. Some eminent scientists, such as Jacques Monod, think, that, before life actually arose on earth, the chance that it would arise was not much greater than zero. Exobiologists may yet prove to be sophisticated specialists on a nonexistent subject. Anyway, the problem of life's origin is far from solved. Rostand optimistically expects that it will be solved in a future not too distant. In other essays, Rostand presents arguments for his profound and uncompromising, conviction that the value of every human life is infinite. Of course, this conviction is based only in part on biology, chiefly on expertly and adroitly summarized evidence of genetic uniqueness and unrepeatability of every individual (with the exception of “identical” twins, who are never really identical for environmental reasons). Reasons of ethical and esthetic nature are not hidden but are given less emphasis. (The book has, after all, “A Biologist's Notes” in the title.) Rostand is an opponent of the death penalty (“because I feel, rightly or wrongly, that society should set an example of respect for life by ‘outlawing death,’ to quote Albert Camus”). He is sensitive to the problems posed by the progress of medical arts, which permit maintenance of vegetative life that persists for days and even years in the absence of all human attributes. Abortion extinguishes an incipient if not a really human life in the full meaning of the word “human.” However, fanaticism is entirely foreign to Rostand's intellectual make up; he recognizes that “in some cases a total, inalterable respect for human life can lead to an impasse or a contradiction, and that in certain circumstances it can even result in advocating conduct that would be contrary to the true interest of human life.” It is a pleasure to read these essays, with their unfailingly urbane, slightly old ‐ fashioned style and their admirable sense of moderation and good taste. Tidbits of humor and historical curiosities are sprinkled here and there but not in excess. Here is one of them: “This Digby was a curious man, well versed in sorcery. Having married an extraordinarily beautiful woman, Venetia Anastasia, he set about preserving her youth by putting her on a special diet consisting of young capons that had been fed on vipers. She died in the prime of life.” Rostand knows how to instruct, without being either boring, or condescending, or showing off his remarkable erudition. ■ Author's Query I am engaged in gathering information for a biography of the late Clarence Whitehill, perhaps America's greatest operatic baritone, who died in December, 1932. Apparently he taught singing during his later years, in New York, and if any of his pupils are still alive and would send me some information regarding him both as a man and a teacher it would be of great help to me. I should also be glad of any letters from those who heard him during his 20 years at the Met, and their impressions of him. FRANK F.

Legislature in 11th Week of Leisurely Pace,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/12/archives/legislature-in-11th-week-of-leisurely-pace-other-major-issues.html,"ALBANY, March 11— The Legislature enters the. 11th week of the 1973 session tomorrow after nearly three months during which it has acted on only one major issue —passage of a modified form of no‐fault automobile accident insurance. Compared with the pace of some past sessions, that record is above average, since the lawmakers have dealt fairly early with a major bill. But the pace is still a long way from the orderly deliberative process that the Republican majority leaders of both Houses they desire. News Analysis If the past is any precedent, resolution of the major bills pending here will again be acted on in the last days of the session in the annual Albany Walpurgisnacht compounded of long session days, calendars clotted with important bills, contentious debate, debate, fitful attempts to stifle the lawmakers' garrulity and charges that major bills are being enacted without sufficient study. The best educated guess at present foresees the end of the session around mid‐May, with a two‐week recess at Passover and Easter. Several attention ‐ getting issues have already been resolved by inaction. For instance a debate on repealing the state's liberalized abortion law has been averted by the recent decision in the United States Supreme Court that in effect guaranteed a wholesale repeal of most states' anti‐abortion laws. Originally slated for legislative action was the second passage of a constitutional amendment that would remove. from the State Constitution the limitations on gambling and permit the Legislature to determine what forms of gambling were allowable. The amendment passed easily last year but this year the leaders are having qualms at the prospect of a Nevada‐like system of casinos in the state if the amendment receives the necessary second passage and is approved by voters in November. Two reasons the gambling amendment appears doomed are the absence of its chief proponent, former Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges, who has retired, and the strong opposition of organized sports, which says it fears legalized gambling will open the door to widespread fixing of sports events. The session has been dominated by Governor Rockefeller's proposed bill providing for mandatory life sentences for pushers of hard drugs and no chance for plea bargaining or parole. Other Major Issues The Governor's bill now is in the Codes Committees of both houses, where it seems certain to undergo some changes. But it is also certain that Mr. Rockefeller has been in the vanguard of a hot issue and that tougher laws for drug traffickers will be enacted although they may not be as harsh as he recommends. Other major issues pending before the state's 210 lawmakers include the following: ¶Mr. Rockefeller has said that court reform was a major legislative goal this year. Others on the court‐reform bandwagon include Mayor Lindsay, who has his own plan. In addition, a special state commission has produced a voluminous study urging reform of the court system. So far, the Governor has not submitted his proposal and there are indications that meaningful restructuring of the state's court system might not get much beyond the discussion stage this year. ¶Mr. Rockefeller is eager to have the Adirondack Park land‐use plan enacted although there are attempts being made by legislators representing residents of the vast tract of unspoiled woods, streams and mountains to postpone action for another year. The Governor has proposed an $8.88‐billion budget for the state fiscal year beginning April 1. That proposal has been subjected to hearings and the fiscal committees of the Senate and the Assembly are scrutinizing it. Budgets normally engender considerable haranguing and lobbying but this year the reaction has been fairly tepid. That is because of an anticipated surplus of an as‐yet‐to‐beagreed‐upon amount and the fact that the threat of major cuts in programs is absent. ¶A special state commission has recommended the creation of a uniform pension plan for the state's eight retirement systems for public employes. The recommendation has been hotly and consistently assailed by dozen's of the state's leading union leaders, a fact that all but insures modification—if not postponement—of the commission plan. ¶In his annual message the Governor expressed some pique at the State Board of Regents, which sets educational policy for the state. He has proposed creating an inspector general as a watchdog over the education system—a move that has irked the Education Department and the Regents. But the Governor is expected to persuade the Legislature to go along with his plan. ¶Still awaited are the recommendations of the special cornmission that the Governor created to look into the future of horse racing in the state. The so‐called, Delafield Commission report has been delayed by disagreements among the nine members of the commission. One official who is keeping a constant watch for the report is Howard J. Samuels, the head of New York City's Offtrack Betting Corporation, who fears that a move is afoot to have the state take over all OTB operations. There are other issues, such as a possible proposed new charter for the City of New York, but there are indications that the dimensions of that task are great enough to warrant giving the special state commission assigned to the job more time. The Governor said recently that he hoped the commission would have legislation before the Legislature this session, but others, such as Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, Republican of Montauk, have said they were not averse to a time extension."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/13/archives/thinking-about-the-thinkable-books-of-the-times-response-to-a.html,"If the dozens of women who collaborated in writing this book are right—and it really impossible for a man to understand what it is like to be a woman—then probably shouldn't be reviewing “Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women,” by the Boston Women's Health Book Collective. But I am doing so anyway, for several reasons: first, because the book looked useful and I wanted an excuse to read it carefully, and second, because those members of the movement I respect have often argued that women's liberation means men's liberation, and it is an argument I am willing to try on. OUR BODIES, OURSELVES. A Book by and for Women. By the Boston Women's Health Book Collective. 276 pages. Illustrated. Simon & Schuster. $8.95 cloth; $2.95 paper. Besides, it really doesn't matter whether I like the book or not, because it has already been widely distributed and it is well known. You see, it all began back in the spring of 1969, when a group of women in their late 20's and early 30's (some married, some single) got together in Boston to form a discussion group. Initially, their talks were aimed at solving the “doctor problem” and venting their “frustration and anger” at “those doctors who were condescending, paternalistic, judgmental and noninformative.” But gradually the discussions evolved into consciousnessraising sessions, then into medical seminars, and finally into a project to write various papers to be distributed to the women's “sisters.” Response to a Stimulus At first the papers were simply mimeographed and passed around. Then, as demand for them grew, they were printed and bound together in an inexpensive edition published by the New England Free Press. Finally, when demand for the book began to strain the resources of the Free Press, it was decided to publish the book commercially. (Incidentally, the present edition is available “to clinics and other groups providing health‐counseling services, at a 70% discount,” provided 12 or more copies are ordered and “a document verifying health service status” is enclosed.) So the publication of “Our Bodies, Ourselves” is more a response than a stimulus, and it doesn't much matter whether male reviewers like it or not. But do I like it? you are still wondering. Let me duck the question a moment longer by saying that since the book was written collectively—with, for example, “A Boston gay collective” contributing the chapter on Lesbianism, “In Amerika They Call Us Dykes'; and several older women helping out on the chapter covering menopause—it was never expected that everyone would be pleased with all the contents, not even the women who put the book together. “Many women have spoken for themselves in this book,” the preface states, “though we in the collective do not agree with all that has been written. Some of us are even uncomfortable with part of the material. We have included it anyway, because we give more weight to accepting that we differ than to uneasiness.” I don't see how any sensible womaneven an antifeminist one—could fail to be enlightened by the book's lucidly informative chapters on “The Anatomy and Physiology of Reproduction and Sexuality,” on nutrition, exercise, venereal disease, childbearing and postpartum emotional problems; or even by the philosophy that informs them, to wit, that knowledge of one's body is essential to control of one's body, and that control of one's body is essential to living in contemporary America. (As you will see if you read the book, it's a more radical idea than it may sound.) On the other hand, I can imagine that some women — even halfway liberated ones may not agree with the book's extreme open‐mindedness on the questions of birth control and abortion, or its specific conclusion that “it is a myth that the infant will be psychologically damaged unless the mother is always present.” And to judge from her recent article in The New York Times Magazine: Betty Friedan will approve of the book's refreshing freedom from what she calls “pseudoradical infantalism,” but she will be disappointed by the somewhat vague and solipsistic rhetoric on “what it means to be a Lesbian in this society.” Much to Be Learned As for me, the male in the ointment: I have my quibbles. The book was written collectively, and collective writing is never very refreshing (the next time I come across the word “crucial,” I am going to wear the last of the enamel off my molars). I am still trying to dovetail all the talk about “living less in our heads” and responding “to our feelings” with the book's overriding message that women must know and think about their bodies in order to get control of their lives. (I'm sure there's a way to reconcile these two messages, but trying to find it has me climbing an epistemological wall.) But I learned a great deal from this book that I did not know before, or had somehow forgotten. And if the authors are correct in their belief that one of the major reasons why men oppress women is because “of the male fear and envy of the generative and sexual powers of women” —and I think they am—why then it will do no harm at all for men to read “Our Bodies, Ourselves” and expend a little rational thought on these powers. Nor will it do much harm for a male to review it."
CONTRACEPTIVE AIR FOLLOWS ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/15/archives/contraceptive-aid-follows-abortions.html,"Of the 7,299 women who received abortions last year at the 22d Street Center of Planned Parenthood of New York, 86 per cent accepted medically approved or prescribed birth‐control method afterward, the organization announced yesterday. In a report to the State Department of Health on results of a one‐year pilot contraception ‐ counseling program financed by the department through a $58,800 contract, the oragnization also reported that some of the remaining 14 per cent might have selected postabortion contraception. But since many of this group were out‐of‐state residents, the project had no positive evidence as to whether or not they began a contraceptive regimen, the report said. Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of the local Planned Parenthood organization, a non‐profit group, said that the percentage of abortion patients who selected an effective birth control method rose from 63 per cent in the first quarter of 1972 to 88 per cent in the last quarter. “We naturally hope that the percentage will continue to rise, since one of our main goals is to help prevent the need for repeat abortions among women who have already chosen to terminate an unwanted Pregnancy.” he said."
Plan to Speed Abortion Services Urged,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/15/archives/plan-to-speed-abortion-services-urged.html,"The president of the Rockefeller Foundation called upon government agencies and the public and private health sector yesterday to share the responsibility of making safe and humane abortions available to women throughout the country regardless of their ability to pay. Dr. John H. Knowles, speaking to a meeting here of the national advisory council of Planned Parenthood's Center for Family Planning Program Development emphasized the need for speedy cooperative action to carry out the recent Supreme Court decision giving women the right to end unwanted pregnancies. “Laissez‐faire may be in for soap and cars, but not for health services,” said Dr Knowles, who is the former director of Massachusetts General Hospital. “The free market has not provided accessible services to the poor.” He predicted that without swift action on the part of government and the health system, women who are poor, very young or from rural areas would be without access to safe abortion services “for years to come.” Among the steps he suggested are the following: ¶Coverage of abortion costs for single and married women by Medicaid and private health insurance whether the operation is done in a hospital or a free‐standing clinic. ¶The establishment of free or low‐cost pregnancy detection and abortion referral services throughout the country. ¶The development of medical standards that would cover abortions done outside of hospitals. ¶A public education campaign emphasizing the relative safety of early abortions and where they can be obtained. ¶Expansion of family planning services to minimize the need for abortions. Dr. Knowles said that, judging from past experience, the failure to set up adequate, lowcost abortion facilities would lead to the establishment of commercial agencies that might “gouge” patients and refer them to facilities of “uncertain” medical standards."

The decision to cancel the $170,000 project was made after Mr. Weinberger, his Under Secretary and his population affairs chief had a private viewing of the 60‐minute film, which devotes about four minutes to abortion, according to sources in the department and in private population groups. The decision was confirmed today by Louis M. Hellman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for population affairs, who expressed disappointment."
Jail Terms Deplete Ranks of Hell's Angels,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/18/archives/jail-terms-deplete-ranks-of-hells-angels-police-let-angels-in-girl.html,"OAKLAND, Calif., March 17 —The Hell's Angels, the motorcycle gang whose violence satisfying their appetites once spread terror in this state, have fallen on hard times. Where once a dozen or so them could take over streets of Rodeo, a little town on San Pablo Bay, after beatinga brace of policemen, today their leaders one by one going to jail. The latest to fall was Ralph Barger, 34 years old, a high school dropout who became famous tough guy, was invited to address high school civics classes, was hired to protect the stars at rock concerts, and became the “old man” of a green‐eyed blonde who once won a beauty contest. Yesterday, Barger was sentenced to a prison term on conviction of peddling drugs. He must serve 10 years before askfor parole. Drugs led to his downfall, and it appears that drugs have shattered the strength of the Hell's Angels. They used marijuana long before it became popular. Some of them used heroin, but it was not until the mid‐nineteen‐sixties that they moved headlong into the drug traffic as suppliers. Dozen in Prison Because of drugs, the money hunger that drug profits created in them and the violence that always was their trademark, the Angels have almost fallen apart. In the last year about a dozen of their leaders have gone to prison for long terms. “These are prominent members and their loss will be detrimental to the club,” said Don Whyte, the senior trial deputy district attorney here, who prosecuted Barger on the drug charge. Arrested many times before, Barger had escaped before with county jail sentences, even when he shot a man three times in the head. The major downfall for the Angel leadership has come through information exposed in two murder trials. Testimony in one of these produced a bizarre story that begins with two motorcycle riders from Georgia appearing on a Friday might in 1971 at the Richmond, Calif., Angel chapter headquarters, membership about 10. One of them wanted to join. The Angels began to tease them, and then assault them. Their beer and their coffee were laced with LSD. When they began to hallucinate, the Angels played crude tricks on their dazed minds. Found Dead on Bed One of the Georgians was a big man, Thomas Shull, 24 years old. When the Angels tired of teasing their visitors, the big man was not ready to stop. He began to lash out. The Angels tried to force sedatives down his throat, then hog‐tied him and tossed hint on a bed. A few minutes later someone noticed that he was dead. Orders were passed to kill the other man, Charlie Baker, 30, who was strangled. The bodies were taken in a car to Ukiah, where a former Angel owned a farm. There they were thrown down a well and covered with debris. About six months later, in January, 1972, William Pifer, known as “Whispering Bill” because his larynx had been removed in a cancer operation, began to talk about the Angels' crimes. None of the officials to whom Pifer tried to tell his story seemed to believe him. “People in law enforcement considered Pifer a criminal, not a witness,” said Thomas A. Watrous, a deputy district attorney in Contra Costa County. Mr. Watrous is the prosecutor in a case where Whispering Bill's story has been shown to jury by videotape recording. Pifer died of cancer March 4. The tape was made at a preliminary hearing last November. 3 Bodies in Well Finally Pifer went to a man he had known years before, Sgt. Frank Tiscareno of the Pittsburg, Calif., police. After some preliminary investigation, the authorities dug out the well the farm near Ukiah. They found two bodies of the men who rode out of Georgia on their Harley‐Davidsons. They also found the body of young woman. They have no idea who she was. William John Moran, 39, a truck driver, is on trial in Richmond on the charge of murder of Charlie Baker. The case probably will conclude next week. The man who owned the faith where the bodies were buried in the well is George Wethem. He had left the Hell's Angels, the authorities said, to live quietly on his farm. Mr. Whyte, the prosecutor here, said he was told by investigators that Wethern was once the main distributor of hallucinogenic, drugs in the East Bay area, while Barger, then president of the Oakland Angel chapter, was the main distributor of hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine. The second murder trial was concluded on Dec. 29, with Barger and three other Hell's Angels winning acquittals the charge that they murdered Servio Winston Agero, 29, a narcotics courier front Texas. Drug Dealer Angle Again the trial produced a series of horror stories. Even though Barger escaped a murder conviction, his certain conviction as a narcotics dealer was built into the murder trial. He and the three others were accused of killing Agero, in a dispute over the Texan's selling them worthless cocaine. Richard Ivaldi, 26, testified he saw Barger go into, a room where Agero was on a bed and heard the, “pop” of a gun. As the trial unfolded, the defense clouded Ivaldi's credibility by showing that he had told the police where to find a woman's body in a car trunk, and also that there were three bodies in his home. Then Barger testified. The defendant grew up in the streets of Oakland. He left high school in 1955, failing to finish the 10th grade. He said he enlisted in the Anny and was discharged a year later when it was found he was under age. He worked as a machine operator from 1960 to 1965, when he was dismissed because of extended absences. From then until now, he told the probation officer, he has had income from two film companies that he advised in making pictures about the Angels. He got a total of about $12,000. But a Federal indictment alleging tax evasion asserts he had $44,223 more income in 1967–69. Girl Was Codefendant His first wife died in 1967 of the effects of an illegal abortion. For the last three and a half years he has lived with Sharon Gruhlke, 23, who when she was 19 was named Maid of Livermore, a city to the east of Oakland. Miss Gruhlke was a codefendant in the drug trial where Barger was convicted, but the jury was unable to agree on her case. She is scheduled for retrial in April. In his murder case, Barger denied he had shot Agero. He said he was at home in bed with Miss Gruhlke when the killing occurred. He said that for at least five years, beginning in 1967, he had given tips to the Oakland police on'caches of weapons, narcotics, and explosives. He said he dealt with Sgt. Ted Hilliard of the Oakland police. Later Mr. Hilliard, now an investigator for the district attorney's office, testified, “Mr. Barger would load them in the back of my car—automatic rifles and dynamite, for example.” But Mr. Hilliard insisted that the police had not given the Angels protection in return for the tips. Admitted Drug Dealing In his direct examination, Barger said he had used drugs, and this opened the door for Mr. Whyte to ask on cross‐examination: “So you were a narcotics dealer, Mr. Barger?” “Yes, sir,” Barger replied, and when this December testimany was read to his jury in the narcotics trial in February, it was all over but the formalities. Barger first came to public notice in 1958 when five carloads of policemen were called to quell a riot where he suffered a head injury. He was then identified as president of the Hell's Angels. During the early nineteen‐sixties, newspaper accounts told of gun fights, of judges giving sentences that required young men to forswear further association with the Angels, of the Angel assault on Rodeo in 1961, eventually repelled by a strong show of police force. By 1964, Barger and Michael Walter called on an Oakland Tribune columnist and told him: “Our oath is allegience to the United States of America. If there should be trouble we would jump to enlist and fight. More than 90 per cent of our members are veterans. We don't want no slackers.” Police Let Angels In Walter was there in October, 1965, when the Oakland police stopped an antiwar parade from Berkeley at the city limits, and then stood aside so the Angels could come trough and attack the marchers. The Berkeley police arrested. Walter and some of the others, but the Angels broke a Berkeley police sergeant's leg first. In early 1965, the California attorney general's office issued a report denouncing the Angels as criminals, and late that year customs officials accused them of smuggling in drugs from Mexico through Tijuana. In December, 1969, Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones came West for an outdoor rock festival at Altamont speedway festival, attended by about 300,000 people. The Angels were in charge of security. A black youth who had a gun was killed. The Angel guards beat up many persons, including one of the performers. They sold drugs. Successor Convicted In 1970, Barger made a show of stepping down as Oakland Angel president, but within a few, months his successor had a 10‐year conviction for shooting at a bartender. Membership of the Oakland chapter is about 40, the authorities estimated. In January, 1972, Barger and four other Angels were arrested while driving through the Oakland hills. They had two bound and gagged men in the trunk. Barger faces trial on kidnapping charges from this incident. In prison, if he goes there, Barger will not lack for company. About a dozen Hell's Angels have been convicted in the last year At. San Quentin, the guards see them as leaders of “the bikers” clique.” Five or six of “the bikers” are Angels, and the others come from other motorcycle clubs. “They originally stay out of things,” said one prison official. “They provide a balance in the racial conflicts. When trouble starts with the Chicanos or the blacks, the Angels join up with the other whites. They're militantly white, you know.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/18/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-reporters-sourcesand-curbs-on-the-peoples.html,"To the Editor: Anyone who has been paying attention to the performance of the press in recent years has to be highly skeptical of its propaganda barrage pro claiming the dire need for legislation, so‐called “shield” laws, protecting reporters sources, frequently cited as “authoritative sources,” “official sources,” etc. It frequently turns out that these “sources” are something less than “authoritative” or “official.” For example, that great Pulitzer Prize winner Jack Anderson went on radio with the report that Senator Eagleton had a record of drunk‐driving arrests and, when questioned, said he had documentary proof of his allegation. Well, as everyone knows, he had no such proof and finally admitted the allegation was baseless. To make matters even worse, he admitted he rushed on the air with the story minus proof because it was a potential scoop and he wanted to get ahead of others. More recently Mr. Anderson implied that the diary of a man who pleaded guilty in the Watergate case had been initialed by officials high in the Nixon Administration when, in fact, the initials were those of F.B.I. agents made for identification purposes later in court. Now when a Pulitzer Prize winner puts on performances like that, what can one expect from the lesser mortals of the press who are seeking fame and fortune in the journalistic world? It a reporter can get away with refusing to disclose his sources, the temptation is obviously great to dream up some cock‐and‐bull story, for example, derogating President Nixon, a popular field of endeavor of the press these days, and attribute it to “authoritative sources.” Every day undisclosed sources are cited as authority for news stories of dubious ancestry that. ‐often are subsequently revealed as inaccurate. Recently, Vermont Royster, whose journalistic stature is attained by few, wrote in The Wall Street Journal, “The issue of the people's right to know is one which the news media, too, usually make much of, except when they're talking about ‘shield’ laws to give reporters the right to decide what the people have no right to know.” Right on, Mr. Royster! Let's keep the press reasonably honest by requiring reporters to reveal their sources. A. J. LAMBERTON Fort Lauderdale, Fla., March 10, 1973 To the Editor: Your editorial writers and columnists, particularly Tom Wicker, have recently been fighting the good fight for freedom of the press in this country against an Administration which quite obviously does not believe in or agree with at least some of the United States Constitution. The basic and fundamental reason for the writing of the Constitution in the first place was to create a government of divided, and therefore limited, powers. There is ample evidence that this Administration finds our system of checks and balances irksome in its effort to lead us “children” (as the President characterized us) to those heights of self‐reliance and docility approved by the Administration. But the Founding Fathers believed, and some of us still believe, that, complicated and cunibersome and often inefficient as it may be, selfgovernment is better than being governed by others. The trouble is that self‐governors—the sovereign people —must have the information on which to base sensible decisions. Only an informed electorate, can make a democracy work; only an informed electorate can sustain a republican form of government for very long. That is the reason that freedom of the press is guaranteed absolutely in the First Amendment—because it is of first importance to the survival of the personal freedom of all the people. It is essential to the continued life of any democratic republic or republican democracy. It is because the liberty of each of us Is at stake that this current war of the Administration against newsmen (papers, television and radio, no matter which) is really a war by the Nixon Administration (whether it fully realizes it or not)—a war by it against the American people. Somehow, it seems to me that The Times and other media have missed making that point clear in defending the press's rights. The press has these absolute rights only because the public absolutely needs an absolutely free press to assure its own continued freedom. R. W. VAN DE VELDE Princeton, N. J., March 1, 1973 The writer is a professor in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International, Affairs at Princeton University. Demographers' ‘Disservice’ To the Editor: The recent disclosure of a shrinking birth rate to well below replacement levels has taken no one by surprise except perhaps the demographers. Improved and more widely accessible contraceptive methods, liberalized abortion laws, the increased number of working women, further population concentration in urban areas, drop in the rate of first marriages, economic dislocation resulting from inflation, plus a whole complex of heightened expectations of personal fulfillment fueled by various liberation and libertarian movements—could have no other possible effect. Nor should the demographers have been taken so completely off guard if they read the daily newspapers. News reports from West Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland, Rumania indicate a birth‐rate decline to record lows. Demographers have been telling us in no uncertain terms that, unless the brakes are immediately applied to population growth we shall all be packed like sardines in a small can by the year 2000. But why bother to take demographers seriously about their prediction of events in some distant future when they seem to be unable to predict or even to assess events right under their very noses? If demographers had expressed the theory of exponential population growth as a more or less reasonable hypothesis awaiting factual corroboration, instead of as an absolute truth, they might have spared themselves the embarrassment of being overtaken by the facts. Demographers have done themselves as well as the entire socialscience community a grave disservice by calling into doubt the capacity of the social scientist to say anything intelligent about the future. JOSEPH ROSENBLOOM Piscataway, N. J., March 5, 1973 Thailand Role in SEATO To the Editor: In C. L. Sulzberger's March 11 column “New Look, Not New Reality,” the columnist dealt with Australia's foreign policies of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, particularly on such collective defense arrangements as SEATO. He wrote that the Prime Minister insisted that SEATO would not “subvert” the Paris 1973 Agreements on Vietnam. Nor would the Prime Minister “allow Thailand to use the alliance in any way against China.” I do not know whether the statement concerning Thailand was actually made by the Australian Prime Minister or was merely Mr. Sulzberger's interpretation of the Austral. ian position. Be that as it may, I am obliged to state categorically that it is not the intention: or the policy of the Government of Thailand to attempt to use SEATO in any way against China. In fact, recent moves and policy statements of my Government have already indicated the contrary. I am, therefore, writing this letter to dispel whatever apprehensions may be caused by Mr. Sulzberger's article. ANAND PANYARACHUN Ambassador from Thailand Washington, March 12, 1973 U.N. and the Environment To the Editor: Your excellent March 4 editorial “Protecting Wildlife,” lauding the successful negotiations in Washington that led to an international convention to protect endangered wildlife and plants, did fail to point out one of the most significant aspects of the agreement. The eighty participating countries asked the new United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to provide. the secretariat services for the convention. This, in effect, means that the United Nations will monitor and report on how the pact is being implemented. UNEP will also undertake scientific and technical studies designed to make the convention effective and to request information from governments and, most important, it will have the responsibility to advise goveinments when the convention is not being implemented effectively. All this puts a lot of clout into the hands of UNEP's executive director, Mauride Strong, and highlights the growing leadership of the United Nations in the global struggle to preserve and enhance the environment. The convention itself is a result of the historic United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm last June, which, among its many recommendations, called on all nations to safeguard “the natural resources of the earth, including the air, water, land, flora and, fauna . . . for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning or management.” Those of us who see the United Nations as the only international institution capable of coordinating a global approach to environmental problems are encouraged by the fact that the signatories to the convention—including the United States—also see the United Nations in this light. At a time when there is a tendency in this country to downgrade the United Nations as an ineffective debating society, it is heartening that our country turns to the United Nations for support in an area that is of vital concern to us all. PORTER MCKEEVER President, U.N. Assn, of the U.S. New York, March 8, 1973 Repression in Belgrade To the Editor: In February 1971 the professors of the Law School of the University of Belgrade held a faculty meeting to discuss proposed amendments to the federal Constitution of Yugoslavia, aimed at increasing the powers of the member states. At that meeting, when asked for his opinion by the federal and local public authorities, Prof. Mihailo Djuric, a Serbian member of the group of social theorists who publish the journal Praxis, warned of the dangers of excessive decentralization for Yugoslav unity. He gave as an example of those dangers the creation of a “nationalities problem” within the quasi‐independent member states and pointed out that since 40 per cent of the Serbs live outside Serbia, this problem would be particularly acute for them. As few months later, the crisis in Croatia made Marshal Tito aware of the dangers of ethnic separatism. And yet, shortly after the arrests at various personalities charged with Croat nationalism, Professor Djuric, in the summer of 1972, was indicted on the sole basis of the remarks he had made more than a year before at the faculty meeting. He was accused of “propaganda hostile to Yugoslav unity” and “Serbian nationalism” and condemned to two years in jail. Two issues of Praxis and Philosophia, the journal of Yugoslav philosophers, which tried to defend Professor Djuric or to publish the text of his own defense, were banned. In January 1973 the Supreme Court of Serbia reduced the sentence to nine months, Professor Djuric is now in jail. He is allowed neither visitors nor books. Professor Djuric, who has a distinguished record both as a partisan fighter in World War II and as a scholar of political and social philosophy, has never publicly criticized the Yugoslav regime. Those of us who over the years have admired the efforts of the Yugoslav people and Government to build an original, humane and independent form of socialism in their country are deeply disturbed by such a lapse into repressiveness, such a violation of free speech and elementary academic freedom. Despite the mass of injustices in this world, the time has not come when we must condone through silence or indifference an injury to the freedom and dignity of any one man. STANLEY HOFFMANN Professor of Government, Harvard NOAM CHOMSKY Professor of Linguistics, M.I.T. JOHN KENNETH GALB1RAITH Professor of Ecoriomics, Harvard Cambridge, Mass., March 9, 1973 The letter was also signed by six other scholars, from Harvard and Boston Universities. Aid to Hanoi To the Editor: The recent renunciation and denunciation of aid to Hanoi by American liberals, many of whom sought peace at any price, is suggestive of the Franco‐Algerian conflict and its appraisal by many leading North. African intellectuals. According to the latter, the style of French involvement in Algeria was held as morally objectionable by the French left wing; however, they were more concerned with their own society's moral fabric than with the essentials of Algerian pacification.

William Benton Dies Here at 72; Leader in Politics and Education,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/william-benton-dies-here-at-72-leader-in-politics-and-education.html,"Former Senator William Benton of Connecticut, publisher of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and onetime Assistant Secretary of State, died early yesterday in his sleep in his apartment at the Waldorf Towers Hotel. He would have been 73 years old on April 1. His home was in Southport, Conn. There will be a memorial service at 3:30 P.M. on Wednesday at Trinity Church (Episcopal) in Southport. Mr. Benton had been released from Lenox Hill Hospital on Feb. 26 after recovering from pneumonia. A man who never seemed to operate at less than full tilt, WilLiam Burnett Benton crammed at least five careers into his lifetime. He was, at various times, an advertising executive, a university vice president, a public servant and Senator and the head of a vast publishing empire. In all these careers, except politics, he wielded the Midas touch. One example of Mr. Benton's business acumen was the Muzak Corporation, which he picked up in an idle moment in 1939–40, when he was still with the University of Chicago. After expanding the company's operations and taking several millions out of it in dividends, he sold it in 1957 for $4.35‐ million. But despite his undoubted feel for the marketplace, Mr. Benton preferred to regard himself (and to be regarded) as a serious and dedicated educator and statesman. In this respect he was chairman of the company that published and sold the Encyclopaedia Britannica, from which he and his family made a great deal of money, much of it given to the William Benton Foundation, At the same time the company enriched the University of Chicago, a contractual beneficiary, by more than $25‐million in 25 years. A friend and business partner was astonished by the ease with which Mr. Benton made money, remarking that he “completely lacks the acquisitive instinct” and adding: “You never saw a businessman spend less time thinking about, money.” Another Viewpoint Another associate of 20 years disagreed, saying: “It's like a fellow playing 40 games of chess simultaneously. You could say you never saw a fellow spend so little time on a game of chess. But that wouldn't be the whole story.” In politics, which engaged Mr. Benton from 1945, he was a liberal Democrat, whose record as Senator from Connecticut was highlighted by opposition to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican and anti‐Communist crusader. In 1951, when Mr. McCarthy was at the apogee of his influence, Mr. Benton introduced a resolution that, in effect, denounced his colleague as a liar and a thief and as unworthy to sit in the Senate. Hearings on this resolution led ultimately to Mr. McCarthy's censure in 1954, but by that time Mr. Benton was out of the Senate, having been defeated at the polls in 1952. Mr. McCarthy's enmity was generally credited with helping in the defeat. He tried several times thereafter for office, but, as one biographer put it, he was “never really one of the boys.” Mr. Benton, it was said, “simply does not react” to a person and an ambiance, and could rarely bring himself to utter a flattery. Less kinflly observers said that he was such a fountain of ideas that he did not listen to the notions of others and was inclined moreover to be vainglorious. Son of a Clergyman Mr. Benton's background was religious and educational. Born April 1, 1900, in Minneapolis, he was the son of Charles William Benton, a Congregationalist clergyman and college professor, and the former Elma Hixson, a county school superintendent, His father died when he was 13, and his mother took the family to Montana to clear ground for a homestead. Bill Benton entered Yale on his second attempt and graduated in 1921. He worked his way through as a high‐stake auction bridge player. While denying reports that he cleared $25,000 a year, he told a friend that “it's a demonstrable fact that for 10 years I was one of the 10 or 20 best card players in the world,” On graduation he turned down a Rhodes Scholarship for a job as an advertising copywriter. This horrified his mother, who wrote her son, If you won't go into a respectable profession, can't you at least be a lawyer?” In advertising, he rose to become assistant general manner of Albert Lasker's Lord & Thomas agency in Chicago. He was earning $25,000 a year when he left in 1929 to join Chester Bowles in forming Benton & Bowles with a capital of $18,000. This agency, New York‐based, attained annual gross billings of $18‐million by 1935, of which Mr, Benton's share was $250,000—a huge sum in the Depression. Pioneering to market research and the use of radio as an advertising medium, Mr. Benton was in part responsible for the Maxwell House “Showboat,” the Palmolive “Beauty Box,” “Gang Busters” and Fred Allen's “Town Hall Tonight.” He has been credited with introducing the studio audience and signs to direct it to applaud, as well as commercials with sound effects. “Up to then, you'd always had a commercial announcement, somebody stopping the show and talking, as though he were reading from a magazine,” Mr. Benton recalled. “I staged commercials, yo tt could hear the spoons, people ‐clinking cups of coffee, everything acted out. It was revolutionary; it was like the first girl standing on her head on the back of a horse.” It was Mr. Benton, impressed with the local “Amos ‘n’ Andy” comic show in Chicago in 1929, who initiated its sponsorship on a national network by Pepsodent that made the show's characters, played by Freeman Gosden and the late Charles Correll, household words. Mr. Benton had determined to quit advertising when he was 35, and in 1935, he did, having by that time made $1‐million. Almost immediately, however, Robert M. Hutchins, his Yale classmate and president of the University of Chicago, persuaded him to become a vice president of the school. He held that post from 1937 to 1945 and helped the university pioneer in educational radio and educational movies. His radio program, “The University of Chicago Round Table,” won several awards as an adult education show. With characteristic self‐regard, Mr. Benton appeared on the show, talking about the common man, censorship, cartels, foreign relations and other topics on which he was able to brief himself with remarkable thoroughness. ‘Cooking Up Things’ At Chicago, Mr. Benton was, in effect, advertising a university. “Bill was what an engineering concern would call research and development,” Mr. Hutchins said. “We worked on cooking up things, all kinds of measures, some of them successful, some of them abortions.” One of his greatest successes turned out to be the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which had been bought from its British owners after World War I by Sears, Roebeuck & Co. In 1943 the mail‐order house wanted to get rid of the publication and offered it to the university. Mr. Benton put up $100,000 in working capital for the acquisition and gave the school a beneficiary interest in the profits. The salesmanship methods that Mr: Benton employed over the years to push the encyclopedia and its associated enterprises — chiefly classroom films, a yearbook, a junior encyclopedia, an atlas and a dictionary—have been much criticized as “hard sell.” But there has been little question that they produced results. Nevertheless, in the judgment of a number of experts, the informational quality of the Britannica was greatly diluted under Mr. Benton's management. And at least one editor resigned in a huff over the volumes' contents. Mr. Benton not only defended the Britannica, but also expanded its related business by publishing the 54‐volume “Great Books of the Western World” series and a companion 10‐volurne set called “Gateway'to the Great Books.” In 1964 the Bri tannica company acquired the G. & C. Merriam Company, which publishes Webster's Dictionary. Administering his publishing realm, Mr. Benton was accustomed to flying 75,000 miles a year to ginger up his underlings and to dictating up to 8,000 words a day of ideas and suggestions for his aides to execute. Recipients of these memos were amazed (and sometimes numbed) by their author's fecundity and circumlocutions. In 1971, in a joint venture with the Tokyo Broadcasting System, Mr. Benton began publishing an international encyclopedia in Japanese. He edged into public service in 1939 as an adviser to Nelson A. Rockefeller, then Coordinator of Inter‐American” Affairs. Out of this, and an interest in economics as a founder of the Committee for Economic Development, came his appointment in 1945 as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. As Assistant Secretary, his post for two years, he organized the Voice of America broadcasts and was active in the establishment of UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. During the Johnson Administration he was chief United States member of the UNESCO executive board with the rank of Ambassador. He served last year on the educational platform committee at the Democratic convention in Miami. Appointed by Bowles Mr. Benton became a Senator by courtesy of his old business partner, Chester Bowles, who was Governor of Connecticut in 1949. Mr. Bowles appointed him to fill a vacancy, and then he won an election in 1950 for the rest of the term. His Senate record included a plea for a Fair Employment Practices Commission and a fight against the McCarran Immigration Act as restrictive of the people of eastern and southern Europe. He voted for the legislation, howeverl when his appeals against it proved futile. Out of office after 1952, he was identified with the Adlai E. Stevenson, wing of the Democratic party and campaigned for Mr. Stevenson in 1956 and supported him again in 1960. The two were warm friends, and Mr. Stevenson was a frequent guest at Mr. Benton's home in Southport. From his student days, when he was editor of The Yale Record, Mr. Benton was interested in art and in his friend Reginald Marsh in particular. By 1954, when Mr. Marsh died, Mr. Benton had collected hundreds of his paintings, which centered on the vulgarities and vagaries of American life. Marsh, who has come to be recognized as a major artist, forms the richest part of Mr. Benton's collection, which also includes works by Ivan Albright, Jack Levine, Bellows, Hassam and Kuniyoshi. In 1972 the University of Connecticut named the William Benton Museum of Art in Mr. Benton's honor. Later that year he gave his collection of Albright's medical sketches to the University of Chicago Medical School. In the same year he was named Chubb Fellow at Yale. Mr. Benton married Helen Hemingway, a Connecticut schoolteacher, in 1928. Also surviving are two sons, Charles1 and John; two daughters, Mrs. Helen Boley and Louise, and eight grandchildren."
Abortion Clinics in City Face Rising Competition,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/abortion-clinics-in-city-face-rising-competition-abortion-clinics.html,"One of Manhattan's 12 nonhospital abortion clinics, geared to a capacity of 750 patients a week, is down to an average of 380. “If we go below 300, they've got us in trouble financially,” a spokesman said. Another such clinic, which has drawn 85 per cent of its patients from out of state, has just cut its $150 standard price to $125 for local women, who do not have to be shepherded from and back to airports. There are reports that some competitors are offering $100 or even $75 group rates to activist women's organizations. A Queens clinic opens only three days a week because it is doing barely a third of its capacity of 100 abortions a day, but it does 80 two‐ minute menstrual extractions a week at $50 each, although an administrator says, “We're just beginning in this, procedure compared with some clinics.” And personnel from a fourth clinic, originally based in Westchester, have set up a management corporation—under a conglomerate called Tender Care, Inc.—to manage locally staffed “nonprofit comprehensive women's medical centers” in other states for a percentage of the gross earnings. Abortion clinics, probably the city's fastest‐growing business since the 1970 liberalization of the state abortion law, are now worrying about their financial future in the wake of the decision by the United States Supreme Court last January that made abortions legally obtainable in other states as well as a possible increase in those performed in doctor's offices in the city. In the face of increased competition many clinics are exploring new techniques and health services, including “colonizing” other states where such abortion facilities have previously been illegal. The City Department of Health lists 21 free‐standing abortion clinics, including, three each in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Four are nonprofit. Several more are in Westchester, Rockland, Nassau and other nearby counties. The Supreme Court, making abortion a matter between a woman and her physician in the first three months of pregnancy, limited the power to “regulate the abortion procedure” to the months after that first trimester. The decision punched holes in Article 42 of the city's Health Code, including the ban on abortions performed in doctors' offices, according to most legal opinions' obtained thus far by the Board of Health. Peril Cited “I hope we don't have a hundred women killed in doctors' offices before we can test what the decision really means,” said Dr. Jean Pakter, director of the Bureau of Maternity Services and Family Planning, which administers Article 42. Adopted under the state's 1970 abortion law, Article 42 provided that first‐trimester abortions could be performed in clinics as well as hospitals —but under requirements that disqualified doctors' offices almost categorically because they were not that fully equipped and staffed. Article 42 also required that the doctor in charge be a qualified obstetrician or surgeon. “There's nothing now but professional self‐discipline to keep doctors who aren't OB's or surgeons from doing first‐trimester abortions in their offices,” said Dr. Morton A. Schiffer, chairman of the Health Department's advisory committee on obstetrics and gynecology. “And if they do them, we won't be able to keep up our standards.” Dr. Schiffer's committee is revising Article 42, including “recommended guidelines” for abortions in the first three months. He and Dr. Pakter expressed cautious optiinism, echoing the widely expressed belief that “doctors are not flocking to do abortions because of the profession's basic conservation” — a reason also frequently given for the “foot‐dragging” by doctors in many states in setting up abortion services. Although there are plans in some states to establish abortion cliriics—both commercial and nonprofit—no new clinics are known to have opened. Some out‐ofstate hospitals that did not perform abortions have now begun to do them, but generally on, a small scale. No state legislature has yet amended its abortion law to conform to the Supreme Court decision, although an attorney general or a local court has declared abortion laws invalid in more than a dozen states. And abortionreferral services across the country continue sending patients to clinics in New York. The situation here, most specifically for the Health Department, reflects what one obstetrician called “the regrettable ‘Catch‐22’ aspect” of the Supreme Court decision. “In its ban on regulating first‐trimester abortion, the court cited “the now‐established medical fact' of safety during this period,” said Dr. Bernard Nathanson, former medical director of Women's Services, Inc., a large non profit clinic now known as the Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health, Inc. “Everybody knows this ‘medical fact’ was ‘established’ here and that the court relied on the data, experience and abortion‐safety record of New York City—which, ironically, was based on strict regulation,” Dr. Nathanson said. “If the Right‐to‐Life People and other antiabortionists can come forward in the future and say, ‘Look, in the absence of regulation we haven't got first‐trimester safety—we've got a high mortality rate,’ then this thing could be reappealable right, back to the Supreme. Court.” Dr. Nathanson noted, along with others, that the future might have been clarified more by a decision in which the court would have said, in effect, “We're legal men, not medical men.” Certificate Required The Health Department, citing the court's reliance on New York statistics, has notified clinics, hospitals and doctors that it will continue, to require a certificate of termination of pregnancy. “Our function of collecting information is implied in the Supreme Court decision,” Michael Blumenfeld, deputy administrator of the Health Services Administration, asserted. Pending a decision by a lower court on the appeal of a lawsuit seeking anonymity for a woman, the certificate still must carry the name of the woman whose pregnancy is being terminated. Reports differ on how much—or even whether—nationwide legal abortion has slowed the stream of out‐of‐state‐women, who last year had more than 60 per cent of the 118,000 abortions that were performed here. The major proportion of those pregnant three months or less patronized nonhospital clinics, generating what has been described as “cut throat competition” and “virtual kidnapping at airports. “A lot of clinics are scared stiff—some talk about pooling facilities to meet their colossal overheads, esspecially rents,” said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, who recently completed a report for the New York County Medical Society on “ideal” abortion services. “The days are doomed for doctors who made a million dollars or More, doing 50 or 60 abortions per four‐or‐five‐day week in a clinic.” “A lot of clinic people are hanging on to their ricebowls so hard they're clutching them all out of shape,” said Merle Goldberg, director of the National Women's Health Coalition. Her opinion that “the single‐procedure clinics will not survive” drew hardly any dissent. Many clinics, commercial as well as nonprofit, insisted that, beyond the short‐term ujiheaval, they would welcome “putting outof‐state abortions into perspective as we move into the whole field of ‘well‐woman’ medical services that we should be offering local women,” as it Was put by Dr. Robert Landesman, medical director of Women's Services. Most observers thought the future was more dubious for the commercial clinics than for the nonprofit ones. But even for nonprofit clinics, “an unfortunate by‐product of a welcome court decision” was foreseen by the Rev. Howard R. Moody of the Clergy Consultation Service, which operates a nationwide abortion referral service. “Unless clinics offer new services, it will be difficult if not impossible to go on providing abortions on a sliding scale as low as $25 for poor women, who, in a sense,” he said, “have been subsidized by the woman from Iowa, for example, who comes here and pays the full rate.” Commercial as well as nonprofit clinics plan to expand their contraceptive services beyond the counseling they have been required to offer abortion patients. They are also exploring genetic, fertility, sexuality and menopause counseling; sterilization, diagnostic procedures, Lamaze preparation for childbirth and other prenatal and postnatal care, among other possibilities. Perhaps the most controversial new service is the technique of vacuum aspiration called menstrual or endometrial extraction or miniabortion, done between the fifth and the 10th (in some clinics the 17th) day after a missed period. “Endometrial extraction is going to effect the abortion business in New York as much as the Supreme Court decision, as clinics adapt to a clientele of local women who can easily come in before they need a full abortion,” said H. A. Cooper, administrator of T.L.C. Women's Services in Long Island City (which is not connected with Tender Care, Inc.) Dr. Landesman called the early aspiration “the style of the future” and “a good office procedure that is spreading like wildfire—we had 30 scheduled last night. Dr. Schiffer called it “a less formidable procedure with a lot of potential,” but said that “we need some good solid statistics—the consumer needs more to go on than her own demand.” Dr. Milton Dannon, medical director of Park Med Associates, said he “just can't see doing menstrual extraction” because in “at least a dozen cases where it had been done elsewhere, we had to do, a full abortion because a pregnancy was missed or do a completion because of severe cramps.” Before the Supreme Court decision, the Health Department pronounced vacuum aspiration “an abortion procedure if the woman is pregnant and an unnecessary procedure if she is not” and its proponents agree that it should be done with the same laboratory tests and followup visit as an abortion. Planned Parenthood of New York, which operates two nonprofit clinics here, “will undertake within 30 days a study of early aspiretion involving 200 to 300 patients before deciding whether to advertise it as a routine service or make it a medical option for decision by a doctor,” according to Alfred E. Moran, director of Planned Parenthood. Fee Drop Predicted Two Clinic directors predicted that the standard abortion price would drop to $100 within a year because of competition, and some persons suggested that “eventually” it would level off near $50, or not much more than the price for miniabortion. However, Mr. Moran said he was “not at all convinced” that either a commercial clinic or‐ physician doing office abortions would find it easy “to get the fee below $125 without loading on extra charges,” considering the costs of necessary laboratory work and other important procedures. He noted that the Planned Parenthood clinics' lowest price of $2 on a sliding scale was offset by a high of $145. Mr. Moran said, however, that the two clinics paid $33 an hour, to physicians, “who see maybe 2.5 to 3 patients an hour” and that “we no longer have trouble recruiting obstetrician‐gynecologists. —we have a waiting list.”"
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"MONDAY, MARCH 19, 1973 International President Lon Nol of Cambodia, acting under the state of emergency and siege declared on Saturday, when he escaped an apparent attempt on his life, ordered a series of stern measures yesterday. He suspended the publication of all newspapers and periodicals, except those published by the Government. He put under house arrest a number of members of the former royal family, and also ordered all striking teachers to resume work. [Page 1, Column 4.] There are about 207,000 more people on earth today than yesterday, and by the end of the week there will be 1.5 million more. Population growth goes on unchecked and despite the most vigorous attempts to reverse the trend, there are more desperately poor people than ever. Their numbers, more than anything else, have thwarted development efforts, according to the second of a series of articles on the impact of development programs in Southern Asia. [1:1–3.] The Ford Foundation has reviewed its $50‐million‐a‐year program of assistance to poorer countries and has decided to continue the assistance for the next decade, the foundation's annual report said. [2:4–6.] The dollar was surprisingly strong in heavy trading this morning on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market, the first major market to reopen after the two‐week suspension. The dollar's value opened at 262 yen, and rose to 264 yen in spot trading. [1:1–3.] National Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr., Democrat of North Carolina, chairman of a special Senate committee investigating the Watergate political espionage case, said that White House aides invoking executive privilege to keep from testifying before the committee should be found in contempt of Congress. If the aides refused to answer his committee's subpoenas, he said he would recommend to the Senate that it “pass a resolution declaring that the man is in contempt of the Senate and request a prosecution.” [1:6–7.] In a move certain to provoke controversy in legal circles, President Nixon will ask Congress to abolish insanity as a defense against murder and related Federal crimes. Under legislation the White House will submit within the next few days, an accused criminal will no longer be able to avoid conviction by proving that he was insane when the crime was committed.” This defense has been recognized, under varying definitions, for more than a century. [1:6–7.] The Nixon Administration's current and proposed cutbacks in social services, coupled. with rising doubts about the distribution and efficacy of revenue‐sharing funds, have generated confusion and suspicion in the South, where nearly half the nation's poor and blacks live. [1:5–7.] “Tenant power” is increasingly being proclaimed across the country as the tenants' rights movement slowly spreads from its more familiar setting among New York City apartment dwellers. From Boston to Berkeley —and perhaps most strikingly in New Jersey—people who pay rent for shelter have been banding together for action aimed at landlords and public officials. [27:1–8.] William Benton, who was Democratic Senator of Connecticut from 1949 to 1952 and who also had widely diversified and lucrative business careers, died in his sleep in his Waldorf Towers apartment in New York, [1:7–8.] Metropolitan Governor Rockefeller endorsed former Mayor Robert F. Wagner, a Democrat, as “a man who can lead and heal this city,” and politicians said that his statement sealed the deal that would give Mr. Wagner, 63 years old and a three‐term Mayor from 1954 to 1966, the Republican and Liberal lines for the mayoralty in this year's election. [1:8.] In a city‐ordered study of how improved transportation might help poor people, the. Regional Plan Association proposed that 15 bus‐system extensions be instituted to connect low‐income areas to nearby manufacturing districts. The report also recommended free bus transfers at scores of additional points, a huge discount on train commuting at certain hours and a revision in subwaybuilding plans to make them more responsive to the needs of the poor. [1:5.] Abortion clinics, probably the city's fastest‐growing business since the 1970 liberalization of the state abortion law, are concerned about their financial future in view of the Supreme Court decision in January that made abortions legally obtainable in other states. As a result, clinics here now face competition from other cities. [32:3–8.] The Other News International 53 P.O.W.'s get big welcome, but 3 do not.

Every Birth in Asia Limits Hope,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/every-birth-in-asia-limits-hope-each-birth-in-asia-makes-the.html,"KAMAN, India—There are about 47,000 more people on earth today than there were yesterday. By the end of the week there will be nearly 1.5 million more. A few will grow up healthy, educated and comfortable in prosperous countries like the United States, where they will have small, planned families. Most will grow up in a daily struggle to survive in, poor countries like India. They too will have families, but much larger ones. The unchecked and accelerating growth of the human population goes on, setting a frightening record each day. Today, despite the most vigorous attempts in history to reverse the trend, there are more desperately poor people than ever. Their numbers, more than anything else, have thwarted a postwar development effort aimed at improving their lot. In Asia they live beyond the bubbles of affluence and showcases of new prosperity that most Western travelers view as evidence of the success of postwar development. One does not have to travel far beyond those bubbles to get the other view. The journey among the havenots of Asia on which this series of articles is based did not encompass revolutionary China, blatantly prosperous Japan or Vietnam, that proxy for a big‐power battleground that has been so disrupted that comparisons with the rest of Asia are meaningless. Even among those who are somewhat more prosperous, the pressures of population take their toll. India's teeming population was recently increased here in Kaman, a village of about 1,200 people 35 miles north of Bombay, by the birth of a twinkly‐eyed girl named Padmini. She was the sixth child of Mr. and Mrs. Balaram Pandurang Wadkar, who were proud parents even though a boy might have provided more security for their old age. Padmini, born on a rope bed, became the 22d occupant of the biggest house in the village. A six‐room brick structure built in 1941 by her grandfather, it is shaved now by his children and their families. Madhu Atmaram Kaman Kar, as first son, is the head ?? the household and owns 46 acres of rice land and a smal brick works. A man of wealtl and influence in the village he also promotes family plan ring and helped it achieve it official goal last year by talk ing 75 men into being steri lized by vasectomy. They were among roughly a million Indian men and wo men operated on last year what is the world's most active sterilization program. The tota was hardly enough. Ten time that many Indians reach the age of fertility every year and there are already nearly ?? million couples of childbearing age—15 to 45. On the day Padmini was born 55,600 babies were born in India as they are on aver age every day, and 23,800 people died, so there were 31, 800 new mouths to feed the day, as there are every day In 1971 India had a population of 548 million, according to a national census taken in the spring of that year, and her yearly increase is put at about Z5 per cent at present—more or less the population of Aus tralia or Pennsylvania—or 13 million. According to data compiled by the Population Reference Bureau, Inc. of Washington Padmini was one of some 342, 000 babies in the world who shared the birthday. About 135,000 died, for a net increase of 207,000. In a year that is more than 75 million—four Californias or one Bangladesh. More than any other factor population growth has been charged with sabotaging the most concerted effort in human history to improve the lot of the impoverished majorities in underdeveloped countries—hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America locked into a web of malnutrition, sickness, illieracy and economic stagnation. But Many Were Passed By The development effort be gan slowly after World ?? II, when many colonies gained independence. It accelerated in the nineteen‐fifties and sixties as the giants of capitalism and Communism waged intense contests for influence. Though success was in the air, with more people healthien and better educated and more people with jobs and hope than ever before, there were many more in the opposite condition partly because population had grown so rapidly. In fact assessments of the quarter of a century of effort have asserted that the development process has not significantly altered the situation of the poor. An the progress has, at most, slowed the rate at which conditions are getting worse. Rich countries are praised for their aid and blamed for its inadequacy. Governments in poor countries are praised for their commitments to help ?? people and damned for ?? inefficiency, corruption and lack of interest in actua efforts. But population growth is viewed as the central problem, and many experts say that they simply do not know what to do to curb it, short of radical transformation of societies toward strictly and forcefully limited options on the size of families. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish sociologist, concluded five years ago after a decade of study that nothing short of “radical policy measures” would work. Even they would not check population growth within 20 or even 30 years after they were adopted, he felt. In Asia, where more than half the world's people live, population‐control programs have only begun. They have been least successful where they are most needed. Rate Is Low in China There might be one major exception, China, which went through the radical transformation Mr. Myrdal talked about The Population Reference Bureau has estimated her population at 786.1 million and her growth rate at 1.7 per cent year—the second lowest in Asia after Japan, with 1.2 per cent. If the figures are correct, China's annual population increase would still be 13.4 million, roughly that of India, leaving the Chinese with both a major achievement and a major problem. Social discipline in Japan makes comparisons with the rest of Asia pointless. Similarly, the use of birth control in developed Western countries cannot be compared because the mass education and affluence that promote its use are missing in most of Asia. With affluence the problem begins to solve itself as attitudes change. But gains toward affluence are largely offset by population increases. Motivation and attitude are paramount, because technological breakthroughs such as birth‐control pills and intrauterine devices, or abortion and simplified sterilization operations, are useless unless people resort to them. Furthermore, vast improvements in governmental efficiency would be required to put them to successful use. ‘Motivation Is Lacking’ “Motivation is the major factor,” Samuel E. Bunker, the Ford Foundation's specialist on Asian population, said in a recent interview, “and motivation for family planning is basically lacking in most Asian societies.” Singapore's relatively suc cessful motivation Includes rap idly gained affluence and mass education, plus economic discrimination against parents with more than two children. The 2.2 million people live on a small island, tightly controlled by an uncontested Ciovernment that is the envy of shaky re gimes throughout Asia. The country's size and ideology are directly opposed to China's, but the Government's command over the population, 80 percent of it of Chinese origin, is comparable. Many governments in Asia simply cannot take the pervasive steps needed to curb pop ulation growth and hope to remain in power. Progress is an especially relative term in population con trol. All Asian governments claim it. One monumenta achievement, at least, is that all Asian governments now recognize that population growth is a problem, and all have family‐planning policies and programs, some of them strong and some token. Only eight years ago Sukarno, then President of Indonesia, which is the world's fifth most populous nation, said, “In my country the more the better.” Security for Old Age For most poor Asian people this is still the view. The reasons for it reflect the complexity of development problems. The security in old age for the parents of the baby born in India is just one element. Without real development and its guarantees for security, children are the best guarantee people have that they will be provided for in their old age. Without adequate nutrition and health care, education only reinforces the idea that each couple must have several children in order to insure that enough will survive. Without sexual equality —notably lacking in Asia, where men have far more chance of economic success—each couple must keep producing until it has enough sons. However many children a family has, progress in development can raise false hopes for security. Industrial growth and the Green Revolution in agricultural output have expanded national incomes at a rate of more than 6 per cent a year. That is more than double the yearly rate of Asian population increase, which is 2.7per cent. However, the new wealth has been concentrated in relatively few hands. As Robert S. McNamara, president of the World Bank, said last year, it has not reacned the poor to any significant degree. Two Nationsapos; Views Recognizing the dangers in this, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India stresses the need for “distributive justice.” Leaders in Pakistan, where national growth set world records a few years ago, did not perceive the danger, and unrest over inequities was largely responsible for the division of the country in December, 1971. Another hopeless policy is migration to underpopulated areas. Indeed, people are moving in the opposite direction. Americans might want to get away from it all after years of accumulating the fruits and problems of affluence; pool Asians want to go where the action is. As a result, urbanization has become a nightmare in pool Asian countries. Villagers stream by the hundreds intd Seoul, Manila, Bangkok, Jakarta, Dacca, Calcutta and Bombay, to mention just a few cities overburdened by warren like slums that compound their inability to provide sanitation order and other essentials. Pockets of opulence symbolize progress and some people see urbanization as a sign of it. However, many development experts consider urbanization In poor nations as distressing evidence of the breakdown in traditional rural life, largely as a result of population growth. “In so many villages there is nothing for the additional people,” said Mrs. Avabai B. Wadia, president of the Family Planning Association of India. “There is only so much land—there is no more.” In dealing with population pressures, the moral plank on which men and governments have based their development efforts is that everything that can be done to preserve life and alleviate suffering must be done. Malaria control, for example, cannot be neglected so that a natural population bal. ance will be restored. An erosion of the plank—so that men and nations with means did not merely ignore problems but consciously deciled to neglect them so that more people would die—would raise the chilling question of whether civilization was advancing. Yet the plank is responsible for increasingprobems. Partly because of the control of malaria, life expectincy in India has risen from 32 rears in 1951 to 57 years today. Erosion of Voluntarism In India, where family planning has been a Government ??oncern since 1949 — longer han in the rest of Asia —here is another rule: Birth control must be voluntary. The rule is followed throughbut Asia, but a recent trend has seen its slow erosion hrough economic and social discriminatior against large families. This is just beginning ?? India, with Government ??ousing and job preferences for ??eads of smaller families and ??en who can show certifi cates of sterilization. Some private companies have also begun to enforce the same policy. The chief ways to birth control remain persuasion and education. Me get 20 rupees$2.65—for being sterilized, and sometimes triple or five times that amount at carnival‐like vasectomy rallies. Condoms, the most popular birth‐control devices, are usually free. Factories have been unable to meet demand because of labor troubles, so 51 million condoms were hastily ordered from Japan. Initial successes in birth‐control programs are illusory because the people who most want to practice birth control volunteer first. Progress in India is much more difficult now, said Mrs. Wadia, because the great majority, are not eager to limit their families. A Goal Is Deferred In 1963 India's goal was to reduce the birth rate by more than a third in 10 years, from 42 per thousand population to 25. So far it has been reduced only to 38 per thousand, and I the original goal has been put off to 1980. The human terms are even more discouraging than the statistics. For Padmini, born into the wealthiest family in her village, life will be hard, but there is a good chance that she will grow up to have children of her own. For Sakubai, born in a tiny thatched but on the other side of the village, life is already much harder. Her father, a landless laborer, committed suicide. Her uncle, Gopal Pandurang Hadal, 30 years old and also landless, is now the head of a family of 10—five adults, including two grandparents, and five children. His wife is ill and his sister, Sakubai's mother, is nursing, so neither can work. Mr. Hadat and his elderly father and mother must pi avide for the family, which they do by walking eight miles each morning to a hill forest where they gather stove wood. They, all carry bundles back to the village, where each sells for 2 rupees. The family income of 6 rupees, or 80 cents, a day, means 8 cents each. Life is not easy on 8 cents a day. Next: Unemployment and urbanization."
Abortion Clinics Here Face Nationwide Competition and Uncertain Future,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/abortion-clinics-here-face-nationwide-competition-and-uncertain.html,"One of Manhattan's 12 nonhospital abortion clinics, geared to a capacity of 750 patients a week, is down to an average of 380. “If we go below 300, they've got us in trouble financially,” a spokesman said. Another such clinic, which has drawn 85 per cent of its patients from out of state, has just cut its $150 standard price to $125 for local women, who do not have to be shepherded from and back to airports. There are reports that some competitors are offering $100 or even $75 group rates to activist women's organizations. A Queens clinic opens only three days a week because it is doing barely a third of its capacity of 100 abortions a day, but it does 80 two‐minute menstrual extractions a week at $50 each, although an administrator says, “We're just beginning in this procedure compared with some clinics.” And personnel from a fourth clinic, originally based in Westchester, have set up a management corporation—under a conglomerate called Tender Care, Inc.—to manage locally staffed “nonprofit comprehensive women's medical centers” in other states for a percentage of the gross earnings. Abortion clinics, probably the city's fastest‐growing business since the 1970 liberalization of the state abortion law, are now worrying about their financial future in the wake of the decision by the United States Supreme Court last January that made abortions legally obtainable in other states as well as a possible increase in those performed in doctor's offices in the city. In the face of increased competition, many clinics are exploring new techniques and health services, including “colonizing” other states where such abortion facilities have previously been illegal. The City Department of Health lists 21 “free‐standing” abortion clinics, including three each in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Four are nonprofit. Several more are in Westchester, Rockland, Nassau and other nearby counties. The Supreme Court, making abortion a matter between a woman and her physician in the first three months of pregnancy, limited the power to “regulate the abortion procedure” to the months after that first trimester. The decision punched holes in Article 42 of the city's Health Code, including the ban on abortions performed in doctors' offices, according to most legal opinions obtained thus far by the Board of Health. Peril Cited “I hope we don't have a hundred women killed in doctors' offices before we can test what the decision really means,” said Dr. Jean Pakter, director of the Bureau of Maternity Services and Family Planning, which administers Article 42. Adopted under the state's 1970 abortion law, Article 42 provided that first‐trimester abortions could be performed in clinics as well as hospitals —but under requirements that disqualified doctors' offices almost categorically because they were not that fully equipped and staffed. Article 42 also required that the doctor in charge be a qualified obstetrician or surgeon. “There's nothing now but professional self‐discipline to keep doctors who aren't OB's or surgeons from doing first‐trimester abortions in their offices,” said Dr. Morton A. Schiffer, chairman of the Health Department's advisory committee on obstetrics and gynecology. “And if they do them, we won't be able to keep up our standards?.” Dr. Schiffer's committee is revising Article 42, including “recommended guidelines” for abortions, in the first three months. He and Dr. Pakter expressed cautious optimism, echoing the widely expressed belief that “doctors are not flocking to do abortions because of the profession's basic conservation” — a reason also frequently given for the “foot‐dragging” by doctors in many states in setting up abortion services. Although there are plans in some states to establish abortion clinics—both commercial and nonprofit—no new clinics are known to have opened. Some out‐of‐state hospitals that did not perform abortions have now begun to do them, but generally on a small scale. No state legislature has yet amended its abortion law to conform to the Supreme Court decision, although an attorney general or a local court has declared abortion laws invalid in more than a dozen states. And abortion referral services across the country continue sending patients to clinics in New York. The situation here, most specifically for the Health Department, reflects what one obstetrician called “the regrettable ‘Catch‐22’ aspect” of the Supreme Court decision. “In its ban on regulating first‐trimester abortion, the court cited ‘the now‐established medical fact’ of safety during this period,” said Dr. Bernard Nathanson, former medical director of Women's Services, Inc., a large non profit clinic now known as the Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health, Inc. “Everybody knows this ‘medical fact’ was ‘established’ here and that the court relied on the data, experience and abortion‐safety record of New York City—which, ironically, was based on strict regulation,” Dr. Nathanson said. “If the Right‐to‐Life people and other, antiabortionists can come forward in the future and say, ‘Look, in the absence of regulation we haven't got first‐trimester safety—we've got a high mortality rate,’ then this thing could be reappealable right back to the Supreme Court.” Dr. Nathanson noted, along with others, that the future might have been clarified more by a decision in which the court would have said, in effect, “We're legal men, not medical men.” The Health Department, citing the court's reliance on New York statistics, has notified clinics, hospitals and doctors that it will continue to require a certificate of termination of pregnancy. “Our function of collecting information is implied in the Supreme Court decision,” Michael Blumenfeld, deputy administrator of the Health Services Administration, asserted. Pending a decision by a lower court on the appeal of a lawsuit seeking anonymity for a woman, the certificate still must carry the name of the woman whose pregnancy is being terminated. Reports differ on how much—or even whether—nationwide legal abortion has slowed the stream of out‐of‐state‐women, who last year had more than 60 per cent of the 118,000 abortions that were performed here. The major proportion of those pregnant three months or less patronized nonhospital clinics, generating what has been described as “cut‐throat competition” and “virtual kidnapping at airports.” “A lot of clinics are scared stiff—some talk about pooling facilities to meet their colossal overheads, esspecially rents,” said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, who recently completed a report for the New York County Medical Society on “ideal” abortion services. “The days are doomed for doctors who made a million dollars or more, doing 50 or 60 abortions per four‐or‐five‐day week in a clinic.” “A lot of clinic people are hanging on to their rice bowls so hard they're clutching them all out of shape,” said Merle Goldberg, director of the National Women's Health Coalition. Her opinion that “the single‐procedure clinics will not survive” drew hardly any dissent. Many clinics, commercial as well as nonprofit, insisted that, beyond the short‐term upheaval, they would welcome “putting out‐of‐state abortions into perspective as we move into the whole field of ‘well‐woman’ medical services that we should be offering local women,” as it was put by Dr. Robert Landesman, medical director of Women's Services. Most observers thought the future was more dubious for the commercial clinics than for the nonprofit ones. But even for nonprofit clinics, “an unfortunate by‐product of a welcome court decision” was foreseen by the Rev. Howard R. Moody of the Clergy Consultation Service, which operates a nationwide abortion referral service. Commercial as well as nonprofit clinics plan to expand their contraceptive services beyond the counseling they have been required to offer abortion patients. They are also exploring genetic, fertility, sexuality and menopause counseling; sterilization, diagnostic pro cedures, Lamaze preparation for childbirth and other prenatal and postnatal care among other possibilities. Perhaps the most controversial new service is they technique of vacuum aspiration called menstrual or endometrial extraction or mini‐abortion, done between the fifth and the 10th (in some clinics the 17th) day after a missed period. “Endometrial extraction it going to effect the abortion business in New York as much as the Supreme Court decision as clinics adapt to a clientele of local women who can easily come in before they need a full abortion,” said H. A. Cooper, administrator of T.L.C. Women's Services in Long Island City (which is not connected with Tender Care, Inc.) Dr. Milton Damon, medical director of Park Med Associates, said he “just can't see doing menstrual extraction” because in “at least a dozen cases where it had been done elsewhere, we had to do a full abortion because a pregnancy was missed or do a completion because of sever cramps.” Two clinic directors predieted that the standard abortion price would drop to $100 within a year because of competition, and some persons suggested that “eventually” it would level of near $50, or not much more than the ‘ price for mini‐abortion. However, Mr. Moran said he was “not at all convinced” that either a commercial clinic or physician doing office abortions would find it easy “to get the fee below $125 without loading on extra charges,” considering the costs of necessary laboratory work and other important procedures. He noted that the Planned Parenthood clinics' lowest price of $2 on a sliding scale was offset by a high of $145."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/20/archives/letters-to-the-editor-let-the-farmer-do-his-job-the-gradgrind.html,"To the Editor: The Times has a rather consistent and alarming misunderstanding regarding the situation on the Ainercan farm today. It is true that farm income, at $17‐billion to $19 billion after taxes in the 1972–73 period, is at record levels, but this income exceeds only nominally the levels achieved 25 years ago. So for the first time in a quarter of a century the farmer has begun to inprove his return on investment to sufficient levels to encourage expansion. Gross farm assets 25 years ago ranged approximately from $120 billion to $140 billion. Gross assets einployed in 1972 are estimated at $240‐billion to $260 billion. The point is that the farmer today is achieving a, return of approximately one‐half of what he was capable of achieving in the late forties. The American farm system is the most efficient and innovative in the world today. Because of the bureaucratic nature of this country's farm policy over the past several decades and the Government's continuing involvement, the farmer has become ultraconservative., He is generally unwilling to expand production even when this is permissible in fear of not getting an adequate return vis‐à‐vis the handouts the Government has historically given him. To control farm prices artificially would sufficiently discourage the farmer from expanding. crop production, and, thereby, guarantee the prolongation of the problem indefinitely. The unprecedented rise in personal disposable incomes in past fifteen years, fueled by exorbitant demands from unions in most recent years, has accelerated beef consumption above historic trends. With consumptive patterns in Japan and Europe running two to three times domestic rates, it is only, natural to expect rising prices. The American farm system provides the consumer with the lowest cost of food in the world. It is only capable of and interested in increasing its production to meet the demand if it can achieve a proper return on investment. Only free market conditions will give the farmer sufficient incen five to meet the challenge more aggressively. The American consumer has to learn to stop complaining and to let the farmer do his job, for otherwise prices will only be sustained indefinitely at high levels. Just as rationing will become a fact of life in the energy field, the consumer should be aware that he may be faced with the unavailability of certain food products which have always been considered part of the American way of life. STEPHEN H. LOCKTON New York, March 9, 1973 The Gradgrind Generation To the Editor: Having set out to recast the American adult in the Nixonian image, the President has now turned to the kids. As a starter, he and his coadjutor, Mr. Wrather of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, have decided that “Zoom” is likely to give children the notion that life can be fun. To replace “Zoom,” how about series based on the admirable philosophy of Mr. Gradgrind's school? “Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts,” said Mr. Gradgrind. “Facts alone are wanted in life. Nothing else will ever be of service. This is the principle on which I bring, up my own children. Stick to Facts, Sir!” With Mr. Wrather's cooperation we may develop a generation of joyless Gradgrinds. For “no little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon. No little Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle, Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are! No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject, each having at five years dissected the Great Bear like a Professor Owen. No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field with the cow with the crumpled horn, or with that yet more famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb.” Gradgrind cows were “graminivorous, ruminating quadrupeds with several stomachs.” “‘Zoom,’ indeed!” Mr. Gradgrind would have snorted. “Where's the work ethic? Where are the Facts?” HARRIET CULP Birmingham, Ala., Feb. 27, 1973 To Tax Even the Rich To the Editor: Correcting the inequities in personal income taxes that lead to individuals with large incomes paying no tax at all can be rectified using the following procedure: Require each taxpayer with gross income of $25,000 or more to file two. reports. One report should be the kind now filed, the other should permit deductions only of personal items such as taxes and interest on an occupied residence, personal deductions, charitable contributions, etc., but the total of all deductions must not exceed 25 per cent of gross income. Then divide the balance in half and estimate the tax on that half and require the taxpayer to pay on estimate No. 1 or No. 2, whichever is greater. The man with $1 million per year income would show no tax on estimate 1, but on estimate 2 he would show $1 million income, $250,000 deductions. Half of the balance is $375,000. His tax then would be the normal tax on $375,000 net income and he wouldn't do too badly. Granted, this is a compromise, but we probably never will see complete elimination of the deductions behind which the wealthy taxpayer now can hide. JULIUS STORCH New York, March 12, 1973 • All Winnings Are Taxable To the Editor: I would like to correct a misunderstanding as expressed by Howard Samuels and repeated in Mace Blicksilver's March 10 letter in regard to numbers betting. All winnings are taxable. Winnings in excess of $600 are reportable to the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099 Misc., but all winnings are taxable whether reported or not and whether paid by OTB or an illegal numbers runner. Since the Internal Revenue Service now requires banks to report interest payments of $10 or more, it is not inconceivable that the reporting requirements for gambling winnings might be reduced to an amount much lower than $690, which would, of course, play havoc with OTB, the racetracks and even with bingo games. CARL T. MURZIN Flushing, N. Y., March 12, 1973 The writer is a practicing C.P.A. Suppressed Reminder To the Editor: It is more than regrettable that C.B.S. decided against showing veteran David Rabe's “Sticks and Bones” “at this time” to avoid possible discord during the homecoming of the P.O.W.'s. The play about a blinded, embittered Wand ambivalent veteran would have helped to put things into perspective by reminding all of us of those who were killed in action or badly maimed, doomed to lives in wheelchairs or hospital beds, drug addiction, rejection by their families, homelessness, confusion, unemployment or crime. There was no red carpet when they were brought home, no embrace by some high‐ranking officer; there were no gifts of flowers, cars, money, no brass bands. Many were forgotten as soon as they arrived, being nothing but painful, guilt‐inducing reminders of a cruel and senseless war. They did not add to the glory of the President, who kept in the spotlight by being praised by the P.O.W.'s in their practically identical homecoming speeches in which they frequently used Mr. Nixon's favorite term, “peace with honor.” (Thackeray coined the phrase “the Devil's Code of Honour.” How apt in this context.) I wholeheartedly share the nation's happiness about the safe return of the P.O.W.'s and I don't begrudge them anything they have been given, but doubt that it would have hurt or harmed them or the rest of us to see “Sticks and Bones.” It would have reminded them of how fortunate most of them have been in comparison to many thousands of their comrades, and it would have given those of us who stayed at home a valuable lesson in understanding and compassion. That C.B.S., often so upright and courageous, bowed to so‐called “public demand” is a frightening omen. GERTRUD SANDER ROST Montclair, N. J., March 12, 1973 • A Look Back To the Editor: In the year 1780 John Dunning proposed in the House of Commons resolution which read: “The power of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.” The passage of this resolution during the reign of George III marked significant step in the development of England's unwritten constitution leading to the supremacy of Parliament and the establishment of its modern cabinet government. You have but to substitute for “the power of the Crown” “the power of the President”—and you have an apt statement of our current constitutional crisis involving the separate spheres of power of the Congress and the President. DUDLEY C. LUNT Wilmington, Del., March 1, 1973 • Abortion and the Individual To the Editor: I do not understand by what logic the Reverend Degnan (Op‐Ed March 10) concludes that the Supreme Court's abortion decision has “reduced” us. Rather, it appears to recognize that the individual has a choice in the matter of terminating pregnancy. Father Degnan is obviously aware of the complexities involved in this issue, but it seems far more logical to conclude that the Court decision has “raised” us by allowing for individual moral decisions regarding abortion during the first six months of pregnancy. It seems that the Supreme Court has risen above the emotional debates by enacting a sound compromise. The responsibility for intelligent and reasoned decisions now rests with the individuals who will be directly affected by the abortions. STEPHEN O. VOYSEY New Brunswick, N. J., March 10, 1973 City Prisons and the Mentally Ill To the Editor: The Feb. 27 letter from Messrs. Nederiger, Karp and Morgan, regarding the city's plan to use the Branch Queens House of Detention as a central prison psychiatric facility, raises questions which should not go unanswered. The Board of Correction has been assured that the use of Branch Queens as a therapeutic facility will not result, as is charged; in the dismemberment of mental‐health services available at other institutions. We are told that Branch Queens — with a maximum population of 252 the most manageable, most community ‐ oriented and quietest city prison—will only supplement the programs available at other institutions. It is not the intention of anyone involved in the proposed move to make Branch Queens the “dumping ground” for problem inmates. In his thirteen months in office, Correction Commissioner Benjamin Malcolm has done more to open up the prisons to civilians and noncorrection personnel than any prison administrator in history, and the suggestion that the move is motivated by the desire of correction officials to eliminaté civilians is a gratuitous insult to him and his administration of the department. In fact, the need for Branch Queens is urgent. At least 10 to 15 per cent of the more than 7,500 detention prisoners in New York City are so severely mentally disturbed that they properly belong in psychiatric hospitals. Messrs. Nederiger, Karp and Morgan, who are present and former mental health workers at the Tombs, know as well as anyone that the various detention institutions are simply inadequate in size, physical characteristics and staffing to meet this need. The allegation that the move is “destructive expenditure” by securityconscious Correction and Health Services officials who have “rarely entered a prison” could not be further from the truth. A more relevant topic of concern for those with responsibility in the field of prison mental health would be an inquiry into the premises of the prison mental health program. Instead of committing vast resources to programs aimed at “curing” mentally disturbed inniates with lifetime histories of psychological disorders in the antitherapeutic environment of the pretrial detention prison, far more attention must be paid to the need for removing the mentally ill from the criminal‐justice system itself. Prison mental‐health programs cannot cure sick people. The effort must be to minimize the trauma of incarceration while seeking alternatives to sterile “correctional” institutions. JOHN M.

A Critic Offers Views on Women's Lib,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/21/archives/a-critic-offers-views-on-womens-lib-everybody-cowed.html,"“I have become the figure at the center of resistance to the movement,” Midge Decter says wryly. “Women who two years ago would have been very fierce in the face of resistance to the movement say to me, ‘You've picked the lunatic fringe of this movement and that's not fair.’ But as they go on and on with that kind of conversation, you find out that they adhere to the very ideas they describe as lunatic.” Since she waved the red flag in the face of feminism last summer with the publication of her book “The New Chastity and Other Arguments Against Women's Liberation,” Miss Decter has become a favorite bad guy (her words) in panel discussions around the country on the women's movement. The other day, she gave her views on the women's liberation movement as she sat in her large, rambling apartment on West End Avenue, where she lives with her husband, Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine, and the two of her four children who still live at home. Miss Decter, who was executive editor of Har‐. per's magazine for five years, is now working part‐time as literary editor of the new World magazine. Miss Decter speaks much as she writes, in long, thoughtful sentences, concerned more with analyzing the ideology of the movement than with such issues as day care or abortion. She has said that specific issues of injustice “lend themselves not to the large‐scale analyses of a liberation movement, but to the particular and practical application of pressure against the wrongdoers.” “Everybody Cowed” Her voice is calm and low, and slightly gravelly, perhaps because of the countless cigarettes she smokes, and she wriggled into all kinds of positions in her chair, tucking and untucking her bare feet, as she, spoke. “I think everybody, has become extremely pious,” she said. “You cannot say about the movement, ‘This is a bad idea’ or you cannot say ‘This is a bad novel,’ because everybody has been cowed by it. “I think the behavior of men has been extraordinary in the face of this movement. You know it's become almost impossible to talk accurately about relations between men and women because the Whole thing has become so ideological. Everything fits into the ideological slots, and I don't think men and women are telling the truth any more.” One of Miss Decter's major premises is that the women's liberation movement actually denigrates women because it proclaims them unfit for equality with men by harping on such themes as the sickly enslavement of housewives and, the progressive dulling of the minds of young women who have been forced into secretarial work. She feels that consciousness‐raising groups have simply served to reinforce the consciousness of this inferiority. “My original point was that the movement was putting women down,” she said. “The young housewife with three little kids is not doing something inferior to her husband; she's doing something different. It was her choice and her own doing—and what's wrong with it? “If there are a lot of young housewives around that are bored, then they tend to reinforce each other. What lies at the bottom of such complaints is that life is very hard. “What I object to is this notion that women have nothing to do with their own difficulties. Women are trying to get the moral credit for being a minority, when they simply aren't. They are equating their movement with the black movement, and I think it's just unholy for middle‐class American women to equate themselves with blacks and say that they have been oppressed by society. “It's the undergraduate girls in the best Ivy League colleges who are saying that they have been discriminated against, and it's just a way of saying ‘Take it easy on me.’” Miss Decter, who stayed home and raised her own children before they were of school age, maintains that the women's movement does not understand motherhood or children. “I suspect somebody who gets up all the time and talks about dirty diapers is not someone who is speaking from real experience,” she said. “Motherhood has been reduced to a series of dirty jobs. There's nothing about the fun of it. And I pity the next generation of little children.”"
Women Equality Groups Fighting Credit Barriers,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/25/archives/women-equality-groups-fighting-credit-barriers-womens-equality.html,"A revolt against what many women and civil rights lawyers perceive to be sex discrimination in the extension of credit is gathering momentum. Under the slogan “Give credit to a woman where credit is due,” the assault takes two forms: a search for legal redress and wellpublicized pressure tactics against the business community. Some barriers are buckling more quickly than expected with support from politicians seizing “a nice clean issue, not abortion” (as one feminist put it), and from retailers and bankers aware that the female 53 per cent of the population dominates the consumer economy. There have been these developments: ¶Sex discrimination in the granting of credit is under attack in bills pending in both houses of Congress and at least half a dozen state legislatures, including New York's. The first state law specifically banning sex discrimination in credit and insurance transactions has just been passed in Washington. ¶The community property law was amended last year in the State of Washington to make wives equal managers of the property. A lawsuit soon to be filed in United States District Court in Louisiana will challenge “the arbitrary designation of the husband as sole manager of the community property.” Such changes would give creditors additional protection and have profound implications for women's credit opportunities in the eight community property states. ¶The National Commission on Consumer Finance, which held hearings on the subject last May in Washington, D. C. recommended in a recently released report that states re view and amend laws that inhibit the granting of credit to women. ¶Hearings by state commissions have since been held in Pennsylvania, California, Idaho and New Hampshire and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Government investigations have been started in Wisconsin, Virginia, Missouri and Michigan. ¶The Center for Women Policy Studies in Washington, D. C., has received a grant from the Ford Foundation to study the problem. The National Organization for Women has produced a manual for groups wanting to set up a credit project. Two to three dozen NOW chapters already have. ¶Such projects by women's groups in Dallas, Minneapolis and St. Paul and Baltimore against department stores and other retail grantors of credit have made it easier for women to open charge accounts in their own name. The Baltimore Credit Bureau Inc. agreed to set up independent credit records for women. “Discrimination in credit deprives women of participating in the major American way of life and denies them equal access to the same opportunity men enjoy,” asserts Barbara Shack, director of the women's rights project of the New York Civil Liberties Union. Like many other experts in this new area of civil rights, she acknowledges that reluctant merchants and lenders do not act necessarily out of male chauvinism. Many are intimidated by the confusion surrounding the legal property rights and liabilities of women in the United States. Still, three areas of inequitable treatment have clearly been identified in the hearings, investigations and surveys: retail credit, mortgages and bank loans. Women have “second class status” in stores and banks, according to the most thorough survey on the subject of women and credit, which was published last month by the Oregon Student Public Interest Research Group, an offshoot of Ralph Nader's consumer movement. Class Does Not Matter That status cuts across age, race and economic class, although those of child‐bearing age, the separated and divorced and those who most need credit to survive, show the greatest bruises. Mrs. Eddlene Bloom of Oak Park, Mich., who was divorced last November, has sole title to a new Volvo, to a home valued at $38,000, more than $30,000 income in alimony and child support, and a savings account of $3,000 in the same bank where she and her former husband had a joint checking account for 10 years. She also works part‐time. Yet last January when she applied to the J. L. Hudson Company for a charge account, she was asked for the names of her former husband and her lawyer. “Just to be safe, so we can verify your ability to pay,” she was told. She received the charge plate, marked Ms., in two weeks. Last month, though, her application for a Master Charge account through her bank was turned down. What disturbs Mrs. Bloom and other divorced women is to be “automatically” classified as a credit risk. “For years, I handled all the bills for the household,” she said. “I am the one who insured our excellent credit rating, except that it turned out to be ‘his’ not ‘our.’” Indeed, while the married woman “is a nonperson when it comes to credit,” as Representative Bella Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, has said, the divorced or separated woman runs into what the Oregon study terms “the catch 22.” The store will not extend credit “because the credit check will frequently find that she has no credit rating at all. The entire credit history belongs to the husband.” The report recommended that wives be given separate files in credit bureau records. Alimony Often Disregarded Many credit managers and lenders refuses to consider alimony or child support as income, moreover, because they do not regard it as a steady and certain source. On the other hand, they are also reluctant to count the salary of the young working wife. Take the case of Paul Wintjen, 27, of Milford, Del. and his wife, Marjorie, 25. Last year they were told their combined income of $14,000 a year was too low to qualify for a Veterans Housing Administration mortgage with which they wanted to finance a $19,900 house with a 10 per cent down payment. Mr. Wintjen was earning $9,500 a year as manager of fast food restaurant. The bank refused to count the $4,500 salary of Mrs. Wintjen, a hospital technician. However, the bank lending officer suggested that one half of her income would be computed if she would submit a medical certificate of sterilization. If her husband were to have a vasectomy, though, her income would not be counted “because can still get pregnant.” Mrs. Wintjen bitterly reflects that “my income is counted 100 per cent by the state of Delaware and the United States Government for income taxes.” Proof of inability to bear children has customarily been demanded of young wives by bankers, who seem to regard the age of 38 as the frontier of safety. They are also biased in favor of nurses and teachers (as opposed to secretaries and assemblyline workers) on the theory that they are likely to go promptly from childbirth back to the job because their services are so much in demand. A survey by the United States Savings and Loan League showed that 72 per cent of 421 banks queried said they would ignore part or all of a working wife's income. Only 28 per cent said they would count all of it. Since 1965, the Federal Housing Administration's official policy has been to disallow a young wife's income only if she has no definite record of employment. In 1971, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) repealed its guidelines of counting 50 per cent of a wife's earnings. But the present determination of whether the joint income is likely to continue has been criticized by women's rights group as being too subjective. And even when guidelines are loosened, they say, word does not necessarily filter down to the loan officers in the field. Particularly vexing to women's rights groups is what they view as the inconsistency of credit policies as well as the “wide gap between policy and practice” (as the Women's Equity Action League found in its Dallas project). In February, 1972, the St. Paul Department of Human Rights tested 23 banks by sending a man and a woman with identical credentials to apply for a $600, 18‐month auto loan. Both were 24 years old, married, earning $12,000 a year as research analysts and the sole support of their student spouses. Both had good credit histories. Thirty‐nine per cent of the banks revealed discrepancies in their loan policies (such as requiring a co‐signature only in the case of the female), and nine banks were found to discriminate. Most of the practices used in extending credit “are based on outmoded assumptions about the status and role of women in society,” said Senafor Harrison A. Williams Jr., Democrat of New Jersey in introducing his credit discrimination bill. He pointed out that nearly 43 per cent of the female population worked and more than 44 per cent of married women living with their husbands were employed. Three out of 10 married women with children under 6 are in the labor force. Feminists argue that there is no valid evidence to support the assumption that women are bad credit risks. A 1941 study by David Durand for the National Bureau of Economic Research offered statistical proof that women were better credit risks than men. A few more recent studies, as summarized in the Oregon report, either confirm this or conclude that marital status is not a reliable determinant of credit worthiness. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which introduced the sex discrimination ban into Federal law, is addressed to employment. There is no Federal law or constitutional court interpretation to protect women in credit transactions. Some feminists argue that the Equal Rights Amendment, if ratified, would be a powerful tool against credit discrimination. In Congress, three bills introduced by Mrs. Abzug would bar discrimination by sex or marital status in federallyrelated mortgage transactions, by federally insured banks or by creditors through an amendment of the Truth in Lending Act. A bill by Representative Margaret Heckler, Republican of Massachusetts, is also drawn to cover consumer lending. Senator Williams's bill is broadly written to extend the Consumer Credit Protection Act. It also contains a provision for individual suits in a civil action, with damages equal to the amount of credit refused. State Laws Definitive It is in state law, however, that property rights are defined and that creditors try to cover their risk. The Married Women's Property Acts, prevailing in 42 states, give women the right to contract in their own names. However, state laws also make husbands responsible for their wives' support. The ambiguous word “necessales” is often stated in connection with support and it gives some creditors pause. In 11 states, there are some limitations on the liability of a wife for the contracts signs and creditors fear she might disclaim her obligation. So it is that creditors ask for information about a husband's income or demand his cosignature because they want double protection in collecting the debt. “They have no right to it,” says Mrs. Shack, of the New York Civil Liberties Union. She adises women who refuse to give it that they are within their rights, in New York at least. Furthermore, Mrs. Shack says, creditors should realize that the wife's earnings are free from her husband's claims so “she is really a better credit risk than he.” In the eight community property states, the wife is supposed to own half the property acquired after marriage. But until amendments like the one passed last year in Washington, the husband is sole managof the community property. Recent attempts to write a ban on sex discrimination into state or municipal law have usually proceeded on oblique courses. Washington has just passed the first law that flatly gives the right to engage in credit transactions without discrimination by sex or marital status. Consciousness Stressed Most other efforts have been directed toward amending a public accommodation law to include a sex discrimination ban and then have a court or agency construe a bank or a retail store as a public accommodation. Such a bill just passed the New York State Assembly. Mrs. Shack has also filed a complaint under a sex discrimination ban in the state human rights law relating to loans for housing, land or commercial space. A bill signed and passed by the New York City Council is similarly related to housing. Ira M. Millstein, a New York lawyer who served as chairman of the National Commission on Consumer Finance, is one of those who believe that legislative change is not the most important tactic. “A lot of women are still not aware they should be entitled to credit,” he said. “Until they are conscious that a woman with income is a person entitled to credit, period, that marital status shouldn't interfere, that she should be judged as any wage earner for better or worse, what good will it do to put another law on the books? “As soon as women start stamping their feet and raising hell and getting to the right person in the credit granting office, it will get done,” he declared."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/25/archives/sisters-under-each-others-skin-end-lesbian-oppression.html,"To the Editor: Every political movement must at some point deal with those who may have been among its originators, but beyond whom it has now grown. There should be some way the Women's Movement can recognize Betty Friedan's contribution and respect it, while gently but firmly dismissing her current irrelevant and pathetic demands that we all go backward. Friedan's magazine article (“Up from the kitchen floor,” March 4) contained scurrilous and vituperative attacks on lesbian feminists, deliberate misrepresentations of the radical feminist wing (more than half the Movement), and insensitive blindness to the needs and demands of Third World women, many of whom are now forming Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican and Native American radical feminist group in the United States. To red‐bait and C.I.A.smear women at one and the same time is quite a feat. To imply contempt for the intelligence of the housewife is quite an error. And to be other than ashamed of addressing the war technicians of the Air Force Academy—all of them male—is simply astounding. It makes one wonder who indeed is behind this manufactured news event, first attempted when Friedan attacked Abzug and Steinern in (fittingly) McCall's; in whose patriarchal interest is it to set wellknown figures of the Movement at one another's public It is clearly not in the interest of women. And it is, after all women that the Feminist Movement is all about: lesbians and heterosexual and celibate women, mothers and nuns, welfare clients, housewives, students, factory workers, secretaries, women of all races and classes, young and old, reformers and radicals. We are talking about a mass movement now, with global scope, and comprised largely of women at last unwilling to settle for tokenism. We will not be divided by irrelevancies, nor exploited or defamed by any individual woman's pitiable obsession for male acceptance in the U.S. Senate. We happen to be more than half the human species, oppressed longer than any other people, and this time we will not be stopped. If the eminent sister would remain at all relevant, she should recall these words of Gandhi: “There go my people: I must hurry and catch up with them, for I am their leader.” ROBIN MORGAN New York End lesbian oppression! To the Editor: As lesbians and feminists, we deplore Betty Friedan's article. She grossly misrepresents lesbians in the Women's Movement by accusing them of “proselytizing,” trying to take over the Women's Movement, and even plotting to seduce Betty herself. Betty fails to acknowledge the large contributions of lesbians in areas of broad feminist concern: equal pay, child care, abortion, etc. She also fails to mention the terrible oppression lesbians have suffered both in society and in the Women's Movement because of heterosexual bigotry like hers. Fortunately, the majority of women in NOW have had their consciousness raised and now see lesbianism as a valid alternate life‐style. Important resolutions on lesbianism were passed at the 1971 and 1973 national NOW conferences. One declares lesbianism a feminist issue; the other commits NOW actively to introduce and support legislation to end discrimination based on sexual orientation. If this is the result of our “proselytizing,” we applaud our efforts and the support of our sisters. Meanwhile, Betty persists as a fear‐ridden anachronism, dividing women with slanderous attacks on her lesbian sisters. Perhaps her reluctance to face her own prejudice has caused her to translate our efforts to end lesbian oppression into a fantasy‐plot to take over the Women's Movement. As for her story of plotted seduction and blackmail, we trust that intelligent leaders will recognize it as a vague rumor, curiously nameless and devoid of detail. Betty gloriously concludes: “... the sex role revolution ... will make it really possible for men and women (our italics) to ‘make love, not war.’” She neglects to include 10 per cent of the country: women who love women and men who love men. Our voices will not be stilled by the fearful words of a sister whom the “sex role revolution” has left behind. GINNY VIDA Vice‐president, Gay Activists Alliance; JEAN O'LEARY Chairwoman, Lesbian Liberation Committee New York Solipsism decried To the Editor: When Ms. Friedan presumes to speak for all women and projects her limited personal experiences into cosmic truths about all of us, we must dissociate ourselves from her “leadership.” Consider the arrogance of her opening statement about how things were 10 years ago: “Locked as we all were then in that mystique, which kept us passive and apart, and kept us even from seeing our real problems and possibilities.” (Some of us had read Simone de Beauvoir's “The Second Sex” by then as well as voluminous books on the women's suffrage movement. We had also figured out things for ourselves.) According to Ms. Friedan, until her book was published, “each of us” thought we were freaks if we didn't find orgasmic fulfillment in housework. Having to offer an after‐the‐fact explanation of the millions of women who were already working before her book came out, she simply assigns to them all feelings of mass guilt and betrayal of their femininity. As a self‐described Joan of Arc, Ms. Friedan assumes that her personal relationships set nationwide and possibly even worldwide trends. Her divorce has implications for all women, her sharing a summer place with a group of men and women inaugurates “new kinds of marriages,” her rediscovered ability to love a man gives the all‐clear signal to other women to love men and to feel tenderness. Solipsism on such a vast scale would simply be laughable if it were not taken at face value by editors who allow Ms. Friedan to present herself as the initiator of virtually every aspect of the women's movement, except for the lesbianism which she views as a C.I.A.‐inspired plot.

Two Doctors Here Known to Users as Sources of Amphetamines,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/25/archives/two-doctors-here-known-to-users-as-sources-of-amphetamines-10-to-25.html,"Two New York area physicians, Dr. Robert Freymann and Dr. John M. Bishop, have become widely known among users of amphetamines as regular sources of the powerful stimulant. According to former patients, the two physicians, have provided amphetamine injections routinely to a large number of patients, many of them prominent in artistic and social circles and some of them heavily dependent on the drug. Details of their practices have emerged as several former patients and other knowledgeable persons have come forward following disclosure last December in The New York Times of the methods of another so‐called “speed doctor,” Dr. Max Jacobson. Dr. Jacobson, who says that for years he supplied amphetamines mixed with vitamins and other Ingredients to a clientele including celebrities and politicians, is being investigated by the Yew York State Attorney General's office and the New York County Medical Society. Last week the state brought charges of unprofessional conduct and fraud in the practice of medicine against Dr. Jacobson in the first step of an attempt to revoke his license. Neither Dr. Freymann, whose office is at 3 East 78th Street, nor Dr. Bishop, who once practo iced in Manhattan but who now lives and works in Sag Harbor, L.I., is associated with Dr. Jacobson. Neither is under investigation, and their, practices generally differ widely from Dr. Jacobson's. But their common reliance on amphetamines in their practices has led some patients of one to patronize another, or in some cases all three in succession. All three of the doctors, according to their patients, have been users of amphetamines themselves. Dr. Jacobson acknowledges that he takes his own preparations, but both Dr. Freymann and Dr. Bishop deny using the drug. ‘Speed Doctors’ Common Reports from patients and physicians in other parts of the Country ndicate that doctors who give injections of amphetfamine practice in virtually every major city. Not all devote themselves exclusively to amphetamine. Many simply offer the shots to otherwise healthy patients along with more orthodox medical services for the ill. Many medical experts and estate and Federal regulatory agencies consider amphetamine one of the most dangerous of, legally available drugs. Longterm use can lead to heavy dependence and such toxic side effects as behavioral changes resembling paranoid schizophrenia. Attempts to quit the drug can produce such a profound aepression that a number of users have committed suicide. The only uses of amphetamine on which nearly all authorities agree are in the treatment of two rare disorders, narcolepsy, a compulsion to fall asleep, and hyperkinetic behavior in children. Some doctors say the drug's appetite ‐ suppressing ability also makes it helpful in weight control, but others argue that the addictive potential is too hazardous for any such non‐essential use. Although it is not illegal to give patients amphetamine, there are increasingly tight state and Federal regulations intended to discourage its use in all but a few medically necessary cases. It is contrary to state and Federal regulations to sell amphetamines in excessive quanties or to dispense the drug to persons in whom there is no demonstrated medical need. $10 to $25 a Prescription These regulations are directed against doctors, sometimes at well‐to‐do addresses well known among young drug abusers, who bypass the preliminary tests and simply write prescriptions for anyone who walks in with the necessary cash—anywhere from $10 to $25. Two New York area doctors —Dr. Alois Peter Warren of Manhattan and Dr. Jack Cohen of Great Neck, L. I. — have been convicted in Federal court of violating drug control laws. A third, Dr. Jules C. Bigliani of Union City, N. J., lost his license last September following a grand jury indictment for unlawfully dispensing ampheta mines. But medical regulatory agencies acknowledge that little has been done to stop general amphetamine abuse. The county medical society, although it can expel a member doctor, is powerless to prevent him from practicing. The state has the power to revoke a doctor's license but can, as in Dr. Jacobson's ease, spend years investigating one doctor. Meanwhile, as the regulatory agencies weigh the Jacobson case, new information from the patients of other doctors shows that the dimensions of this seldom‐published drug abuse problem among the privileged and affluent reaches well beyond the clientele of one doctor. “I went to Dr. Freymann for about a year and by the end of it, I was completely out of my head,” said Bob Clark, a free lance news photographer. was a very straight guy, never knew anything about speed. But I was pretty busy with my work, never getting enough sleep. A friend suggested I go to get these great vitamin shots. It was a disaster for me.” Many patients of speed doctors said they had originally been told that they were getting vitamin shots. Only after the side‐effects became obvious did they learn the truth. Mr. Clark, who is now rebuilding his life without drugs, said he did not know what the injections contained until Dr. Freymann gave him a prescription for Desoxyn, one brand of amphetamine, and someone who knew the name told him what it was. A number of other patients of Dr. Freymann described similar experiences of psychiatric complications and destroyed lives and careers. Yet for many patients, the experience started out as pleasant and exciting. “The first day I arrived in New York, a friend who was a model took me to Dr. Freymann because she was going to get a shot,” recalled Susan Mitchell, a 33‐year‐old travel agent. “She got her shot and Dr. Freymann asked if I wanted one too. My friend said they were great, so I tried it” In the euphoria produced by weekly shots from Dr. Freymann, Miss Mitchell said she was delighted to see her weight go down. But it kept going down, shrinking her in six weeks from a size 14 to a size 6. Within months Miss Mitchell was going for shots every other day. “Once I passed out after shot and he put me in a back room and went on shooting other people,” she said. “It felt like the whole top of my head was coming off.” After years of repeated “nervous breakdowns,” fits of panic and rage at odd moments, and uncontrollable episodes of paranoic fear that everyone was plotting against her, Miss Mitchell decided to quit the drug for good. “I haven't been back in about a year and I've never felt better,” she said. Tablets Crudely Pressed The New York City Medical Examiner's laboratory analyzed a quantity of tablets Dr. Freymann had given Miss Mitchell and found them to contain amphetamine. The pink, yellow, purple and green tablets had been crudely pressed and did not appear to have been made in a commercial pharmaceutical factory. Another patient, Erica Mann, a pretty young woman with, according to her psychiatrist step‐father, a life‐long obsession to lose weight even though already quite thin, had been going to Dr. Freymann for injections for three months. “She was living in the city in a place of her own, so we really didn't know what was going on,” said Dr. Edward M. Einhorn, her step‐father. “Then one day she called up her mother and said she was in pain.” Erica's mother came into the city and, unable to find a doctor, called for an ambulance to take her to Mount Sinai Hospital. In the intensive care unit, with “possible heart failure” the first diagnosis, her condition deteriorated into coma. The hospital called Dr. Freymann's office to ask what drugs she had been getting. The reply: vitamins, calcium gluconate (a substance that produces an instantaneous warm flush but little else except in very rare ailments) and 20 milligrams of intravenous amphetamine three times a week. Dies Six Days Later Six days later, on Sept. 24, 1972, despite efforts to save her, Erica Mann died. The death certificate lists her cause of death as myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that usually results from either an infection or the ingestion of toxic chemicals. Dr. Elizabeth Klineberger, who treated her in the hospital, refused to discuss the case. Dr. Freymann, who was away on vacation when Erica died, said later he thought she might have committed suicide, Withdrawal from heavy amphetamine use often leads to deep despondency. Dr. Einhorn said, he and Erica's mother had considered suing Dr. Freymann but had been advised by their attorney that they did not have a strong enough case. Instead they sent a report on the case to the New York County Medical Society, of which Dr. Freymann is a member. The society has not yet responded to the report. Dr. Freymann's practice is not unknown to the medical society or to state agencies that regulate the practice of medicine. The 67‐year‐old, Leipzig‐born, doctor lost his license for six months in 1968 when the State Department of Education found him guilty of procuring and performing abortions and of “unprofessional conduct” in 1963 and 1964 when he was found to be administering narcotic drugs to persons known to be habitual users. It is a violation of the public health law to give narcotics to known addicts but not to give amphetamines to known habitual users. Prior to his suspension Dr. Freymann had been on the staff of New York Medical College's Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals. In an interview in his office, the white‐haired doctor conceded that he had administered amphetamines to patients but vigorously denied that he had done it for improper reasons. “If I have used amphetamine, I have used it in a medical sense,” Dr, Freymann said. “I don't believe in hooking people on amphetamines.” Dr. Freymann praised the value of amphetamines in treating obesity, depression and what he called “just a tired, generally run down feeling.” “If a patient came to me and said ‘I want some Desoxyn because I'm tired,’ I'd give it to him,” Dr. Freymann said. He said the drug had acquired an undeserved bad reputation because people became addicted to it. “The addicts killed a good drug,” he said, noting that governmental controls on the drug are being tightened. “I have a clientele that Is remarkable, from every sphere of life,” Dr. Freymann said. “They all come to me.” He declined to name some of his more famous patients but added, “I could tell you in 10 minutes probably 100 famous names who come here.” A Kind of ‘Bar Hopping’ Several patients said they had gone not only to Dr. Freymann but also to Dr. Jacobson and Dr. Bishop. “If you wanted to make a big night of it,” one former patient recalled, “you'd go over to Max's and get a shot and then over to Freymann's and then down to Bishop's. It was just another kind of bar hopping.” Of the three, Dr. Bishop was, until a serious hospitalization, in 1969, regarded as perhaps the most avante garde. Whereas the other two treated mostly socialites and jet setters, Dr. Bishop attracted “far out,” underground film makers and entertainers as well as personalities such as Timothy Leary. According to his patients, Dr. Bishop's office was decorated in modish fashion and hung with huge abstract paintings. In the waiting room music was furnished either by an expensive stereo or a live guitarist. The office had a sauna for the usa of patients. The waiting room was often a meeting place for patients who, they said, smoked marijuana and discussed pop philosophy. Dr. Bishop was the cast physician for “Hair” when it opened in New York and is today still treating Michael Butler, the producer. “I'm still one of his patients,” Mr. Butler said. “He's kept me in good health. He's very heavily into vitamin shots.” Mr. Butler said he did not think the shots contained amphetamine. Mr. Butler said that when “Hair” had opened many of the actor's were hit by the Hong Kong flu and that Dr. Bishop had treated them all with “heavy doses of vitamins and they came through beautifully. The ‘Hair’ kids used to really love him.” Another patient of Dr. Bishop's, now a designer for major movie studio, told how his life was affected by amphetamines. ‘Looked Like the Best’ “I was working very hard and got quite tired,” he said. “A friend told me he had terrific doctor he went to to get vitamin shots every week. He was Dr. John Bishop. “I didn't know anything about speed or about this kind of doctor. If his office had been in some dingy back‐street place, I wouldn't have been there. But the place looked like the best kind of doctor's office with attractive, efficient nurses. “I just said my friend had, referred me. He didn't ask me what the problem was or ask anything about my medical history or even feel my pulse. I'd had vitamin shots before and it seemed like the usual thing—a big needle with brown fluid jabbed into your buttock. “But before the needle was half in, you got this terrific feeling, this rush. Your head was suddenly so clear. And you had this fantastic energy. I felt like I never had in my life.” The designer, who asked that his name not be used, said he started going every week, then twice a week. Within a few months, he said, “I had the feeling I couldn't face anything without it. By then I was going every day. The shots were $10 at first. Then they went up to $15. Then there was an extra‐special high‐powered one at $25.” Whenever he could not get a shot from one of the doctors, the designer said, he experienced severe withdrawal symptoms. “The crashing process is pretty bad—nausea, chills, sweating, headache, anxiety, a feeling of total despair. It's a matter of physical exhaustion. Sometimes you've stayed up for three or four or five days” Started Injection Himself Eventually, he said, visits to the doctors had become a bother and he had started Injecting himself. After a year he found himself unable to hold a job for long. “When you're on it [amphetamine], your whole life is your condition. ‘Have I taken enough? Should I take more? Where can I get more?’ You weren't even aware of who was President. President of what?” After four years on amphetamine, he abruptly quit taking the drug and endured the withdrawal symptoms. He went back to work and has remained off amphetamine ever since. Dr. Bishop, after his hospitalization, moved to California for a while and then returned to set up practice in Sag. Harbor. “I'm just a country doctor., I'm kind of passé now,” Dr. Bishop said. He said he had given up the too‐busy Manhattan pace for the more relaxed life of a small town. Dr. Bishop said the decision had come during his hospitalization, which he said had been the result of stab wounds sustained in a mugging. Others who know Dr. Bishop say he had a psychiatric breakdown. Dr. Bishop said that although he had given amphetamine injections in the past to treat obesity, he had never given the drug “the way Jacobson did.” Dr. Bishop acknowledged that his name had been linked with those of Drs. Jacobson and Freymann in the minds of some patients. “I found people were going to Freymann in the morning, Jacobson in the night and seeing me in the afternoon,” Dr. Bishop said. Dr. Bishop said some patients might have confused his injections with those of the other doctors because “it's possible to give people good feelings with vitamins, niacin, for example, without using amphetamine.” A Few Are Prosecuted Not all speed doctors remain in practice. A handful have been investigated, prosecuted and convicted of amphetaminerelated offenses. In each of these cases, however, the doctor in question sold large amounts of amphetamine to undercover agents. Because undercover Government investigators are normally prohibited from receiving injections as part of their investigations, they say it has been almost impossible to make cases against doctors who normally administer the drug in their offices and do not sell large amounts that patients can carry away. Dr. Jack Cohen of Great Neck, who sold hundreds of amphetamine capsules to an undercover agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, was convicted in Federal Court last July after pleading guilty. He was placed on two years' probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. Last September, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners revoked the license of Dr. Jules Bigliani, who had also sold large quantities of amphetamine to undercover agents. One doctor who both gave shots and sold large amounts of the drug was Dr. Alois Peter Warren of Manhattan. In 1971 he was found guilty of running what the court called “an amphetamine supermarket.” A Federal undercover agent had purchased a large amount of injectable amphetamine and 260 disposable syringes from Dr. Warren. Chiefly on the basis of the agent's testimony, Dr. Warren was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine. He is now in prison. Dr. Warren's lawyer, in an attempt to have the sentence reduced, told the court: “The crime for which the defendant stands convicted did not contribute to the very real social problem that we have in this country today, where drugs are made so easily available to our youth, the impoverished and minority “Looking at it in its worst light, Dr. Warren provided amphetamines for money basically to the wealthy Park Avenue jet set who knew what they were getting and were willing to pay for it.”"
Tristate Area Birth‐Rate Drop Called Aid to Orderly Housing,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/25/archives/tristate-area-birthrate-drop-called-aid-to-orderly-housing.html,"A drop in the birth rate may yield unexpected opportunities to organize the growth of the metropolitan area into population centers, avoiding the “urban sprawl” of growth in the nineteen‐sixties, the Regional Plan Association said yesterday. At the same time, the association warned that smaller families might lead to a greater per capita income and, as a result, more money spent by each person on automobiles, homes and other items damaging to the environment. The comments were contained in a new analysis of population trends in the city and 26 surrounding counties—stretching from Trenton to New Haven. Six years ago the association forecast a regional population of 30 million by the year 2000. Now it predicts a population of 24.6 million as “most likely.” Regional population growth will lag behind the national rate, the association said, because there are more single persons here, more women work here and therefore devote less time to child‐rearing, there is more access here to contraception and abortion, and migration into the region from the outside is likely to taper off. Among the possible effects of declining growth in the region, the following were cited: ¶The region's median age will rise from the 1970 level, of 30 to 35 by the year 2000—causing the “youth culture” to perhaps “give way to a more ‘mature’ atmosphere.” ¶Elementary‐school enrollment will decline slightly, but high school and college enrollments will jump greatly. ¶Smaller family sizes will lead to greater demands for apartments, rather than houses, and this could lead to less of a demand for “urbanized land.” The conclusion of the Regional Plan Association—a private research and planning agency—was to demand, as it has many times in the past, greater efforts to preserve undeveloped land and concentrate growth in regional population centers."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/27/archives/letters-to-the-editor-on-buying-producing-and-saving-energy-the.html,"To the Editor: In The Times of Feb. 26, Walter Levy, a leading oil economist, urged U. S. initiative to “create and coordinate a common approach on energy matters by major oil importing countries” against the “whipsawing” by oil producing countries working through the Organization of Oil Producing Countries. Without waiting for a common front, the U.S. is in a position to take unilateral action against the oil producers. Generally, the oil producing countries are backward agriculturally and industrially and must rely on the oil consuming countries for agricultural and industrial products. For example, Libya, a real tail twister, is, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce Daily, dated Feb. 23, urgently in need of 300,000 tons of wheat flour, 100,000 tons of semolina and 100,000 tons of milled rice. Why should the U.S. furnish these cereals, now very much in demand, without knocking down the cost of Libyan oil? Iran, presently looking for millions of dollars of U.S. military equipment, should be told to reduce its price on oil in return for getting additional equipment for its armed forces. The same policy should be applied to Saudi Arabia, another customer for military equipment. When the oil consuming nations present a hard‐nosed common front to the oil producing nations, as Mr. Levy rightly suggests, the, latter should be told in no uncertain terms that food, arms, replacement parts for oil production and refining equipment, etc., will be withheld if unreasonable demands are not scaled down. Only then will the energy problem become less urgent. HARRY N. AIZENSTAT Springfield, Mass., March 6, 1973 • To the Editor: Your Feb. 26 editorial “Gas From Siberia” made several important, valid points. We too believe that various alternatives should be explored. You have performed a most important service to the American public by pointing out some of these alternatives in your editorial. One provision of a national energy policy—something which is urgently needed to help solve our energy crisis —would be the alternative suggested in your editorial to provide prices for natural gas sufficient to step up greatly the domestic search for and development of this premium energy fuel. The petroleum industry does not generate nearly enough capital for this purpose. Companies in the petroleum industry averaged in 1972 a return of about 6½ per cent on total assets. Moreover, the repression of naturalgas prices by Federal regulation has distorted the total price structure of all forms of energy, stifled their discovery and development and artificially stimulated the demand for natural gas, our highest‐premium fuel. Placing reliance for energy requirements on the private‐enterprise system, with all forms of energy competing in the marketplace, would also help stimulate exploration for and development of crude oil as well as natural gas, building of needed new domestic refining capacity and research to bring other forms of energy into economic production. We need overseas supplies of energy, but we should maximize our own development. Preferential treatment for foreign supplies is unfair to this nation's energy industry and the country as a whole. W. F. MARTIN President and Chief Executive Officer Phillips Petroleum Company Bartlesville, Okla., March 1, 1973 • To the Editor: Economists have long recognized the need for special taxes in cases of external diseconomies, and would accomplish this through the tax system. But if this approach is unacceptable to the general public or to its political representatives, environmental groups can attain similar results through public relations campaigns, especially when the benefits to the individual and society can be documented. An example of such a campaign objective is to induce Americans to purchase a sub‐compact for the second family car. The advertising campaign should include estimated dollar savings to the average commuter and oil saving to the nation as a whole. Beyond that, the campaign could emphasize the energy costs and environmental hazards of driving the very heavy models as a “first car.” Moving to a more “costly” area in terms of consumer inconvenience, something should be done to stop the practice of individuals commuting fifty miles to and from work, each occupying one large car. This can be accomplished, the “European way,” ie., by closing certain city areas to private traffic and substituting mass transit or by levying very stiff parking or other taxes on the commuter. A tax of $100 per month would at least induce the formation of car pools. The automobile companies might well consider diverting some of their facilities to the production of mass transit equipments. Here the environmental campaign would have to be accompanied by intense lobbying activity. But this is money and energy better spent than stopping the trans‐Alaska pipeline. (Prof.) MORDECHAI E. KREININ Michigan State University East Lansing, Mich., March 16, 1973 The Future of Jerusalem To the Editor: Lord Caradon says in his March 10 Op‐Ed article about the status of Jerusalem: “The ideal of an undivided city, with an Arab Jerusalem ... and an Israeli Jerusalem ... and freedom of access for everyone to the holy sites, is rapidly gaining ground.” Can Lord Caradon claim never to have heard before of such an arrangement? Can he seriously write over his signature that this is a “new” idea that is “gaining ground”? Was this not the exact condition agreed to by all parties in the 1948 armistice agreement? What may have been a logical solution to all sides in 1948 cannot still be advocated as a logical or a just solution in 1973. Our opinion is now influenced by several factors. ¶The flagrant violation of this agreement by Hussein et al. No Israelis were permitted access to any holy site nor were foreigners admitted to these holy sites if they came from Israeli Jerusalem. ¶The exemplary way the Israel Government has maintained the holy sites of all faiths since 1967. How can the distinguished Lord Caradon seriously suggest that Israel cede sovereignty to Hussein because Lord Caradon is convinced that Hussein will surely now agree to “free access.” Incidentally, who or which international body gave Hussein sovereignty in Jerusalem in the first place? GARY EHRMAN New York, March 10, 1973 • Nonhazardous Backyards To the Editor: The Chrysler Corporation ad in your March 13 issue, protesting the 1975–76 Federal emissions standards for automobiles, states, “The vegetation in your backyard gives off as many hydrocarbons as the 1975–76 law permits your car.” While this may be true (I don't know), it stops far short of the whole truth. The hydrocarbons produced by cars include compounds which are carcinogenic (cause cancer) in animals and have been implicated as a cause of human cancer. To my knowledge, backyard plants have yet to be shown to produce any emissions hazardous to health. GORDON EDWARDS Assistant Professor of Pharmacology George Washington University Washington, March 14, 1973 • Pillar of Corruption To the Editor: The fixing of traffic tickets is corrupt act, one practiced secretly by insolent individuals who have promised to work in the public interest but instead use their power to benefit friends—doubtless in hope of receiving favors in return. When seeking office, these officials would not dare admit publicly to such deeds. Joseph J. Bryer, in his March 19 letter, ridicules Mr. Nadjari for having obtained the indictment of three Lindsay officials for having allegedly conspired to fix tickets. But what better way to start to root out corruption, long though the road be? Because it is so common, so ingrained, so readily accepted even by those sworn to uphold the law, ticket fixing in a sense legitimizes corruption and becomes one of the pillars on which the more dramatic farms of corruption rest. Guilty officials should be turned out, first because they have betrayed a trust, secondly because they have broken the law and thirdly because their acts tend to cause others to accept corruption and to act dishonestly. Mr. Nadjari doubtless will go after some big fish and so gain Mr. Bryer's approbation. The battle for integrity in government will not be won by battling million‐dollar bribe‐takers alone. The fight must also be directed against those officials who daily subvert their oath of office, thus helping to create the atmosphere in which corruption flourishes. WILLIAM R. BOWLER Hillsdale, N. J., March 20, 1973 Ode to the Windy City To the Editor: Mike Royko wrote a Feb. 27 Op‐Ed article implying that Chicago has the same problems as Nevi York and is as bad off. Well, what ate the facts? With only twice as many people, the budget of the City of New York is over seven times larger than Chicago's. The sales tax in the Windy City is 5 per cent, and it has no city income tax. Per capita income in Chicago in 1971 was 23.7 per cent above the national average. Food prices are at least 10 to 12 per cent cheaper. On the whole, the cost of eating out is twice as much in New York. As for the school system, the average high school graduate in Chicago has a two‐andone‐half‐year acumen over New York's in reading ability. As for public transportation, on all subways and buses in Chicago you find leather seats and backs. All are air‐conditioned. Furthermore, there is virtually no graffiti. I cannot drive a car (because of my eyesight), and I can't afford cabs, so I must use public transport. I can truthfully state that there is a tremendous amount of crime in the subways of New. York and that this is not the case in. Chicago. If anyone doubts me, all he has to do is to go to Times Square and purchase The Chicago Tribune. Just fifteen cents to prove or disprove my claim that in Chicago there is a surplus of lower and middle‐income apartments, and the rents are around 25 to 40 per cent cheaper. The cost of owning a phone in the big apple is nearly double, and in Chicago you pay only ten cents for a call, no matter how long you talk. This summer I will be returning to Chicago, having spent three years here. The Windy City may be a lousy place to visit, but what a nice place to live. I've looked at life from both sides now. DONALD JUREWICZ New York, March 7, 1973 Value of Farm Land To the Editor: Much agricultural land with a commercial or “fair market” value in excess of its value used as farm land is taken out of farming each year and put into commercial development after the death of the owner, as a result of the pressure on his estate to pay Federal and state estate taxes presently measured by its market value as commercial property rather than its agricultural use value. These pressures are a major cause of the disappearance of farms and rapid urbanization in many areas in the country, with attending undesirable environmental and other consequences. The present method of valuation of farm property on the death of the owner was instituted at a time when use value generally was the same as commercial value. If present estate tax pressure were not so onerous and unfair, much land woul'd continue for a longer time in farming with attending social benefits, Such as the preservation of open spaces, since many heirs to farms would continue farming and not sell out. Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota has introduced a bill, S. 1108, which would change the law to provide for valuation of farm property at farm value for Federal estate tax purposes. This proposal is a crucial piece of legislation for those concerned with the preservation of open spaces and of farm land in the United States and deserves, I believe, wide, support. HAROLD M. WIT New York, March 19, 1973 • Concern for Life To the Editor: Neil Kotler's concern for the life teeming in the ghetto, Appalachia and Vietnam is laudable indeed (letter Feb. 27). And perhaps he is justified in accusing the anti‐abortionist of being too exclusive in his defense of the unborn at the expense of the miserable people struggling to maintain their existence in a world beset with Poverty, injustice and war. But we shall never solve the violence in Attica, or Watts, or Hue, or the Sudan until we recognize and appreciate the value of human life, however humble or imperfect. What better place to begin than with the unborn? If life is so expendable in the womb, why not on the battlefield? It the Supreme Court can sanction destruetion for thousands of unborn under the guise of constitutionality, why is Mr. Kotler surprised when we bomb Hanoi, or Lieutenant Calley murders innocent civilians? “The North Vietnamese are life, the welfare mothers and children are life; and so, Mr. Kotler, are the unborn who are being so methodically suctioned, scraped or salted out of their mothers' wombs. JULIET M. McCARTHY Delmar, N. Y., March 4, 1973"
"Senate, by 72‐19 Vote, Passes Bill Challenging Administration on End of Health Programs",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/28/archives/senate-by-7219-vote-passes-bill-challenging-administration-on-end.html,"WASHINGTON, March 27—The Senate passed a bill today challenging the Administration's plans to end several major health programs. The vote was 72 to 19. If supporters of the measur can keep that margin they could override a possible Presidential veto. A nearly identi cal bill before the House has the unanimous support of the health subcommittee consider ing it, but the bill's prospects before the whole House are not yet clear. The bill passed today by the Senate extends for a year the Hill‐Burton program for hospital construction, the program of Federal aid to community mental health centers and several other programs, including the regional medical programs that came into being about seven years ago to help, bring the fruits of medical research to the aid of patients everywhere. The programs are scheduled to expire June 30. The Administration is insistent that they do so. The 1973 authorization level for the programs that are due to expire is $1.8‐billion. The Administration believes it would be wasteful to extend these for another year. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, chief sponsor of the bill, said the Administration had repeatedly romised to send alternative proposals to Congress but had never done so. The one‐year extension, he said, will give Congress time to draft better programs. The measure was passed after June 30 rather than a vote of 57 to 37, an amendment offered by Senator Edward J. Gurney, Republican of Florida, that would have extended the expiring programs four months after, the, senate rejected, by a full year. Supporters of the amendment said four months was enough time to draft alternatives. Senator Robert Taft Jr., Republican of Ohio, who supported the amendment, said the call for a one‐year extension was simply an admission that the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee had not done its job. “If we had, there would be no need for a blanket, automatic one‐year extension,” said Senator Taft, who is a member of the committee. Senator Kennedy, chairman of the committee's health subcommittee, said an extension of only four months would “strangle” the programs he was trying to save or revise. He said the one‐year extension would prevent a legislative logjam that would otherwise be inevitable because of the Administration's delays. The he bill was passed with one amendment, introduced by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, and itself amended by Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York. This amendment said that doctors and hospitals that receive Federal funds should not be obligated to perform abortions or sterilization operations if their religious beliefs or moral convictions forbade it. Senator Javits's contribution to this amendment was a statement that Federally aided hospitals having antiabortion or antisterilization policies should no discriminate against doctors on their staffs who took opposing views. Of the major programs that would be extended by the bill passed today, the Administration has been most critical of the region medical programs. In testimony before the Senate berger, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, said many of these programs had Burton programs, he said, have outlived their usefulness, while the community mental health centers program was essential ly a demonstration program that is no longer needed be. cause the demonstrations have been completed. Supporters of the extension, disagree with him and point to the support for the program by many national groups, in cluding the American Public Health Association, the American Heart Association, the As sociation of American Medical Colleges and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers. In testimony earlier, Mr. Weinberger attributed much of the support for the programs to what he called “the education‐health‐poverty complex.”"
Single but Not Alone: Adoption Brings Family Life to Unmarried,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/28/archives/single-but-not-alone-adoption-brings-family-life-to-unmarried.html,"WASHINGTON — “Adoption agencies,” the single parent said bitterly, “play God, and would rather give babies to a couple even though one‐third of present marriages end in divorce. My situation is stable and known, which is not true for a divorced parent, often living on $120 a week.” The speaker, who prefers to be anonymous, is a 50‐year old unmarried woman, a Government economist who adopted her daughter, now 2½ years old, privately when agencies did not respond to her requests. According to Karen Mitchell, head of the Council on Adoptable Children, which lists children available for adoption from agencies, there are 50 single men and women in the Washington area who, seeing matrimony pass them by, decided not to be deprived of parenthood as well (Estimates of single parents nationally and in such areas as New York are not available; one problem is that most figures include stepfather' adoptions of children of women they marry.) Mrs. Mitchell characterizes single parents as “strong psychologically,” able to overcome the social pressures against single parent adoption (including such suspicions as that the adopted child “is really their own, born out of wedlock”). Generally, the single parent is female, in her late thirties, has several brothers and sisters, and is a professional earning at least $12,000 a year. She adopts not out of loneliness but, as a male professor said, “out of a sense of fullness,” a desire to love. She sometimes rejects male suitors who feel put out that she chose a child rather than them. As single parents, they face special problems. One of them is explaining to the child that unlike most of his peers, he has no father (or mother); another is arranging for child care, a problem they share with all working mothers. “But what worries us all,” said Hope Marindan, 46‐year‐old mother of two adopted sons, a 2½‐year‐old MexicanAmerican and an 8‐month‐old of Tlingit Eskimo origin, “is who will take care of the child if anything should happen to the parent.” Single parents in Washington were jolted by the reality of this problem when one of them, Joan Doniger, was killed recently by an automobile. Her two adopted daughters, a 5‐year‐old Korean (whom Miss Doniger saved by throwing from her hands when the car struck) and a black, aged 2, were orphaned for a second time in their brief lives. Miss Doniger's will placed them with an older married sister, a working woman whose own family is already grown. Wills, in which the children are left with two‐parent guardians, and high insurance, so that the children will not be burdens to the guardians, are precautions that most single parents take. • But guilt does plague these single parents when their children ask. “Why don't I have a daddy?” A 41‐year‐old New York woman lawyer admitted in talking about her 2‐year old daughter that “my conscience does bother me; I love her, but it is not the best decision in her interest.” To compensate for the lack of a spouse, single parents seek extended families, whether relatives or friends, so that their children can have uncles and aunts if not fathers or mothers. Miss Marindan rationalizes her situation by noting the increase in “natural” single parent families through widowhood and divorce. “It seems quite possible to me,” she observed, “that losing a parent through death or divorce might often be considerably more traumatic for a child than not having one to start with.” But perhaps the greatest problem of single parents is finding the children they covet. Although there are no laws that prohibit single parent adoption, prospective single parents claim they are discriminated against because of age, sex, religion, race, nationality—but mostly because of traditional attitudes as to what constitutes a proper family. As birth control and legalized abortion have shrunk the reservoir of available infants, they must compete with the more socially desirable married couples for even the hard‐to‐place older, handicapped and transracial children. For some, the task has been easier than for others. Glenda McNeill, a professor of social work at Catholic University, read about San Diego's efforts with single parent adoption in 1965. Then 37, she applied to the District of Columbia's human resources agency, which had never before awarded a child without blood ties to an unmarried person. She obtained an 18‐monthold girl in December, 1966, and five years later adopted a 3‐year‐old girl. Miss McNeill had an easier time than most prospective parents, possibly be cause she is black, as are most children available for adoption. Two white male college teachers had no success with the Washington agency. A 41‐year‐old man was denied a hearing because his single status made the agency suspicious of homosexual tendencies. The other man, 35, who had taught in ghetto schools and is godfather to several black children, was rejected because he is white. Both men eventually found a sympathetic hearing with Lutheran social service agencies. The older teacher adopted a 7‐year‐old Sioux Indian boy from South Dakota about 18 months ago; the younger man's application is currently being processed. • Because of religious obstacles, Kathy Sreedhar, a 37‐year‐old Jew, flew to India, homeland of her deceased husband, to search for a daughter. Authorities there refused to give her a child because she was American, but she finally found 11‐month‐old Anita in a Catholic orphanage in Bombay, and brought her to the United States under the nonpreferential quota. Kathy was lucky that the Indian quota was undersubscribed because the United States Immigration and Nationality Act discriminates against single parents, permitting only a “U.S. citizen and his spouse” to bring in foreigners under age 14 without quota restrictions. To get around these legal obstacles requires imagination. Marjorie Margolies, 30‐year‐old television reporter for the National Broadcasting Company in New York, two years ago sponsored her 9‐year‐old Korean daughter, Leeheh, as a student and a year later adopted her. Miss Margolies admits that “I could not take a child hard to place because of hemophilia or other illness; but race or age are not problems.” Her criteria are shared by other single parents who, because they work, do not have the time to devote to the emotionally disturbed or chronically ill. Ironically, it is to find homes for these children that adoption agencies have revised policies against awarding children to single parents. Mrs. Peg Weingarten of Washington's Family and Child Services said that five years ago the agency made it a “positive policy to find homes for hard‐toplace and transracial children.” A spokesman for New York's Division of Adoption Services said that “what has driven us to accept single parents is that some older children need a father or mother figure and we are unable to find couples willing to take them.” Faced with the reluctance of agencies to aid them, almost half of the 10 single parents interviewed adopted. infants on the “gray market” through lawyers and doctors, paying the natural mother's medical bill, normal legal fees and transportation costs to pick up the child. As the men tend to adopt boys, so the women adopt girls, “for logistical reasons,” and to provide the child with an appropriate sex image. In addition, to create a more normal family life, most parents have or are trying to adopt a second child. Marjorie Margolies, in fact, has just returned from Vietnam where she found seven children she said were available for adoption. She plans to adopt one and is seeking potential parents for the others. (Leeheh's two older brothers, now 13 and 15, have also been found and Miss Margolies is trying to find parents for them). Adopting has changed the life‐styles of these single persons. • In order to earn more money, Glenda McNeill, who had been a social worker, became a professor of social work. She owns her own home, sends her daughter to private school and dancing classes, and pays for a part‐time sitter. Hope Marindan got an M.A. in Government and then switched from secretarial work to management analysis. In spite of their newly acquired de??endents, single parents are sanguine about marrying. They believe their opportunities are enhanced by a commitment to family life. As an added benefit, their children have become a way for them to meet other single parents—the widowed and divorced. Actually, some female single parents are not that eager to marry. One, a woman psychologist, asserted that marriage should be separate from the need for children. “In terms of child‐rearing, a spouse is not always a plus,” she said. She and others view themselves as the reverse of the married woman who, at 40, when her children are grown, casts about for a career. Their attitude is, “I have done everything I wanted to do; now I decided to have a family.”"
RIGHTS OF WIVES BACKED IN BONN,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/29/archives/rights-of-wives-backed-in-bonn-bill-says-they-may-retain-names-and.html,"BONN, March 28—The Cabinet today approved the draft of a bill to reform marriage laws that would establish the equality of the sexes in terms of family names and the right of a woman to work. Present law gives the male partner the right to impose his name on his wife whether she wants it or not and to insist that she stay at home and run the household. The draft bill would make West Germany outstanding in some areas of marriage legislation while allowing it to catch up to foreign countries in other respects. The main figure behind the draft bill is the Minister of Justice, Gerhard Jahn. Comparing the bill to practices in other countries, Mr. Jahn said that it was also progressive in regard to support costs and equal rights to pensions in the case of divorced couples. Support Linked To Earning The bill, expected to be passed by Parliament some time next year and to go into effect in 1975, links support cost and pension responsibility to the earning ability, rather than to the sex of the divorced partners. However, it requires a husband to contribute to the further education of his divorced spouse if she happens to be the economically disadvantaged partner, as is most often the case here. The bill also foresees equal benefit for thi divorced partners from social security, medical insurance and other rights earned during the marriage. Mr. Jahn said that the new principle of “disintegration” of a marriage as the basis for divorce, instead of the traditional “guilt” principle, was an area in which West Germany had to “catch up to other countries.” Under the new law no blame would be cast on either partner in a marriage and the legislation will determine only who should pay what to whom. While Mr. Jahn appears to have widespread backing for the reform, he is a figure of extreme controversy in the issue of the abortion legislation in West Germany. He has been pictured in pro‐abortion posters with the belly of a pregnant woman. For the last three years he has firmly opposed proposals to permit abortions in the first three months of pregnancy, demanding instead a so‐called “indication” regulation in which physicians would determine whether a prospective mother should bear her child."
‘Bridget Loves Bernie’ Dropped From C.B.S. Schedule for Fall,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/30/archives/-bridget-loves-bernie-dropped-from-cbs-schedule-for-fall.html,"“Bridget Loves Bernie,” “The Doris Day Show,” “Mission: Impossible” and “The New Bill Cosby Show” have been dropped from the Columbia Broadcasting System's primetime schedule for the fall. The decision to drop “Bridget Loves Bernie” was “absolutely removed, independent, and disassociated from criticism of the show from some Jewish groups,” said Robert D. Wood, president of the C.B.S. television network, yesterday. The program had been attacked by several groups as being offensive to Judaism because its plot line centers on the marriage of a Jew and a gentile. C.B.S. said that the criticism “had been limited to a very small, though articulate group” and that it had received fewer than 200 letters of complaint, compared with 6,000 letters from viewers who objected to the abortion episodes on “Maude.” The Bill Cosby show was the victim of poor audience ratings, as were “Mission: Impossible,” which has run on the network for seven years, and “The Doris Day Show,” which has been on for five seasons. Replacing the departing programs will be “Cojack,” featuring a detective hero created by Telly Savalas in the C.B.S. special “The Marcus‐Nelson Murders” three weeks ago; “Calucci's Dept.,” with James Coco, a comedy involving a state employment office worker in New York; “Roll Out!” a World War II comedy starring Stu Gilliam, and “The New Adventures of Perry Mason,” a reincarnation of the Erie Stanley Gardner series about the criminal lawyer, on the network for several years. Additionally, James Stewart will appear in an occasionally presented, 90‐minute series called “Hawkins” in the 9:30 P.M. time slot that will mostly be occupied by “The New C.B.S. Tuesday Night Movies.” John H. Mitchell, president of Screen Gems, producers of “Bridget Loves Bernie,” said yesterday that “it is entirely possible, and we are doing everything to make it happen, that the program will be picked up by one of the other networks.” The American Broadcasting Company and the National Broadcasting Company are expected to announce their new season schedules next week. “M*A*S*H,” the comedy about Korean War medics now seen on C.B.S. Sunday nights, will move into the 8:30 Saturday time period vacated by “Bridget” in the fall. Almost all of the other shows now seen on C.B.S. will be back next season. They include “The Waltons,” “Canon,” “Maude,” “All in the Family,” “Barnaby Jones,” and the shows starring Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball."
PENNSYL VANIA'S BAN ON ABORTION VOIDED,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/30/archives/pennsylvanias-ban-on-abortion-voided.html,"PHILADELPHIA, March 29 (AP)—The State Supreme Court struck down Pennsylvania's antiabortion statutes today and overturned the conviction of a physician whose patient died after an abortion. The state's highest court, in a 5‐to‐2 decision, said that the two antiabortion sections of the state criminal law were similar to the Texas antiabortion statutes that were overturned in January by the United States Supreme Court. “Because we deem the difference between the Texas and the Pennsylvania statutes inappreciable, we hold that Section 718 and 719 are unconstitutional,” Chief Justice Benjamin R. Jones said in his majority opinion. A court source said that the ruling meant there “is no statute at this point” on the books in Pennsylvania. The ruling came on two appeals, one by the state against a Centre County Common Pleas Court ruling that Section 718 was unconstitutional. The other was an appeal by Dr. Benjamin A. King, who was convicted in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court of performing an abortion that resulted in the death of his patient."
"Parent and Child: “Catch 22 for mothers” (cont.); And Catch 23, 24 25, 26...",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/01/archives/article-9-no-title-a-bill-of-goods-and-catch-23.html,"“Catch 22 for mothers” by Dr. Sally E. Shaywitz, which ran in this Magazine March 4, provoked an unusual outpouring of letters from women. (As we went to press, there had been no letters from men.) Dr. Shaywitz, pediatrician and mother of three young sons, described the agonizing choice many educated women have to make between the careers they were trained for and the children they yearn for. Society has imposed a choice— between work and motherhood — that admits of no satisfactory solution. Many women resent the decision that faces them. Some women like the status quo. Others are superwomen who flourish on combining motherhood and marriage and career. Others regret being forced to do it. Some regret their “retirement” to motherhood. Others rejoice in it. A significant number of women feel the time has come for men to share in the nurturing of children. The letters that follow are a sampling. The best of all possible worlds Sally, baby, everything's going to be O.K. I traveled much the same route 17 years ago. During the time my three children were infants, toddlers and school‐age, I suffered the same Pangs of fear and remorse. I am now convinced that ‘the route I took of full‐time pediatric practice and parttime mothering was really best for all concerned. I have sent one son off to college. The two who remain at home are developing independence at an alarming rate. So don't worry. It is really true that quality of mothering can substitute for and may be better than quantity of time spent with children. The advantages are many, including giving them earlier independence, setting. model of work and study in the home by both parents and fulfilling the intellectual need of the mother who can let her kids go and know there will not be a yawning void created by her having nothing to do when they leave. It works out better for all concerned —husband, wife and children, MARJORIE J. MCKUSICK, M.D. Chairman, Delaware Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics. Wilmington, Del. The monotony of a career I am a lawyer and come from family of professional people, but count the happiest and most satisfying and most fulfilling years of my life the 20 years I spent as a suburban housewife and mother. I loved taking care of my children, being needed by them, keeping house for them and my husband, being part of a community. Now my children are grown and gone, and I am a working lawyer. I go to work every morning and solve a few problems for somebody. And there are a dozen or so more problems lined up to be solved the next day and the next. What's so fulfilling about that? M. WALLACH Bayside, N. Y. The real Catch 22 The complete nonappearance of the word “father” in an essay on childrearing, exceeding 2,000 words in length, is astonishing. Why is it only working mothers who are being deprived of the delights of early childhood that Ms. Shaywitz bemoans so grievously? JEANNE TASHIAN Ann Arbor, Mich, The customary nonparticipation of fathers in parenting is the real Catch 22 for mothers. The more sensitive feminists have advocated liberation from our fixed roles, yet society, if it is in fact pushing mothers into a dual role, has not yet dreamed of suggesting that fathers play a dual role also. The male power structure has rarely suggested that male employes be permitted to have days off with a sick child, or work three days a week instead of five for two years as women are expected to do. The idea is not to reverse roles, but to share. The reason, I submit, that this kind of flexibility has not been created for fathers is that they, and we, all know that staying home with a child is not all glowing mothering. It is also cleaning house, washing dishes and clothes, and myriad other mindless tasks. The solution is not to insist that all women have overwhelming maternal instincts which cannot be compromised by combining them with another satisfying facet of our lives; the answer is to do an equal sales job on paternal instincts, recognize that it might be fantastic for both baby and father if he reports the first smile and first word, and if he knows it's a drag some days. SALLY HOWE POLLAK, M. Ed. Westford, Vt. And where in this article are the men? How is it they do not agonize over these choices? Dr. Shaywitz does not name the many alternatives, parttime jobs for men and women, so that they might more equally experience career and family life. There are endless plans we could create if society could understand and tolerate the dualism of women (and men I might add) that tells them to love and care for their offspring as well as love and care for themselves and the world. JOAN JANIAK Syracuse, N. Y. Nobody told me Although I nursed my baby, I never heard the various put‐downs Ms. Shaywitz describes. But I did discover something nobody ever talks about—the mother‐infant relationship is wonderfully erotic. The sensation of nursing is another kind of orgasm. IMOGEN HOWE West Redding, Conn. “just” a wile and mother As a R.N. for six years before the birth of my daughter, I was well aware of where I stood in society's complex structure. Little did I know what was waiting for me in the world of motherhood. Being asked about the latest in medical science at a social gathering has been replaced by terrific guilt feelings when no one is appreciative of the latest cleverness of my 21‐monthold. Where I once strolled freely in and out of all the local stores, I am now confronted with signs, “No strollers or carriages allowed.” When it was once R.N. in the “fill‐in‐your‐occupation” blank, it is now housewife. How many more times am I going to be asked what I do all day? And when am I going back to work? It is hard to swallow the fact that I'll get more recognition if this letter is published than in a lifetime of motherhood. LINDA D. STUPSKI, R.N. Westport, Conn. Ever since I stopped working five years ago to enjoy my pregnancy and remain home until I no longer feel needed (21 years or more?), I have become very defensive of my position as wife and mother. Relatives, friends and strangers repeatedly ask me if find my life a challenge now. I have always hoped that wives and mothers would consider fulfilling these roles their more important purpose and challenge—instinctively. SUSAN PARK UTZ Groton, Conn. Now, about that maternal instinct The feminist movement only advocates that expert and skillful programs be made available for infants of mothers whose reactions to motherhood are not as joyful and contented as one would hope. I still recall the sullen disappointment of one young mother who had left a promising career in publishing to bear a supposedly much‐desired child. Providence be thanked that her husband could afford the services of the calm and gentle governess they'd hired. This young mother's first comment to us as we paid our “baby admiration visit” was, “How old does it have to be before I can tell it to shut up or I'll kill it?” JULIA WILKINS KAY, M.A. New York, N. Y. The derogation of the parent's role, about which Dr. Shaywitz complains, is precisely what the Women's Movement is opposed to. Parenting is essential and valuable, and should be considered as such. However, whether or not to be a fulltime parent must be a choice: many women do not have so strong a “maternal instinct” as has Dr. Shaywitz. Dr, Shaywitz runs down the feelings of her peers who want to work.. CYNTHIA ELLEN HARRISON Verona, N. J. There is no evidence for hereditary, built‐in urges toward nurturance of the infant among the higher primates. Harlow's work with monkeys has shown that females who have had little experience of such nurturance themselves show little interest in their own offspring. The ample reports on the “battered child syndrome” indicate that not all human mothers show an instinct for nurturance. Admittedly, such cases in both monkeys and humans are the result of a pathological environment. Nevertheless, they demonstrate that the concept of a nurturant instinct which is “built into” the female and which works itself out without regard to her environment is dubious There is a great deal of evidence that nurturant behavior is not limited to females. Physiological psychologists have shown that there are areas concerned with maternal behavior in the brains of both male and female rats. The ability to nurture in higher animals is neither an instinct nor limited to females. It must be learned and can be learned equally well by either sex. Experts such as Margaret Mead have shown that differences within one sex between cultures are greater than the differences between the sexes within a culture. In fact, humans, among the primates, share only with the hamadryas baboon the extreme dif‘ ‘ I would like to suggest that the impossibility of getting an adequate mother surrogate or of raising a “nondeviant” youngster has been greatly exaggerated. Fathers can be adequate mother surrogates. One goal of Women's Liberation is the liberation of men in our culture so that they too can be permitted to share in the satisfactions of nurturance. The inability of males to openly express their emotions is one of the tragedies of modern society. RHODA K. UNGER, Ph.D. Department of Psychology Montclair State College Upper Montclair, N. J. A bill of goods In recent years, the emphasis on professional fulfillment for women has been so great that female undergraduate and graduate students with whom I've talked have often been close to despair over the seemingly irreconcilable choices of serious career versus marriage and motherhood. Even among the married, abortions for career reasons have become common — with the frequent aftermath of doubt and depression. We are guilty of trying to sell the American woman a bill of goods; first, prior to the nineteen‐sixties, the extreme of the homemaker, then, from the sixties on, the gray‐flannel‐suited professionally fulfilled career woman. Many educated women have not bought anybody's stereotype. At our career counseling service, which is geared to educated women (many of whom have a choice about whether to work and how much) approximately 80 per cent of our 3,000 clients to date have requested part‐time work or study, because of their desire to mother intensively. Much of our counseling focuses on the individual woman's right to work out her own human values and resulting balance of roles. CYNTHIA S. PINCUS A.C.S.W.

Westchester Women Testify on Employment Bias,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/01/archives/westchester-women-testify-on-employment-bias.html,"WHITE PLAINS, March 31 A series of public hearings designed to document cases of discrimination against women in Westchester has begun with several dozen women testifying about their experiences with employers and in the courts. One of them, Paulette Morse, a recent college graduate who organized the hearing on employment, told of being asked by one employment agency interviewer after another whether she had her husband's permission to go to work, and even what method of birth control she used. A woman who testified anonymously and identified her employer as a large food products corporation in Westchester said she was told, “We've never had a woman as a product manager and we never will until the courts force us to.” Ann Singsen said she had been dismissed from her teaching job at Valhalla High School at the end of her fourth month of pregnancy. She was reinstated only after her husband, a lawyer, threatened to bring a suit. Employers attitude toward pregnancy, and their refusal to treat pregnancy as simply temporary medical condition, constitutes “the greatest single case of sex discrimination in employment,” Brenda Feigen Fasteau, coordinator of the women's rights projects of the American Civil Liberties Union, told the hearing. The hearings, begun this week at Eistview Junior High School, are sponsored by the Westchester Civil Liberties Union and the White Plains Commission on Human Rights. Arthur Kellman, the commission's chairman, told the audience of about 100 on the first night that the purpose of the hearings was both to redress individual grievances and to provide an impetus for new legislation. Preston David, executive director of the New York City ‘Commission on Human Rights, cautioned that “change cannot come about with voluntary agreements, but only through strong enforcement action.” The White Plains commission, unlike its New York City counterpart, has no legal power to enforce its decisions. Mr. David brought with him the 800‐page record of five days of hearings on discrimination against women in New York City in 1970. In preparation for the hearings, the Westchester Civil Liberties Union had sent 450 major Westchester employers questionnaires on their employment policies relating to women. Only 47 of the companies responded: such corporations as I.B.M., General Foods, and American Telephone and Telegraph did not answer. Even based on the scattered returns, the picture Was “far worse than we expected,'. according to Barbara Rosen, who conducted the survey. Twothirds of all the female employes covered in the survey were in clerical positions. According to Joyce Levin of the Westchester Civil Liberties Union, 74 per cent of all working women in Westchester earn less than $8,000 a year, while only 25 per cent of the men earn so little. Three per cent of the women and 30 per cent of the men make more than $15,000 a year. “The waste of human resources in Westchester is a loss to all of us, and particularly to women,” Mrs. Levin said. The next hearing, on Tuesday, will cover women and social services, including child care, abortion and welfare. On Thursday the hearing will cover housing, credit and insurance. Both will take place at the Eastview Junior High School, starting at 8 P.M."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/03/archives/letters-to-the-editor-a-nation-retreating-from-integration.html,"To the Editor: The March 3 news article on the tragic public school integration problems of Charlotte, N. C., cites local and regional factors underlying recent violent behavior of black and white students toward each other. Omitted was any mention of the effect of the national mood and attitude toward racial integration upon the children in integrated classrooms. The miracle is that the young of both races have behaved as well as they have, given the character of our national “leadership” in this matter. What “message” is being signaled from Washington concerning the future of public school integration? An appallingly large number of nationally prominent leaders have made it very clear that they oppose busing, yet a few minutes’ reflection confirms that we cannot obtain any meaningful degree of school integration without transporting children out of their segregated neighborhoods. These national leaders, including (tragically) our President, have signaled loud and clear that what they really oppose is racial integration. Those who doubt that this signal has been received at the local level (with devastating results) would do well to discuss the matter with blacks or with whites who are actually involved in racially integrated situations. Nor is this all. The Department of Justice has intervened in several suits on the anti‐integration side, and the House passed a viciously anti‐integration bill last session. This is an extraordinarily serious matter, for the impression is being created by some of our national leadership that the high‐water mark of racial integration has been passed, that support for it has evaporated, that it was a mistake to go this far, that retreat is now in order. Those of us with children in integrated classrooms view this with ‘deep alarm, as our children are in reality hostages to the nation's policies. Many cities have been integrated —it isn't just Richmond and ‘Charlotte, but a score more, involving literally millions of urban children now in integrated classrooms. Their educational, social and physical wellbeing are in grave danger if a national retreat takes place, destroying the justification for what has already taken place and creating a mood of recrimination and racial polarization. What has happened in Charlotte is just the leading edge of the storm we can expect if the nation turns back at this point, disavowing further progress and creating conditions undermining the safety and well‐being of these children. A high order of national leadership is now required. Despite the inflamed rhetoric and clichés of the recent political campaign, the American people still possess a deep reserve of humanity, of goodwill, of concern for their fellow citizens, of enlightened self‐interest, a reservoir available to leaders willing to speak to the people in terms of our real problems, real possibilities and real choices. A. JARRELL RAPER, M.D. Richmond, March 17, 1973 ‘May God Forgive America’ To the Editor: Stephen O. Voysey has it all solved when he writes (letter March 20) that by the Court's decision “the responsibility for intelligent and reasoned decisions now rests with the individuals who will be directly affected by the abortions.” Surely the unborn child is not given the right to make intelligent and reasoned decisions: and yet who is more “directly affected by the abortions""? The would‐be‐mother continues to live; yet the about‐to‐be born human person is destroyed. To see this as “a sound compromise” is clear evidence we are “reduced.” May God forgive America. (Very Rev.) ROGER MERCURIO Congregation of the Passion Chicago, March 21, 1973 On Serving Justice To the Editor: I would like to respond to Mr. Thomas O'Flaherty's March 23 letter, “Our Abused Jurors.” I also recently completed two weeks of jury duty, and I emerged with different impressions. Although much time was spent sitting and waiting, I did not think the two weeks was a waste of time. As Mr. O'Flaherty said, serving as jurors is for many people their only contact with the administration of justice, and I found it to be a fascinating and awesome experience. And when I did get on a jury, it took all of my abilities to decide my vote on the guilt or innocence of a fellow human being. I did not find that my time and abilities were misused, and I did not leave feeling apathetic. On the contrary, I left with a new determination to be more widely read and more knowledgeable on today's issues and with a greater interest in law and government than I had before. As for the money, I believe it is paid to jurors so that poor people can serve without too much financial hardship. RUTH CAREY New York, March 23, 1973 The Graffiti Nightmare To the Editor: Has our transit system and city government not been asleep at the obvious switch, the subway yards, in controlling the graffiti nightmare? The Mayor's report in The Times of March 28 says that not only will it cost the city more than $10 million to clean up the mess if it can but that now they will begin policing the subway yards, where the dirty work obviously begins. Millions of New Yorkers who are forced to ponder this graphic assault on their sensibilities daily have put two and two together long ago. Government seems to have realized this $10million later. Is Manhattan on the rocks? One begins to suspect that it is when, singly or in groups, teen‐aged and sub‐teenaged barbarians can keep the city in a state of siege, visible insult piled on visible insult. To those of us who love our city and are proud to show it off, the spectacle is an extreme embarrassment, which it is obviously intended to be. Are we really so helpless? BLANDINIA B, DAMS New York, March 28, 1973 Peril in the Sky: The Doldrums To the Editor: Last Dec. 29 almost a hundred New York passengers bought death tickets to the Florida Everglades aboard Eastern Air Lines flight 401. That Lockheed 1011 cost about $15million. Litigation will range in the hundreds of millions. Might a $500 gadget have kept all safe? Since Eastern's pilots, Robert Loft and Albert Stockstill, failed to react to altimeters, “pilot error” becomes obvious. The flight recorder heard the audible alarm at 1,700 feet but neither pilot responded. Crew member Angelo Donadeo survived to report, “There was never any alarm or concern in the cockpit.” Picture it: A $15‐million jet is flying into the ground and two superb pilots simultaneously quit seeing and hearing instruments. They're not even concerned. Were both pilots slipped a Mickey? Biometeorology has deciphered that Mickey. Webster clues us in doldrums: (1) Dullness; state of listlessness and boredom, (2) A part of the ocean near the equator abounding in squalls. The two go together, and blometeorology has shown that human reactions relate to electrical forces accompanying squalls. This science deals in earth's electrical phenomena (electrostatic/magnetic/ionic environments) and their effects on mentality. H. Kdnig, physicist of the Meteorological Institute at Hamburg, Germany, summarized hundreds of thousands of observations to show that with three‐to‐five cycle per second electrical variations human reaction time is increased 40 per cent and light perception is similarly decreased. These electrical waves penetrate large buildings. Prophetic words come from S. W. Tromp, head of the Bioclimatological Research Center, Leiden, the Netherlands: “It seems reasonable to predict that air ion control of living and working spaces will become routine practice, finding acceptance as an important element in promoting health and comfort. It may well prove to be vital factor in establishing optimal environmental conditions for occupants of submersibles and sealed space cabins.” Can pilots be immune? The Luftwaffe thought not and installed electric field devices in World War II bombers. Eastern officials, briefed in March and June of 1972, did inspect one electric field device, but they made no aircraft applications. They still haven't. A DoT/F.A.A., May 1972, Report NA 72‐19 states, “Ionization of the atmosphere in aircraft may be an important factor... in the effective functioning... of pilots,” but top F.A.A. scientists, denying their own competence, have effected neither study nor remedy. Are they too busy flying their own jets to spend “scarce medical research dollars""? E. STANTON MAXEY, M.D. Certified Flight Instructor Stuart, Fla., March 30, 1973 Why Americans Leave To the Editor: In his March 10 letter, G. F. Bush anticipates the imminent return of Americans from “Merry Old England,” where they have fled to escape “crime, taxes, strikes and other alleged defects of the United States.” As an English graduate student studybig American history in this country, I find Mr. Bush's thesis both superficial and naive. Most Americans who have taken the serious decision to leave their home country and settle elsewhere do sq, after much soul‐searching and ex tremely painful thought. While their reasons are varied, I have yet to find an American expatriate who has left because of material or physical (ilk comfort, i.e. to escape taxes and strikes. They leave for much deeper and more serious reasons. They leave because this country refuses to acknowledge that every American deserves, as a right, decent medical care; because they are sickened by the implication that poverty is somehow inherited and that people who collect welfare checks are defective charity cases: ‘because policemen carry guns and don't hesitate to use; them in a society where violence is way of life. Finally, they leave because the rampant materialism they see in every TV commercial and every second‐hand car, dearly bought, in the driveway :of middle‐class homes, signifies that not only poor Americans suffer under the yoke of consumerism par excellence. America has been good to me: If has enabled me to continue my education and to meet some marvelcius people. I do not wish to pretend that, England offers a truly viable alternative to the American expatriate—it doesn't. We have our fair share of materialism, racism and demeaning welfarism, but in this case it is “scale""’ with which I am dealing. Maybe this letter was not really’ necessary as Anthony Lewis on the same day provided an admirable answer to Mr. Bush's assumption that the “natives” will soon return. The 1972 statistics speak for themselves:  DIANA KEALEY Stony Brook, L. I., March 12, 1973 The Birdman of Brooklyn  To the Editor: Having recently purchased a home in the Sheepshead section of Brooklyn, I decided to take a crack at one of my lifelong desires: to attract birds to my home. Three bare pear trees stand in MY backyard, in an area roughly thirty square feet. The very day that my wife and I came to look at our neW castle, I saw an unusual number of delicate purple finches perched in the trees. The idea was immediately sown; I would create a feeding station for both migratory birds and the few varieties that winter here. From the start, my new hobby was more than a pastime; it was almost an obsession. For about fifty birds who frequented the yard, I began to make my bird feeders out of any available material. A trip to the library got me off to a good start and I have been learning ever since. Cutdown coffee cans do very nicely, as long as the seed remains dry. After experimenting with one feed after another, I gave my friends a diet of mixed grains (bird seed) and a mixture of peanut butter and cornmeal. Between January and March my bird population gradually tripled; so did my enthusiasm. Each morning, if the weather is clear, I am visited by a pair of married cardinals at 6:415 A.M. By 7 there are at least fifty male and female purple finches, about a dozen nuthatches with their turtleneck sweaters on, three garrulous bluejays, thirty sparrows, two mourning doves, ten or twelve starlings and a woodpecker in a pear tree (a little downy). When I return from my work at 3:30 P.M., I head straight for my rear bedroom window, which gives an excellent overview of the action. Now that spring is near, some grackles, redwings, cowbirds and a pair of orioles have joined my band of merrymakers. After nearly ten years of yearning, my dream is finally realized. I am the Birdfeeder in the Rye. For me there is no greater pleasure than to start the day with a glimpse at my wards, while I nurse a cup of coffee. With the window blind half open, the birds light on the upper branches of the tree without seeing me. They are so close that I am beginning to imagine that I perceive changes of expression on the downy faces. Yes, Nature still lives in Brooklyn; in my three pear trees.

CONNECTICUT RULE ON ABORTIONS UPSET,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/05/archives/connecticut-rule-on-abortions-upset.html,"NEW HAVEN, April 4 (UPI) —Judge John O. Newman ruled in Federal district court today that Connecticut must pay for a welfare recipient's abortion if a doctor certifies that it is necessary. Catherine Roraback, a lawyer, filed the request for court order on behalf of an anonymous welfare recipient. The suit was based on a recommendation that the woman needs an immediate abortion. The state has refused to pay for abortions for welfare recipients since a March 13 State Welfare Department ruling. WPOP, reported that in the 10‐month period from May, 1972, to March, Yale‐New Haven hospital had performed 671 abortions on welfare recipients. The station said that the abortions were performed during the time that the state's statute was in effect technically, pending a ruling on the constitutionality of the law. The state's Welfare Commissioner, Nicholas Norton, declined to comment on whether) the 671 abortions met the requirement that the life of the mother must be in danger for them to be legal. Despite the United States Supreme Court's ruling that struck down the Georgia and Texas abortion laws, Connecticut's statute is technically still on the books. Meanwhile, a radio station,"
FOE OF ABORTIONS OFFERS NEW BTUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/06/archives/foe-of-abortions-offers-new-bills-legislator-acts-to-provide.html,"ALBANY, April 5—Senator James H. Donovan, Republican of Chadwicks and a major opponent of abortion, held a public hearing today on a package of bills he is sponsoring that he hopes will provide women with alternatives to abortion. Last year, Mr. Donovan spon: sored a bill to abolish the state's liberalized abortion law, which permits a woman to have an abortion on demand until the 24th week of pregnancy. It passed, but was vetoed by Governor Rockefeller. This year, Mr. Donovan promised to again bring out a bill to reinstitute the state's old abortion statute, allowing abortions only when a mother's life is in jeopardy. However, the recent United States Supreme Court ruling that in effect upheld the liberalized law, made such a gesture futile. Mr. Donovan's new tack to discourage elective abortions is his series of bills to encourage women to carry their pregnancies to full term. The Donovan bills would do the following: ¶Require health‐insurance policies to cover all maternityrelated costs and eliminate current “discrimination clauses in terms of benefits as it relates to pregnancies.” Mr. Donovan noted that a number of insurance policies provided full expenses for termination of pregnancies but only a small portion of the expenses involved in the birth of full‐term babies. ¶Allow the Commissioner of Health to establish, at a cost of $20‐million a year, centers throughout the state to provide medical and psychological services, legal counseling andl other aid relating to pregnancy.) ¶Permit the state to provide unspecified grants to persons who adopt children born with substantial mental or physical handicaps. ¶Create a “Congenital Defects Rehabilitative Fund” to assist in the prenatal and postcongenital defects and their mothers. Mr. Donovan said he did not know at this time what the costs would benatal care of children with. ¶Appropriate the sum of $800,000 for financing a state share of the birth‐defects institute. One of those at the hearing, Beekman Pool, director of the Legislative Information Service of the State Communities Aid Association, a voluntary statewide organization, said that while the intention of the bills was “commendable,” they “fail"
"Firm Congress Stand on Jews in Soviet Is Traced to Efforts by Those in U.S,.;",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/06/archives/firm-congress-stand-on-jews-in-soviet-is-traced-to-efforts-by-those.html,"WASHINGTON, April 5—At a tirne when the Nixon Administration is dominating Congress on most domestic and international issues, Congress seems to have gained the upper hand on a key question of foreign policy—the linking of a trade agreement with the Soviet Union to the problems of Russian Jews. Vast majorities in both houses of Congress have demonstrated that they are prepared to block any trade concessions until Moscow agrees to let Jews and others emigrate without paying high exit fees. Seventy‐four Senators led by Henry M. Jackson and 268 Representatives led by Wilbur D. Mills have agreed to sponsor legislation to that effect, not just vote for it. Undoubtedly, a sizable number in Congress are seriously concerned about, the problems of Soviet Jews and believe that the United States Government should apply pressure on Moscow to permit them to emigrate freely. Nonetheless, it was apparent from interviews with Senators and Representatives and their aides, and with Jewish leaders, businessmen and Administration officials, that such solid Congressional support could not have been mustered were it not for the organized political activities of American Jews. The Administration, which believes that the matter of the Soviet Jews is essentially an internal problem, is concerned that a confrontation with the Soviet Union on the issue could complicate the whole movement toward improved American‐Soviet relations—a keystone of President Nixon's foreign policy. But Congreis — spurred by Jewish organizations and legi&lators who work closely with them — is so firm on the question that top Administration, officials have made it clear to Moscow that there will be no trade agreement unless the policy of taxing emigrants is changed. The Jewish organizations used a tactic that dozens of other interest groups—the gun lobby, for instance—have used successfully ion. Capitol Hill: They generated a considerable amount of grassroots pressure on individual senators and representatives. The phenomenon is a fact of life in this city, where thousands of lobbyists, representing a staggering array of interests, are constantly seeking to influence Congressional action. The American Jews who are exerting organized political pressure on the issue are not motivated by personal gain or economic advantage, tlie‐ reasons for mosticibbying in the capital. Rather, Roman Catholic groups that lobby against abortion and environmentalists who put pressure on Congress to act against pollution, the, Jews are acting on what they see as humanitarian principles. The treatment of Russian Jews has weighed heavily on American Jews for generations. Today there are many who feel anger, even guilt, because they believe that their fathers and grandfathers did not do enough about the plight of the Jews in Russia and the slaughter of Jews by the Nazis. When the Russians began last August to impose steep taxes on th'ose who wished to emigrate, there was a sense of outrage among American Jews and a belief in many quarters that the increasing political strength of the Jewish community should be used to change the policy. The political power of the 5.8 million American Jews has two principal sources: First, Jews tend to be regular and conscientious voters, and their votes can mean the difference between victory and defeat in many key industrial states. Second, many Jews are dependable contributors to campaign funds. Moreover, through a network of Jewish organizations and publications, individual Jews are kept informed of national political issues and can he encouraged to convey their views to their political representatives. Javits Speech Ignored In theory the Soviet emigration tax was intended to make those who leave repay the socialist state for the cost of their educations. In practice the fees — ranging into the tens of thousands of dollars and far beyond the means of most Russians — apply principally to Jews, a highly educated minority, many of whom want to emigrate. At about the time the education tax was levied, United States officials were negotiating a comprehensive trade agreement with the Russians. Under it MosCow promised to pay its Lend‐Lease debt to the United States. In return the Administration pledged to seek Congressional approval of legislation granting nondiscriminatory tariff rates — most‐favored‐nation treatment — for Soviet products as well as credit guarantees that would help the Russians pay for American goods. There is disagreement over who originated the idea of linking the trade agreement with the problems of the Soviet Jews. The first public mention came. Aug. 30 in a short speech that ‘Senator Jacob K. Javits gave at a small rally in New York. His remarks got little coverage in the press and went almost unnoticed here, but brick had been set in place in what rapidly became a solid wall of Congressional opposition to entering the trade agreement without a satisfactory resolution of the emigration matter. In September staff members of key Senators ‐‐ Mr. Jackson, who is a Washington Democrat; Mr. Javits, New Yorkl Republican; Abraham A. Ribicoff, Connecticut Democrat,’ and Hubert H. Humphrey, Min‐II nesota Democrat — discussed actions Congress could take to force the Russians to change their policy. Each Senator had been a Istrong supporter of Jewish, causes and had received considerable election support from Jews. Their staff members—Richard Perle for Senator Jack(son, Alfred A. Lakeland for Senator Javits, Morris J. Amitayl for Senator Ribicoff and Richard Gilmore for Senator Humphrey — had worked closelywith Jewish interests, especially on matters concerning Isrel, over the years. Throughout the discussions the staff aides kept in touch with I. L. Kenen, chief lobbyist in Washington for causes of special interest to American Jews, and Jerry Goodman, executive director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, an umbrella group composed of 34 national Jewish organizations ‐‐ the American Jewish Committee and B'nai B'rith, for instance — and at least 200 local Jewish agencies. Mr. Kenen and Mr. Goodman were important to the Senators because, with their contacts and mailing lists, they could generate grass‐roots support fore actions the Senators favored. On Sept. 26 about 120 leadlers of Jewish organizations met here to discuss the issue of the Soviet Jews: Mr. Goodman, who had called the meeting, said it was held in Washington to “sensitize Congress to the issue.” Senator Jackson, spoke, and the group endorsed his legislative proposal in principle, although it did not agree to specific language. Calls began going out to round up support. In the next week senators reported receiving 20 or 30 letters a day on the issue; others told of visits or telephone calls from Jews in their states who had been active in their election campaigns. Mr. Javits, who had still not found a draft of the Jackson proposal he could accept, was visited by a group led by Rabbi Gilbert Klaperman, head of the New York City chapter of the Conference on Soviet Jewry. The early drafts, the Senator explained, to the consternation of some of those who came to his office, would be “unnecessarily irritating” to the Nixon Administration. By early October Senators Jackson and Ribicoff had gathered 32 co‐sponsors for their legislation, which they offered as an amendment to an East. West trade bill. The assembly or sponsors was a show of strength rather than a serious legislative move since it was known that the bill would not reach the Senate floor before adjournment. Javits Adds to Roster Then Senator Javits agreed to support a modified amendment and brought in 30 more senators as co‐sponsors. Later the number of sponsors went tip to 76 ‐‐ more than three‐quarters of the Senate—and Mr. Jackson introduced his amendment on the Senate floor. “Why did so many people sign the amendment?” a Northern Senator asked rhetorically. “Because there's no political advantage in not signing. If you do sign, you don't offend anyone. If you don't sign, you might offend some Jews in your state.” Last year no serious effort was made to gather support for the amendment in the iflouse of Representatives, but an intensive drive began’ early this year. On Jan. 18 Mr. Kenen, executive vice chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Corn mittee, sent an urgent letter to about 1,000 Jewish leaders across the country. It included a list of 144 representatives who had agreed to sponsor a move identical to Senator Jackson's and said: “If your congressman has not yet joined in co‐sponsorship, will you please urge him to do so without delay.” Most of those who received Mr. Kenen's letter—his mailing) list has been carefully cultivated over the years — were in position to pass the word to hundreds of others. By the third week in January there were few representatives who had not received dozens of letters and calls from important constituents. At the same time Mark E. Talisman, an assistant to Rep resentative Vanik, an Ohio Democrat, began calling every member of the House in search of co‐sponsors. By early February he had gathered 238 names, more than a majority. It was then that Mr. Vanik took the measure to Mr. Mills, Demo corat of Arkansas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and asked him to be the chief sponsor. Mr. Mills agreed, announcing his position on the House floor on Feb. 7. Mills's Support Crucial Mr. Mills was won over because he was presented with a fait accompli — a majority behind a piece of legislation. As a Congressional aide put it, “When there's movement in the House, Mills knows how to step to the front.” His strength is such that, without his support, a measure involving trade is unlikely to reach the floor for a vote; with his support, passage is likely. In the Senate, the groundwork having been laid, it took only two weeks for Senator Jackson to get 73 other sponsors for his proposal this time, and the measure was reintroduced on March 15. Some who refused to join in sponsoring the amendment were subjected to pressures from friends and contributors at home. No Real Lobbying For example, Senator William B. Saxbe, Republican of Ohio, the only member of Congress who has spoken out publicly against, the move, was asked to a breakfast meeting in Columbus with Ohio Jewish leaders. The meeting was arranged by Leon Friedman, preslident of the Columbus Savings and Loan Association, who is one of the Senator's oldest and closest friends. Mr. Friedman, former president of B'nai B'rith in Columbus, said he had been asked to call the meeting by Jewish friends in Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Toledo. Senator Saxbe refused to switch, remarking after the meeting: “I just can't believe how astonished they were that they didn't change my mind.” He believes that a trade agreement with the Russians is too important to risk by meddling in what he sees as a domestic problem. Close followers of the issue in the Administration and on Capitol Hill agree that the White House has done no real lobbying. Peter G. Peterson, former Secretary of Commerce, who played the leading role in negotiating the trade agreement and in explaining it on Capitol Hill, went out of the Cabinet early this year. After that, according to Administration sources, no one at the top level concentrated on the issue for some time. Peter M. Flanigan, President Nixon's assistant for international economic affairs, did talk privately with a few Senators, as did Henry A. Kissinger, the President's national security adviser. They argued that the problem could be more readily settled with quiet diplomacy than with legislation. Furthermore, enough public statements were made by such officials as Secretary of State William P. Rogers that congressmen were aware of the Administration's concern. However, no effort was made to persuade rank‐and‐file senators and representatives to oppose the Jackson amendment. An Administration expert commented that the time was not ripe for legislative activity because the trade bill to which the Jackson‐Mills‐Vanik measure would be offered as an amendment had still not even been submitted to Congress. Another expert put forward another explanation for the Administration's stance: Mr. Jackson is one of the few Senators with direct access to Mr. Nixon, and any Presidential aides who took him on direct‐’ ly “might get their legs cut out from under them by the President.” Whatever the reason for the Administration's inactivity, its officials have been explaining to the Russians that there is no chance of getting the mostfavored‐nation agreement through Congress until the emigration question is settled. According to a reliable AcV.,” ministration official, Charles W. Colson, then a Presidentig aide, impressed that point Ori: Vasily V. Kuznetsov, Deputy’ Foreign Minister, during a visit to Moscow in February. George, P. Shultz, Secretary of the Treasury, made the same point when he went in March. ‘ The Administration source quoted Mr. Kuznetsov as telling Mr. Colson: “We will do out part.” When Vladimir S. AlkhimoV; Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and the head of delegation that recently visiited the United States, met with Mr. Mills, according to Congresional aides, Mr. Mills told him’ that 350 representatives would: vote to block the trade measure if the exit tax was still in force but that if the tax was repealed, most‐favored‐nation treatment would be approved. ‘My job,” Mr. Alkhimov is said to have replied, “is to tell Moscow that.” Since mid‐March the Soviet Government has been overlooking the emigration tax for a sizable number of Jews who could not afford it. Though the action seemed to be a response to the attitude in Congress, the leaders of American Jewish organizations are not convinced that there is to be a wholesale waiver. “We don't want to rub their noses in it,” Mr. Kenen said. “If they can find a face‐saving way out, that's fine. But I can promise you that we'll keep the heat on at home until we're satisfied that anyone who want to can leave Russia?’ The New York Times"
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/06/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"The Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday to require President Nixon to get specific Congressional approval before giving foreign aid to North Vietnam. The 88‐to‐3 vote was also a warning that the Senate would be unlikely to approve such aid, which the President favors. As one of the limitation's three opponents put it, “This is telegraphing the punch that ‘there ain't gonna be no aid.’ “ [Page 1, Columns 2–3.] President Thieu said he would “never, never” ask the United States to send troops back to South Vietnam. In his first American public appearance, a speech and news conference in Washington, Mr. Thieu said his Government could survive a North Vietnamese invasion. [1:4.] South Vietnam reported several major Communist attacks. The attacks, in the Mekong Delta and the Central Highlands, were described as “preliminary activity that some Government officials think will be followed by a sustained offensive. Some American officials, however, were skeptical that drive would be mounted of the dimensions of last spring's Communist offensive. [5:1.] In a rare legislative setback, President Nixon's desire for a Soviet‐American trade agreement has been blocked by determined Congressional majorities who have made it clear they will approve such an agreement only if Moscow lifts its high exit fees aimed at emigrating Jews. And behind their determination is an effective lobbying effort by American Jews. [14:1–8.] National The rate of inflation for the first three months of 1973 was the highest since the Korean war on the basis of the wholesale price index, which rose at an annual rate of 21.5 per cent. That was a big climb from the already high annual rate of 9.6 per cent, for the final quarter of 1972, and enough to start talk of possible restrictions on exports to increase supplies of some products. [1:7–8.] L. Patrick Gray 3d asked President Nixon to withdraw his disputed nomination as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and White House officials said the President would grant the request. It was not immediately known whom Mr. Nixon would nominate in his place, but there are reportedly only two candidates—Henry E. Peterson, a career Justice Department lawyer, and Federal Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. of Los Angeles. [1:1] Indian and Government negotiators signed a formal agreement to end the occupation of Wounded Knee, S. D. Under the terms of the agreement, militant Indians who seized the hamlet two months ago will surrender their arms this weekend. In return, a Presidential commission will study treaty rights of the Oglala Sioux and the Government will investigate the operations of the Pine Ridge Reservation. [1:6.] President Nixon vetoed a bill that would have forced him to spend $120‐million that he had impounded last January. In vetoing the bill for a rural water and sewer grant program, Mr. Nixon def6nded his powers of impoundment on Constitutional grounds and said that the bill would have led to further inflation or higher taxes. [1:7.] Metropolitan Boycotting housewives won their first victories with the announcement by two supermarket chains, Grand Union and Big G, that meat prices were being cut. In crediting the boycott with causing its 10‐cent‐a‐pound reductions, Grand Union warned that a long boycott wetild be self‐defeating by discouraging production: [1:8.] Charles J. Urstadt has resigned as State Housing Commissioner. Mr. Urstadt, who said he had submitted the resignation three weeks ago, did not hear that Governor Rockefeller had accepted it until after it was learned that Mr. Urstadt had acquired an interest in Douglas L. Elliman & Co., a major city real‐estate concern. [1:2–3.] The estimated cost of rebuilding Yankee Stadium has jumped almost $7‐million in less than a year, according to Mayor Lindsay, who put the new estimate at $27.9‐million. Mr. Lindsay, who said the rebuilt stadium would be the finest in the country and “very cheap at the price,” described the increase of more than 30 per cent as “routine—a modest escalation.” [1:5.] A hearing officer for Chancellor Harvey B. Scribner has concluded that Luis Fuentes, the controversial superintendent of Manhattan's school district 1, is “at the present time, neither a bigot nor a racist.” Several groups had accused Mr. Fuentes of anti‐semitism.

"After Five Years, Cooke Still Relishes His Pastoral Role",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/07/archives/after-five-years-cooke-still-relishes-his-pastoralrole-a-demanding.html,"Terence Cardinal Cooke was doing what he likes to do best — mixing with people. For more than an hour one night recently he stood in the black‐and‐red robes of his office in the gymnasium of Stepinac High School in White Plains while an accordionist turned, out such songs as “I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing” and several hundred volunteer workers in the Catholic Charities drive filed by to greet him. Many bowed to kiss his ring. Some were invited to pose by his side for a photograph. All got a smile and a cheerful word. “Nice to meet you, Bill,” he told one man. “Give my best to everyone in Tuckahoe.” “You're from Katonah?” he remarked to another happily. “As Katonah goes, so goes the nation!” A Demanding Assignment To Cardinal Cooke, such public appearances are the most enjoyable part of being Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York — a demanding post that he assumed five years ago this week. “It's fun going out and seeing people,” he said in an interview at his residence behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. “They shape you and their response makes the job bearable.” During this period, the 52‐year‐old Cardinal has built a reputation as an able administrator, a dedicated pastor to the “people of God” in New York and a cautious progressive who has patiently implemented the numerous liturgical and other reforms mandated by the Second Vatican Council of 1962 to 1965. “He has moved with the times and made the changes that were necessary,” said Msgr. James G. Wilders, pastor of St. Thomas More Church in Manhattan, “He works untiringly for the sick and poor and retarded. He is strong and firm, yet always gentle.” On the other hand, critics, especially some younger priests, have accused Cardinal Cooke of making changes only when pressured to do so, of failing to exercise leadership on moral and social issues and of pursuing personal loyalty and the appearance of outward tranquility at the cost of vitality. “The archdiocese has gone through a Nixonization process,” said a priest in the chancery. “The brakes have been put on the movement. The Cardinal has surrounded himself with conservatives who never rock the boat. You never hear from the people who five years ago were a source of energy and dlan.” The Archbishop of New York is the spiritual leader of 1.8 million Catholics from Staten Island to. Dutchess, Sullivan and Ulster Counties. He oversees 408 parishes, 398 elementary and high schools and 203 charitable organizations and supervises the work of 1,938 priests. He is automatically an important figure in the American hierarchy and a spokesman for the Catholic Church in national affairs. Cardinal Cooke, who rose to power through a series of chancery posts, succeeded Francis Cardinal Spellman, who ruled the archdiocese from 1939 until his death in 1967. Bishop Cooke was installed At a service in St. Patrick's Cathedral on April 4, 1968, that was attended by the late President Lyndon B. Johnson and other dignitaries. In his inaugural address, Cardinal Cooke set the tone for his administration — a commitment to serve the poor, a strong pastoral orientation and a preference for strengthening existing structures, rather than building new Ones. “Let us improvii% the institutions and structures that have served us so well, making them glow with a rekindled spirit of love,” he declared. Since then he has pushed through numerous administrative reforms, including the establishment of a research office to gather data for planning, the consolidation of administrative facilities and the publication, of the first archdiocesan financial report: Early in his tenure, Cardinal Cooke made a decision to fight for the survival of the financially troubled parochial schools. One step was the creation of a Commission for Inter‐Parish Financing, which last year raised $2.9‐million in assessments from wealthy parishes and distributed it among 53 others that were having financial problems. At the suggestion of an advisory committee, the archdiocese's department of education was enlarged and asked to develop the concept of “total religious education,” including new programs for Catholic children in public schools. One result has been the hiring of 78 full‐time religious‐education coordinators in local parishes. Pastoral Challenge In 1970 a study conducted by consultants to the archdiocese, from Columbia University reported that morale among archdiocesan clergy was low and that almost half of local priests had thought about leaving parish work. It cited, loneliness, frustration in their Work and lack og support from superiors as major factors. With the cooperation of the Senate of Priests, Cardinal Cooke took steps to correct this situation. An elected panel of six priests, first envisaged by Cardinal Spellman, now makes recommendations on pastoral assignments. Other moves included modification of the seniority system in naming pastors, retirement plan and the establishment of six‐year terms for pastoral assignments. In making such changes, Cardinal Cooke's biggest assets have included a capacity to work long hours and an outgoing personality with wide appeal among the laity. “He's a people's cardinal,” said Jerry DeNicola, a member of the Church of St. Gregory the Great in Harrison. The Cardinal also is regarded as an effective fundraiser. “He's the kind of guy who can pat you on the back until the change falls out of your pockets,” said one pastor. Cardinal Cooke describes himself as simply a highranking pastor. “My job, first and foremost, is to be a shepherd — and servant of God's people,” he said. “I have no other desire or purpose in life.” On the other hand, some members of the Senate of Priests have expressed irritation at the slow pace of development of a new system of due process within the archdiocese and at the Cardinal's refusals to criticize the war in Vietnam and to speak out on the issue of amnesty. “He thinks that he's provided leadership on issues of war and peace, but he hasn't,” said the Rev. Raymond M. Rafferty, 34‐year‐old chairman of the elective body. Some priests have complained that the personnel board, while effective in filling existing posts, has not addressed itself to the most urgent need — the developanent of entirely new forms of ministry. Others have expressed disappointment that eleven “vicars” appointed to represent the Cardinal in various sections of the archdiocese have been given no seal decision‐making authority. Most fundamental has been the accusation that Cardinal Cooke has not been able to communicate any vision of where the church should he going in the postVatican Two period. “He hasn't got a message,” said the Rev. Robert L. Stern, who recently resigned as head of the SpanishSpeaking Apostolate. “The archdiocese is drifting.” Outside the archdioese, the image persists among someobservers that New York has been slower than other sees in moving away from the quasi‐monarchial image of the bishop that prevailed generally before Vatican Two. “You don't have a meeting with the Arhcibishop of New York,” one bishop said. “You have an audience,” Policies Defended In the interview, Cardinal Cooke replied that he sees as many people as his crowded schedule permits and expressed confidence that New York has kept pace with the trend toward more democratic decision‐making procedures in the church. “We've certainly had lot of discussions,” he remarked. “We take the championship for that.” Others say that the charge of lack of vision is misguided. The Rev. George Kelly, pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in Manhattan, contended that Cardinal Cooke's emphasis on pastoral activities was exactly what the church needed following a time of considerable upheaval. “The parish is about basics,” he said. “It's there that we worship, educate, take care of the sick and build our community. We haven't been doing this as well as we did in the years when we were a struggling church. The Cardinal has sensed the importance of building this up.” Although most observers believe Cardinal Cooke's policies within the archdiocese have generally been in line with the style of his predecessor, his role beyond New York is thought to be radically different. Cardinal Spellman was an avowed ecclesiastical and political conservative and a close friend of Pope Pjus XII who dominated the affairs of the American Catholic Church for a generation—and who was thought to have exercised considerable influence outside it. Cardinal Cooke said he disavowed an interest in the methods attributed to his predecessor. “I don't wartt to be a politician,” he said. “I've got enough problems.” Interviews with political figures tended to bear this out. “You used to hear semisnide references to the chancery as ‘the Powerhouse,’ “ said one well‐known city official. “Now you never hear the word.” Leader Against Abortion Within the state, Cardinal Cooke has been a major Catholic spokesman in the fight against abortion and in the quest for aid to parochial schools. The fact that the church's position has thus far not prevailed on either issue, however, has been widely interpreted as a sign of the chancery's decreased political muscle. On the national level, John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, is generally regarded as the key figure politically, but Cardinal Cooke is regarded as important because of his apparent friendship with President Nixon. The President appointed Cardinal Cooke to the Presidential Task Force on International Development, which made recommendations on foreign‐aid policy. Last year, reportedly at the initiative of Patrick Buchanan, a White House staff member, Mr. Nixon wrote to Cardinal Cooke expressing his opposition to abortion reform. Cardinal Cooke is personally popular among his fellow American bishops, and he has earned a reputation as an enthusiastic worker who can be depended on to carry out whatever duties he assumes. He was chairman of a commission that took on the highly complex task of developing a system of uniform accounting for American dioceses and he has emerged as a leader of the national anti‐abortion drive and as a spokesman for the hierarchy on tax credits for parents of children in nonpublic schools. Despite his personal populality, however, Cardinal Cooke has not emerged as a major national leader of the church. He fared poorly in last year's election for president of the bishops conference, and he was not a member of the American delegation to the 1971 Synod of Bishops in Rome. One reason for this, one bishop said, is that “there's a general suspicion of New York among the bishops, especially in the Midwest. They want to make sure that no one ends up running the whole ship the way Spellman did.” Several sources have observed that Cardinal Cooke's efforts have generally involved managerial matters or issues on which the bishops were unanimous, rather than controversial topics. “He's not an idea man, but he is awfully good at pushing through ideas that he has adopted,” said a bishop. Cardinal Cooke indicated that this was in keeping with his own inclinations. “When I take on a job I try to do my homework,” he said. “But I don't think that my key role is to be a leader in national or international affairs.” He acknowledged that during the next five years he must deal with serious problems. The future of parochial schools is uncertain. Mass attendance and seminary enrollments are down. He is under increasing pressure to give more recognition to Spanish‐speaking Catholics, who now make up about half of New York Catholics. The Cardinal expressed confidence, however, that the archdiocese had the resources to meet these challenges and said that he regarded his primary task as one of “educating” local Catholics about the teachings of the church and how to apply them.” “The church is developing and growing all the time,” he said. ‘There are signs of real spiritual growth. There is a new social consciousness and a fervor about real participation among the laity. We're entering a new springtime.”"

One step was the creation of a Commission for Inter‐Parish Financing, which last year raised $2.9‐million in assessments from wealthy parishes and distributed it among 53 bthers that were having financial problems. At the suggestion of an advisory committee, the archdiocese's department of education was enlarged and asked to develop the concept of “total religious education,” including new programs for Catholic children in public schools. One result has been the hiring of, 78 full‐time religious‐education coordinators in local parishes. Pastoral Challenge In 1970 a study conducted by consultants to the archdiocese from Columbia University reported that morale among archdiocesan clergy was low and that almost half of local priests had thought about leaving parish work. It cited loneliness, frustration in their work and lack of support from superiors as major factors. With the cooperation of the Senate of Priests, Cardinal Cooke took steps to correct this situation. An elected panel of sit priests, first envisaged by Cardinal Spellman, now maim recommendations on paitoral assignments. Other moves included modification of the seniority system in naming pastors, a retirement plan and the establishment of six‐year terms for pastoral assignments. In making such changes, Cardinal Cooke's biggest assets have included a capacity to work long hours and an outgoing personality with wide appeal among the laity. “He's a people's cardinal,” said Jerry DeNicola, a member of the Church of St. Gregory the Great in Harrison. The Cardinal also is regarded as an effective fundraiser. “He's the kind of guy who can pat you on the back until the change falls out of your pockets,” said one pastor. Cardinal Cooke describes himself as simply a highranking pastor. “My job, first P and foremost, is to be a shepherd — and servant —of God's people,” he said. “I have no other desire or purpose in life.” On the other hand, some members of the Senate of Priests have expressed irritation at the slow pace of development of a new system of due process within the archdiocese and at the Cardinal's refusals to criticize the war in Vietnam and to speak out on the issue of amnesty. “He thinks that he's provided leadership on issues of war and peace, but he hasn't,” said the Rev. Raymond M. Rafferty, 34‐year‐old chairman of the elective body. Some priests have complained that the personnel board, while effective in filling existing posts, has not addressed itself to the most urgent need — the development of entirely new forms of ministry. Others have expressed disappointment that eleven “vicars” appointed to represent the Cardinal in various sections of the archdiocese have been given no real decision‐making authority. Most fundamental has been the accusation that Cardinal Cooke has not been able to communicate any vision of where the church should be going in the postVatican Two period. “He hasn't got a message,” said the Rev. Robert L. Stern, who recently resigned as head of the SpanishSpeaking Apostolate. “The archdiocese is drifting.” Outside the archdioese, the image persists among someobservers that New York has been slower than other sees in moving away from the quasi‐monarchial image of the bishop that prevailed generally before Vatican Two. “You don't have a meeting with the Arlicibishop of New York,” one bishop said. “You have an audience.” Policies Defended In the interview, Cardinal Cooke replied that he sees as many people as his crowded schedule permits and expressed confidence that New York has kept pace with the trend toward more democratic decision‐making procedures in the church. “We've certainly had lot of discussions,” he remarked. “We take the championship for that.” Others say that the charge of lack of vision is misguided. The Rev. George Kelly, pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in Manhattan, contended that Cardinal Cooke's emphasis on pastoral activities was exactly what the church needed following a, time of considerable upheaval. “The parish is about basics,” he said. “It's there that we worship, educate, take care of the sick and build our community. We haven't been doing this as well as we did in the years when we were a struggling church. The Cardinal has sensed the importance of building this up.” Although most observers believe Cardinal Cooke's potitiesvithin the archdiocese have generally been in line with the style of his predecessor, his role beyond New York is thought to be, radically different. Cardinal Spellman was an avowed ecclesiastical and political conservative and a close friend of Pope Pius XII who dominated the affairs of the American Catholic Church for a generation—and who was thought to have exercised considerable influence outside it. Cardinal Cooke said he disavowed any interest in the methods attributed to his predecessor. “I don't want to be a politician,” he said. “I've got enough problems.” Interviews with political figures tended to bear this out. “You used to hear semisnide references to the chancery as ‘the Powerhouse,’ “ said one well‐known city official. “Now you never hear the word.” Leader Against Abortion Within the state, Cardinal Cooke has been a major Catholic spokesman in the fight against abortion and in the quest for aid to parochial schools. The fact that the church's position has thus far not prevailed on either issue, however, has been widely interpreted as a sign of the chancery's decreased political muscle. On the national level, John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, is generally regarded as the key figure politically, but Cardinal Cooke is regarded as important be cause of his apparent friendship with President Nixon. The President appointed Cardinal Cooke to the Presidential Task Force on International Development, which made recommendations on foreign‐aid policy. Last year, reportedly at the iniative of Patrick Buchanan, a White House staff member, Mr. Nixon wrote to Cardinal Cooke expressing his opposition to abortion reform. Cardinal Cooke is personally, popular among his fellow American bishops, and he has earned a reputation as an enthusiastic worker who can be depended on to carry out whatever duties he assumes. He was chairman of a commission that took, on the highly complex task of developing a system of uniform accounting for American dioceses and he has emerged as a leader of the national anti‐abortion drive and as a spokesman for the hierarchy on tax credits for parents of children in nonpublic schools. Despite his personal popularity, however, Cardinal Cooke has not emerged as a major national leader of the church. He fared poorly in last year's election for president of the bishops’ conference, and he was not a member of the American delegation fo the 1971 Synod of Bishops in Rome. One reason for this, one bishop said, is that “there's a general suspicion of New York among the bishops, especially in the Midwest. They want to make sure that no one ends up running the whole ship the way Spellman did.” Several sources have observed that. Cardinal Cooke's efforts have generally involved managerial matters or issues on which the bishops were unanimous, ‘rather than controversial topics. “He's not an idea man, but he is awfully good at pushing through ideas that he has adopted,” said a bishop. Cardinal Cooke indicated that’ this was in keeping with his own inclinations. “When I take on a job I try to do my homework,” he said. “But I don't think that my key role is to be a leader in national or international affairs.” He acknowledged that during the next five years he must deal with serious problems. The future of parochial schools is uncertain, Mass attendance and seminary enrollments are down. He is under increasing pressure to give more recognition to Spanish‐speaking Catholics, who now make up about half of New York Catholics. The Cardinal expressed confidence, however, that the archdiocese had the resources to meet these challenges and said that he regarded his primary task as one of “educating” local Catholics about the teachings of the church and how to apply them. “The church is developing and growing all the time,” he said. “There are signs of real spiritual growth. There is a new social consciousness and a fervor about real participation among the laity. We're entering a new springtime.” The New York Times"
New Techniques Monitoring Fetus Seek Birth of Healthier Babies,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/07/archives/new-techniques-monitoring-fetus-seek-birth-of-healthier-babies.html,"The human fetus, which for millenia has gestated undisturbed in the womb, is being probed, photographed and otherwise monitored by medical researchers whose goal is the birth of healthier babies. Using a variety of new gadgets and tests to unveil secrets formerly locked within the womb until birth, researchers are devising faster, more accurate methods for diagnosing abnormalities early in fetal life and for checking on the development of the fetus at critical points during pregnancy. The ever‐closer scrutiny pf the fetus is aimed at preventing the birth of infants with severe defects and saving the lives of those jeopardized by adverse conditions in the womb. Some of the techniques under study may make it possible one day to operate on the fetus or treat it for lifethreatening diseases long before it must face the stresses outside the womb. Pioneering Research Much of the pioneering research in fetal development has been done at the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, a leading center for research in obstetrics and gynecology throughout its 23‐year history. There, an obstetric team spent the last five years putting together an extensive “atlas” of fetal development using ultrasound, a simple, harmless method that applies the echo principles of the Navy's sonar to monitor the growth of the fetus. There, too, an obstetrician has devised a scope that goes directly into the womb to examine the young fetus. At his office at Downstate, Dr. Carlo Valenti, a spry, slight doctor who looks and acts 10 years younger than his 48 years, could scarcely contain his excitement as he described his latest research achievement, the endoamnioscope, as he calls it. Dr. Valenti's scope, developed with the aid of optical engineers, is a prototype instrument for directly viewing, photographing’ and taking skin and blood samples from a fetus 14 to 16 weeks old. The instrument, the doctor said, could be used to examine the developing fetus visually for gross, physical defects, such as anencephaly (lack of a brain), and to analyze its blood far such inherited disorders as sickle‐cell anemia and hemophilia. Dr. Valenti's initial studies on fetal blood are published in the current issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The scope, through which the doctor can take a biopsy of fetal skin, could also be used to improve the accuracy of prenatal, diagnosis of birth defects, Dr. Valenti said. He explained that current methods use cells floating in the amniotic fluid, ‘and occasionally the mother's cells are mistaken for fetal cells; making the diagnosis meaningless, Safety Tests Begun But with a direct fetal biopsy, which snips off it piece of skin about one millimeter square from an innocuous place, such as inside the upper arm, “there can be no mistake,” the doctor said. He added that skin cells grow much more rapidly than cells from the amniotic fluid, making a diagnosis possible within two days instead of the current three to four weeks. Dr. Valenti's scope is a tubelike device about a quarterinch in diameter, containing optical fibers that transmit the image, a light source and a biopsy tool. Although he is seeking further miniaturization of the instrument, Dr. Valenti has begun safety tests on pregnant women who are scheduled for abortion. So far, the scope appears to cause no serious harm to the fetus or the pregnancy, he said. Diagnosis by ultrasound, first applied to obstetrics eight years ago by a Scottish obstetrician, Ian Donald, has now become a routine procedure in many medical centers throughout this country and abroad. At Downstate the other day, a sonography diagnostician, Shirley Staiano, scanned the abdomen of a woman soon to have her first child. The woman's pbstetrician had thought her uterus was too small for the supposed 38 weeks of pregnancy and wanted a check on how the fetus was developing. From the 10‐minute scan, Miss Staiano discovered that the fetal head was indeed the right size for 38 weeks, but the body seemed too small. Preventing Stillbirths Dr. James H. Nelson Jr., chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Downstate, explained that possibly the Placenta was not giving the fetus enough nourishment to insure proper growth. Combining the information obtained from the sonogram with the results of other chemical tests could indicate the advisability of delivering the baby early instead of waiting for labor to begin, he said. Such an approach, he explained, can help prevent stillbirths and infant death shortly arter birth. Another of the hundreds of patients being examined at Downstate by sonography is a woman who has no pituitary gland and who was induced to ovulate with drugs. At eight weeks’ pregnancy, the songgram indicated a possibility of twins, confirmed by a second sonogram at 10 weeks that clearly showed two gestation sacs, each containing a fetus. Miss Stalano said this patient would be monitored monthly by ultrasound to be sure her fetuses continue to develop normally. Dr. Nelson explained that such early diagnosis of a muttiple pregnancy was impossible by any other means, and that repeat examinations by X‐ray give less information about the fetus and are potentially dangerous. Thus far, he said, there is no indication that sonography causes any harm to the mother or her unborn child."
On to Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/08/archives/your-move-kissinger-on-to-mediterranean.html,"Early this year Atlantic City's Commissioner of Public Works proposed an ordinance to change the names of two of that resort city's oldest thoroughfares. The proposal might well have been adopted had the thoroughfares not been Baltic Avenue and Mediterranean Avenue, because those two names also represent properties on the board of “Monopoly,” America's most successful board game. Commissioner Arthur Ponzio thought it would be less confusing to the tourists to change the real Baltic and Mediterranean to Fairmont and Melrose (the names of their lengthier extensions) apparently believing that nobody would really care. Commissioner Ponzio was wrong. Within days he received a letter from Edward P. Parker, the testy president of Parker Brothers in Salem, Mass., the manufacturers of “Monopoly,” who advised Ponzio to reconsider. His proposal could shake the very foundations of American tradition. “Would you like to be the man to tell a ‘Monopoly’ fanatic from California that the streets he came to see no longer exist? Would you be willing to take the responsibility for an invasion by hordes of protesting ‘Monopoly’ players, all demanding that you go directly to jail—without passing Go?” as Parker put it. The Commissioner received many other angry letters of protest, and, in the face of such opposition, withdrew. This defense of the integrity of the game was, of course, part publicity, but also part daffy board‐game enthusiasm. More “Monopoly” sets—seventy million—have been sold since 1935 than any other modern board game. Many new games on the market are based upon the principles of “Monopoly,” principles that also reflect some of the values of our society. One reaches a goal by the acquisition of as much property as possible, in a highly competitive system in which poverty and failure are synonymous. Luck is more of a factor than moral rectitude. “Chutzpah” is one of these new board games. Chutzpah means nerve, or boldness, in Yiddish, and the box states that the game is “for shiemiels, schlemazels, mavens, bolabustas, clutzes, trumbaniks and even some of your best friends.” By throwing dice, the players may acquire a mink stole or a fixed nose, vacations in Miami and the Catskills. The game is satirical, and bar mitzvahs and college educations figure among the things to acquire. Instead of the bank, as in “Monopoly,” “Chutzpah” has a pushka, and instead of a jail, there is a tsoris, which is a kind of trouble spot for those who have gained too much weight because they ignored their diet, and are forced to miss a turn. “Chutzpah” is most successful in the New York area, but it also sells well in the Midwest. It is manufactured by Middle Earth, of Portage, Mich. The president, Louis Hall, “didn't know a goy from a girl,” when he decided to take over the manufacture, but now it brings in about $50,000 a year. “Out here they call it “Chootzpah,” he says. “It's most popular among Jews, of course—many synagogues use the game for fundraising—and the second biggest buyers are those people who live next door to Jews.” “Chutzpah” is by no means the only game based upon the principle of acquisition. In “Movie Moguls Game of Hollywood,” players compete for old stars, movies, awards and hence riches. Acquiring valuable art at auction is the objective of “Masterpiece”; used car trading is the basis of “Dealers’ Choice.” “The exciting game of corporate management” is played in “Executive Decision.” Board players can indulge themselves in other American dreams as well. They can push the great levers of power in games devoted to politics: “Meet the Presidents,” “Summit,” “The Next President” (“Who Can Beat Nixon?’ has become academic), “Mr. President,” which “realistically re‐enacts campaign events leading to the election of the President and the Vice President and features popular and electoral vote tallies. Parties nominate their candidates and plan strategies designed to sweep them into office.” “Diplomacy” permits most anyone to become a living room Kissinger, involved in international intrigue. For similar fantasizing “Thinking Man's Football” “let's you play like a pro without losing your amateur status. All the thrills, spills and excitement of professional football come alive as you call the plays.” Where are all these games coming from? The larger manufacturers have their own teams of professional game inventors, who get a percentage of the sales on games they invent. According to one official, “Most of the inventors produce one idea after another. But you do have your one‐game man, who makes enough off that one idea to live comfortably the rest of his life, just like you have your one‐book author. Margaret Mitchell was a one‐book author. You might say that ‘Monopoly’ is the ‘Gone with the Wind’ of the board games.” But of course the cost of developing and mar keting is considerable, and often a game must sell well for a year just to pay expenses. There are really very few original ideas and no real break‐through in recent years. It is interesting to note that two of the most original games — “Monopoly” and “Scrabble” were developed during the Depression. “Scrabble” is based upon anagrams, and grew out of the idea of crossword puzzles. The “Scrabble” craze didn't occur until 1953, and now millions of the games are sold every year. After an idea for a new game has been approved by company executives — who spend a lot of their time literally playing games in their offices and sometimes in the corridors of the building—a few of the games are produced for testing. Various outside groups are used for testing. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Corporation, which makes “Executive Decision,” uses college students from the Minneapolis area “who range in political attitudes from ultraliberal to Ultraconservative.” Because the market is now flooded with adult games, the tendency is for manufacturers to go back to the older, proven sellers. Ethnic games are not always a success, partly because many stores are reluctant to stock them. But Brentano's sold out its 500 sets of “The Godfather Game,” which costs $15 and comes in a box shaped like a violin case, in spite of bomb threats and complaints by people who thought the game was detrimental to the Italian image. “The game is strategic, not violent,” insists John Deegan of Urban Systems in Cambridge. “You simply try to control various parts of New York,” (meaning a board‐game player can imagine himself a respected and powerful don). Urban Systems, which sold 400,000 “Godfather Games,” also makes “Ecology,” “Smog” and “Litterbug.” Urban Systems Research does jobs for the Government in pollution and urban transportation, and these studies are applied to the games. “You might say our games subsidiary has the most expensive research and development program anywhere,” Deegan says. Urban Systems also manufactures a game called “Women's Lib?” It isn't a board game, but a “role‐playing” one in which as many as seven players are assigned characters that range from conservative to liberal on women's rights issues. The most radical character is named Womb—the acronym from “Women Opposed to Male Bigots”—and the most conservative is, predictably, a man named Male Chauvinist. Each player presents his/her (her/his?) point of view, and then all players vote on the issue, entailing three or four alternatives (the alternatives for the abortion issue, for instance, are free abortion, therapeutic abortion at the doctor's discretion, and no abortion), and points are assigned. Skillful arguing by a player influences the voting of the others. Urban Systems says most players are between 20 and 35, fairly well‐educated, fairly well‐to‐do and live in cities. F.A.O. Schwarz surveyed its stores across the United States recently to determine which adult games were the best sellers. The results offer an interesting insight into regional tastes. In New York City, “Monopoly” was no longer the best seller. Chess had overtaken it, due in part to Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Backgammon, which is older than chess and which is also having a remarkable revival, was second (as Time says, “Hefner and his friend Barbi, Bridge Star Oswald Jacobi, Ari and Christina Onassis, Prince Radziwill, Polly Bergen and Jill St. John have all discovered the social charms of backgammon); “Labyrinth,” a Swedish game in which a metal ball is manipulated along inclined planes, was third; “Scrabble,” fourth; “Monopoly,” fifth. But in Manhasset, L. I., “Monopoly was the top seller, and “Chutzpah” took over the fifth position. In Beverly Hills, Calif., “Movie Moguls” was the third best seller, and “Ouija” board was among the top five. (“Ouija” board is supposed to provide messages from the supernatural; “They're weird out there,” says Arnold Maggi, the buyer for Schwarz.) In Houston, “Masterpiece” is a big seller, perhaps because many Texas oil MANY board games involve real skill, rather than just luck. “Point of Law,” for Instance, requires both concentration and logic. Players consider the facts of court cases, and four possible decisiors the court might make. Alter a discussion period, players are ranked by a moderator. “Sleuth” is a game of deduction in which players question their opponents, and try to discover who has the missing gem. “Monad” requires players to plan in advance how they will trade, buy and “leap” from low numbered cards up to the highest numbers. Big money can be made in games, given the enthusiasm of Americans for playing, and the relatively low cost of manufacturing. But marketing a new game, especially for the independent producer, is difficult and hazardous. “Eccentric,” a game of detection developed by a New York advertising account executive named Dick Shuster and a friend, seemed a year ago to have all the topical attributes of a best seller. The game was based upon the idea of a “great global search” to discover the hideout and the identity of an eccentric billionaire who traveled around the world in various disguises and hid in various cities, hotels and suites. At the time, controversy raged concerning Clifford Irving's book about Howard Hughes, and when Shuster presented the idea of the game to a buyer, he received an enthusiastic response. “The normal procedure then would have been for us to go to a big game company, and let them promote the game and pay us a royalty,” Shuster says. “But we would have lost too much time that way, and we decided to do it ourselves.” Bloomingdale's agreed to buy a gross of “Eccentric,” according to Shuster, as did Brentano's, Shuster and his partner then checked the yellow pages of the telephone directory, and obtained quotes from printers about the cost of manufacturing the game. The two partners invested $10,000 apiece, and commissioned an artist. The first game box top bore a picture with too great a resemblance to Howard Hughes, and had to be scrapped. “We ordered 9,000 sets,” Shuster says, “and we had to review every piece that went into each game. We had to order 54,000 little plastic airplanes to use as pieces, and these had to be sorted according to color on the apartment floor. We were both holding down steady jobs, and at night trying to get 54,000 little airplanes into plastic bags.” They hired two different publicists at different times, “but neither of them understood the process of promoting games.” They then tried to do their own publicity, but the game was scheduled to appear soon, and there wasn't enough time for promotion. As it turned out, Brentano's ordered only 24 games. Bloomingdale's ordered a gross, but misplaced them in the receiving department, and Shuster went to the store on his lunch hour, located the games, and helped get them out onto the floor. They sold fairly well, but the partners had no money left for promotion or distribution. They are still stuck with 6,000 games of “Eccentric,” after giving 1,500 of them to the Red Cross at Christmas time, and they are out‐of‐pocket approximately $20,000 between them. Still the game business over‐all is booming. The obvious reasons are that games provide cheap entertainment, relaxation and a chance for the stylized pursuit of most fantasies. But board games also are unequivocal—one wins or one loses—in an era when society in general is confusing, and most accomplishments are fraught with contradictions. Perhaps most important, games provide the opportunity to compete to the utmost without having to worry about the consequences. As a publicist for Parker Brothers puts it, and the comment could apply to most adult board games, “In ‘Monopoly,’ you can be competitive and friendly at the same time. It gives you a chance to beat your friends’ brains out, without really hurting anyone.”"
Blumenthal Pictures Himself As Apostle of Compromise,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/09/archives/blum-en-thalpictureshimself-as-apostle-of-compromise-funds-trickle.html,"If there is one thing that the polls and the polls agree on, it is that Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal of Manhattan is the least wellknown of the “four B's” who are expected to make up the field in the Democratic mayoral primary on June 4. For an office‐seeker to emerge from the shadows of comparative obscurity on the West Side into the sunlight of citywide recognition in a matter of weeks usually requires either a massive advertising campaign, a vivid personality or extreme views that the news media find impossible to ignore. But by temperament and conviction Mr. Blumenthal is earnest and hard‐working rather than colorful. He pictures himself as an apostle of compromise and accommodation, of measured progress and sensible innovation, a member of the reform faction who has worked closely with both regular Democrats and right, that is, left, minded Republicans during his 11 years in the State Legislature. Nor is it likely that the public is going to get tired of seeing Mr. Blumenthal's face in the near future. His campaign is so underfinanced that he has not even made any television commercials yet, let alone found the money to put them on the air. Funds Trickle In Ordinarily, the endorsement of the New Democratic Coalition, representing the city's 75 reform clubs, which he received last month, would have released a spring freshet of funds, but there has been only a trickle so far—perhaps $100,000, scarcely a fifth of what is needed for even a respectable advertising campaign. One reason for the drought is probably the falling stock market, another the feeling that the city's political mood is swinging to the right, and still another the widely held opinion that Mr. Blumenthal and Representative Herman Badillo of the Bronx, whom he defeated for the coalition designation, will destroy each other's chance for nomination. As a result, Mr. Blumenthal has been delivering his message in person for the most part, until now at least, concentrating on the pivotal Jewish vote, which is expected to range from half of an anticipated minimum primary turnout of 750,000 to 42 per cent if it should reach 800,000. At synagogues and fraternal meetings, Mr. Blumenthal is apt to say that he wants to become “the first Jewish Mayor of New York.” It is a frankly sectarian appeal that some of his coreligionists find troubling, particularly in what is already seen as a polarized city —an appeal that Controller Abraham D. Beame did not use in his unsuccessful 1965 campaign and is not using now. Ad Posed Problem Moreover, Mr. Blumenthal has already had to disavow an advertisement that was placed on his behalf in The Jewish Press, an English‐language weekly published in Brooklyn by a committee headed by Yaakov Kornreich, a businessman who is active in Orthodox circles and who supported President Nixon in last November's election. The ad stated in part that Mr. Blumenthal would prevent Flatbush “from becoming another Brownsville,” which was widely taken to mean that he would use some undisclosed means to prevent blacks from moving into the area. “I asked the sponsors of the ad to make certain changes, and I regret to say that this was not done,” he said. “I have written to The Jewish Press to that effect.” Mr. Blumenthal also said the other day that his daily grind of appearances had already reduced his anonymity factor, according to a recent poll taken in Queens by the county Democratic organization, from 95 to 60 per cent. Respondents from whom the name Blumenthal evoked an affirmative response rose from 4 to 12 per cent. Stresses Years in Assembly The same poll, however gave Mr. Beame and Representative Mario Biaggi of the Bronx affirmative scores of 28 and 24 per cent, with Mr. Badillo, the fourth “B” In the field, trailing with 9 per cent. In his public appearances, Mr. Blumenthal emphasizes his long service in the Assembly, where he is deputy minority leader and is generally acknowledged by his colleagues to be highly effective in pushing for legislation of benefit to the city in a body dominated by upstate Republicans. He began the investigation into the asserted laxity of the Public Service Commission in protecting the public interest and wrote the law that transformed the commission into a bipartisan body with an independent investigative staff. “I also was the chairman of the drafting committee and was the floor manager of the Medicare and Medicaid bills,” he said. “The states had a wide range of options in using Federal funds, and the troubles that have beset ours are the fault of Governor Rockefeller, not the law.” He is probably best known for his leadership of the five‐year fight to have the state's abortion law liberalized. While the candidate does not ignore his contribution, the realities of politics do not lead him to give equal emphasis to it, the new law being less highly regarded in the city as a whole than on the West Side. Mr. Blumenthal also points to his strong record on housing issues, including laws that require owners of apartment buildings to install front‐door locks and intercommunications systems, to require landlords to provide heat around the clock during the cold‐weather months, and to grant real‐estate tax abatements to persons over 65 years old with annual incomes of less thane $5,000. With State Senater John J. Marchi of Staten Island, who is likely to be the Republican mayoral candidate, Mr. Blumenthal has sponsored a bill that would establish an industrial development agency here, empowered to issue bonds to finance the construction of commercial buildings in an effort to reverse the flow of jobs out of the city. In the absence of significant Federal financial assistance for the city's mass‐transit problems, Mr. Blumenthal has proposed that a percentage of state income‐tax receipts be earmarked for this purpose. Advocates Larger Council This would, in effect, force Washington to provide a subsidy, since state tax payments are deductible on the Federal tax return. He shrugs off the criticism that such an arrangement would disproportionately benefit upperincome commuters from the suburbs. Like other candidates this year, Mr. Blumenthal has an elaborate plan for the decentralization of authority over city services and construction. He would enlarge the City Council to 75 members and redraw the district lines so that they embraced specific neighborhoods, rather than wandering all over the map as they do now. “Councilmen would serve full‐time and have their own staffs,” he said. “They would function as locality mayors and ombudsmen so that it wouldn't be necessary for local people to go to the city and borough halls to get their grievances attended to.” Mr. Blumenthal has already proposed this idea to the Temporary State Charter Revision Commission for New York City, chaired by Republican State Senator Roy Goodman, of which he is a member. The commission began its work last October and is due to report its recommendations in June for inclusion in the November ballot. Proposal Termed ‘Purile’ A colleague of his on the 12‐member commission called Mr. Blumenthal's proposal “purile,” adding: “It would force the Mayor to bargain separately with 75 Councilmen with the strategy of buying each one of them at the lowest possible price. What it would do would be to institutionalize West Side reform politics.” Indeed the West Side reform label, with its connotations of knee‐jerk liberal responses to pressing social issues, is one Mr. Blumenthal finds something of a, handicap in working‐class and middle‐class areas elsewhere in the city. In discussing the law‐andorder issue, he emphasizes the underlying necessity of providing jobs for the poor, of reforming the courts to provide more efficient disposition of criminal cases, and of the possibility of budgeting $50‐million to rehire 3,000 retired patrolmen for a year's tour of duty. Alone among the “four B's,” Mr. Blumenthal has said he would retain Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy. “On the whole I think he has done an excellent job,” the candidate said, “but I doubt that he could be persuaded to stay on.” Reform‐Movement Founder Mr. Blumenthal, who is 44 years old, was born and raised in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. He is a graduate of the College of William and Mary and has law and master‐of‐law degrees from New York University. He was a legal officer in the Army and then joined his father's Man hattan law firm, in which he is now the senior partner. Mr. Blumenthal, one of the founders of the reform movement, was first elected to the Assembly in 1962. In 1969 he organized a group of reform members of the body in support of Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn, who was engaged in a leadership fight with Moses Weinstein of Queens, now a State Supreme Court justice. As a reward, Mr. Blumenthal was given the newly created post of deputy minority leader, with an annual stipend of $5,000 in addition to the $15,000 in salary and $5,000 in expenses that members of the Legislature receive. It was also Mr. Steingut who appointed him to the charter‐revision commission. In fact, Mr. Blumenthal's close relationship to Mr. Steingut, who epitomizes the regular Democratic organization, has led some scholastics on the West Side to assert that he is a reformer in name only. As supporting evidence, they cite his cautious approach to such thorny municipal issues as the Forest Hills housing project and the Canarsie school dispute. Favored Compromises Mr. Blumenthal says he spoke out on both, favoring compromise solutions. “It's a pragmatic necessity to work with people of widely differing views in the Legislature to get anything done,” he said. “I don't think it makes me any less of a reformer.” Critics also say that the behind‐the‐scenes maneuvering he used to stop Mr. Badillo at the convention of the New Democratic Coalition had more in common with the old Tammany Hall than with the League of Women Voters, which he denies. Although he has served in the Assembly far longer than is usual for a man of ability and ambition, and has told friends that he is becoming bored and restive there, he turned down an opportunity to run for City Council President on Mr. Badillo's ticket in 1969. Last year he did not seek the Congressional nomination to replace the late William F. Ryan—a nomination he said he had enough support to win. In the first instance, he said, Mr. Badillo would not make a commitment to provide him with duties that would enhance the largely ceremonial status of the office. In the second, he preferred to avoid the lengthy separations that would be required from his wife, the for mer Joel Winik, and their four children, who range in age from 9 to 13 years. Likes Outdoor Activities The Bhunenthals live in a modest ground‐floor cooperative apartment at 81st Street and Riverside Drive, and have a small summer place at New Milford, Conn., where Mr. Blumenthal water‐skis, digs, plants and chops wood with an enthusiasm unusual for a city boy. He also likes to point out that, unlike many advocates of integrated public schools, he sends his children to them, and his wife teaches at an intermediate school in the Bronx. Except for Mr. Beame, his chief rival for the Jewish vote, Mr. Blumenthal seldom mentions his rivals by name. He says that Mr. Beame has been overrated as a Controller and that he is preparing to document his charges. He attacks Mr. Biaggi, a former police lieutenant, indirectly by asserting that crime has risen sharply in Philadelphia since its former Police Commissioner, Frank Rizzo, was elected Mayor. He and Mr. Badillo have been ignoring each other in public, but Mr. Blumenthal made his views known in an interview. “The people want and deserve someone who doesn't go around denouncing everybody as racists because they didn't vote for him,” he said, referring to Mr. Badillo's widely quoted outburst after his defeat at the convention of the New Democratic Coalition. “To govern this city you've got to be able to work with people regardless of their background.”"
Some New Views on an Old Subject At a Conference on Sex Stereotyping,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/09/archives/some-new-views-on-an-old-subject-at-a-conference-on-sex.html,"A slendtr, blue‐eyed woman who strongly resembled Julie Andrews entered a classroom at Fordham University's Manhattan campus the other day and began writing what she called “sexual stereotypes” on the blackboard: GIRLS: Dependence, passivity, fragility, tolerance, inability to risk, emotional. BOYS: Independence, aggression, competitiveness, leadership, active, unsentimental. The woman was Dr. Karel Rose, a professor of education at Brooklyn College, and she was preparing to lead a workshop on children's literature at a day‐long conference she helped plan with three other women professors, “Sex Role Myths We Teach.” The airing of sexual stereo types is nothing new; it has been one of the causes celebres of the women's liberation movement in the last three years. But this was the first time, according to Dr. Rose, that a public conference was held on the subject at a major university. “As educators dealing with college students and spending large blocks of time in the public schools,” Dr. Rose said in her opening remarks in Fordham's Pope Auditorium, 113 West 60th Street, “we've begun to have some authentic shocks. Sex stereotyping is going on unchecked and at a phenomenal rate. Potential Is Restricted “It's not that we're squirming under the disapproving gaze of the women's movement,” she added, “for in reality they have expended little energy on children. It's just that we ourselves have found that the problem of sex role conditioning in youngsters and adolescents has been a significant factor in preventing both females and males from developing their full human potential.” The Saturday conference drew 200 people, most of them young women who were students, career women or fulltime housewives and parents. Some of the handful of men who attended grumbled after they learned that the focus of the conference would be on women; they had eicpected more attention paid to their sex role myths. A male member of the Gay Activists Alliance seemed the unhappiest of all. During a question‐and‐answer session following the keynote speech, he stood and demanded recognition for “the country's 10 million homosexuals.” “Let's not perpetuate the myth that everybody is married and living in the suburbs holding hands,” he said angrily. Parents Aid Myths The keynote speaker was Dr. Eli Ginzberg, a professor of economics at Columbia University, where he is also director of Conservation of Human Resources. “Parents are the major contributors to sex myths,” he told the audience. “They should not differentiate in opportunities they make available for boys or girls. They must indicate that motherhood is not a fulltime occupation. It simply isn't. The silver‐haired professor, who had a vast amount of statistics concerning working women at his fingertips, pointed out that the average woman would spend 40 years of her life in which her children had either left the home, or were there “only for a few hours a day.” One vital reason it is important for a woman to know how to work outside the home, he said, is that there is now one divorce for every three marriages, “and would guess it's going to go up, not down.” “Family relations are going to continue to be eroded,” he added. “One of the reasons is that women are realizing they don't have to live with no‐good men anymore. There are more options now — for both men and women.” Dr. Ginzberg cited statistics to show that America's professional schools are now admitting more women than ever before. (A jump from 5 to 14 per cent enrollment of women in medical schools, he said, from 2 to 8 per cent in law schools, and from 2 to 10 per cent in business schools.) “This will provide more role models for women,” he said, “and make the pull for women much easier.” Among the conference's eight workshops were, “Do Popular Magazines Perpetuate Sex Role Myths?”; “Are the Media Guilty of Creating Sexual Stereotypes”; Children's Literature”; “The Professions and Motherhood” and “High School Students Rap About Sex Role Stereotypes,” which, judging from attendance and media interest, seemed to be the most popular workshop. The morning high school workshop was attended by about 50 persons, most of them high school girls, with a few boys, parents and teachers thrown in. The consensus seemed to be that sexism in the schools, although decreasing, still exists—and is perpetuated by the older teachers. Among the students’ complaints were the schools’ lack of interest in girls’ sports; refusal of many schools to admit girls to industrial arts or woodworking classes; teachers tendencies to favor boys in sciences and mathematics classes; and the poor quality of most sex education classes. He Likes to Cook “My sex ed class is taught by an unmarried woman gym teacher who is Roman Catholic and dosen't believe in abortion,” one girl said angrily. A black youth mentioned that he liked to cook, even though he frequently got kidded about it. “I know some girls can play basketball better than men,” he said. “So why shouldn't be able to cook? Some of the best cooks in the world are men.” A male physical education teacher advocated requiring high school students to take both home economics and shop classes. “I recently got married to a law student,” he said, “and I feel more fulfilled now that I have started cooking, cleaning and doing laundry.” Few Role Models In the children's literature workshop, Dr. Rose and her co‐leader, Dr. Renee Queen, professor of education at Fordham, asserted that mothers are shown as “passive nincompoops” in most children's reaaers. “You never see mother going to vote or engaging in community activities,” Dr. Rose said. “She is always pretty much wearing an apron, or hollering at daddy. The mothers who do work all have very domestic jobs—as teachers, librarians, or counter girls at a supermarket.” The two women recommended several non‐sexist children's books, including one called “Firegirl,” in which little girl becomes a fireman, and “The Temper Tantrum Book,” which shows little girls getting dirty in the mud and having the same attitudes as boys. “Girls have few role models in children's literature,” Dr. Queen said. “What they do have are mostly “mythical creatures—like witches, fairy godmothers, or Mary Poppins.” A debate on the feminist magazine, Ms., took up much of the time at the workshop on popular magazines, led by Joanna Brown, white editor of Ingenue magazine, and Ida Lewis, black editor of Encore magazine. The consensus was that Mr. has “lily white” and more racist than such traditional magazines as Ladies Home Journal, Glamour and Seventeen. “These magazines nave no pretensions about being liberal or forward thinking,” Miss Lewis said, “but yet they regularly show black people throughout their pages. Ms., on the other hand, shows only token blacks—like Shirley Chisholm.” “As educators dealing with college students and spending large blocks of time in the public schools, we've begun to have some authentic shocks. Sex stereotyping is going on unchecked and at a phenomenal rate.”"

Blumenthal Pictures Himself As Apostle of Compromise,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/09/archives/blumentha-ppictures-himself-as-apostle-of-compromise-funds-trickle.html,"If there is one thing that the polls and the polls agree on, it is that Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal of Manhattan is the least wellknown of the “four B's” who are expected to make up the field in the Democratic mayoral primary on June 4. For an office‐seeker to emerge from the shadows of comparative obscurity on the West Side into the sunlight of citywide recognition in matter of weeks usually requires either a massive advertising campaign, a vivid personality or extreme views that the news media find impossible to ignore. But by temperament and conviction Mr. Blumenthal is earnest and hard‐working rather than colorful. He pictures himself as an apostle of compromise and accommodation, of measured progress and sensible innovation, a member of the reform faction who has worked closely with both regular Democrats and right, that is, left, minded Republicans during his 11 years in the State Legislature. Nor is it likely that the public is going to get tired of seeing Mr. Blumenthal's face in the near future. His campaign is so underfinanced that he has not even made any television commercials yet, let alone found the money to put them on the air. Funds Trickle In Ordinarily, the endorsement of the New Democratic Coalition, representing the city's 75 reform clubs, which he received last month, would have released a spring freshet of funds, but there has been only a trickle so far—perhaps $100,000, scarcely a fifth of what is needed for even a respectable advertising campaign. One reason for the drought is probably the falling stock market, another the feeling that the city's political mood is swinging to the right, and still another the widely held opinion that Mr. Blumenthal and Representative Herman Badillo of the Bronx, whom he defeated for the coalition designation, will destroy each other's chance for nomination. As a result, Mr. Blumenthal has been delivering his message in person for the most part, until now at least, concentrating on the pivotal Jewish vote, which is expected to range from half of an anticipated minimum primary turnout of 750,000 to 42 per cent if it should reach 800,000. At synagogues and fraternal meetings, Mr. Blumenthal is apt to say that he wants to become “the first Jewish Mayor of New York.” It is a frankly sectarian appeal that some of his coreligionists find troubling, particularly in what is already seen as a polarized city —an appeal that Controller Abraham D. Beame did not use in his unsuccessful 1965 campaign and is not using now. Ad Posed Problem Moreover, Mr. Blumenthal has already had to disavow an advertisement that was placed on his behalf in The Jewish Press, an English‐language weekly published in Brooklyn by a committee headed by Yaakov Kornreich, a businessman whO is active in Orthodox circles and who supported President Nixon in last November's election. The ad stated in part that Mr. Blumenthal would prevent Flatbush “from becoming another Brownsville,” which was widely taken to mean that he would use some undisclosed means to prevent blacks from moving into the area. “I asked the sponsors of the ad to make certain changes, and I regret to say that this was not done,” he said. “I have written to The Jewish Press to that effect.” Mr. Blumenthal also said the other day that his daily grind of appearances had already reduced his anonymity factor, according to a recent poll taken’ in Queens by the county Democratic organization, from 95 to 60 per cent. Respondents from whom the name Blumenthal evoked an affirmative response rose from 4 to 12 per cent. Stresses Years in Assembly The same poll, however gave Mr. Beame and Representative Mario Biaggi of the Bronx affirmative scores of 28 and 24 per cent, with Mr. Badillo, the fourth “B” in the field, trailing with 9 per cent. In his public appearances, Mr. Blumenthal emphasizes his long service in the Assembly, where he is deputy minority leader ana is generally acknowledged by his colleagues to be highly effective in pushing for legislation of benefit to the city in body dominated by upstate Republicans. He begin the investigation into the asserted laxity of the Public Service Commission in protecting the public interest and wrote the law that transformed the commission into a bipartisan body with an independent investigative staff. “I also was the chairman of the drafting committee and was the floor manager of the Medicare and Medicaid bills,” he said. “The states had a wide range of options in using Federal funds, and the troubles that have beset ours are the fault of Governor Rockefeller, not the law.” He is probably best known for his leadership of the five‐year fight to have the state's abortion law liberalized. While the candidate does not ignore his contribution, the realities of politics do not lead him to give equal emphasis to it, the new law being less highly regarded in the city as a whole than on the West Side. Mr. Blumenthal also points to his strong record on housing issues, including laws that require owners of apartment buildings to install front‐door locks and intercommunications systems, to require landlords to provide heat around the clock during the cold‐weather months, and to grant real‐estate tax abatements to persons over 65 years old with annual incomes of less than $5,000. With State Senator John J. Marchi of Staten Island, who is likely to be the Republican mayoral candidate, Mr. Blumenthal has sponsored a bill that would establish an industrial development agency here, empowered to issue bonds to finance the construction of commercial buildings in an effort to reverse the flow of jobs out of the city. In the absence of significant Federal financial assistance for the city's mass‐transit problems, Mr. Blumenthal has proposed that a percentage of state income‐tax receipts be earmarked for this purpose. Advocates Larger Council This would, in effect, force Washington to provide a subsidy, since state tax payments are deductible on the Federal tax return. He shrugs off the criticism that such an arrangement would disproportionately benefit upperincome commuters from the suburbs. Like other candidates this year, Mr. Blumenthal has an elaborate plan for the decentralization of authority over city services and construction. He would enlarge the City Council to 75 members and redraw the district lines so that they embraced specific neighborhoods, rather than wandering all over the map as they do now. “Councilmen would serve full‐time and have their own staffs,” he said. “They would function as locality mayors and ombudsmen so that it wouldn't be necessary for local people to go to the city and.borough halls to get their grievances attended to.” Mr. Blumenthal has already proposed this idea to the Temporary State Charter Revision Commission for New York City, chaired by Republican State Senator Roy Goodman, of which he is member. The commission began its work last October and is due to report its recommendations in June for inclusion in the November ballot. Proposal Termed ‘Puerile’ A colleague of his on the 12‐member commission called Mr. Blumenthal's proposal “puerile,” adding: “It would force the Mayor to bargain separately with 75 Councilmen with the strategy of buying each one of them at the lowest possible price. What it would do would be to institutionalize West Side reform politics.” Indeed the West Side reform label, with its connotations of knee‐jerk liberal responses to pressing social issues, is one Mr. Blumenthal finds something of a handicap in working‐class and middle‐class areas elsewhere in the city. In discussing the law‐andorder issue, he emphasizes the underlying necessity of providing jobs for the poor, of reforming the courts to provide more efficient disposition of criminal cases, and of the possibility of budgeting $50‐million to rehire 3,000 retired patrolmen for a year's tour of duty. Alone among the “four B's,” Mr. Blumenthal has said he would retain Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy. “On the whole I think he has done an excellent job,” the candidate said, “but I doubt that he could be persuaded to stay on.” Reform‐Movement Founder Mr. Blumenthal, who is 4 it years old, was born and raised in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. He is a graduate of the College of William and Mary and has law and master‐of‐law degrees from New York University. He was a legal officer in the Army and then joined his father's Man hattan law firm, in which he is now the senior partner. Mr. Blumenthal, one of the founders of the reform movement, was first elected to the Assembly in 1962. In 1969 he organized a group of reform members of the body in support of Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn, who was engaged in a leadership fight with Moses Weinstein of Queens, now a State Supreme Court justice. As a reward, Mr. Blumenthal was given the newly created post of deputy minority leader, with an annual stipend of $5,000 in addition to the $15,000 in salary and $5,000 in expenses that members of the Legislature receive. It was also Mr. Steingut who appointed him to the charter‐revision commission. In fact, Mr. Blumenthal's close relationship to Mr. Steingut, who epitomizes the regular Democratic organization, has led some scholastics on the West Side to assert that he is a reformer in name only. As supporting evidence, they cite his cautious approach to such thorny municipal issues as the Forest Hills housing project and the Canarsie school dispute. Favored Compromises Mr. Blumenthal says he spoke out on both, favoring compromise solutions. “It's a pragmatic necessity to work with people of widely differing views in the Legislature to get anything done,” he said. “I don't think it makes me any less of a reformer.” Critics also say that the behind‐the‐scenes maneuvering he used to stop Mr. Badillo at the convention of the New Democratic Coalition had more in common with the old Tammany Hall than with the League of Women Voters, which he denies.

Major Part of Abortion Law Is Struck Down in Arkansas,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/10/archives/major-part-of-abortion-law-is-struck-down-in-arkansas.html,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April (UPI)—The Arkansas Supreme Court, in a 7‐to‐1 decision, struck down today the major part of the state's abortion law. It retained a section allowing only licensed physicians to perform abortions. The court overturned the conviction of John O. May, a former North Little Rock alderman, who had been charged with illegally performing an abortion. It ordered a new trial on a technicality of judicial procedure. In the court's majority decision, Associate Justice Lyle Brown said that the United States Supreme Court had ruled that state could limit the performance of abortions to licensed physicians."

The first planes were scheduled to bring in only military fuel, American officials said, but they suggested that later flights might carry commercial fuel if efforts to ease the critical shortage failed. [Page 1, Column 1.]. Premier Saeb Salem or Lebanon submitted his resignation “In the public interest” following the predawn raid by Israeli commandos in which three Palestinian guerrilla leaders were killed. Mr. Salem, a Moslem, was a close friend of Mohammed Yussef Najjar, chairman of the political department of the Palestine Liberation Organization—the over‐all guerrilla group—who was among those slain. [1:2.] Lieut. Gen. David Elazar, the Israeli Chief of Staff, said that his forces’ spectacular commando raid in Beirut was staged in response to “the intensification of terrorist acts in Europe and other places in the last six months.” General Elazar said in a news conference in Tel Aviv that “It is true that most of those acts failed, but we had to act against the phenomena of terrorist activity against Israeli targets abroad.” [1:3.] National President Nixon sent Congress a comprehensive trade bill that would give him sweeping new authority to raise and lower United States tariffs and other trade barriers as a prelude to forthcoming inilrnational negotiations. The President said his new “Trade Reform Act” called for “the most important changes in more than a decade in America's approach to world trade.” [1:8.] Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst appeared to widen the Administration's definition of executive privilege to cover 2.5 million employes of the Government's executive branch. Testifying before three Senate subcommittees jointly considering the executive privilege question, Mr. Kleindienst said Congress had no power to order any executive branch employe to appear and testify before Congress if the President barred such testimony. He suggested repeatedly that if Congregs wished to remedy the situation, It could cut off funds to the executive branch or impeach the President. He also suggested that the question could be settled by Presidential election. [1:2–4.] A surprisingly docile House bowed to the wishes of the White House by voting to sustain President Nixon's veto of a bill to finance water and sewer systems in rural America. The vote was 225 to override the veto and 189 to sustain it, 51 votes short of the two‐thirds needed to override. [1:5.] The Administration proposed raising the Federal minimum wage to $2.30 from the current $1.60 an hour by 1976, but also asked for the lower minimum wage for youth that had been bitterly opposed by unions. The Administration's proposal was made by Secretary of Labor Peter J. Brennan, who was immediately attacked by George Meany, president of the A.F.L.C.I.O., for his support of the youth subminimum. [1:4.] Metropolitan Agreement on a new contract covering about 136,000 state employes and calling for wage increases of $156‐million over two years of a three‐year contract was announced by negotiators for the Civil Service Employes Association and the state. The agreement, which is subject to ratification, calls for wage increases of 61/2 per cent in the contract's first year, retroactive to last April 1, and 51/2 per cent in the second year. [1:2–3.] Judge Orrin G. Judd of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn directed the state to remedy the “inhumane and shocking conditions” at Willowbrook State School for the Mentally Retarded on Staten Island. He said nine specific steps must be taken to correct the inadequacies. [1:7.] Sedimentary deposits with an oil‐bearing potential perhaps as rich as those off the coasts of Louisiana, Texas and California have been found 30 to 50 miles off Long Island and New Jersey, the United States Geological Survey and Nixon Administration officials said.

"Cost of Abortions, Vasectomies And Pills Ruled Tax Deductible",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/11/archives/cost-of-abortions-vasectomies-and-pills-ruled-tax-deductible.html,"WASHINGTON, April 10 (AP)—The Internal Revenue Service ruled today for the first time that expenses for abortions, vasectomies and birth control pills are tax deductible, including those for 1972. A spokesman added that the rulings could be controversial but said, “We can't take moral questions into account.” “Although many persons object to vasectomy and abortion on religious or moral grounds,” the spokesman said, “the I.R.S. is required to base its ruling on an objective interpretation of the law.” He said the ruling en abortions would apply to abortions in clinics, doctors’ offices and hospitals “as long as they are legal.” There is no ceiling amount in the tax agency's ruling for abortions or vasectomies. But only that portion of medical expenses amounting to 3 per cent or more of a person's income is deductible. The ruling said the abortion deduction was allowed under the agency's regulations that provide that “amounts paid for operations or treatments affecting any structure or function of the body and are therefore paid for medical care.” In respect to birth control pills, the agency ruled that expenditures were also “an amount paid for medical care” under its regulations. The ruling on abortion says the determining factor on a deduction is that the operation must not be illegal under state law. ‘However, an agency spokesman noted that the recent Suprenie Court ruling declared most state prohibitions against abortion were unconstitutional, so that virtually all abortions therefore should be deductible."
National Appeals Court? Yes and No,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/11/archives/national-appeals-court-yes-and-no-by-arthur-s-miller-and-eugene.html,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass.—By valiant efforts the Supreme Court has managed to operate efficiently in the sense that it keeps abreast of its docket, schedules arguments promptly, and rarely holds an argued case for decision at the following term. The end‐of‐term crunch, when opinions pour forth in profusion within a span of a few weeks, is a familiar feature of the process. In reflecting on the mission of the Court, I cannot help recalling my own experience as law clerk to Justice. Brandeis. The first case assigned to him for opinion was a complex one involving the overlapping jurisdiction of state and Federal courts. After several weeks of labor and numerous drafts; could see nothing more to be said or revised. The justice commented, “I think the opinion is now persuasive, but what can we do to make it more instructive?” The question led to another paragraph, setting out some analogous instances. The vote at conference had been 5 to 4, but the deck sion came down with a unanimous opinion. Few, I think, would wish to challenge Justice Brandeis’ conception of the Court or the underlying moral principle that one in whom the responsibility is reposed should in truth perform the function, Few would disagree, I believe, with the diagnosis that optimum conditions do not now exist for the work of the Court and that there is every reason to expect that the dimensions of the problem will grow even more severe. The report of our study group recommends a national court of appeals with screening and conflict‐resolving functions. The court would consist of seven members, drawn on a rotating basis from the judges of the courts of appeals, to serve three‐year staggered terms; all the cases now eligible for Supreme Court review would go Initially’ to the new court; it would be expected to certify to the Supreme Court some four to five hundred cases per year as arguably worthy of review, from which the Supreme Court could be expected to accept, as now, one hundred twenty to one hundred fifty cases for argument and decision; and the new court would retain jurisdiction to decide or could receive on remand from the Supreme Court cases involving a conflict of decision among circuits where the issue was not otherwise of sufficient moment to warrant Supreme Court review. The new court might certify cases on an affirmative vote of three of its seven members. As experience developed, the jurisdiction of the court on remand from the Supreme Court might be broadened, and the terms and selection of its members might be revised. The screening function of the national court of appeals would be major one, but it would not be intruding on the consideration of such issues as abortion, school desegregation plans, reapportionment plans, public school financing, public aid to parochial school pupils, the ramifications of equal time and fairness in broadcasting—to name a few of the issues with which the Supreme Court must grapple at the present term. Those with a bent for history will recall that for a long time there was special jurisdictional amount requirement for review of circuit court decisions, and that for a century criminal cases could reach the Supreme Court from the circuit courts only on a certificate of division in the circuit court. Review of state court decisions depended on how the state court decided a Federal question; thus for a time, when workmen's compensation was held unconstitutional in a state court, there was no possible review in the Supreme Court. Were all these tribunals—the circuit courts and the state courts—the Supreme Cpurt, in violation of Article III? The argument over “one Supreme Court” is in this context simply rhetorical device, reminiscent of the attack on the Courts of Appeals Act as setting up “nine Supreme Courts.” A variant of the argument is that court which has jurisdiction to decide a case must also have authority to decide whether to decide. Whence comes this asserted principle? Not, surely, from the Constitution, as the history of criminal appeals demonstrates. If judges who decide a case in the first instance can determine whether it should be reviewed, would be odd to find that more disinterested judges were constitutionally disqualified to perform this function. In any event, the principle is an empty one in the present context, since the Supreme Court would have “jurisdiction to decide a case” only if the case were certified to it; and if it were argued that this is an unconstitutional condition, the argument merely begs the original question. It would be ironic, finally, to gag at a national court of appeals because of the provision for one Supreme Court while swallowing a proposal that panels of three justices could make final decisions in the name of that one Court. [We] are persuaded that our proposals would not fetter the Supreme Court but would help to emancipate’ it, to free it for the highest performance of its essential functions to vindicate the rights secured by the Constitution, to assure the uniform application of Federal law, to maintain a proper balance among the components of our Federal Union. To criticize without proffering more acceptable counterproposals is to acquiesce in a steadily worsening condition. By Arthur S. Miller and Eugene Gressman WASHINGTON—The proposal for a national court of appeals created by Congress to eliminate all except a few hundred of the 4,000‐plus cases annually filed in the Supreme Court, is the wrong remedy at the wrong time for an incorrectly diagnosed malady. There can be no question that the number of cases brought to the Supreme Court has been rapidly increasing. The number has quadrupled over the last 35 years. This fact is amply documented in the December, 1972, report of a distinguished study group appointed by Chief Justice Burger and chaired by Professor Freund. That report asserts, without any real analysis, that the raw figures of increased case filings prove that the Supreme Court is overworked and in need of a drastic procedural overhaul. The remedy suggested is a “mini‐Supreme Court,” manned by rotating panels of seven judges from the Federal courts of appeals, to review and dispose of the great bulk of the cases filed. These panels would have power to deny review in, cases the panels feel are unfit for Supreme Court consideration. It is dubious if raw statistics on case filings can tell much about the actual workload of the Supreme Court. Justice Douglas termed a “myth” the notion that the raw figures utilized by the Freund report show that the Court is in fact overworked. In his view, the justices now have a lighter workload, in terms of all the tasks they must perform than when he went on the bench more than thirty years ago. At the present time, the Court is both completely current in its consideration of petitions available for decision and, even more, important, has been unable to fill its oral argument schedule for the balance of the year because of a scarcity of cases ready for disposition on the merits. No basis exists for the assumption in the Freund report that the increased case filings show that the Supreme Court cannot process them properly or expeditiously. The justices may use their own discretion and their own techniques to sift out the few cases they think worthy of full review by the Court. Some justices, particularly after they gain experience, perform this task themselves, easily and quickly. Others are aided by their law clerks. Whether a petition merits full‐dress review should be determined only by the Supreme Court justices themselves. For that very reason, the task cannot be effectively delegated to a miniSupreme Court. No standards can be erected to guide an outside group of judges in selecting or rejecting cases to reflect the subjective, discretionary and changing interests of the Supreme Court, as a collective body. Justices know the reviewable and nonrevlewable ones when they pee them, but they cannot find for a group of outsiders how to identify them. It is difficult to honor the constitutional requirement that there be only one Supreme Court if another court has power to decide what the Supreme Court will see and what that Court will never see. The power to choose what should or should not be decided is a crucial part of the judicial power given the Supreme Court by Congress and the Constitution. Justice Douglas once described this power as “in many respects the most, important and think, the most interesting of all our functions.” The proposed mini‐Supreme Court would inevitably and subtly downgrade the Court in many ways. No longer could the oppressed and the aggrieved be assured the opportunity to take their claims tb basic rights and liberties to the Supreme Court. No longer would the Supreme Court have the power, so essential to many of our constitutional freedoms, to pick those cases for review that only in the eyes of the Court itself present such vital problems. Placing that power in a group of lower court judges would tend to elevate’ and perpetuate their more conventional views of the law, thereby precluding much of the innovative and developmental aspects of Supreme Court litigation."
Advertising: Recall of Ingenue,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/12/archives/advertising-recall-of-ingenue-norton-simons-tv-show-to-carry.html,"In its last issue under its old publisher, Ingenue, a magazine, for teen‐aged girls, departed from a 14‐year tradition and ran an explicit article on sexual conduct. Besides bringing in a number of angry letters from subscribers' parents and advertisers, the April issue caused the new owner, Twenty First Century Communications, to run an ad in which it “completely disassociates)) itself from the old Ingenue published by the Dell Publishing Company. Dell, according to its president, Mrs. Helen Meyer, had the remaining issues taken from the newsstands last Friday. That is the same day that the ad ran in Women's Wear Daily. The article, “After the First Kiss Where Do You Go?” was excerpted from “Girls & Sex,” a book by Dr. Wardell Pomeroy, published in 1969 by Delacorte Press, a Dell property. Dr. Pomeroy, an early associate of the late Dr. A. C. Kinsey, is a recognized auhority in the field. The excerpt concerns “petting,” which Dr. Pomeroy writes “embraces a whole variety of contacts.” “One of its greatest advantages,” he notes, “is as learning experience to marriage.” During a brief interview in her office yesterday, Mrs. Meyer characterized the article as both “stupid” and “out of context.” “In my wildest imagination I just can't believe we published it,” she said. Normally, she said, she sees page proofs prior to publication but when the April issue was rushed to press the corporation was in the midst of moving to another office and faced with labor difficulties at the printer. The former editor, Joan Wynn, who at the time was helping to get together the first issue (May) of The New Ingenue, also cites the confusion and lack of staff at the old magazine. She said the Pomeroy piece is “strong” but noted that sex education classes are equally frank and that “petting is the area of concern and wonder to this age group.” The average age of the Ingenue reader is 17 and of its 750,000 monthly circulation, some 100,000 copies are sold on newsstands. Matty Simmons, chairman of Twenty First, said some 500 letters were received from parents and eight to 10 from advertisers. Mrs. Meyer said she only knew of about 150 to 175 letters from parents and two from advertisers. In her letter of response to the letter writers, Mrs. Meyer said that the editor “has made a mistake in judgment” and that It was “an unfortunate decision.” Then, noting the change of ownership, she wrote, “You can understand how bad we feel to end our association with Ingenue on such a note.” The ad in Women's Wear ran under the headline, “Public Notice.” After noting that The New Ingenue” is a new magazine with a new staff and “a new viewpoint,” it added in smaller print, “Let it be known that this magazine completely disassociates itself from the currently published Ingenue magazine with its contents, with its publishers, with its staff—in every way.” Dell is not mentioned by name. Triangle's Seventeen with a circulation of 1.5 million has, according to Ray Robinson, its managing editor, “covered contemporary social issues in a responsible way.” These included both sides of the abortion controversy and veneral disease “hot lines.” “We don't sensationalize,” he said, “We refuse to exploit sex and we don't exploit our readers either.” Mr. Simmons of Twenty First said that until his company's take‐over it gad no editorial controls over the magazine, but that the agreement signed last November called for it to be consistent with past issues. The May issue of The New Ingenue features on its cover a come‐on for its nationwide survey, “Would you pose nude for a centerfold?” “There's nothing in there that's sexy,” explained Mr. Simmons. Despite the fact that it produces America's most mis understood soft drink, Dr Pepper has managed to move strongly into fourth place in carbonated beverage sales in 1972. That good news and more will appear in the April 20 issue of Beverage Industry, which notes that the 21.9 per cent sales increase for. Dr Pepper pushed it ahead of Royal Crown Cola, despite that brands best sales year.’ The top three are still the same, Coca‐Cola, Pepsi‐Cola and Seven‐Up.  Young & Rubicam is the agency for Dr Pepper. Why not send them a case. Triangle Publications has progressed far enough with its plans for a food‐oriented sister ship to TV Guide, to produce a prototype issue. The first issue, dated September, will go on sale Aug. 28, Triangle promises, and it will be 120 pages. The name, Good Food. “This September, America will get its first taste of Good Food,” says Triangle, which should be ashamed of itself. WNBC‐TV and Della Fernins, Travisano & Partners, Inc., have terminated their relationship. CIG Computer Products, Inc., Stamford, Conn., to Philip Stogel Advertising.

Health Agencies Plan No Aborted Fetus Research,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/13/archives/health-agencies-plan-no-aborted-fetus-research-statement-disclosed.html,"BETHESDA, Md., April 12 — More than 100 opponents of abortion attended a meeting at the National Institutes of Health here today to ask questions about the institutes’ policy on the use of aborted human fetuses for medical research. The meeting was prompted by students at the Stone Ridge Country Day School of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic school for girls near the institutes here. The students asked for the meeting to protest any possible present or future use of live aborted human fetuses for research purposes. In addition to students from the school and from the Landon School, a private boys school in Bethesda, the meeting was attended by a substantial number of adults, including at least one medical student from Georgetown University and a representative from the Kennedy Institute in Washington. Speaking for the health institutes was Dr. Charles U. Lowe, scientific director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a unit of the N. I. H. He opened the meeting by reading a brief statement by Dr. Robert Berliner, the institutes’ deputy director for science. “The N.I.H. does not now support research on live aborted human fetuses and does not contemplate approving the support of such research,” the statement said. “We know of no circumstances at present or in the foreseeable future which would justify N.I.H. support of research on live aborted human fetuses.” Dr. Lowe said the institutes had began exploring policy on the matter about two years ago, when reports from Scandinavia and Britain indicated that some such research was being conducted in Europe. The fetuses involved were generally too young and too incompletely developed to survive. The could, however, be kept alive for several hours in the laboratory. Dr. Lowe said that a special committee of the institutes had been established to consider policy on all areas of human experimentation, including fetal research. After the meeting, he said that the institutes’ committee on human experimentation was expected to report to the director with a proposed policy statement by about July 1. Earlier this week, a newspaper for physicians, Ob.‐Gyn. News, distributed primarily to obstetricians and gynecologists, disclosed that a statement concerning the use of aborted fetuses for research had been adopted in March, 1972, by the Child Health Institute's national advisory council, whose official name is the National Child Health and Human Development Council. The statement did not specify that it was referring to living fetuses. The text of the statement published by Ob.‐Gyn. News said: “Scientific studies of the human fetus are an integral and necessary part of research concerned with the health of women and children. Because of the unusual problems involved in a growing competence and interest in the field, ethically and scientifically acceptable guidelines for the conduct of such investigation must be developed.” The advisory council's statement also said that the guide lines for protecting minors and other helpless subjects would be applicable to such cases, that informed consent would have to be obtained from the appropriate persons and that any applicable state, national or other laws should be binding. Several months before that statement was accepted by the board, a Natiohal Institutes of Health study section on human embryology and development described some criteria for such studies. These were also published last week by Ob.‐Gyn. News. The guidelines specified that the abortus should be no more than 20 cofnpleted weeks of gestation, should weigh no more than 500 grams (slightly more than a pound and be no more than 25 centimeters (slightly less than 10 inches) in length. Modifications of both statements have been drafted and the whole issue is currently under discussion at the institutes. On Tuesday, officials of the United States Catholic Conference issued a statement in Washington deploring any proposal to permit experimentation on aborted human fetuses. The proposals were described as “a further indication of the eroding value placed on human life in a permissive abortion atmosphere.”"
Abortion Foes Mount Drive on Hospitals,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/15/archives/abortion-foes-mount-drive-on-hospitals-letter-drive-planned.html,"NEWARK — Anti‐abortion organizations, employing petitions, picketing, public relations and political and economic pressures, have begun a concerted drive throughout New Jersey to sway public opinion and hospitals against performing abortions. The vigorous campaign follows the historic ruling by the United States Supreme Court last Jan. 22, which permitted abortions during the first three months of pregnancy. Previously, New Jersey law, which is now superseded by the court's decision, allowed abortions only if the life of the mother was endangered by pregnancy. The anti‐abortionists, who prefer to be known as “prolife” advocates, achieved a major victory when they persuaded two nonsectarian general hospitals—Riverside in Boonton and Newcomb in Vineland—not to follow the Supreme Court ruling and maintain their previous policy. A third hospital — Point Pleasant in Ocean County—said it would not perform abortions, except to save the mother, and asserted that it had not been subjected to any anti‐abortion pressures. The 140 hospitals in the state are a major target of the anti‐abortionists, some of whom are planning a massive letter‐writing campaign to hospitals in Bergen, Union, Essex and Hudson Counties. According to the New Jersey Hospital Association, which represents all 140 institutions, most of the hospitals have decided to permit abortions. The association did not have any specific breakdown, but it said that each hospital made the decision on an individual basis. The 16 Roman Catholic hospitals that belong to the association do not permit abortions. Initially, Riverside Hospital trustees adopted the more liberal abortion policy allowed by the Supreme Court ruling, and two abortions were performed there. But the Morris County chapter of the statewide Right to Life Committee began a letterwriting campaign against the decision and threatened economic sanctions against the institution. “Can we, in good conscience, continue to support the fund‐raising activities and services of Riverside Hospital, which has so little regard for human life?” a committee member, Thomas Licciardi, wrote in a letter published in several local newspapers. Mr. Licciardi, a 39‐year‐old father of seven children, had organized a demonstration that was to take place at the hospital today, but canceled it when Riverside reversed its decision. Gordon Elliott, the Riverside administrator, said the trustees decided on a “temporary suspension” of the new policy so that “further evaluations of the policy and the problems” could be made. The trustees, Mr. Elliott said, also want to determine “if the majority of the community” is opposed to the liberalized policy. Because of the suspension, the hospital administrator added, Riverside has been threatened with a law suit by a proabortion group. In Vineland, trustees of Newcomb Hospital received a score of petitions and hundreds of letters from both pro‐abortion and anti‐abortion forces. Three weeks ago, the trustees voted, 8 to 4, against abortions, but they declined to spell out their reasons in a terse three‐paragraph announcement. A hospital spokesman said there were “rumors that local groups might cut off financial aid” to the hospital if the abortion policy was liberalized. He said that the hospital, like Riverside in Boonton, had been threatened with a court suit from a proabortion group, Action for Abortion Rights. In Ocean County, the administrator of Point Pleasant Hospital said that the institution had received more than 100 letters praising its anti‐abortion decision, and only one negative letter. Richard Leone, the administrator, said the 13 trustees unanimously voted for an anti‐abortion policy because “abortions are contrary to the express purpose of a hospital: preserving and maintaining life.” Some Hospitals Picketed A number of hospitals have been picketed and subjected to other pressures, but the anti‐abortionists were not always successful. Five days of picketing and telephone calls to trustees failed to keep Underwood Memorial in Woodbury from adopting an abortion policy within the Supreme Court guidelines. The anti‐abortionists say their ranks include people of all religious faiths, not just Roman Catholics, who have traditionally led the opposition. The chairman of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee, Dr. Samuel A. Jeanes, is a Baptist minister. He said that the committee's board of directors included a rabbi and other Protestant clergymen. The committee is the largest anti‐abortionist group in the state. It says its newsletter is mailed to nearly 10,000 people. The committee is an umbrella group that distributes literature, slide shows and other materials and provides speakers for its 21 county units. Dr. Jeanes said that the state committee was strictly a funnel for information and did not lobby or pressure anyone; however, the county chapters do campaign for the cause. For example, the Union County chapter is questioning all legislative candidates about their views on abortion and a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would, in effect, prohibit abortions. All of the county Right to Life units and allied groups are collecting petitions to send to state legislators and Congressmen, urging the passage of such an amendment. Dr. Jeanes said that 27 state legislators had signed the petition so far. Another active anti‐abortion organization is the New Jersey Knights of Columbus, a lay Catholic men's group, which is sponsoring an essay contest for public high school students. The themes are: “The Unborn Baby's Right to Life” and “The Constitution Should Be Amended to Protect the Lives of Unborn Babies.” Because of the controversial nature of the contest, some school boards are opposed to it. In Dumont, for example, a school official said that abortion was not among the approved list of subjects for such contests, and doubted that the Knights would be granted permission to conduct it. Despite the dispute, the Knights of Columbus intends to announce the winners on May 13—Mother's Day."
INMATES PRAISE PRENATAL CLINIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/15/archives/inmates-praise-prenatal-clinic-gynecological-clinic-too-5-chose.html,"A prenatal clinic that has been operating at Rikers Island for nearly five months now has drawn praise from hundreds of inmates who say they now receive immediate medical attention during pregnancy. The clinic also provides counseling and assists women inmates in the placement of their babies. Before the prenatal clinic was started, pregnant inmates—or inmates who suspected they were pregnant—would visit the crowded morning clinic in the Women's House of Detention. In an emergency, they were taken to nearby Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, where they still are taken to give birth. “Pregnant inmates at Rikers just weren't afforded any special care,” said Andrea Lefkowitz, a former volunteer worker now employed by the Health Services Administration. “No attempt was made to prescribe vitamins, for instance, and individual counseling was practically nonexistent.” According to officials, at least 40 of the prison's 600 women inmates are pregnant at any given time. But more than 200 women use the clinics facilities each month, because examinations are also conducted to detect venereal disease. “An alarming number of inmates have V.D.,” said Miss Lefkowitz, who was graduated from college early this year. While precise figures were not available, Dr. Elly Stern, the physician in charge of women inmates at Rikers Island, said about 20 cases were detected each week. Actually, the prenatal clinic, which was set up by Miss Lefkowitz, is open only on Mondays. But a gynecological clinic has also been set up and women inmates can visit it four days a week. This clinic has a doctor and a nurse for consultation, X‐ray equipment and facilities for blood and pregnancy tests. “What we do, essentially, is maintain records on the women who come to us for consultation,” Miss Lefkowitz said. “In addition, we prescribe a special diet and vitamins and iron. Then we check regularly whether or not the women abide by the prescriptions. Most do.” In addition to the medical services, the prenatal clinic provides inmates information on abortions and planned parenthood. A majority of the pregnant inmates are unmarried and nearly 85 per cent are narcotics addicts, according to prison officials. “Eight women have had babies in the time that we've run the clinic,” Miss Lefkowitz said, adding that five other women chose to have abortions. All of the women who had babies had relatives who took custody of the children. But Miss Lefkowitz said that she is in contact with a number of child‐placement agencies who could be of help in the event relatives refused to raise an inmate's child."

Teacher Who Opposed Flag Pledge Wins Court Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/17/archives/teacher-who-opposed-flag-pledge-wins-court-fight-plea-by-elks.html,"WASHINGTON, April 16— The Supreme Court let stand today a decision barring public school officials from discharging a teacher who refuses to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag with pupils in her homeroom. Mrs. Susan Russo, a high school art teacher, was dismissed by authorities of Henrietta, a Rochester suburb, when they found that she was remaining silent while the pledge was broadcast over the school's public address system each morning and followed by the pupils. Mrs. Russo told school officials that she refused to give the pledge “as a matter of conscience.” She rejected the pledge's assurance of liberty and justice for all as “hypocritical” and said she preferred to demonstrate her patriotism by actions rather than recitations. A Federal District Court trial denied the teacher's bid for reinstatement, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decision, maintaining that her discharge had been an unconstitutional violation of her right to freedom of speech. In declining to review the appellate court decision today, the Supreme Court rejected arguments by the school board that Mrs. Russo had refused to perform a legitimate educational task, preferring to express her personal political views instead. The high court also dismissed an appeal by 15 Maine lodges of the Elks, who sought unsuccessfully to bar the State Liquor Commission from denying them licenses because the fraternal organization does not accept blacks as members. The dissenting Justices in the 6‐to‐3 decision did not question this attempt to discourage discrimination, but they objected to another part of the Maine law that permits organizations to discriminate as to their members if they are “ethnic in character.” Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the minority that the Court should have taken jurisdiction of the case to review the constitutionality of the state's sanctioning of ethnic discrimination. In another decision, the Justices declined to review a decision that rejected a challenge by the New York District Council of the International Long‐shoremen's Association to construction of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. A group of union members had sued to prevent construction of the twin skyscrapers on the grounds that the buildings would tend to deprive the dock workers of a livelihood by filling 23 acres of West Side harbor area and eliminating 11 Hudson River piers. While the case was pending, much of the construction was completed. With Justice Douglas dissenting, the high court also let stand a decision prohibiting zoning officials in Santa Fe, N. M., from ,imposing limits of the use of 5,000 acres of Indian reservation land that have been leased to a private developer. The real estate company maintained that the land was still under Federal jurisdiction and illumine from local zoning. Some 18 Indian tribes were given authority in 1955 to lease reservation land for residential and business purposes. The Court also denied a rehearing sought by anti‐abortion forces in New York and Connecticut who were trying to upset the decision the Justices handed down in January, holding that states cannot prohibit abortions except during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy. Special to The New York Times HARTFORD, April 16 — Today's decision by the Supreme Court “puts an end to legal efforts to defend the constitutionality of the present Connecticut abortion law and leaves the state with no abortion law at all,” Attorney General Robert K. Killian said. The Federal District Court here, which twice declared the state's tough anti‐abortion laws unconstitutional, must now prepare a decision based on the Supreme Court's liberal guidelines. “That three‐judge court decision, when rendered, will provide the basis for any further legislative action in this field,” Mr. Killian said. Several abortion bills are in committee in he Assembly now. It would take two or three weeks to get new legislation out of the Assembly, Francis J. Collins, a Brookfield Republican and Speaker of the House, and Mr. Collins, anticipating the passage, with his help, of liberal abortion regulation bill, said: “We have to respect the Supreme Court, no matter how disasteful we find its decisions.”"

The transformation was wrought by $800,000 worth of restoration that included vacuuming two inches of dust from nooks and crannies in the ceiling, painting, washing down the stained glass windows, and patching flaking pillars. Worshipers for the first time may now get a good look at the hats of four cardinals suspended from the ceiling 112 feet high. Cardinal Cooke called the restoration “a return to the cathedral's original beauty and majesty—something that none of us has ever seen.” Msgr. James F. Rigney, the cathedral administrator, said the reaction most generally heard from worshipers was: “Wow!” Factory Workers Get Increased Pay Average weekly earnings of factory workers in the New York‐northeastern New Jersey area rose 40 cents, to $159.97 weekly, during February according to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That Summer of 1870,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/19/archives/that-summer-of-1870.html,"This year, New Yorkers again will be treated to the city's annual ridTimes‐Square‐of‐undesirables summer festival. If history is any guide, this clean‐up will elimiriate only the most visible, allurements of vice—the streetwalker— for a few months at best. New York's vice will continue to thrive here—as it has for the last 150 years. “There is no city in the world where there is so much vice, so many entirely abandoned, and reckless women . . . as in New York,” lamented one journalist after the Civil War. By 1870, over 10,000 professional courtesans lived in a New York City of 950,000 persons, according to several newspaper estimates. Day and night, saucily dressed young women strolled past the elegant hotels, shops, and theaters of fashionable downtown Broadway—glancing “quickly but searchingly at every man they passed.” A friendly smile and a jaunty ,“How do you do, my dear? Come, won't you go home with me?” was a familiar greeting on the Broadway trottoir. Broadway's “peripatetic whorearchy,” as it was called, was the best known but only the smallest portion of the city's “strumpet‐ocracy.”, Most prostitutes were “waiter girls” at one of the 500 “concert saloons” scattered throughout the city or lived in one of the “ladies’ boarding houses” whose red‐front door lamps twinkled all night from one end to the other of Greene and Mercer Streets. What were regarded as filthy pictures and dirty books also was a flourishing business in New York by the 1840's. Young boys often sold the “most indecent and immoral” books in broad daylight on Broadway —“especial care being taken to display the engravings.” In the eighteen‐fifties, the Venus Miscellaney magazine offered stories and illustrations “fouler than the most morbid imagination could conceive.” The magazine also received 150 orders each day in the mail from all over the nation lot its popular “bawdy yellowcovered literature.” New York's wealthy and fashionable Upper Ten Thousand enjoyed—in secret — these same pleasures they so vehemently criticized in public. New York society has “refinement and vice perfected . . . it has civilization and it has barbarism,” declared the worldly journalist Nathaniel Parker Willis, who himself enjoyed the fashionable social follies of the Upper Ten Thousand. In the eighteen‐sixties, several biownstone mansions alohg Fifth Avenue were luxurious brothels. A fine.troadway restaurant had “a sort of secret establishment overhead that I have never rightly understood,” wrote one visitor to New York in the early eighteen‐fifties. “You always, day and night, see a set of hacks standing here: they understand.” Well‐to‐do women also enjoyed their fashionable vices. At the height of the frenzied winter social season, many prominent women reputedly endured the giddy whirl of nightly midnight suppers and balls only with the much‐whispered‐about “Cordial Elixir,” prepared by a druggist near Gramercy Park. Another indispensable fixture of the fashionable tipper Ten Thousand was Madame Restell, the society abortionist and the “wickedest woman in New York.” Abortions and induced miscarriages kept Fifth Avenue families “fashionably small.” The competent and discreet Restell was hated not because she practiced abortion but because she practiced it so openly and without shame. She advertised her “preventive powders” and services in several newspapers, enjoyed a daily ride through Central Park in her stylish carriage, and lived and worked in an extravagant brownstone mansion at Fifth Avenue and East 52d Street. The Broadway streetwalkers offered another easy target of vice drives. During the city's 1855 “foray among the unhappy women who perambulate Broadway,” Trinity Church vestryman George Templeton Strong confided to his diary that, “What the Mayor seeks to abolish or abate is not the terrible evil of prostitution . . . but simply the scandal and offense of the peripatetic whorearchy. He is . . . trying to keep vice from proclaiming its allurements in the market place. The great, notorious ‘ladies boarding houses’ of Leonard and Mercer Streets are left in peace.” One hundred years ago—as today—society hypocritically tolerated prostitution, dirty pictures and abortion only as long as they were discreet, out of the way, tainted with shame. But once these activities came out into the open and were easily available to more than just the very rich and very poor, society suddenly, saw itself besieged by a wave of vice and sin. So, as Mayor Lindsay and the collection of would‐be mayors call for a clean‐up of the city this summer, let's first look to the thousands of New Yorkers who now fight the daily boredom of long subway rides by reading “sexcapade” paperbacks or line up for a spicy X‐rated flick at their neighborhood theater."

Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/21/archives/us-first-stop-on-tanaka-tour-notes-on-people.html,"Premier Kakuei Tanaka of Japan said he would visit the United States for talks with President Nixon in June or July. The Premier said at a news conference in the city of Nagoya, where he was campaigning for a conservative candidate in the mayoral election, that his visit to Washington would be followed by trips to the Soviet Union in August and to Britain, France and West Germany in October. Mr. Tanaka said he would use the trips to promote his policy of “multipolar diplomacy.” In Peking, Chairman Mao Tse‐tung met for 90 minutes with President Luis Echeverria Alvarez of Mexico. Their talk was described as “most cordial,” and it caused Mr. Echeverria to be late for a ballet performance at the Great Hall of the People. A spokesman for the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel said that one of the last things Gina Lollobrigida, the actress, did before returning to Rome was to report to the police here that $26,000 worth of jewelry had been stolen from her suite at the Waldorf Towers. Miss Lollobrigida left yesterday morning. The jewels were a pair of earrings and a diamond brooch. The police said there was no sign of forced entry into the 32d floor suite where the actress had stayed. In Detroit, however, the husband of Carol Channing, the actress, issued a public appeal for the return of his wife's false eyelashes, which she uses in the musical “Lorelei.” The eyelashes were returned, but a wedding ring and silver cufflinks that were stolen with them remained stolen. In an alfresco Good Friday rite, Pope Paul VI carried a large wooden cross near the Colosseum in Rome. In a brief address, the Pontiff called for an end to violence in the world, the “inhumanity” of abortions, to crime that today is becoming professional and organized” and to the increase of international annament. Tenthousand people attended the ceremony. Pravda, the official organ of the Soviet Communist party, said that Olga Korbut, the gymnast, and her teammates had brought fond memories home from their eight‐city tour of the United States. “President Nixon,” a Soviet sports official said in Pravda, “warmly received the sportswomen. He said he regarded them as representatives of Soviet youth and that future contacts between the two countries depend on how young people in the United States and the Soviet Union would understand one another.” “I don't want to sound like the beleaguered Governor, because I'm not,” said Gov. Philip W. Noel of Rhode Island. Then he gave a summary of some of the events that have beleaguered him in his first months in office: “The president of the Providence Gas Company is a personal friend of mine, and I was in office three weeks, and we rail out of natural gas. Then they burned down the prison, took all the Navy bases out of Rhode Island, and now we have some Panamanian tanker that has mutinied. We may not have the most problems in the world,” the Governor said, “but if we're not first, we're way ahead of whoever is second.” Prime Minister Gough Whitlam of Australia, whose moves to reduce his country's traditional ties with Britain include the replacement of “God Save the Queen” as the national anthem, arrived at Windsor Castle as the guest of Queen Elizabeth II. Mr. Whitlam arrived in London with his wife and daughter after a visit to Canada and told newsmen that the “inevitable and essential” change in relations between Britain and Australia did not mean they were drifting apart. Mr. Whitlam is also scheduled to talk with Prime Minister Heath. “The strongest evidence to prove that God exists is a beautiful woman” said President Giovanni Leone of Italy. “I adore women,” said Mr. Leone in an interview with the magazine Europeo. “To me, women are the most beautiful things in the world and certainly I'd like to see a woman as President of the republic. I'm a feminist in my own way.” JAMES F. CLARITY"
L.I. Women's Lib Group Screening Therapists,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/22/archives/li-womens-lib-group-screening-therapists-young-marrieds-a-problem.html,"HEMPSTEAD, L.I. — Consciousness‐raising talk groups have been used in the women's movement, in contrast to therapy, with the explanation, “We're lot sick, we're oppressed.” For those concerned that they might be both, a therapy referral committee has been formed here to help sort it out. The committee is one of many at the Women's Liberation Center of Nassau County. The center coordinates a network of consciousnessraising groups throughout the county in addition to housing services and committees for special needs. An abortion reFerrel committee has also been formed and a legal referral committee is being considered. The therapy referral committee offers a list of prescreened therapists to women wary of picking one at random that might not be in sympathy with their values. Fay Kuriloff, a committee member, said it was formed in response to calls for help that came into the center, and recurring reports at talk sessions of upsetting experiences with therapists. Members of the committee said that among the women who had had what they called “bad experiences” with previous unscreened therapists was a married woman told by her therapist to have an affair and an unmarried one told by her therapist to find a lover. Dr. Bernice Hamerling, a psychologist accepted by the committee for its list, said she had received complaints from patients who had been through the traditional approach “in which the person is in a passive role receiving treatment, while the therapist takes a lofty detached view. This is supposed to foster ‘transference’ — you form whatever relationship your psyche needs to form. “It's a dependent, powerless and impotent role on the part of the patient. Increasingly, I see this as less necessary and peer therapy as more valuable. In it, two people put their heads together to solve a situation which one is too subjective to solve.” Dr. Hamerling described some of the “bad experiences” related by women referred to her, which were typical of many who sought out the referral committee's list as an alternative. Young Marrieds a Problem “There had been considerable trouble in one marriage,” Dr, Hamerling said. “The woman had been considered a ‘naughty girl’ because she had not been the wife the therapist expected. One woman was told she didn't appreciate her husband, that he was too good for her. Her therapist threatened her with hospitalization. Dr. Hamerling, asked if women in the movement seeking therapy was an indication that they were more troubled than those outside the movement, replied: “It's becoming increasingly clear to me that in any constellation — a couple, a family — it's the healthiest member who seeks treatment. I would say this is resoundingly true of the women who come to me from the committee.” She said most of the eight or nine women who have come are “young marrieds,” who have been married 10 to 15 years and who have married very young.” “They're simply not content to be appendages to husbands,” she said. “Most are bright. They have to have a good deal of ego strength to make this decision at all. Several have affairs (not a case where the woman finds the ‘right man’ after finding the ‘wrong man’) and try a fling into independence. “Usually they make the decision to go to school rather than continuing the affairs. I root for going to school. Usually I don't root for the affairs because I see them as self‐defeating — it's a way of keeping a woman just where she was but giving a little novelty.” Fay Kuriloff said that before the committee was formed the center had received “an enormous num ber” of requests for therapists. “We kept a Iist in the files of personal recommendations from members and of personal bad experiences members had with particular therapists,” she said. “The women ‘personning’ the phones found the need to come up with therapists who would not try to keep a woman in what society has designated as her role.” Therapists Interviewed The committee formed in May, 1972, and, after drawing up guidelines, began interviewing therapists in June. Some of the therapists interviewed were recommended by center members. Some therapists read about the referral system in the center newsletter and asked to be interviewed. Others heard by word of mouth of the referral group and offered their services. There have been 19 accepted for the referral list, including one psychiatrist, six psychologists with doctorate degrees, one with a doctrate in human development, eight with masters' degrees in social work, one with a master's in psychology and two guidance counselors. Four are men, including the psychiatrist. Several therapists have been turned down by the committee. A therapist who won the committee's favor answered their question about the distinction between femininity and masculinity this way: “Whatever a woman is, is feminine. Whatever a man is, is masculine.” One of those recently accepted for the referral list is Dr. Ruth Formanek, who recalled: “They asked a lot of questions that I thought showed a lot of thought. They were not committed to any theory or any school of therapy. Life‐Styles Considered “They asked about my background, training, job experience, how I conceived the process of therapy. I saw it as an interpersonal experience which focused on problems a person might have Because of the relation to the therapist, the same problems emerge in the therapeutic relationship. The goal is to make the person conscious of the patterns that might interfere with the relationships she might want to have.” Asked about her goals in therapy, she said she responded by saying it should “permit a person to self‐actualize her potential.” In answer to a question on persons with alternate lifestyles, including homosexuality, she said there should be room for any one to live in any way she wants, provided it is not harmful to the person or others. “I think sometimes heterosexuality is used as a defense and one might look on it as a symptom,” she said. But I had a patient who used her homosexuality to fight her parents with and also to shock me. After a while we focused on the real issues, which were her relationship to people in general — she was isolated, alienated and depressed. She became more open to men and women and to realize that there were other than sexual relationships.” In answer to another question from the committee during their interview, she said that all of the sex roles were acquired through learning in the social structure. She also referred to “a notion” expressed by some on the committee that some supposed difficulties are introduced by the doctor and accepted as problems by suggestible patients. “A large number of women consider themselves frigid either because of what their therapist told them or because of a statement read in Freud,” she said. “So the cure is semantic — I might say: ‘I'll give you another definition and you won't be frigid.’” Women seeking a therapist call the center at 292–8106 from 10 AM to 4 PM weekdays, and may leave a telephone number, with or without a name, for the committee member on duty that week to call. If the woman seeking help would rather not leave a number, she is given the telephone number of the committee member on that week's “intake” duty. The committee member may ask if she has an idea of what kind of therapy she wants or could briefly describe why she feels she needs help so she can be matched with a few therapists on the list who have expressed interest or indicated skill in the area required. The caller is also asked if there is any money problem to be considered in the selection of a therapist. Those on the list charge nothing or a minimal fee for the intial visit, in keeping with the committee's belief that women should “shop around” among those on the list before selecting a therapist, as part of the women's movement goal of taking charge of their own lives."
Acupuncture Used As an Anesthesia in Four Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/23/archives/acupuncture-used-as-an-anesthesia-in-four-abortions.html,"WASHINGTON, April 22 (UN) — Doctors at the Washington Hospital Center have successfully used acupuncture as anesthesia in four recent abortions and plan to use the ancient Chinese technique in other kinds of surgery.The women volunteered undergo acupuncture. Hospital officials said they suffered fewer aftereffects from the abortions than would have been expected if a conventional anesthetic had been used. However, the hospital does not plan to use acupuncture widely in abortions because it is time‐consuming. It is expected to be used in special cases or when a woman is allergic to conventional anesthetics. The use of acupuncture was described by the hospital to patients as a “conservative evaluation program.” The progra includes study of the chemical changes that occur in animals as the result of its use. In its use as an anesthetic during abortions, the stainless steel needles are inserted at eight pairs of points on the feet, legs, stomach and hands. The needles are connected to wires carrying an alternating electric current. During the four abortions performed under acupuncture no pain‐relieving medication or drugs were needed, even after the abortions. Dr. F. Norman Berry said he was impressed by the relaxation the acupuncture permitted and the ease with which dilators can be inserted into the cervix without causing pain."
"Campus Activism Fades, Style of 1950's Prevails",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/23/archives/campus-activism-fades-style-of-1950s-prevailss-political-activism.html,"Political activism is moribund at colleges and universities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and students have taken on the superficial appearance of their self‐centered, socially indifferent, AllAmerican campus counterparts of the nineteen‐fifties. They are cutting their hair, studying harder, shunning esoteric life‐styles and their behavior is generally so docile that a few formerly embattled school administrators call it eerie. A few other school officials say this has been going on so long it is just boring. After three years of campus calm that followed the uprisings over the Cambodia invasion and the Kent State killings, this postwar spring has settled in with a political sleepy ‐ headedness unequaled since the Eisenhower years. Many students cannot recall when they last heard fiery rhetoric, let alone saw a demonstration. National issues — as well as most state and local ones—are all but ignored. Even the Watergate scandal hardly raised an eyebrow. And while some questions involving women's rights, local housing and campus safety occasionally cause a stir, the remaining radicals are Pirandello ‐ like characters In search of a cause. This seems all the more dramatic today, the fifth anniversary of the student uprising at Columbia University, where hundreds were injured and arrested in clashes with the police. Though reasons vary considerably, the vast majority of students now appear to be devoted to themselves—to achieving success, acquiring money and having a good time—all in the most cherished, middleclass Establishment style. These are the major conclusions drawn from interviews in recent weeks with hundreds of students, faculty members and school administrators by campus correspondents of The New York Times at tristate colleges and universities. The survey of student interests, activities, concerns and life‐styles, supplemented by the correspondents’ own observations, also pointed up the following: ¶Most students believe that demonstrations and other forms of protest by students over the Vietnam war and other issues in the nineteen‐sixties achieved little or nothing. The idealism of the effort is admired, but the effort itself is thought to have been unrealistic and the issues too abstract. ¶Students are most concerned about their own pursuits and futures—about their grades, chances of getting into graduate schools and lucrative careers, marriage prospects, personal ambitions, personal friendships and, occasionally, what they consider a realistically solvable problem, such as a rash of thefts in a dormitory. ¶They also chase the bluebirds of happiness of the nineteen‐fifties. Liquor, wine and beer are increasingly popular, as are on‐campus pubs and schmaltzy juke ‐ box dancing. There have even been a few mock‐nostalgic formal dances. Marijuana, pill‐popping and sex are big party favorites, but opiates have virtually no takers. ¶Alienation as a general attitude and the generation gap in particular are not in vogue. Many faculty members and school administrators talk of student courtesy, civility and attentiveness; many students praise their teachers, discount the radicals’ perception of administrators as reactionary and talk effusively about their parents as understanding and generous. ¶Long hair, scruffy blue jeans and faded shirts—once symbols of defiance—have lost their radical connotations, and barbers and stylish clothiers are making a comeback. Students say there is more freedom and less pressure to conform in matters of personal appearance. ¶Besides ignoring nearly all political and social issues of public concern, students at many schools have lost interest in what was once a major push to gain a voice in the policies and operations of their schools. Student‐government organizations also lack support generally, though they are important at a few schools. ¶Race relations appear to be generally good, but many blacks and Latin students maintain “Third World” corridors in classrooms and dormitories and a voluntary separatism in social life that may hide tensions to some extent. Much of the white‐liberal guilt in campus race relations of the last decade seems to be gone. Interviews suggesting these general trends were conducted at Fordham, Columbia and New York Universities and the City College of New York here; the State University centers at Stony Brook and Binghamton; Vassar College at Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Rutgers and Princeton Universities in New Jersey and Yale University and Connecticut College in Connecticut. The end of direct American involvement in Vietnam and the end of the military draft are the most obvious arid frequently cited reasons for the vanishing stock of political activism. But others cited a disillusionment with radicals and many said they thought the era of demonstrations had accomplished nothing and left the student body‐politic benumbed. “I thought the persons who organized us were out for peace, love and happiness,” said Dorinda Deodata, a Fordham senior. “Then we got to Washington and they started throwing rocks through windows and chanting ‘Ho‐Ho‐HoChi‐Minh.’ They used us.” “The killing of millions and discrimination just does not arouse the feeling that it did five years ago,” said Mark Dawson, a student‐government leader at Stony Brook. “Things like the Watergate caper don't shock anybody. Nothing shocks anybody anymore.” “Lobbying is the style for the seventies,” said Mitch Medine, the student‐government president at Binghamton. “Ten well‐informed people making their cases in Congress or in the State Legislature can be more effective than a half‐million people in the streets.” Not all issues of public concern are dead. Housing and tenants’ rights have drawn attention recently at Rutgers, Binghamton and Columbia. Crime—mainly thefts and assaults—are cited as concerns at Stony Brook and Columbia. Homosexual movements received considerable attention this year at Fordham, and just last week—contrary to the Ren‐ eral apolitical trend—the Student Peace Union at Fordham said its 30 members had raised $700 on campus for Quaker relief efforts in Vietnam. Apathy Called a Problem At Yale, about 70 people turned up at a recent demonstration against a Marine recruiter on campus. But the Yale Political Union, which brings notables to speak on campus, made its big splash of the year in February with the appearance of Ann Landers, the syndicated‐advice columnist, who was applauded for favoring abortion on demand. In general, the women's liberation movement is the most prevalent political force on college campuses, but its leadens say apathy rather than opposition is their biggest problem. Outwardly, the broad retreat in the last three years from political activism to personal and parochial concerns appears to be a resurgence of the middie‐class values and apathetic innocence of the nineteen‐fifties. But there are numerous indications that the similarities are only superficial, that the upheavals of the nineteen‐sixties have left permanent imprints on the student psyche. “Less Hypocritical” Today's college student appears to be more aware but more cynical about the nation's problems, less inhibited but less inclined to act in situations without concrete aims and the prospect of success. Many object to being called apathetic and refer to themselves as “practical” or “realistic.” “People who got involved in politics found out they were ineffective,” said Elisa Curialle, a 20‐year‐old N.Y.U. senior, voicing a popular view. “They're facing personal problems now,” she went on. “I think those problems are really harder to solve. Anyone can sit down and discuss what to do about poverty. People realize now that you can't live without money. They're less hypocritical. It's no longer unfashionable to say you're looking for a job to get money.” A C.C.N.Y. student, Larry Peobles, said students had a “monumental ambivalence toward all issues that have nothing to do with their own ambitions or goals.” As for idealism, he added: “Once you give up wanting to be a fireman or a cowboy, you're only in it for the money.” Lucrative Goals Cited Citing inflation, rising unemployment and increasing competition in graduate schools and the professional job markets—plus their own desires to make lots of money—students are spending more time studying and directing their efforts toward the lucrative goals. “We're caught in a professional sandwich,” said Carolyn Grillo, a Yale Junior. “One slice is law school, the other is medical school.” At Princeton, Jay Lucker, a librarian, said: “If you come to the main library at 9 P.M., it looks like Grand Central Station.” This was echoed in reports from most schools surveyed. Though academic performance is difficult to measure, school officials generallu said they thought it was improving. The rapidly increasing costs of education also have added to the mood of student seriousness, with many working to pay part of their expenses. At Princeton, where next year's minimum costs will be $5,400, nearly half of the 4,000 undergraduates hold part‐time jobs. Students are, nonetheless, relaxing. At Columbia this year, there have been beer‐drinking contests, tugs‐of‐war, ah iceskating party and a performance by a stripper hired by150 freshmen. The latter prompted a protest by women editors of The Columbia Daily Spectator. Drinking and dancing, somewhat tarnished relics of yesteryear, have been revived with gusto. Students regularly drink beer and dance to records in the Lion's Den in the basement of Ferris Booth Hall at Columbia—once a radical commandpost. “It's straight out of American Bandstand,” said 21‐year‐old Marcy Glanz, of Barnard. The Yale prom, which died in 1971, was resurrected last winter. Many considered it a joke, but other groups are now considering formal dances. Barbers Busy Again At Princeton, a new pub is the most popular spot on campus. Plans are under way to set up a bar in the student recreation building at Connecticut College in New London, and the pub in the student center at Binghamton had to be doubled in size recently to accommodate, overflowing crowds. Drinking tastes are also being upgraded. Sangria and jug wines used to be most popular among N.Y.U. students who patronize the Astor Place Liquor Store, according to the manager, Dominique Manzone. “Now they buy the better Italian and French wines,” he said. “They have graduated.” Marijuana and various types of pills, including depressants called Quaaludes, are widely popular. Jim Borzilleri, a. Vassar freshman, said that student energies formerly devoted to protests now “are in Quaaludes, alcohol, bad grass and good women.” Another Vassar student said: “The energies have paired off and gone to bed, locking the door behind them.” The sexual revolution is perhaps the clearest illustration that any similarity between students of today and those of the nineteen‐fifties is superficial. Co‐ed dormitories are now commonplace, as are apartment‐living arrangements between unwed men and women students. Many say an emotional commitment is no longer prerequisite for sexual relations. Personal appearance is increasingly amoral as well as apolitical. “There's no longer a romanticism about poverty,” said one N.Y.U. student. “For awhile it was very fashionable to look poor, especially if you weren't.” Barbers in and around campuses report brisk business, as do clothing stores with mod styles. But despite the appearance of dark fingernail polish and lipstick, unisex clothes and platform shoes—all seemingly faddish — most students say they feel little or no pressure to conform sartorially. “Last year, I'd walk into class with a skirt on and people would look at me like I had bad breath,” said a Princeton co‐ed. “Now, you can even wear stockings and not get the crazy stares.” The quest for student power in school operations and poli cies, which achieved some successes in the sixties, has left few traces at most schools. At C.C.N.Y., for example, student senate elections in the last three years have failed to draw more than 15 per cent of the voters. Some senate seats are unfilled because of dropouts, and the deadline for senatepresident nominations had to be extended recently because there were no contenders. Princeton's undergraduate assembly is an exception, influencing academic, financial and social functions considerably. “The perceptions of students have been very helpful in guiding the university committees to make balanced judgments,” said Princeton's provost, Sheldon Hackney. In a similar tone of amity, Fordham's president, the Rev. James Finlay, said his campus had experienced “a return to a spirit of warmth,” adding: “I don't run into hostility much anymore. There is a growth of civility among students.” Some students said the socalled “generation gap” no longer existed. “My mother and father are the best people know,” said Herbert Michaels, a member of the Students for Democratic Society at C.C.N.Y. “I also know a lot of teachers who are good people.” Another C.C.N.Y. student, Tom McDonald, put it another way: “There are an awful lot of 20‐year‐olds here with 50‐year‐old values. I've met people here whose only justification for taking education is [that] it pays $18,000 after seven years.” At most schools surveyed, little or no apparent racial tension was reported, though it was noted at several that blacks and Latin students maintain a “Third World” voluntary separatism in living accommodations and social situations. Dr. Lamar Miller, professor of education and the director of the Institute of Afro‐American Affairs at N:Y.U., said: “Black students have sort of been beaten back. They still complain about racism and discrimination and bias on the campus, but the effort to change things is not as it was.”"
Establishment Values Rule on Campus,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/23/archives/establishment-values-rule-on-campus-apathy-called-a-problem-less.html,"Political activism is moribund at colleges and universities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and students have taken on the superficial appearance of their self‐centered, socially indifferent, AllAmerican campus counterparts of the nineteen‐fifties. They are cutting their hair, studying harder, shunning esoteric life‐styles and their behavior is generally so docile that a few formerly embattled school administrators call it eerie. A few other school officials say this has been going on so long it is just boring. After three years of campus calm that followed the uprisings over the Cambodia invasion and the Kent State killings, this postwar spring has settled in with a political sleepyheadednes unequaled since the Eisenhower years. Many students cannot recall when they last heard fiery rhetoric, let alone saw a demonstration. National issues—as well as most state and local ones—are all but ignored. Even the Watergate scandal hardly raised an eyebrow. And while some questions involving women's rights, local housing and campus safety occasionally cause a stir, the remaining radicals are Pirandello‐like characters in search of a cause. This seems all the more dramatic today, the fifth anniversary of the student uprising at Columbia University, where hundreds were injured and arrested in clashes with the police. Though reasons vary considerably, the vast majority of students now appear to be devoted to themselves—to achieving success, acquiring money and having a good time—all in the most cherished, middleclass Establishment style. These are the major conclusions drawn from interviews in recent weeks with hundreds of students, faculty members and school administrators by campus correspondents of The New York Times at tristate colleges and universities. The survey of student interests, activities, concerns and life‐styles, supplemented by the correspondents' own observations, also pointed up the following: ¶Most students believe that demonstrations and other forms of protest by students over the Vietnam war and other issues in the nineteen‐sixties achieved little or nothing. The idealism of the effort is admired, but the effort itself is thought to have been unrealistic and the issues too abstract. ¶Students are most concerned about their own pursuits and futures—about their grades, chances of getting into graduate schools and lucrative careers, marriage prospects, personal ambitions, personal friendships and, occasionally, what they consider a realistically solvable problem, such as a rash of thefts in a dormitory. ¶They also chase the bluebirds of happiness of the nineteen‐fifties. Liquor, wine and beer are increasingly popular, as are on‐campus pubs and schmaltzy juke ‐ box dancing. There have even been a few mock‐nostalgic formal dances. Marijuana, pill‐popping and sex are big party favorites, but opiates have virtually no takers. ¶Alienation as a general attitude and the generation gap in particular are not in vogue. Many faculty members and school administrators talk of student courtesy, civility and attentiveness; many students praise their teachers, discount the radicals' perception of administrators as reactionary and talk effusively about their parents as understanding and generous. ¶Long hair, scruffy blue jeans and faded shirts—once symbols of defiance—have lost their radical connotations, and barbers and stylish clothiers are making a comeback. Students say there is more freedom and less pressure to conform in matters of personal appearance. ¶Besides ignoring nearly all political and social issues of public concern, students at many schools have lost interest in what was once a major push to gain a voice in the policies and operations of their schools. Student‐government organizations also lack support generally, though they are important at a few schools. ¶Race relations appear to be generally good, but many blacks and Latin students maintain “Third World” corridors in classrooms and dormitories and a voluntary separatism in social life that may hide tensions to some extent. Much of the white‐liberal guilt in campus race relations of the last decade seems to be gone. Interviews suggesting these general trends were conducted at Fordham, Columbia and New York Universities and the City College of New York here; the State University centers at Stony Brook and Binghamton; Vassar College at Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Rutgers and Princeton Universities in New Jersey and Yale University and Connnecticut College in Connecticut. The end of direct American involvement in Vietnam and the end of the military draft are the most obvious and frequently cited reasons for the vanishing stock of political activism. But others cited a disillusionment with radicals and many said they thought the era of demonstrations had accomplished nothing and left the student body‐politic benumbed. “I thought the persons who organized us were out for peace, love and happiness,” said Dorinda Deodata, a Fordham senior. “Then we got to Washington and they started throwing rocks through windows and chanting ‘Ho‐Ho‐HoChi‐Minh.’ They used us.” “The killing of ‐millions and discrimination just does not arouse the feeling that it did five years ago,” said Mark Dawson, a student‐government leader at Stony Brook. “Things like the Watergate caper don't shock anybody. Nothing shocks anybody anymore.” “Lobbying is the style for the seventies,” said Mitch Medine, the student‐government president at Binghamton. “Ten well‐informed people making their cases in Congress or in the State Legislature can be more effective than a half‐million people in the streets.” Not all issues of public concern are dead. Housing and tenants' rights have drawn attention recently at Rutgers, Binghamton and Columbia. Crime—mainly thefts and assaults—are cited as concerns at Stony Brook and Columbia. Homosexual movements received considerable attention this year at Fordham, and just last week—contrary to the general apolitical trend—the Student Peace Union at Fordham said its 30 members had raised $700 on campus for Quaker relief efforts in Vietnam. Apathy Called a Problem At Yale, about 70 people turned up at a recent demonstration against a Marine recruiter on campus. But the Yale Political Union, which brings notables to speak on campus, made its big splash of the year in February with the appearance of Ann Landers, the syndicated‐advice columnist, who was applauded for favoring abortion on demand. In general, the women's liberation movement is the most prevalent political force on college campuses, but its leaders say apathy rather than opposition is their biggest problem. Outwardly, the broad retreat in the last three years from political activism to personal and parochial concerns appears to be a resurgence of the middle‐class values and apathetic innocence of the nineteen‐fifties. But there are numerous indications that the similarities are only superficial, that the upheavals of the nineteen‐sixties have left permanent imprints on the student psyche. “Less Hypocritical” Today's college student appears to be more aware but more cynical about the nation's problems, less inhibited but less inclined to act in situations without concrete aims and the prospect of success. Many object to being called apathetic, and refer to themselves as “practical” or “realistic.” “People who got involved in politics found out they were ineffective,” said Elisa Curialle, a 20‐year‐old N.Y.U. senior, voicing a popular view. “They're facing personal problems now,” she went on. “I think those problems are really harder to solve. Anyone can sit down and discuss what to do about poverty. People realize now that you can't live without money. They're less hypocritical, It's no longer unfashionable to say you're looking for a job to get money.” A C.C.N.Y. student, Larry Peobles, said students had a “monumental ambivalence toward all issues that have nothing to do with their own ambitions or goals.” As for idealism, he added: “Once you give up wanting to be a fireman or cowboy, you're only, in it for the money.” Lucrative Goals Cited Citing inflation, rising unemployment and increasing competition in graduate schools and the professional job markets—plus their own desires to make lots of money—students are spending more time studying and directing their efforts toward the lucrative goals. “We're caught in a professional sandwich,” said Carolyn Grillo, a Yale Junior. “One slice is law school, the other is medical school.” At Princeton, Jay Lucker, a librarian, said: “If you come to the main library at 9 P.M., it looks like Grand Central Station.” This was echoed in reports from most schools surveyed. Though academic performance is difficult to measure, school officials generally said they thought it was improving. The rapidly increasing costs of education also have added to the mood of student seriousness, with many working to pay part of their expenses. At Princeton, where next year's minimum costs will be $5,400, nearly, half of the 4,000 undergraduates hold part‐time jobs. Students are, nonetheless, relaxing. At Columbia this year, there have been beer‐drinking contests, tugs‐of‐war, an iceskating party and a performance by a stripper hired by 150 freshmen.

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/23/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"MONDAY, APRIL 23, 1973 The Major Events of the Day International The Soviet Union has made major changes in its military high command in the last 18 months, motivated by a need for rejuvenation, according to a study by American military and civilian analysts. Generals and colonels with technological experience have moved into areas previously dominated by rough and ready veterans of World War II. One deduction drawn by two American civilian analysts is that a shift toward an offensive strategy may be expected as a result of the new changes. [Page 1, Column 7.] While Soviet political leaders appear to be striving for a relaxation of tension with the West, Moscow's military establishment continues to portray capitalist countries as motivated by aggressive designs. A restatement of Soviet military doctrine last week in the armed forces newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, also stressed the defense aspects of a strong economy at a time when Moscow is looking to the West for advanced industrial technology. [5:3–6.] President Lon Nol of Cambodia and his chief political opponents reached a compromise formula for a new all‐party council to oversee the running of national affairs. The formula allows for the suspension of the two‐chamber National Assembly for three to six months. President Lon Nol also agreed to write into the Constitution the council's authority as a decision‐making body. Presently the ruling Socio‐Republican party holds all seats in the assembly. [14:3–6.] National G. Gordon Liddy, the leader of the Watergate break‐in, has turned down a White House request that he change his mind and begin telling all he knows about the Democratic bugging to a Federal grand jury, sources close to the case said. Some Government officials believe that Liddy, by refusing to talk, is protecting former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, his superior on the Presidential re‐election committee. [1:8.] In the new outburst of Watergate recriminations, experts on the White House now see, a clear pattern of factional strife that could wipe out the executive branch's top command. “The Haldeman‐Ehrlichman side of the White House is in open warfare with the Mitchell‐Dean side,” a senior adviser to President Nixon sale. [1:6–7.] In one of the strongest public statements by a member of the President's own political party, Senator Edward W, Brooke of Massachusetts said that Mr. Nixon could riot esscape responsibility for the Watergate affair “under any circumstances” without an explanation of why he did not know what was going on [25:1.] Metropolitan Governor Rockefeller proposed that the judges of the Court of Appeals and the justices of an expanded Supreme Court be appointed by the Governor, subject to State Senate confirmation, rather than elected. It was one of a number of recommendations, detailed in two bills and a suggested constitutional amendment, that were submitted by the Governor to restructure the state court system. [1:6–7.] Matthew J. Troy Jr., the Democratic leader of Queens, said he had taken a vacation as Representative Mario Biaggi's mayoral campaign manager until Mr. Biaggi resolved reports that he had lied when he denied that he had invoked the Fifth Amendment before a Federal grand jury. [1:1–2.] The body of 7‐year‐old Joan D'Alesandro, missing from her home in Hillsdale, N. J., since Thursday, from which she had gone to deliver Girl Scout cookies, was found in a wooded area along Route 210 in Harriman State Park in Rockland County, N. Y. Her nude body reportedly showed signs of beating and strangulation. Joseph McGowan, a 26‐year‐old neighbor of the D'Alesandro family, was charged with the murder. [1:3.] Political activism is moribund at colleges and universities in New York,, New Jersey and Connecticut, and students have taken on the superficial appearance of their selfcentered, socially indifferent, All‐American campus counterparts of the nineteen‐fifties. Though reasons vary considerably, most students now appear to be devoted to themselves — to achieving success, acquiring money and having a good time — all in the most cherished middle‐class Establishment style. [1:7–8.] Eugene V. Mori paid $10‐million last week to re‐establish his control of New Jersey's Garden State Race Track, and he will have to put up another $10‐million July 16, and the same amount Oct. 15 to buy out dissident stockholders. The financing is only one of Mr. Mori's current problems. [37:1–6.] The Other News International Americans in Lebanon march for Palestinians. Page 2 Captured Arab guerrilla discusses mission.

Let's Get All The Facts,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/25/archives/lets-get-all-the-facts-washington.html,"The forgotten factor in the Watergate case is that it was only the most dramatic part of a much wider political conspiracy. Everybody seems to be concentrating now on punishing. the people who planned, financed or approved the illegal espionage against the Democrats at the Watergate, but very little attention is being paid to the people who organized the disruption and sabotage of the Democrats in the Presidential campaign. But this is one of those complicated problems where the people who actually broke the law may have done less damage than the people who Merely evaded the law. Maybe the espionage by Liddy, Sloan, McCord and the other convicted conspirator—though it was a clear violation of the law—was not as disruptive of the American political process as the money corruption of Maurice Stans and the other Republican fund‐raisers; or the calls in the night, the dirty tricks and sabotage against Senators Muskie, McGciv ern and Humphrey. So if there is now to be a total disclosure of the corruption in the last Presidential campaign, it will not be good enough to deal with the problem of espionage at the Watergate. It will also have to go beyond the espionage, the burglary and bugging in Washington to the sabotage against the Democratic candidates, and the corruption in how money was raised, concealed and finally diverted to finance not only the espionage but the sabotage.. The fundamental menace to the integrity of the American political process is not these clumsy criminal wiretappers at the Watergate but the cunning characters around the President, some of them in the White House, who were not breaking the law but, what is worse, breaking the rules of decent political competition —paying youngsters to infiltrate opposition headquarters, corrupting them to pretend they were loyal Muskie, or McGovern “volunteers,” and getting them to pass back information which could be used against the Democrats they were pretending to support. As Spiro Agnew once said, democracy is a very fragile process. American Presidential campaigns are run by casual pick‐up teams of volunteers, many of them young, working for nothing. Their loyalty is assumed, so they are easy to infiltrate and corrupt. WASHINGTON This is the aspect of the last Presidential campaign that has been overlooked. The people who were involved in the Watergate espionage operations are in terrible trouble, but the people, who were involved in the dirty tricks, of political sabotage are in the clear, and the irony of it is that the legal sabotage is in many ways more serious than the illegal espionage. You don't have to break the law like these Watergate burglars to influence Presidential elections. You can merely organize a Department of Dirty Tricks on the side. You can call up voters in New Hampshire and ask them to vote for Ed Muskie because he wants to give blacks a home in the state, or favors busing, or abortion. It is dirty but legal. You can get your young guys to volunteer in opposition headquarters, and pass on the opposition candidate's schedule and the advance text of his speech, and arrange for people to heckle him, and tell off the television people in advance, so that the confrontation makes good pictures for the network news shows. The possibilities of this kind of political corruption are endless. Letters were sent out in the Florida primary last year under Ed Muskie's name proposing policies which were highly unpopular to Florida voters. Anonymous printed “flyers” were distributed suggesting all kinds of immoral relationships by the Democratic candidates, and this has apparently been accepted by most people as the normal corruption of American politics. “Everybody does it!” So now there is a brutal and conspicuous corruption in American politics: a moral apathy and spiritual bewilderment in the land, and the chances are that it won't be removed by indicting the Watergate culprits or cleaning out the White House staff. Henry Kissinger said in New York the other day that after all the tragedies of the Watergate are over, after justice is done, “then we will have to ask ourselves ... whether we should not keep in mind that the United States will be there longer than any particular crisis ...” It is a good point. He said that he had no doubt that President Nixon would “insist on the full disclosure of the facts. ... Then,” he added, “we have to ask ourselves whether we can afford an orgy of recrimination. ... Without prejudging anyone's guilt,” he concluded, “one should ask for compassion for these' people. ...” Well, nobody wants an “orgy of recrimination” or would deny the need for compassion, but the Watergate characters are really not the main thing.” The people who raised the money and concealed its source, and the people who organized the sabotage of the American political process are probably more to blame than the burglars at the Watergate. But somehow they are getting away with it, which is the final irony of the whole tragedy. The Watergate and the courts are not the end of all this, but only the beginning."
Gloria Steinem Says Press Is Failing Woman Reader,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/26/archives/gloria-steinem-says-press-is-failing-woman-reader.html,"Gloria Steinem told the American Newspaper Publishers Association here yesterday that the press was failing to report what women really wanted to read and that young women in particular were turning away from the Establishment press and looking for “alternative sources of information.” The credibility of the press also came up for discussion throughout the day as the 1,400 newspaper executives, who are at the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel for their four‐day 87th annual meeting; divided into groups and seminars. They discussed subjects ranging from attitudes of readers toward newspapers to attitudes of newspaper executives and reporters on ethical standards, or, in the title of one discussion, “How Are You Fixed for Freebies?” Miss Steinem, the feminist and editor of 4 Ms. magazine, drew an audience of 500 members of the publisher”s association and their wives. It was the first time that wives had attended any of the sessions, and they appeared in large numbers. Rapidly ticking off topics and spewing forth examples, Miss Steinem said that in most newspapers, too little space—or no space at all—had been devoted to the status of the equal rights amendment (whereas, she said, an inordinate amount of space was devoted to high school basketball scores). She called for stories about differences between male and female incomes. (A white woman with a college degree earns the same as a white man with a high‐school degree and a black woman with a college degree earns the same as a white man with an eighthgrade education, according to her statistics.) She also touched upon unemployment' among women in recent years, alimony, abortion, welfare and child‐care. She deplored the picture of the women's liberation movement that she said was generally drawn by the press. She cited a number of personal examples where she had given a serious speech and the press had only picked up her answers to reporters' questions on such topics as bra burning or Mrs. Aristotle Onassis. “If I believed what I read about the movement in the press,” she said,. “I'd have nothing to do with a. Also, if I believed what I read in most of the press about myself, I'd have nothing to do with me. “The problem of being taken seriously is really the one that affects us most. We don't want sympathy, just accuracy.” In a session earlier in the day, George N. Gill, managing editor of The Louisville Courier‐Journal, discussed the results of a survey of ethical standards and practices that had been sent to 910 managing editors (and filled out by 210 of them) throughout the country. The findings showed that two out of three managing editors said: that they would accept free trips, that one out of two accept expense‐paid trips overseas, and that three out of four said they would not rule out all gifts. They set the acceptable value of giftts at $2.50 to $25. Ten per cent of the editors responded, that they accepted advertisements on condition that a reporter will write a feature piece on the group placing the ad, and 10 per cent acknowledged that advertisers were treated differently from nonadvertisers. Almost half of the editors reported that their sports departments could and did accept complimentary tickets for reporters on the ground that the sports activity needed exposure. Mr. Gill said that the problem of free tickets was often a difficult one for small newspapers, which say they cannot afford to buy tickets to all the events they would like to cover."
Dr. English Resigns,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/dr-english-resigns.html,"The long‐standing discord in the board of directors A the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation has been coded, at least temporarily, by the decision of Dr. Joseph T. English to resign as president when a suitable sucssor is found. Since that successor will have to be acceptable to the text mayor, who will not be elected until November, Dr. English will remain in office for some months. His dividend from submitting his resignation at this stage was the vote of the faction‐ridden board to “cooperate fully” with Dr. English until his departure. It is easy to point out defects in the record of the municipal hospitals, and the critics have done that abundantly, often quite accurately. But the seriously underfinanced and largely obsolete collection of institutions which the corporation took over under Dr. English's direction has been in unsatisfactory shape for decades. The real issue is not whether the city hospitals are a medical Utopia now—they obviously are far from ideal —but whether the corporation has made significant progress during its stormy infancy. On balance, we think the verdict must be affirmative, though Dr. English has made mistakes and would no doubt do some things differently if he could rerun history. He has managed to keep the hospitals and their outpatient facilities functioning in the face of severe budgetary limitations and of recurrent harassment from jealous union chieftains, militants who saw the hospitals as recruiting grounds for revolutionaries, politicians seeking to knife Mayor Lindsay by attacking the hospitals, and other divergent groups. The corporation's outstanding successes have been in vastly improving the city collections of funds from Medicare, Medicaid and Blue Cross and organizing the massive abortion program that has served so many thousands of the city's women. Much more needs doing in many areas, but the simple fact is that Dr. English's successor will inherit a better situation than the one the incumbent found when he arrived on the scene three years ago."
Welfare Study. Minimizes Impact of Migrant Blacks,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/welfare-study-minimizes-impact-of-migrant-blacks-notion-is.html,"NEW ORLEANS, April 28—Southern blacks who have moved by the hundreds of thousands to the crowded inner cities of the North, mostly over the last two decades, are less likely to be poor or on welfare than their urban‐born counterparts, according to a new study of the 1970 Census findings. However, the study also found that blacks who had moved from the South since 1965 were more likely to be poor or on welfare than either the earlier migrants or the urban‐born. In a report to the three‐day meeting of the Population Association of America, which ended here today, Larry H. Long, a Bureau of the Census demographer, said that the widely held view that black migrants from the South were principally responsible for the dramatic rise in Northern welfare rolls was not true. Conceding that black migration has added to the welfare population in the North, Mr. Long, who made the study, said that “black migrants have accounted for a less‐than‐proportionate increase in the welfare rolls” as against those born in the cities. Notion Is Challenged His findings, which are to be published soon by the Census Bureau, were based on responses to the 1970 questionnaires in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago,‐ Detroit, Los An geles and Washington. Those cities were chosen because they all have at least 500,000 black residents. Mr. Long also suggested that the results of the study made it appear unlikely that large numbers of blacks had been attracted to the North by the prospect of higher welfare payments, another notion that has been broadly accepted and even espoused by President Nixon. In a speech on welfare payments and other domestic matters in August, 1969, the President said, after citing discrepancies in welfare payments among the states, “One result of this inequality is to lure thousands more into already overcrowded inner cities as unprepared for city life as they are for city jobs.” Noting the traditional theory that “people in economically depressed areas tend, to move to areas where income‐earning possibilities are greater,” Mr. Long contended that it was “impossible to decide how many of the people moving to the high‐income, high‐welfare states were moving because of the high income and how many were moving because of the high welfare.” Working with data from responses to census questions on state of birth and county or city of residence in 1965, and on total money income in 1969 from various sources, including public assistance, Mr. Long concluded that black Southern migrants were “more economically successful” than blacks born in the Northern cities. He also discovered that black women who were heads of households that had migrated from the South were less likely to be on welfare or to have incomes under the poverty level than those born in the states in which the cities were situated. “That blacks having recently arrived from the South have higher rates of poverty and welfare dependence than earlier migrants may suggest either of two interpretations,” he said. “On the one hand, this finding may suggest that after an initial period of adjustment the recent migrants from the South will be more successful in finding and holding jobs than blacks born in the cities where they were living in 1970. “On the other hand, it is possible that the recent black immigrants from the South represent a change of migration patterns. Perhaps they will continue to have rates of poverty and welfare dependence as high as the urban born. That is, the recent Southern migrants may not come to resemble the earlier migrants.” As for whites, who were also included in the study, Mr. Long found “no consistent differences” between all migrants and natives as far as percentages on welfare was concerned, but the migrants were less likely to be below the poverty line. However, he discovered that Southern white migrants were more likely to be poor or on welfare than whites born in the cities. “When one compares black urban natives with blacks born in other states,” he said, “the conclusion is that Southern birth is not a handicap. But when one compares white urban natives with whites born in other states, Southern birth is a definite handicap insofar as poverty and welfare dependence are concerned.” In his findings on blacks, which are broken down city by city, Mr. Long conceded that the differences between migrants and natives were “not great, but they are consistent, and it is clear that out‐of‐stateborn blacks are less likely to become a burden on city welfare systems than the in‐state born.” For instance, he found that 23.7 per cent of the blacks born in New York were on welfare, while only 22 per cent of the migrants were. Of those born in the South, 22.7 per cent were receiving public assistance. In Philadelphia, 21.4 per cent of those born in Pennsylvania were on welfare, while 17.9 per cent of those born elsewhere, including 18 per cent of those born in the South, were. Similar figures applied in the other cities studied. In New York, 23.3 per cent of the native‐born blacks were below the poverty level in income, while 19.9 per cent of those born out of state, including 20.4 per cent of those born in the South, were. Again the differences were consistent among the other cities. The total percentage of whites barn in New York who were on welfare was 3.7 per cent, exactly the same as those born out of state. However, 5.9 per cent of the whites in New York who were born in the South were receiving public assistance. Among whites born in New York, 5.3 per cent were below the poverty level, compared to 4.7 who had migrated. Of those moving there from the South, however, 6.6 per cent were poor. Mr. Long, who was primarily concerned with discovering the economic fate of black mi grants to the cities, concluded that “migration was not as much a source of urban problems as is sometimes thought.” In three days of meetings here, several hundred members of the population association, which is made up of demographers, sociologists, economists and other professionals in the field, have considered such problems as national population policy, fertility trend, abortion, sex education, family planning and potential changes in the labor force. In a time when an increasingly ecologically minded nation appears to be just beginning to think seriously about some of the questions that have concerned them for years, many of the population experts seem themselves to be groping for ways to use what could be a new‐found influence on the public. One speaker likened his quandary to Alice in Wonderland's asking the cat which way to go. “‘That depends on where you want to get to,’ said the cat,” he went on. “‘I'm not sure exactly where I want to get to,’ said Alice, ‘but whereever it is, it seems a good way off from here.’”"
THE REVOLUTION THAT FAILED,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/the-revolution-that-failed-madras-on-the-cover.html,"We are in an era of revolution, an era in which long‐established mores have been examined and booted aside. Most of those revolts against the status quo have enjoyed some measure of success, but the men's fashion revolution died with a whimper despite the bang with which it was heralded. Of course, there were, as always, some fellows whose conception of fashion is to be first with the latest and to whom the matter of taste is purely gustatory. They did go for the garish goodies that were offered as dernier cri, However, that group, while highly visible, is relatively small in number. Most American men eyed the flamboyant clothes offered in the name of fashion during the past few years and decided to pass them up. Eight years ago most of the pundits of men's fashion were taken in by a strange phenomenon that burgeoned in London. was called Mod. Mod was actually an array of outlandish styles many of which had suspiciously effeminate overtones. Those were worn by English working‐class youths no longer seeking the approval of the upper classes. They put aside efforts to emulate the Savile Row look and expressed their new affluence via garments regarded by the Establishment as outrageously garish. Word of Mod reached these shores with the return of buyers and fashion scouts and it stirred the souls of those manufacturers and retailers who found the then‐current naturalshoulder or traditional trend less than stimulating. The Beatles, during their American debut, gave Mod styles a big boost with the kids and many in the men's fashion field thought that those styles would be accepted by more mature men, too. It was a bad thought. The many Mod shops and shopswithin‐shops that sprung up were soon slashing prices to get rid of the wild merchandise and at least one well known sportswea maker almost went broke because of its Carnaby Street espousal. Mod, however, did break down some old taboos of color and pattern. Close on the heels of the Mod debacle, the men's wear industry was “discovered” by host of Name Designers whose forte until then had been women's wear. Perhaps “discovered” isn't the exact word, since some of them had for years either designed or loaned their names on a royalty basis to the more esoteric efforts of the men's tie industry. However, the new big push was then aimed at suits and shirts and, for a time, there was a mad scramble by clothing and shirt manufacturers to capture a good Name to add to their established brands. The creations of the couture designers were, for the most part, the antithesis of the easygoing natural shoulder suits and presented a definitely European mien expressed by square tailored shoulders, high armholes and a closefitting body. The advent of those models, along with the introduction of deep toned, vibrantly colored shirts and wide, elaborately patterned ties, was hailed as the men's fashion revolution. Some called it the Peacock Revolution. It was expected that a lot of American men would be happy to pay a premium to wear the labels of the Name Designers in the same way that women prized their haute couture gowns. It didn't quite work that way. In the first place, those models were geared to the young, slim man and there weren't many young, slim men who could afford the premium‐priced suits. Furthermore, it was overlooked that the moderate success of the Name ties was due to the fact that many were bought as gifts by women who were more impressed by the names than were the male giftees. Also, many of the foreign‐made Name suits couldn't compare in quality or workmanship with less expensive American made garments. The colorful shirts, on the other hand, had great popular acceptance: Soon the wave of Name Designer suits, now lowered in price, was followed by the introduction to these shores of the Nehru suits and sport jackets. You remember those fashion abortions of a few years back: they had highstanding collars and severely straight fronts and had to be worn over a turtleneck pullover. And, of course, to be really in, the cutfit had to be completed with a large pendant dangling from a chain necklace. The Nehru was more of a costume than a style and it was history‐making bust. Undismayed, the fashion revolutionists quickly followed the Nehru with the Edwardian Look, a multi‐buttoned, high closured model featuring a broad collar with lapels to match. The best that can be said for the Edwardian Look is that it was not as big a failure as the Nehru. The fomenters of the fashion revolution then shifted their “sights to lapels and flared pants. It seemingly became contest to see who could cut the widest lapels and the trousers with the most pronounced flares. After reaching the ultimate in those endeavors, the high stylists took aim at the backs as well as the pockets of suits and sport coats. Fancy backs and tricky pocket treatments were the name of the fashion game for a couple of seasons and then began to peter out. They did teach men that the obviously new soon becomes obviously old. A bad idea for those who had to get some mileage out of their clothes. Meanwhile, doubleknits in polyester yarns and in varioius blends were introduced and in the space of a season the fashion scene went knit nutty. All the while that those fashion revolutions were taking place, it was dourly noted in the industry that the production and sales of suits were steadily declining. Sportswear was booming, but something seemed to be deterring the purchase of suits. Then, as they used to say in the old silent movie titles, “Came the Dawn!” The industry remembered one of its oldest and truest adages: “Men's fashions change by evolution —not by revolution.” Men did not want fly‐by‐night fashions. As a result, the current men's fashion theme is the return to an accepted norm and suits are enjoying a new boom. That, of course, doesn't mean a return to the stodgy charcoal gray suit. As a matter of fact, next fall's fabrics (among which will be many wovens) will be livelier than ever. But they will be in colorful versions of classic patterns rather than those dizzying knitted effects of recent vintage. It's undeniably apparent that the men's fashion revolution has fizzled out. But it did serve, in a degree, to break down some of the old color and pattern barriers. And in comparison to its awfulness, it made some good, new bright and bold styles seeem relatively conservative. MADRAS: ON THE COVER Madras: the old is new again. 1.

Hospital Clinic Specializes in the Problems of Adolescents,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/hospital-clinic-specializes-in-the-problems-of-adolescents-problems.html,"NEW HYDE PARK, L. I.—Many youths whose problems fall awkwardly between the concerns of the pediatrician and adult's specialists are bringing their most agonizing afflictions—from acne to venereal disease—to the adolescent clinic here. Since 1964, they have flocked here for free treatment at the suggestion of friends and relatives, schools and social agencies and sometimes their own physicians. The clinic at Long Island Jewish‐Hillside Medical Center aims at encompassing all the physical, emotional and psychological problems intertwined in the adolescent's illness. Often the clinic finds that the complaint that brought the patient in is not the major need for treatment. “It's not unusual to find that the initial complaint has very little to do with the real problems,” said Dr. I. Ronald Shenker, physicianin‐charge of adolescent medicine. The clinic takes a complete medical history of each patient, including drug use and sexual activity. After a recent patient, being treated for a serious thyroid condition, turned out to be pregnant, the clinic added a pregnancy test to its normal battery of diagnostic tests. Contraceptives may be individually prescribed. Abortions are provided for pregnant patients. The clinic staff urges the patients to include their parents in the decision. The clinic treats about 700 new patients a year, and schedules about 3,200 clinic visits a year. Among the major complaints are asthma and allergies, diabetes, learning disabilities, short stature and obesity. Problems Change Dr. Shenker, who started the clinic in 1964 on a $65,000 grant from the Children's Bureau of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, has seen the kind of problems change over the years and the emotional problems intensify. The grant, at present $100,000, renewable annually, is now provided by the Health Services and Mental Health Administration of the Health, Education and Welfare Department and is administered through a contract with the State Health Department. Additional funds are provided by the hospital. “We are being bombarded by school people to help them out with students who need educational adjustment,” Dr. Shenker said. “We are also finding more drug abusers, although we don't treat them on an ongoing basis but refer them to other drug programs. We are screening about 12 cases of venereal disease a month, and getting about 10 to 15 requests for pregnancy tests a month.” Mrs. Bea Eidinoff, social worker for the clinic, said the desperation seen in the need “to feel good” seemed to be a response to an in creasing incidence of chronic depression. “They can't communicate with their parents,” she said. “They have all the pressures and expectations to achieve. They're confused about their role and their value system. The Vietnam war has enlightened them about society —they see the society as kind of crazy and immoral. “And there's so much play on sex and sexuality. They are expected to perform in ways they are not ready for. There are no new frontiers. Jobs are difficult to find. There are many more adolescents to compete with and more years of adolescence.” Mature Earlier Dr. Shenker said youngsters mature earlier than they did in earlier generations, in part because of their being in better health. Despite this, he said, they must endure a prolonged period of adolescence because society keeps them from performing adult roles and provides limited employment, despite the degrees they earn in college. The clinic's work of treating all medical and emotional problems of the patients is conducted jointly by Dr. Shenker, Rita Faath, coordinator for the clinic, and Mrs. Eidinoff, a psychologist and a nutritionist. Other specialists on the hospital staff are available for consultation. The clinic team meets weekly for case presentations and educational sessions. One of the goals of the clinic is to teach adolescents with chronic illnesses like diabetes to take over the management of their ailments from the adults around them. The clinic team has discovered that it's not always the adolescent who needs the help. In one recent case, a Nassau mother brought a young son for treatment of a severe case of acne, Staff members discovered that the parents were overwrought because the boy had once committed a minor theft. The parents were sending him to a religious school, which he disliked. Mrs. Eidinoff recalled, “Dr. Shenker told me, ‘Bea, go see these people. Get these parents off his back.’” The parents were counseled in individual sessions. The boy was transferred to a public school from the school he disliked. The acne condition was brought under control. Staff members of the adolescent clinic become gloomy when asked about one other major area of their work—treatment of obesity. Dr. Shenker said obesity ac counts for about 15 to 20 per cent of their patient intake. “We're getting heavier and heavier kids,” he said. “We're getting kids that have been on many diets. We're getting grotesquely obese kids with grotesquely obese parents. There are no success stories in obesity.” Fat Cells the Factor Obese adelescents are treated on an outpatient basis with dietary controls, after any medical problems have been ruled out. Dr. Shenker said early feeding in infancy determines the number of fat cells and patients thereafter can only deplete the amount of fat in their fat cells to lose weight. “This is a life‐long problem for them,” he said. “We're not talking about immediate weight loss. Every diet works for the short term. You have to re‐educate the dietary habits. You have to aim for a goal six months to a year away. “I'm relatively pessimistic; I don't see anybody getting help with hypnosis, posthypnotic suggestion, longterm psychotherapy. We gave up on medication several years ago. Like every other mode, it works for the short term. With parents who have a pathologic concern with their kids, the weight loss is significantly less.”"

End of Era in Nixon Presidency,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/01/archives/end-of-era-in-nikon-presidency-a-white-house-era-ends.html,"WASHINGTON, April 30—The resignations of H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman from President Nixon's senior staff clearly mark the end of one era of the Nixon Presidency and the beginning of another. Things simply will not be the same. The question is how much different they will be. News Analysis The few men who remain in the President's suddenly shrunken entourage do not believe that the scandals of the moment will have much impact on Mr. Nixon's own personality. His habits are well entrenched, and any future White House operation will reflect the style of its master. But there are some here now, in the White House and on Capitol Hill, who hope that Mr. Nixon will seize what they sense to be a rare opening to redesign his relationships with Congress, the bureaucracy, and even the press. They hope to increase his access to others and theirs to him, to replace the closed corporation that the White House had become with the “open Presidency” to which he once aspired, and to return to his own first principles by decentralizing some of the power that has steadily flowed from the Government agencies to a few decision‐makers in the White House. Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlichman helped design that system, ran the system and, in time, came to symbolize the system. Their Teutonic names and mutual zeal for efficient execution gave rise to many jokes. Their enemies called them Hans and Fritz; their friends simply teased them. In Mr. Ehrlichman's office on the second floor of the White House is a copy of Daniel P. Mcynihan's “Understanding Poverty,” which carries this inscription: “For John Ehrlichman. Achtung! D.P.M.” But their power was no joke. They were men with long ties and easy access to the President, men of loyalty, men who transmitted Mr. Nixon's orders to the bureaucracy and to whom, with few exceptions, Mr. Nixon's Cabinet members were forced to report before winning humble access to the Oval Office. In all areas other than foreign policy, where Henry A. Kissinger retains primary influence, they dominated the White House, and in giving them their release Mr. Nixon has released part of his own political history. What remains is only a shadow of the old superstructure. The members of Mr. Ehrlichman's staff at the Domestic Council, which he directed in his role as the President's chief domestic adviser, departed earlier this year for other jobs in the Federal Government. Perhaps ironically, it was one of Mr. Ehrlichman's intentions in thus dispersing his staff to create an informal network of “old boys” who could help him bend an often cantankerous bureauracy more nearly to Mr. Nixon's will. Many of Mr. Haldeman's staffers left the White House last year to assume key posts at the re‐election campaign committee, where some of them, including kb S. Magruder, found themselvis floundering in the Watergate mess. Other important members of the staff resigned; still others took posts overseas. Few Are Survivors The list of important survivors is not long. There is Ronald L. Ziegler, the press secretary. There is Leonard Garment, the new counsel. There is Peter M. Flanigan, who advises on foreign economic policy. There is Mr. Kissinger. Most of the rest occupy relatively trivial jobs. Mr. Haldeman built the Nixon staff and, when he fell, it seemed to fall with him. Conversely, those who were denied access to Mr. Nixon's inner circle or to whom Mr. Haldeman assigned less important tasks have so far escaped the widening net of Watergate. On the whole, Mr. Haldeman preferred men in his own image—tidy in habit and conservative in mind. He began his relationship with Mr. Nixon as as advance man, directed his 1962 campaign for Governor of California, and accompanied him as chief adviser on the road in 1968. He looked upon himself not as an “issues” man but as a technician and organizer, and the young men he hired and promoted met the same qualifications. Shunted to Lesser Posts Those who did not, or who were too friendly with the press, or possessed some other deficiency, soon found themselves in lesser posts or no posts at all. Robert F. Ellsworth, now an international banker in New York, was eased out of the White House in 1969 into an ambassadorial post to make way for. Mr. Flanigan, a Haldeman intimate. Those with a reputation for being preoccupied with “issues” either left the campaign before the election of 1968 or were shunted to speech‐writing jobs afterwards. The net result was a visible shrinkage in the variety of views and voices available to the President. The Nixon White House had its share of fierce debates, but they were, on the whole, internalized—Mr. Nixon did not enjoy public discussion of the options available to him. And after 1970, when the conservative Dr. Arthur F. Burns had left‐ the White House to head the Federal Reserve Board, and the liberal Mr. Moynihan returned to Harvard, policy discussions seemed to grow more tactical and less substantive. The staff system reinforced the homogenizing process. At its apex stood Mr. Haldeman; below him were a variety of councils, subcommittees and study groups. Ultimately, everything produced at lower levels passed through Mr. Haldeman's hands. So, too, did requests for a personal audience with the President. It was a Haldeman functionary, for example, who informed Walter J. Hickel, then the Interior Secretary, that he could not see Mr. Nixon. It was, a Haldeman functionary who, time and again, gave the same answer to George Romney, then Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Ehrlichman was a crucial link in this system, for it was he who screened all domestic proposals before delivering them to Mr. Haldeman. The Moynihan‐Burns debate of 1969 over welfare policy had offended both Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlichman as well as the President, and when Roy L. Ash of Litton Industries, Inc., was called to Washington to redesign the Executive Office and bring a sense of order to the policy‐making process, Mr. Haldeman, who recruited Mr. Ash, made certain that there was prominent place in the final design for his old college classmate, Mr. Ehrlichman. Have Much in Common Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlichman have much in common. Both are Christian Scientists and strong family men. Both work hard. Both shared the same goal—the preservation of Mr. Nixon's political future. And both possess a low opinion of the press, the bureaucracy and Congress. But there were differences that should not be lost sight of in their simultaneous fall from grace. Mr. Haldeman always insisted that he did not try to shape the President's thinking on substantive issues. Mr. Ehrlichman did try, and, while his views were generally conservative, he also fought against those who urged the President to stop school busing by a constitutional amendment and, vainly, against others who wanted the President to take a strong stand against liberalized abortion laws. And, until the final days, Mr. Ehrlichman always reserved some time on his calendar for reporters who wished to talk about domestic issues. Mr. Haldeman was largely inaccessible from the outset. That was the way he conceived his role, and his conceptions never changed. Objects of Blame Yet, together, despite their differences, they came to symbolize the insularity of the White House staff and to be blamed for the isolation of the President himself. In time, when both men feel confident enough to reminisce about their roles, they may well arm that the way they operated and the structure they created reflected no more than Mr. Nixon's own twin passions for order and solitude—that they were Mr. Nixon's creatures, rather than the other way around. If that is so, then any major alterations in the ways the White House does business with the outside world will depend less on the new people Mr. Nixon puts in their places than on Mr. Nixon himself. George Reedy, President Johnson's press secretary, has written about the “monarchial” tendency of modern Presidents and their staffs—however noble their motives, however persuasive their explanations—to set themselves apart from the other institutions of democracy and, surrounded by the huge burdens and seductive trappings of power, to shield themselves from othersֹ’ voices. This is a condition that fresh faces alone will not solve."

Many of Mr. Haldeman's staffers left the White House last year to assume key posts at the re‐election campaign committee, where some of them, including kb S. Magruder, found themselvis floundering in the Watergate mess. Other important members of the staff resigned; still others took posts overseas. Few Are Survivors The list of important survivors is not long. There is Ronald L. Ziegler, the press secretary. There is Leonard Garment, the new counsel. There is Peter M, Flanigan, who advises on foreign economic policy. There is Mr. Kissinger. Most of the rest occupy relatively trivial jobs. Mr. Haldeman built the Nixon staff and, when he fell, it seemed to fall with him. Conversely, those who were denied access to Mr. Nixon's inner circle or to whom Mr. Haldeman assigned less important tasks have so far escaped the widening net of Watergate. On the whole, Mr. Haldeman preferred men in his own image—tidy in habit and conservative in mind. ‘He began his relationship with Mr. Nixon as as advance man, directed his 1962 campaign for Governor of California, and accompanied him as chief adviser on the road in 1968. He looked upon himself not as an “issues” man but as a technician and organizer, and the young men he hired and promoted met the same qualifications. Shunted to Lesser Posts Those who did not, or who were too friendly with the press, or possessed some other deficiency, soon found themselves in lesser posts or no posts at all. Robert F. Ellsworth, now an international banker in New York, was eased out of the White House in 1969 into an ambassadorial post to make way for. Mr. Flanigan, a Haldeman intimate. Those with a reputation for being preoccupied with “issues” either left the campaign before the election of 1968 or were shunted to speech‐writing jobs afterwards. The net result was a visible shrinkage in the variety of views and voices available to the President. The Nixon White House had its share of fierce debates, but they were, on the whole, internalized—Mr. Nixon did not enjoy public discussion of the options available to him. And after 1970, when the conservative Dr. Arthur F. Burns had left‐ the White House to head the Federal Reserve Board, and the liberal Mr. Moynihan returned to Harvard, policy discussions seemed to grow more tactical and less substantive. The staff system reinforced the homogenizing process. At its apex stood Mr. Haldeman; below him were a variety of councils, subcommittees and study groups. Ultimately, everything produced at lower levels passed through Mr. Haldeman's hands. So, too, did requests for a personal audience with the President. It was a Haldeman functionary, for example, who informed Walter J. Hickel, then the Interior Secretary, that he could not see Mr. Nixon. It was a Haldeman functionary who, time and again, gave the same answer to George Romney, then Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Ehrlichman was a crucial link in this system, for it was he who screened all domestic proposals before delivering them to Mr. Haldeman. The Moynihan‐Burns debate of 1969 over welfare policy had offended both Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlichman as well as the President, and when Roy L. Ash of Litton Industries, Inc., was called to Washington to redesign the Executive Office and bring a sense of order to the policy‐making process, Mr. Haldeman, who recruited Mr. Ash, made certain that there was prominent place in the final design for his old college classmate, Mr. Ehrlichman. Have Much in Common Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlichman have much in common. Both are Christian Scientists and strong family men. Both work hard. Both shared the same goal—the preservation of Mr. Nixon's political future. And both possess a low opinion of the press, the bureaucracy and Congress. But there were differences that should not be lost sight of in’ their simultaneous fall from grace. Mr. Haldeman always insisted that he did not try to shape the President's thinking on substantive issues. Mr. Ehrlichman did try, and, while his views were generally conservative, he also fought against those who urged the President to stop school busing by a constitutional amendment and, vainly, against others who wanted the President to take a strong stand against liberalized abortion laws. And, until the final days, Mr. Ehrlichman always reserved some time on his calendar for reporters who wished to talk about domestic issues. Mr. Haldeman was largely inaccessible from the outset. That was the way he conceived his role, and his conceptions never changed. Objects of Blame Yet, together, despite their differences, they came to symbolize the insularity of the White House staff and to be blamed for the isolation of the President himself. In time, when both men feel confident enough to reminisce about their roles, they may well’ argoe that the way they operated and the structure they created reflected no more than Mr. Nixon's own twin passions for order and solitude—that they were Mr. Nixon's creatures, rather than the other way around. If that is so, then any major alterations in the ways the White House does business with the outside world will depend less on the new people Mr. Nixon puts in their places than on Mr. Nixon himself. George Reedy, President Johnson's press secretary, has written about the “monarchial” tendency of modern Presidents and their staffs—however noble their motives, however persuasive their explanations—to set themselves apart bull the other institutions of democracy and, surrounded by the huge burdens and seductive trappings of power, to shield themselves from others’ voices. This is a condition that fresh faces alone will not solve."
MAY DAY IN PARIS HITS A NEW NOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/02/archives/may-day-in-paris-hits-a-new-note-parade-highlights-the-plight-of.html,"PARIS, May 1 — Tens of thousands of workers sloshed through central Paris today under a drenching rain in a May Day parade that was different from those that have gone on here since 1890. For the first time the ranks of French unionists were swelled by foreign laborers—chanting defiance in Spanish, Portuguese and heavily accented North African French—whose plight as a new subproletariat has begun to catch the nation's conscience and engage its unions support. Three and a half million immigrants are working in France —one out of five laborers—and virtually all have been trapped, neglected, on the bottom rung of the Skills and salary ladder, doing jobs that Frenchmen scorn. Despite the intimidating weather, the throng surged with immense good humor, singing and shouting slogans such as “Frenchmen! Immigrants! One Struggle!” through the streets from City Hall to the Place de la Nation. “The Internationale” was a frequent theme and red flags were brandished. Bundled in parkas, raincoats, boots, berets and caps, hoisting dripping banners andymbrellas, the marchers passed spectators who applauded them from curbsides or hung from windows to shout encouragement. Few Policemen in View Police trucks choked the bridges over the Seine, but almost no policemen were seen along the line of march. Leaflets were passed out to those who marched and those who watched. The subjects included the demands of foreign workers, the plight of Spanish and South African political martyrs, abortion, auto strikes and the expected French nuclear tests in the Pacific. But there was nothing political about the sprigs of lily of the valley—today as always on May Day—that were peddled on street corners as tokens of good luck. Although the two‐hour walk was generally peaceful, there were some violent scuffles as young leftists, wielding bottles and banner poles, tried to break into the ranks. They were blocked by union stewards. Those at the head of the procession included Georges Marchais, secretary general of the 450,000‐member French Communist party, as well as Georges seguy and Edmond Maim, who head the two biggest union, federations, totaling 2.8 million members. The unionists viewed the presence of so many foreign workers as a success for them and for the immigrants. During the recent national campaign for the parliamentary election the common platform of the Socialist and Communist parties included a pledge to better their status and attempt to give them the vote. May pay Strike in Britain LONDON, May 1—Most of Britain's 10 million trade unionists today ignored a strike called to protest the Government's curbs on prices and wages. However, the strike — part of a one‐day demonstration organized by the Trades Union Congress—paralyzed key sectors of industry and left Britons without national newspapers and rail service. Engineering, steel and auto plants, coal mines and docks were among the industries most seriously affected. In London, with subway and bus service seriously curtailed, the streets were clogged with traffic. Some special parking arrangements had been made and most office workers seemed to have arrived on time. Shops were open. There was a big workers’ parade led by a band. This added to the congestion, but it was all orderly in the spring sunshine. The marchers seemed to have but one cry: “Heath out!” but there was an air of unreality because the T.U.C. and the Government of Prime Minister Heath are about to begin negotiations on pay and prices."
"BILL ON V,D. TESTS PASSES IN ALBANY",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/04/archives/bill-on-yd-testspasses-in-albany-it-requires-some-clinics-to.html,"ALBANY, N. Y. May 3—The State Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill requiring physicians and administrators of clinics who provide obstetrical, gynecological, contraceptive and abortion services to suggest venera disease tests to patients who are residents of the state. The bill is intended to help in the discovery and treatment of carriers of the disease and to bring syphilis and gonorrhea under control. Senator Roy M. Goodman Republican of Manhattan and the Senate sponsor of the measure, said that venereal disease in the state had reached epidemic proportions and that sexually active women between the ages of 15 and 40 represent the group most liable to carry and transmit gonorrhea, generally without the knowledge that they are so doing.” “The largest reservoir of undetected gonorrhea is in sexually active women, in whore the disease is generally asymptomatic,” Senator Goodman said. ‘Epidemic’ Noted In a memorandum accompanying the legislation Senator Goodman noted that Federal authorities had estimated that there were 500,000 cases of undetected syphilis in the United States and that the bill would “help bring under control an unprecedented epidemic of veneral disease.” Senator Sidney von Luther Democrat of Manhattan, noted that while he favored the purpose of the bill, the tests for veneral disease were complicated and often were not conclusive. The Senate also gave final legislative approval to a bill permitting the destruction of illegal drugs seized by the police after chemical tests were made to determine their quality and quantity. The measure is designed to avert situations such as have occurred in New York City where 398 pounds of drugs, with a street‐sale value of $73‐million, were stolen from the police property clerk. Under the terms of the bill, which now goes to the Governor, the tests would have to be performed within 30 days of the seizure of the drugs, and a hearing would have to be held to determine if their destruction would prejudice the defendant's case. Other action here included the following: HEART‐TEST INCIDENT Charles S. Desmond, former chief judge of the State, was appointed a special counsel to the Assembly Ethics Committee in its investigation of the behavior of certain Assemblymen during the administration of heart tests at the Albany Medical Center last Feb. 27. An Albany County grand jury said on April 18 that two Assemblymen acted in a “boisterous and obscene” manner while the free tests were being given by a 20‐year‐old woman tech"
French Assembly Chief Foresees More Heed for Public Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/04/archives/french-assembly-chief-foresees-more-heed-for-public-opinion-role.html,"PARIS, May 3—Edgar Faure, who has been a Premier and a Cabinet minister and who has now become President of the French Assembly, has come to the conclusion that modern democracy requires new methods to match the new public awareness of national problems. France has been going through a period of debate, somewhat similar to that in the United States, about the powers of the legislature and the executive. One crucial difference is that until Charles de Gaulle established the Fifth Republic in 1958, Parliament was supreme and the President was essentially a figurehead, filling a role like that of a constitutional monarch. Siace then, the President has been amassing ever greater power, and members of the National Assembly elected in March have expressed a determined will to recoup legislative influence. The election of Mr. Faure as the Assembly's President —roughly comparable to Speaker of the House of Representatives—was taken as sign that Assembly members want a more important role, in government and that President Pompidou does not oppose the idea. Role for Public opinion Mr. Faure, a 64‐year‐old lawyer who was twice Premier in the fifties, discussed the underlying implications in an interview. The major difference between a modern democracy and the way things worked when he entered politics 27 years ago, he said, is that now there has to be direct representation of public opinion.” “Before, he added, “the people only chose representatives. Now they know the problems. They have opinions that have to be taken into account—not only at election time.” The movement of power away from legislature to executive was inevitable, Mr. Faure said, in a period when the chief job of government was to promote economic growth. “Parliament cannot make the main decisions when the problems are about tariffs, the value of money, salaries, prices,” he explained. “Those things cannot be legislated. The decisions are made privately by businessmen or by the executive. “The parliamentary role is essentially juridical. In the 19th century it expanded importantly because the issues were juridical—about individual rights, social relations, divorce, the church and the schools. Then came the period of concentration on economic expansion and the shift in powers.” But, Mr. Faure maintained, structural problems return, comparable to the juridical problems of the 19th century. He added: “We have to deal with such things as the minimum wage, the environment, abortion. The role or Parliament becomes important again because operational answers are no longer sufficient.” Mr. Faure, who escaped from France at the time of the Nazi occupation to join General de Gaulle, recalled: “It was at no risk. I am a well‐organized man, I took the last boat to North Africa. But my organization did not work perfectly. I did not foresee that the Americans would occupy only part of North Africa, so I was stuck in Tunisia for six months until I could get to Algiers.” A classicist, he is well versed in the ancient democracy of the Greeks and its demise, and he feels that the crux of the democratic problem today is that even though societies are immensely larger and more complex, modern conditions enable citizens to judge knowingly once more about what their governments do. The public is much better informed than a generation ago, he said, noting that communications and the spread of education had produced more intelligent, well‐informed people, so that politicans can no longer say just anything to win elections and then go on to decide as they please between campaigns. Reputation for Quick Wits Mr. Faure, a small, almost bare‐skulled man with warm, gentle manners, has a reputation as one of the most shrewd, quick witted politicans in France, He is a member of the Gaullist party now, after having belonged to the Radical‐Socialists (liberals), and is one of those figures who is respected by all but not quite con sidered the regular benchmate of any. He has not yet settled on plans to revitalize and perhaps reform the Assembly, but he has undertaken an extensive program of consultations and meetings to figure out how Parliament can perform its new role. He refused to comment on Washington's political troubles, either the strains between the branches of government or the attitudes revealed in the Watergate scandals. But he summarized the problem of parliamentary democracy in the modern age as “part in action, part in thought.” “We must not be too theoretical,” he said, “or things will not get done. But also we must not be too practical. We must perform the function of meditation.”"
Supreme Court Refuses To Permit Abortion Now,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/05/archives/supreme-court-refuses-to-permit-abortion-now.html,"WASHINGTON, May 4 (AP) —The Supreme Court refused today to permit an immediate abortion for a woman who asserted that a Green Bay, Wis., hospital was denying her constitutional rights and endanger‐ ing her health with its antiabortion policy. The Court without comment denied an application by “Jane Doe” and her physician to order the Beilin Hospital to permit the abortion. Dr. Herbert F. Sandmire was refused facilities when he sought to perform the operation. Dr. Sandmire, a member of the hospital's staff and president of the state society of obstetrics and gynecology, said that if his patient were allowed to pass into the second trimester of her pregnancy today, a more involved procedure for abortion would have to be used, multiplying the risk to the mother tenfold."
Legislature: A Retrospective,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/06/archives/legislature-a-retrospective-no-return-expected-ecology-bill.html,"TRENTON — When the State Legislature convened here last January, Governor Cahill asked it to “take a bold step forward” and approve a superagency that would funnel toll‐road profits into new mass transportation programs for New Jersey. However, this is an election year for the Republican Governor and the politically divided Legislature, and neither appeared ready to approve anything that promised to antagonize the voters. The result was a predictable session that ended here early Tuesday morning. As one prominent Republican legislator put it, “We weren't asked to do very much, and we ended up doing very little.” In fact, the biggest news during the last few months was generated outside the Legislature. It pertained to charges of political corruption involving a number of prominent New Jersey Republicans, and to a series of significant court decisions that promise to force the Legislature to grapple with the issue of financing public education. In its most essential terms, the program outlined by Governor Cahill in his annual legislative message on Jan. 9 was a modest document that did not call for any new taxes or any major new spending programs. However, several measures that finally prevailed were significant. For one, the Legislature approved, and the Governor signed, what is regarded here as one of the toughest laws on disclosing political campaign finances. It will govern the way that candidates raise and spend campaign funds in the fall. For another, the Legislature approved a measure that would have allowed reporters in New Jersey to refuse to disclose any news information to an investigative body. But the Governor was convinced that the state's existing shield law, which allows reporters to protect their confidential sources, was sufficient, and he vetoed the bill. Generally, both parties were more concerned with preparations for the June primary election and with the new legislative districts established earlier this year by the Legislative Apportionment Commission. For the first time in Jersey history, every legislator will run in a definite district, with one Senator and two Assemblymen elected from each. Ecology Bill Scuttled One consequence of the partisan edge given to this year's legislative session was that some strong environmental measures were scuttled by a combination of Democratic opposition and only half‐hearted Republican support in the final meeting of the State Senate, which adjourned here the week before. Initially, Mr. Cahill and his advisers were convinced that their best chances of success in his re‐election campaign involved environmental‐protection bills that required little or no state financial outlays. So, with Assembly Speaker Thomas H. Kean, an Essex County Republican, leading the way, the Assembly approved a number of environmental measures aimed at protecting the state's undeveloped coastline and its offshore waters. However, the entire series of measures was defeated in the Senate when the Democrats there refused to vote for them. One of the measures would have given the State Commissioner of Environmental Protection the power to ban any development that threatened coastal environment. Another would have estab, lished an environmental sanctuary extending out three miles to sea. And a third would have barred the construction, of a deep‐water oil superport in New Jersey waters. No Return Expected Although Governor Cahill said he would attempt to get the Senate to come back after the primary election to reconsider its vote, particularly on the coastal‐protection measure, there was no indication this weekend that the Senators were inclined to do so. As for the Governor's proposed mass‐transit program, it was regarded by the Democratic minorities in both houses as a political vehicle for the Governor's re‐election. Among other things, the program promised to create new mass‐transit facilities without any new taxes. It never got anywhere. On other issues, the state courts settled the rent‐control debate by ruling, that communitites could adopt their own local sent‐control ordinances. And the Federal courts threw out as Unconstitutional the Governor's program of aid for private and parochial schools. Similarly, the Federal courts had already resolved the volatile issues of abortion and capital punishment, all to the relief of both parties here. Even the controversial issue of water fluoridation will probably be resolved administratively, rather than by any direct legislative action. So after giving final approval to the Governor's $2.4‐billion budget, the Assembly headed home here Tuesday, relieved that the session was over and aware, too, that it and the Senate will certainly have to grapple with the issue of tax reform that it has thus far successfully avoided."
What Price Research?,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/06/archives/what-price-research-fetuses-medicine.html,"WASHINGTON—A few years ago, medical scientists in Helsinki injected rubella vaccine into 35 pregnant women who were scheduled to have abortions. The doctors wanted to find out what effect the live virus in the vaccine would have on the fetuses. The experimental question was important and could not really be answered by animal research. Rubella, also known as German measles, is major cause of stillbirths and birth defects, and the vaccine was developed to prevent them, yet it was not clear whether the vaccine would be safe to use in a pregnant woman. The study strengthened the evidence that it would not be safe for the fetus. So there was reason for the experiments, but was it ethical to do them? There was nothing in the research that was going to help the fetuses, nor could their “informed consent” be obtained. A final report on the project was published last summer in the New England Journal of Medicine. The authors included not only the doctors in Finland but also American scientists of Case Western Reserve University and the National Institutes of Health. Although the report caused no ethical stir at the time, it is doubtful that the American participation in the project would be possible now. The climate of opinion seems to have changed. While this has happened totally independently of the rubella story, that project does exemplify the growing problem concerning research involving the fetus. The issues are complicated and are often laden with emotion. If a fetus is to be aborted and therefore cannot survive, is it not wasteful to throw it away without attempts at learning things that might help other babies survive or avoid crippling defects? On the other hand, if it is human, does anyone have the right to do research on it without consent—and whose consent? The mother would ordinarily be the person to ask, but she has already asked for abortion. Can she be said to have the best interest of the fetus at heart? One question often raised by laymen is whether or not experiments on the fetus could inflict pain. But the term “pain” is subjective. It has no meaning unless the subject is conscious and the fetus, presumably, is not. One of the ironies of the already tangled problems of fetal research is that anyone dissatisfied with that answer could only dispute it by doing research on the fetus. The issues concerning fetal research have arisen in this country because of several factors, only one of which is the recent liberalization of abortion laws. In recent years scientists have gained increasing ability to maintain life artificially in the laboratory. There is continued scientific impetus and need to learn more concerning the details of human development and its problems. Further, some European countries, notably Scandinavia, have long considered research on the fetus permissible. Advisers to the National Institutes of Health have been discussing the scientific and ethical issues for at least two years. Last fall, a special N.I.H. committee was set up by Dr. Robert Q. Marston, then N.I.H. director, to review and determine proper policy for the institutes on all areas of human experimentation, of which fetal research is certainly a part. The committee is still working. “From this review recommendations for policies and procedures regarding research on non‐viable aborted human fetuses will evolve,” a recent N.I.H. statement said. “Before any such policies are adopted there will be an opportunity for public discussion to permit expres'sion of societal concerns.” National Institutes of Health policy at present is that research involving fetal tissues is permissible, but that there is no current justification for studies of the intact living aborted fetus that is too young and too incompletely formed to survive. Nor does N.I.H. policy permit research that might be harmful to the fetus in the womb. In the United States, opinion appears sharply divided both among scientists and laymen on the issue, though there has not been much widespread discussion yet in public. The Institute of Society Ethics and Life Sciences in Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N. Y., presents in its current monthly report two diametrically opposed views. The question was: is it justifiable to use aborted human fetuses in research aimed directly at developing artificial means of keeping an early premature baby alive until it is sufficiently developed to live on its own? Dr. Robert S. Morison, professor of science and society at Cornell, argued that, with proper safeguards, it is permissible. He said that the research could be of great help to future babies, and that the experiments on the aborted fetus did not alter its prospects for life because the decision to abort had already decided that. He noted that a special problem would arise if the research progressed far enough to offer the prospects of survival to the aborted fetus under study—a fetus by definition no longer wanted by the mother. Sumner B. Twiss Jr. of the Department of Religious Studies at Brown University said the research in question should not be done. He argued that it raised insoluble problems concerning “informed consent,” serious moral problems involving disposal of the fetus at the end of the experiments and a real dilemma when the research neared the stage of being successful. The example the two men discussed was not hypothetical, but was the subject of an actual research grant application in Britain, where a review committee decided in favor of the project. Dr. Andre Hellegers, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Georgetown University, believes that the United States Supreme Court, which has already ruled that women have rights to abortion, may ultimately have to rule on the question of whether a fetus, viable or not, has individual rights once it has been removed from the womb."
The Man and the Medium Made History,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/06/archives/the-man-and-the-medium-made-history.html,"HE completed only six films during his halfcentury on earth. But from 1925, when the second of them, “The Battleship Potemkin,” burst upon the world until he died in 1948, Sergei M. Eisenstein was, by common consent of creators and critics alike, the second great creative giant in movie history. The first, D. W. Griffith, had demonstrated the medium's previously unsuspected ability to sustain long, complex dramatic narratives at least as well as the novel and the theater could. Eisenstein demonstrated that there was a way to do that with material fundamentally alien to those other arts. He called it montage, an enormously sophisticated editing technique that was purely cinematic. The world of film still awaits a third individual who will, single‐handed, impose a quantum leap of this magnitude on it. In addition to “Potemkin” Eisenstein created “Strike” (1924), “October”—known in the West as “Ten Days that Shook The World” (1927), “The General Line” (1928), “Alexander Nevsky” (1938) and the two‐part “Ivan the Terrible” (1942–46). All but one were historical spectacles and taken together they comprise the only great body of work in the spectacular cinema. Eisenstein is now the subject of a 90‐minute documentary, co‐produced by the BBC and Novosti, a Soviet news agency, to be broadcast tomorrow night at 8 on WNET/ 13. The documentary should help to restore Eisenstein to the consciousness of a new generation of filmmakers and their youthful audience, to whom—as a result of the cold war and the general generational absence of a sense of history—he is a rather remote figure. Indeed, in this respect the new documentary disappoints. Though old friends and colleagues keep popping up in the film to insist that Eisenstein was “the Leonardo Da Vinci of his time,” they are more idolatrous than specific about the precise nature of his gifts and, therefore, of his abiding Importance. There is too much emphasis on his revolutionary subject matter, not enough on his revolutionary techniques as contributions to the basic grammar of film. It cannot be too firmly put: Eisenstein was, above all, a, great and greatly creative editor. To vastly oversimplify the matter, he Imposed the organizing rhythms of art on the inchoate mass of facts we call history. It was a matter of selection, juxtaposition and timing of wordless images, symbols, through which he expressed, as surely as does a historian working with words, the response of his singular sensibility to that history. More important, with Montage, he created suspenseful drama that was also remarkably pure cinema only rarely resorting to the conventions of narrative and characterization that other filmmakers easily borrowed from the established fictional arts. He was, in short, a kind of abstractionist, very much in the modernist spirit. The TV program does not, I think, make enough of the miracle of this purist's survival among the propagandists of what was surely the wordiest, most ideologically contentious and repressive revolution in history. As a result, it is rather dim‐witted when it comes to dealing with his troubles with Stalin's censors, the total supression of one film (“Bazhin Meadow”) and the struggle over “Ivan the Terrible,” which surely shortened his life. Still, the documentary has its values—especially in demonstrating the close relationship between Eisenstein's early personal history and the way his mature mind worked. Educated as engineer and architect, and serving in an engineer's unit during World War I, Eisenstein learned the value of precise planning, the necessity to attend closely to details it mighty enterprises are to come right in the end. After the war, entering the theater as a director, he soon grew impatient with the constraints of the stage, physically incapable of containing the great visions already thronging his mind's eye. It was, obviously, suitable for “the individual and triangle dramas of the bourgeoise,” but even without the intervention of the revolution, that material would not have detained him long. Of the shift in his allegiance from theater to movies, he said simply, “The cart fell to pieces and the driver fell into the cinema.” Actually, of course, the spirit of the times gave him a hard nudge. “Among all your arts, the most important is that of the cinema,” said Lenin. The logic was simple enough. In a huge country that was multilingually illiterate, the silent screen was a perfect medium for internal propaganda. Moreover, it was the only medium in which it was possible to pursuasively abandon the convention of the individual hero and substitute for him the collective, the masses as hero. There was one final factor in this perfectly timed meeting of man and medium. Short of film and equipment, Russian filmmakers in the early twenties had spent much time studying works from abroad, even recutting them. In the course of this work Eisenstein became convinced that it was not so much the individual shots as it was their juxtaposition that shaped the “import and image” of films. An example from his second film, the film that brought him to the attention of the world, “The Battleship Potemkin”: Eisenstein cuts from a close‐up of the hilt of an officer's sword to a close‐up of a priest's hands fingering a crucifix. The similarity in the shape of the two objects made for a simple, natural transition, but more important, in the wink of an eye, as it were, he established a much more important ideological point—the alliance of military and church in the oppression of the masses. In textbook terms, in the terms of the PBS documentary, the relationship between Eisenstein's art and his biography is neat as can be. Eisenstein himself often wrote as if his principles were so universal that anyone could take them up and make masterpieces simply by employing them. “I approach the making of a film in much the same way that I would approach the equipment of a poultry farm or the installation of a water system,” he once said. And in one public pronouncement after another, faithful revolutionary that he liked to seem, he discounted the impact of his personality on his work. This was not mere political expedience on his part. Intellectually, he craved Identification as a humble worker, just one of the masses he glorified. Nevertheless, whether he liked it or not, whether the Communist party hacks liked it cir not, he was an artist. Which means that, in the final analysis, he was, inescapably, that despised figure — a bourgeois individualist. You can see it in his very first feature, “Strike,” in which the wickedly satirical scenes of the stock market in panic are at once funnier, more terrifying, more human than mere allegiance to the party line required. You can see it in the wonderful sequence in “Ten Days that Shook the World” where a popinjay Kerensky mounts the stairs of the Winter Palace, accepting the bows and scrapes of the Czar's old retainers, almost visibly puffing up as he prepares to take over the Czar's old suite. Sure, it's politically “correct,” but it is also a wonderful and quite universal comment on human vanity. Or take Eisenstedn's most famous eequenoe — the massacre on the Odessa Steps in “Potemkin.” It, too, is politically impeccable—the implacable cruelty of the soldiery, the innocent nobility of the crowd they decimate. But I have seen an entirely apolitical American woman moved to tears by this sequence while watching it on television in her living room. It was not ideology that reached her. Nor was it entirely a matter of technique—the masterful rhythm of the editlag (Elsensteln often used a metronome on the set to In sure that the timing of his actors’ movements would match the beat he heard in his mind and help establish the rhythm he would later reinforce in his editing.) No, what got to her was his uncanny, transcendentally nonpolitical ability to reach into the mass and particularize its emotions with suspenseful little sketches of the individual tragedies that, taken together, form that tragedy known as the human condition. The runaway baby carriage, the pleading mother, the bewildered student effectively blinded when his eyeglasses are broken in the Odessa Steps sequence—they all have their analogues in all of his films. Eisenstein was, like most great artists who work in a popular medium, a duplicitous fellow. And if that is not always apparent in his films (though I think that is why they still seem so wondrously fresh to us, despite their didacticism in aid of oft‐pleaded and even discredited causes), it surely comes through in the record of his odyssey through the West in the thirties. This is the most interesting section of the new documentary: Eisenstein arriving at a Swiss film conference and organizing its staid participants into cast and crew to create a mock mini‐epic, then staying on in Switzerland to make a short film supporting legalized abortion; Eisenstein in London joyously playing a bobby in a friend's avantgarde film; Eisenstein assaulting Hollywood and establishing a mad Russian menage as eccentric as anything the movie colony had ever seen (and by that time it had seen plenty); Eisenstein running afoul, first of the moguls, then of Upton Sinclair with his aborted “Qua Viva Mexico” ??? stein out of favor, after his return home, publicly promising to “rid myself of the last anarchistic traits of individualism” after he was forced to abandon “Bazhin Meadow,” then restoring himself to favor with “Alexander Nevsky.” “But it's wonderful that nothing is known about him,” he cried, delighted to find a subject remote enough for the party not to have a pre‐established “line” he must follow. There was, obviously, an exuberance, an energy, a canny self‐preserving instinct and a sheer delight in life and art that does not come through in his own theoretical writings or in the earnest politicized critical writing that accompanied his rise to fame. The PBS documentary does not entirely capture that spirit either, but it very usefully implies it. And its film clips will tantalize a new generation with glimpses of works that not only reshaped the movie medium but retain their freshness because they are infused with the thrill of discovery. They will begin to see here, I think, that though Eisenstein set the parameters which still define the way directors order their images of spectacle, 50 years of imitation (by this time quite unconscious) have not advanced the art substantially; that, indeed, no one has equaled him as yet. For the rest of us, “Eisenstein” at least stimulates speculation, makes us wonder at the enigma of his genius, even though the documentary, in its conventional way, tends to flatten him out, rob him of the verve and charisma every quotation from his movies suggests was present in his personality.

The message is ‘Not much’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/06/archives/the-message-is-not-much.html,"At the end of the sixties, I would sometimes meet old friends who, almost 20 years earlier, had worn long hair and dirty jeans, rejected conventional notions of morality, and spent their time in Greenwich Village coffee houses and bars to the despair of their middleclass parents. In the intervening years, these friends had gotten older but continued living a semi‐bohemian life. They were careful to bring up their children to be free of the old sexual and social repressions, sent them to benign schools and communicated endlessly with them. Now these children were in their early teens and causing their parents far more trouble than their grandparents could have conceived. I heard stories of crackups, runaways, thefts, drug addiction, school expulsions and cult involvement. What was especially irritating was that it was unexpected trouble. Our generation had been, we thought, so much better parents to our children than we had had — so much more direct and understanding and undemanding and kind. Now it seemed we were confronted with a collection of intractable, stony‐faced, bored, self‐destructive kids who had no intention of saying yes to growing up and clearly could say no to nothing else. What had happened, in part, was that in our attempts to liberate this generation from the pieties and moralism which many of us had rejected, we were so indiscriminately iconoclastic in our messages to the young that what we transmitted were negative values. Trendy social thinking had delivered such concepts as merit, hard work, success and selfcontrol into the hands of the know‐nothings and reactionaries. Under the banner of antiauthoritarianism we gave these indulged middle‐class children no firm standards to meet and little adult authority to test themselves against. Many of them reacted by accepting adolescent group standards as their authority, and the “youth culture”—that flurry of assumed identities and perpetual selfgratification—flourished for a time, filling a vacuum. I think the kids got tired of the chaos before the grownups did. Their hunger for some order and structure explains such end of the decade movements as guru worship, the occult and strict organic diets. Now there is yet another turn, back to the safety of the conventional fifties, before the revolution, when kids could act like kids and look forward to growing up because that's where the action was. The writers of novels for teenagers have not yet caught up to the new mood. The mode that writers like Paul Zindel, Maia Wojciechowska and others established—teenage fiction in which America was envisioned as a limbo containing preoccupied parents, irrelevant schools and depressed adolescents—has become an established convention. The most successful of these novels, in sales and in critical acclaim, are often those which are most titillating to the young—dealing with drugs, hetero‐ and homosexual sex, pregnancy and abortion. Until recently, there has remained a little damp moralizing implicit in the novels. Girls have a bad time if they get pregnant. Drug‐taking leads to trouble. But this season, in Norma Klein's “ft's Not What You Expect,” we have the first abortion without any guilt feelings or hassle of any kind. This, by the way, is In a book with suggested reader's age of 10 to 14. Those who write self‐help books for teen‐agers are also often quick to impose on the young their vision of the lives of the young. Books on sex have been hastily revised to include specific technical information about birth control, abortion and venereal disease. There is a tacit assumption that those in their early teens are going to engage in sexual activity—probably promiscuously — and that they are likely either to become pregnant or contract a venereal disease along the way, perhaps both. It is expected that doing these things will cause the kids some anxiety which the teen‐age book people are trying to allay by showing them that, after all, other kids are in the same boat. It is obvious that those adolescents who want it should have access to straight information on any subject whatever. And I am not disturbed by the young reading novels of sex, drugs, madness and despair, which they can find, as they always have, in books for adults. There is something odd and unpleasant in the idea of “understanding” grownups churning out tawdry books for kids. As there is in librarians and teachers welcoming these books so uncritically. However they may disclaim the role and talk about the new reality, the writers of books for the young are instructors of the young, telling them what adults expect of them. Currently, it would seem, the message is “very little.” When kids read books for grownups it is a little like eavesdropping on the adult world. They know the conversation is not meant for their ears, that the message is not for them. They can observe without being called upon to emulate. There is a further responsibility connected with teen‐age books. By and large, in the educated middle‐class, these books are read by younger children than the jacket's advisory notice indicates. My 11‐year‐old son has friends who regularly come from school carrying teen‐age fiction about drugs and sex and crack‐ups and hopelessness. I wonder if these boys think they have been issued these books to show them what life is like. My son has somehow not yet latched on to these books, being hooked on Jack London at the moment. Wolves are more real to him than gonorrhea. I sometimes think about the difference between my father's life as a boy and the ways kids live now. His family was poor and he had to leave school early in order to work. He had always read books, among them, when he was very young, the Horatio Alger series in which honesty and hard work are perennially, miraculously rewarded. I think he believed it. During the First World War, he enlisted in the Navy and was regularly sent out for cigarettes by an officer. In those days, coupons redeemable for premiums were distributed with the packs. One day the officer, as if in a Horatio Alger novel, said to my father, “Young man, you are the first sailor who has always given me the coupons instead of keeping them. I like your honesty and I am recommending that you be sent to Officer's Candidate School.” So my father became an officer and that opened up a larger world. I think he half attributes his later success to the fact that Horatio Alger nudged him on. ■"
"Perennial questions about social, school and sex problems",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/06/archives/ask-beth-perennial-questions-about-social-school-and-sex-problems.html,"“How can a boy kiss a girl who wears braces? — Tinsel Teeth.” You Can't Ask Your Mother. By Elizabeth C. Winship. 244 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. $5.95. “I have enormous ears. Kids say I look like a car with both doors left open…. Is there an operation to whittle them down to size?—Dumbo.” “I am in terrible trouble and I don't know where to turn. I'm fourteen and I'm pregnant….” “I am pretty sure I have a venereal disease…. I just don't know what to do… Beth, I must have help!” These are some of the questions from Elizabeth Winship's syndicated column, collected in “Ask Beth,” and they reveal that, the prevailing image of liberated youth notwithstanding, today's adolescents are suffering very much the same agonies and uncertainties their parents did 20‐odd years ago. The perennial questions about social success and sex, school problems and adult attitudes are all here, along with pleas for advice on such current concerns as drugs and contraceptives, abortions and interracial dating. As the teen‐agers pour out their woes to this understanding woman, back come her practical, honest replies. To a girl wondering how to get to know a boy she likes, Beth exclaims, “Flirt!” and, having expanded a little on what flirting means, she finishes.ith, “Look at all the things animals do to attract the attention of a mate. The penguin, for example, lays a stone at his beloved's feet. Don't bring stones. But go ahead and be gay. Life without gaiety is as bland as a boiled egg without salt.” Beth Winship offers a splendid combination of wit and sense. Her frankness and sympathy must have helped many an anxious youngster, and her book should make a practical present for one's teen‐age friends. If their particular problems aren't covered, then, of course, they too can always go back and “ask Beth.” ■"
Paterson Coalition Lists Goals,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/06/archives/paterson-coalition-lists-goals-housing-a-priority-began-shaping.html,"PATERSON — What similar peoples’ groups have done successfully in San Francisco, Minneapolis and New York, the new Paterson Coalition intends to do here: Let many people act as one by giving them a strong voice in the decision‐making processes. “It's the only route to go,” said Robert J. Cornish, president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan coalition of 41 organizations. “This community is so polarized, and the issues are so strictly categorized by ethnic and political affiliations, that many things that have merit are lost. Now, if an organization's vested interest in a particular issue is valid and gains broadbased support, the coalition will take action. “The coalition will give people the power of expression with support, and the education and systematic means to achieve their objectives,” said Mr. Cornish, who is also a delegate from Omega Phi Psi, a fraternity of black business and professional men. Housing a priority The coalition's Action Council adopted housing, education, public safety and health as immediate concerns with housing receiving the highest priority. The replacement of all housing units demolished by renewal plans was urged by the Rev. Max Tow, the coalition's executive vice president and head of the Inner City Community Action group, which has been active in nonprofit interfaith housing here for some years. About 1,000 housing units are being swept away in the wake of a highway running through the city, said Mr. Tow, whose recommendations run counter to those by planning authorities. Planners see this industrial city of 130,000 as a potential office center. The coalition does not. Two new schools, highway redesign and additional housing police in city projects were called for by the Paterson Education Association, the Catholic Family and Community Services and the Welfare Rights Organization, all new members of the coalition. A school hot‐lunch program and the replacement of off‐duty policemen by welfare recipients as public school guards were also suggestions made in strong position papers. Representing P.T.A.'s, housing agencies, Catholic and Protestant agencies and churches, tenants’ councils and social and civic clubs, the coalition is preponderantly black, although it seeks to represent the total community. According to Mr. Cornish, more than 100 organizations had been solicited during the developmental stages, but some groups, such as the Spanish‐speaking organizations, did not join. “I think that's a matter of the language barrier,” Mr. Cornish said. Membership, however, is not closed. Began Shaping Last Fall The Paterson Coalition began taking shape last fall as a result of the successes of smaller coalitions with strong, but limited, goals. For example, a move to keep the Passaic County Community College in Paterson aroused public sympathy and persuaded trustees and Freeholders to shun a suggestion that the college be shifted to another city. The Tenants Association of Paterson forced through a rent‐leveling law, and the Paterson Media Coalition plunged into heavy negotiations with Radio station WPAT to gain community access to its programing. Also the Sponsoring Committee for Change brought about improvement in the local children's shelter. Catholic community organ izations and clerics have given strong organizational arid staff support to the coalition. Sister Margaret Healy of the Missionary Servants of the Blessed Trinity, a Philadelphia‐based order, was sent to Paterson to organize the teaching sisters in parochial schools. “My message to them,” said Sister Margaret, “is that if the Catholics can, mobilize so effectively on issues of abortion and funding to parochial schools, then we can certainly organize on issues affecting the entire community. After all, that is the message of Christ.”"
Contraceptives‐Sale Bill Due for Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/07/archives/contraceptivessale-bill-due-for-vote-present-law-assailed.html,"ALBANY, May 6—The Slate Senate is expected to act this week on a bill that would substantially liberalize the 100‐year‐old state law restricting the sale and store display of contraceptives. While retaining the ban on advertising of contraceptives, the bill would eliminate the barrier against their sale to persons under 16, broaden the places where they could be sold or distributed, and permit shelf display of contraceptives where they were leeally available. Sponsors of the bill, led by Senator Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, have quietly campaigned for several months, picking up support from the Rockefeller administration, the New York State Council of Churches and a score of family planning, civil liberties and consumer groups. Present Law Assailed They argue that the present law, described by Senator Goodman as the most stringent of its kind in the country, has contributed to an “epidemic” of venereal disease, especially among youths; unnecessarily increased both the abortion rate and the births of “unwanted” children; and led to greater welfare costs. These views are certain to be strongly countered by a number of lawmakers and citizen organizations. The outlook for the bill on the Senate floor is uncertain. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Warren M. Anderson said that the Binghamton Republican was inclined to vote for the bill but was unlikely to make it a party issue. Constance E. Cook, the bill's sponsor in the Assembly, said she would press for Assembly action only if the bill first passed the Senate. In 1972 the Senate rejected a less sweeping modification of the state contraceptives law. And last month the New York State Catholic Committee announced its opposition to the bill now being advanced. The committee, representing the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church in the state, said the measure would “invade the responsibility of parents for the moral training” of their children and “drive a wedge” in the family unit, “breed promiscuity” and encourage “early marital breakups”, and result in an even higher incidence of venereal disease. Senator James H. Donovan, Republican ‐ Conservative of Chadwicks and a leader in the fight against liberalized abortion laws, said he would oppose the contraceptive law, as did Senator Leon E. Giuffreda, Republican of Centereach, L. I., and head of the Education Committee, which reported out the Goodman bill. The law now makes it Class A misdemeanor for anyone to sell or distribute any form of contraceptive to a person under 16. Only licensed pharmacists can sell contraceptives, alithough physicians can distribute a “drug” to patients. Contraceptives, according to the law, cannot be placed on view or advertised inside or outside pharmacies. In addition to abolishing the age restraint, Senator Goodman's bill would allow contraceptives of any kind to be sold, distributed or displayed in family‐planning and other facilities providing health services under the direct or indirect su pervision of a physician. All pharmacy employes would be authorized to sell contractives. The bill's proponents are particularly scornful of the view that widening the availability of contraceptives will help erode sexual morals. “Few people In our society are waiting for this Legislature to enact this so‐called libertine law before they have intercourse,” said Albert N. Podell, an official of the Citizens Union. Among the most active supporters of the bill is the State Health Department. Two weeks ago the department declared that “gonorrhea has reached epidemic levels” in the state—the 1972 total of 67,000 cases was 12,000 over the 1971, it said."
CATHOLICS ASSAY SEX COUNSELING,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/07/archives/catholics-assay-sex-counseling-programs-called-ineffective-for.html,"HOLYOKE, Mass., May 6—The Roman Catholic bishops of New England were told today after a consultation with 160 clergy, nuns and laity that present church sex education programs are “not effective” for most Catholic married couples. A report on family life, reached after discussion in small groups, also said that couples needed special instruction in “forming right consciences” regarding frequency of births within the context of “the pro‐life teachings” of the 1968 birth control encyclical of Pope Paul VI. The final edited version, of the family life report, as well as one on a second topic, “Youth and the Church,” was sharply criticized at a news conference after the three‐day meeting as being too brief and ambiguous. “I was disappointed,” said Sister Mary Caritas of Holyoke, “because the summaries were too simplistic, and anti‐climactic.” The convocation called for development of family life programs, devoted to the “full development of the human person” from preschool to adult levels. Teachers and parents should share in these, and there should be adequate “theological and psychological preparation” for teachers, it was said. Other Proposals Other parts of the document stressed full‐time family life programs for married couples, the thought being that, in the words of the Rev. George P. Behan, of East Providence, R.I., “90 per cent of family life programs in our areas are concerned with premarital training and crisis response.” The report urged training of seminarians in marriage counseling, pastoral care of couples in mixed marriages and efforts to reach divorced and remarried persons who may feel “ostracized” by the Catholic community because of their marital status. Both the family life and youth reports will become part of the “input” from similar meetings of Bishops and laity in 11 other regions around the United States on the same subject. The New England region includes 24 Bishops and 1 I Catholic dioceses in six New England states with 5,7, million Catholics on church rolls. Action Due in November All the consultative regional meetings are discussing the same two subjects, with background material and a special request to talk about the, church's anti‐abortion stand. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, the organization of the American Catholic Bishops, will act on the findings next November. Thraughout the meeting, bishops mingled freely among the delegates, including 40 youths expressing pleasure at being able to enter workshop exchanges and at learning from the laity. The “Youth and the Church” report, presented by Miss Anne Frances Margolies, 19 years old, of Burlington, Vt., said “the greatest need is communication” between church lead‐1 ers and young people. Bishops should make known their stands on social issues to the young, it was said, and foster personalized parishes,, possibly without formal boundaries, that would respond to “the total person” and involve the young at all decisionmaking levels. At a free‐wheeling session oni various issues, presented as “consensus” votes for consideration by the delegates, the convocation urged: exploration of areas of need for “women in ministry” at the local level; involvement of blacks in parish life; the naming of vicars for Spanish ‐ speaking Catholics; education of Catholics on the subject of unconditional amnesty for draft evaders, and special programs for the elderly."
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/09/archives/new-jersey-briefs-court-backs-druggists-records-3-officials-plead.html,"Citing the deaths of 24,000 people each year because of bad reactions to medication, a state appeals court upheld yesterday a rule requiring druggists to keep a profile record on their customers. The Appellate Division of the Superior Court rejected a challenge by Rite Aid of New Jersey, Inc., and nine other retail pharmacies to the rule adopted last year by the State Board of Pharmacy. The regulation was not put into effect immediately because of the court appeal. Rite Aid and the other pharmacies argued it was unreasonably expansive to keep the required profile listing the strength and quantity of the drug given to the customer and a record of his allergies and physical idiosyncracies. 3 Officials Plead Not Guilty Surrogate John J. Lemken of Hudson County and two Union City Commissioners were released on $5,000 personal recognizance bond each after pleading not guilty to indictments against them handed up last week by a Hudson County grand jury. In appearances before Superior Court Judge Joseph P. Hanrahan in Jersey City, Mr. Lemken pleaded to charges of misconduct in office and conspiracy to cheat, and Commissioners Paul J. Lombardo and James E. Largomarsino pleaded to charges of taking municipal funds and aiding and abetting a public cheat. Group Formed to Aid Education An organization designed to give the public a greater voice in making policy on education announced its formation in Trenton with the backing of former State Education Commission Carl L. Marburger. The group, called Advocates for Education, said it would try to provide a “balance” to offset the influence of such organizations as the New Jersey Educatoinal Association, which lobbies on behalf of the state's teachers. The new group is headed by Judith Ahlfeld of Millington, former school board member and president of the Morris County League of Women Voters. Picture‐Taking by Police Is Scored Two Assemblymen demanded an investigation of an incident outside the Assembly chamber last week when a state trooper took photographs of women protesting an Assembly vote in favor of national action to bar abortions. Assemblyman Eldridge Hawkins, Democrat of Essex, charged that the policeman had identified himself as a newspaper photographer. He asked for an investigation of why the pictures were taken and whether they were used to compile dossiers. Assemblyman Ann Klein, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor, said she had serious questions “about the validity of the official accounts of the so‐called disturbance.”"
Byrne Favors Public Funds for Election Financing,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/11/archives/byrne-favors-public-funds-for-election-financing-favors-tax.html,"NEWARK, May 10—Brendan T. Byrne, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor, Said today that he opposed the traditional system of financing elections with political campaign contributions and that, if elected, he would lead a legislative drive to have such contributions outlawed in New Jersey. Mr. Byrne said he would consider asking Governor Cahill to call a special session of the Legislature to approve an emergency appropriation so that this year's gubernatorial election could be financed wholly with public funds. Mr. Byrne's suggestion came in the wake of recent disclosures about the financing of the campaigns of President Nixon and Governor Cahill, both Republicans. Governor Cahill said that while he supported the general concept of public financing of political campaigns, no one had yet come up with a “feasible” plan. In a statement, the Governor said that if Mr. Byrne had any specific recommendations, “I would like to see them and I would recommend that he submit them to the legislative leaders of both parties for their consideration.” At a news conference here, Mr. Byrne, a former Superior Court judge, staked out his positions on some of the major issues in the Democratic primary election on June 5. Because many New Jersey political leaders regard him as the favorite in the primary, his positions today were regarded as significant since they most likely would, reflect the major thrust of his Democratic platform in this year's gubernatorial and legislative elections. The other major Democratic candidates are State Senator Ralph DeRose of Essex County and Assemblyman Ann Klein of Morris County. Mr. Cahill is opposed in the Republican primary by Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. of Cape May. Mr. Byrne has never before been a candidate for election to public office in nearly 20 years of public life in the state, and his initial responses to questions today seemed hesitant and guarded. On the major state issue of tax reform, Mr. Byrne said that a state income tax would have to be considered in any proposed program. But he did not commit himself to one, and he emphasized that no reform effort would succeed in New Jersey unless public officials convinced the voters that it was “something they could believe in, something guaranteed them real relief from oppressive local property taxes.” Favors Tax Classification In opposition to Governor Cahill's tax plan, which was overwhelmingly defeated in the Assembly last July, M. Byrne said that he favored a system under which real‐estate taxes were classified so that they would be applied at varying rates to industry and homes. Mr. Cahill opposed such a classification last year, prompting Democrats in the Legislature to charge that his program would have constituted a $200‐million tax windfall to business and industrial interests in the state. On other key issues, Mr. Byrne said he would support a major state role in zoning and land‐use planning of New Jersey's communities and its na tural resources; he was critical of Mr. Cahill's mass‐transit record, although he refused to take a position on the Governor's proposal to have tolls from the state's major toll roads finance mass‐transportation programs, and he said he accepted the recent court rulings that authorized abortions and that outlawed parochial and private school aid, although he said he favored any such aid that would fall within constitutional limits. However, it was on the issue of campaign financing that Mr. Byrne made his most decisive impact today. Indeed, it was the news of the Federal and state investigations of the political financing of Governor Cahill's election campaign in 1969 that was believed to have figured heavi‐Iture ly in Mr. Byrne's decision tol change his mind last month and enter the Democratic primary after deciding two months earlier against such a move. The Federal investigation, which has already returned one indictment, has implicated former State Treasurer Joseph M. McCrane Jr. and a number of other prominent New Jersey Republicans with close ties to the Governor in an alleged conspiracy to have heavy contributors write them off illegally as business expenses on their income tax returns. In the Assembly, Richard W. DeKorte, the Republican major – ity leader and Assemblyman Albert Burstein, a Democrat,both of Bergen County, had said they would introduce a bill that would outlaw campaign contributions, but the Legisla – ture adjourned and the mea – sure apparently died."
AUSTRALIA REJECTS ABORTION PROPOSAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/13/archives/australia-rejects-abortion-proposal.html,"SYDNEY, Australia, May 12 —In a highly emotional meeting, the ,Auttralian Parliament has overwhelmingly rejected a bill to permit abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy on request, or up to the 23d week with the concurrence of two doctors. The measure, one of the most controversial ever presented to Parliament, produced two days of demonstrations by supporters and opponents outside the Parliament building in Canberra. “The battle has only just begun,” said Representative David McKenzie, a Labor party member from Victoria, who sponsored the bill. The vote against the measure Thursday was 98 to 23 in the 125‐member allmale House of Representatives, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam had declared the abortion measure a matter of conscience, freeing parliamentary members of his Labor party from party direction on the vote. His 27. member Cabinet divided on the proposal, with Mr. Whitlam one of 10 ministers who voted for the bill. The bill applied to the Australian Capital Territory, a federal area around Canberra, corresponding to the District of Columbia in the United States."
Breakfast of Champions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/13/archives/breakfast-of-champions-or-goodbye-blue-monday-by-kurt-vonnegut-jr.html,"Saint Sebastian has seemed more familiar of late. He sounds like an early Vonnegut character: surviving the arrows, he was later beaten to death by rods. His scenario rather resembles that of doomed Edgar Derby of “Slaughterhouse Five""; Derby lived through the fire bombing of Dresden and then was executed by the Germans for helping himself to a teapot from a ruined cellar. A Vonnegut person may have a hysterectomy at 25, or prove irresistible to muggers, be swindled by termite exterminators, share an ambulance with a homicidal maniac, find himself shaking hands with Nelson Rockefeller in a grocery store, lose all his wealth in lawsuits and end up on Skid Row, have an unnecessary amputation, or die from rabies resulting from kincjpess to sick bat. But Vonnegut nearly always makes despair hilarious—and perhaps that's part of the cosmic too. “Breakfast of Champions, or Goodbye Blue Monday!” details the final collapse of Dwayne Hoover, a rich Pontiac dealer who goes mad in late middle‐age, some time after his wife has committed suicide by eating Drano. Crazed by a combination of “bad chemicals and bad ideas,” Hoover sees 11 moons in the sky, shoots up his bathroom instead of himself, and finds that asphalt turns to rubber beneath his feet. This formerly benign man turns against his employes, his girlfriend and every random stranger. Finally, he reads a novel which makes him believe that everyone else on earth is a fully programmed robot, and that he alone has free will. He goes completely berserk in a cocktail bar and wounds a number of people who happen to be present, including his own son. In this novel Vonnegut is treating himself to a giant brainflush, clearing his head by throwing out acquired ideas, and also liberating some of the characters from his previous books. Thus, he has celebrated his 50th birthday in the same spirit that made Tolstoy release his serfs and Thomas Jefferson free his slaves. Once again, we're back on the people‐grid: major and minor personae from other novels resurface in this one, their, lives ridiculously entangled, and future students may classify them as karass‐hoppers. I'm especially grateful for the reappearance of Kilgore Trout, author of “2BRO2B” (see “Hamlet”) and other noxious works of science fiction, the favorite writer of Billy Pilgrim and Eliot Rosewater, the philanthropist, (The latter, you may remember, was evoked by his own father as the man who “did to the word love what the Russians did to the word democracy.”) Trout was once described as looking “like frightened, aging Jesus, whose sentence to crucifixion had been commuted to imprisonment for life.” Wiping the fungi off his rotting tuxedo, or talking to his parakeet about the pollution which will surely kill ‘both of them soon, or identifying with the Abominable Snowman, he reeks of failure to a degree that's almost triumphant: “You have nothing but desolation and desperation here, you say? I bring you more of the same!” Like many Americans, Trout has “a life not worth living, but... an iron will to live.” However; after the late success bestowed on him, no one can ever tell whether Trout is kidding or not—he even crosses his fingers while doing so. Hence he shows a kinship to Bokonon, the guru of “Cat's Cradle,” who insisted that all religions, including his own, were lies. Trout is canny enough to suspect that he was invented by another human mind. He tells the parakeet that he may be “a character in book by somebody who wants to write about somebody who suffers alt the time.” After Trout's novel, “Now It Can Be Told,” causes Dwayne Hoover to run amok, Vonnegut strolls into his own script and introduces himself to Trout. Trout recoils: “Are you crazy?” But then, as the author lazily dematerializes into the void, he hears Trout crying out to be made young. It's a metaphor for total helplessness: the writer is just as casual with his creations lives as any deity or random joker—he can make a plane crash or carelessly decide to let it land. Throughout Vonnegut's books, our society sounds quite similar to the hospital in “Breakfast,” where “persons were recovering or failing to recover from injuries of all kinds.” However, as the protagonist of “Mother Night” observes, hating America “would be as silly as loving it.” Meanwhile, there are a few comforts in the Vonnegut universe: sex, occasional travel to other planets, booze (even though it's really “yeast excrement”), the love of a good dog. (While it's acknowledged that everyone needs “uncritical love,” that essence seems to be getting scarcer of late.) But due to the ease with which Vonnegut can pitch his people into situations that are “complex, tragic and laughable,” he is still our funniest pessimist, a magician of misery and farce. Naturally, “Breakfast of Champions” is laced with lunacies: a motel bedroom smells of raspberries from the disinfectant and roach‐killer which the management uses; a Midwestern Festival of the Arts is “postponed because of madness""; the author himself is almost savaged by a murderous Doberman pinscher he had tried (but failed) to cut from an earlier version of his own book. As usual, the deadpan derision is shot with sympathy. In this book, Vonnegut focuses on “collisions,” on mind‐poisoning, the dignity of advanced syphilitics (“erect, eyes straight ahead""—because the disease makes them rigid), the deflowered conscience, the “great sins [of] our nation,” such as “criminal neglect""—on a world where 14‐year‐olds swallow paint‐remover and pills intended to forestall contagious abortion in cattle (Bang's disease). The national mood echoes a Senator's speech in “God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater”: “We must become again a nation of swimmers, with the sinkers quietly disposing of themselves.” Vonnegut also makes a bitter guess about the roots of racism, which he relates to the frustration of white Northerners after winning the Civil War: “they were cheated out of the most desirable spoils of that war, which were human slaves. Well before the finish, Vonnegut has succeeded in his purpose of bringing “chaos to order.” In “Breakfast,” he states that writers have been guilty of making their readers believe that life is as orderly as the plot of a novel. Approaching 50, “I had become more and more enraged and mystified by the idiot decisions of my countrymen. And then I.. understood how innocent and natural it was for them to behave so abominably... They were doing their best to behave like people invented in story books.... Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life,” he decided to show them how to “adapt to chaos""—as the bewildered creatures in “Break fast” are made to do. An admiring review must contain two objections. First, it's disturbing that Vonnegut calls himself “Philboyd Studge” without paying any tribute to Saki. (“Filboid Studge, the Story of a Mouse That Helped,” is one of Saki's most famous tales; it concerns the advertising of a new breakfast food.) Second, there's a distressing repetition of “doodleysquat""—a term so winsome that most of us would welcome a lifetime without it. Otherwise, this explosive meditation ranks with Vonnegut's best. We know that meditations aren't supposed to explode. But this does."
A JUDGESHIP DIMS POLITICIAN'S HOPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/13/archives/a-judgeship-dims-politicians-hope-hull-is-saddened-as-meskill-names.html,"HARTFORD, May 12—In a series of judicial nominations made by Gov. Thomas J. Meskill, some ambitions have been realized. but at least one has been cut snort. For Lieut. Gov. T. Clark Hull, who longed to become Governor of Connecticut one day, the nomination to the Superior Court, the second highest court in the state, took him out of the line of succession toward the governorship. It was an unawaited call to face political reality. “Dreams die hard and I guess politicians’ dreams die harder than other persons',” the ebullient Lieutenant Governor said at a news conference at the State Capitol yesterday. In a rare moment of sadness and reflection, he added: “When I first came up to the State Capitol in December, 1962, after I had been elected a State Senator — I remember the lovely snowy night — I walked around the Capitol and looked up at the dame and I said to myself: ‘I'm going to be Governor of Connecticut, it's in the stars.'” “Well, it was snowing that night and I guess there was a little cloud over the stars,” he said. Realizing Ambition For Robert I. Berdon, the innovative State Treasurer who won a seat for Connecticut on the PBW Stock Exchange in Philadelphia, the first for any state on any stock exchange, the nomination to the Superior Court was the realization of a lawyer's career‐long ambition. “It's just what I've wanted,” Mr. Berdon said. “I'm very happy with the nomination.” Mr. Hull's eight‐year term on the Superior Court bench begins June 1; Mr. I3erdon's begins July 1. Confirmation by the Senate and House of Representatives is regarded as a formality, Yesterday Superior Court Judge Walter J. Sidor was confirmed in the House of Representatives, by a vote of 77 to 40, for another eight‐year term. The unusually large “no” vote was believed to reflect dissatisfaction among legislators, especially Democrats, with Judge Sidor's ruling last summer that rather than have no General Assembly elections at all, the elections would be held under a controversial, unconstitutional redistricting plan that favored the Republicans. Earlier in the session the Assembly had enlarged the Superior Court bench to 46 judges from 41, and the Circuit bench to 50 judges from 44. Other Nominees The others nominated by the Governor to the Superior. Court were Chief Circuit Judge J. Daly, who went on the bench in 1961 as a Democrat; John F. Shea of Manchester, a lawyer and Republican party worker; and James F. Stapleton, the Republican town chairman of Bridgeport who was given much of the credit for getting a Republican, Nicholas Panuzio, elected Mayor of what had been thought to be a Democratic stronghold. Mr. Hull had served 10 years as a State Senator. A hard campaigner and a loyal Republican, he is more liberal in his political outlook than Governor Meskill and has differed with him publicly on some difficult issues, including the death penalty and abortion. “The essence of the turmoil inside of me is that as long as I feel that there is even an infinitesimal chance that I could succeed to being Governor of Connecticut or, perhaps in 1974, could run for Governor of Connecticut, I hate to give up that chance, no matter how small,” he said."
DOCTORS IN POLL FAVOR ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/13/archives/doctors-in-poll-favor-abortions-most-of-those-replying-to-magazine.html,"Nearly two‐thirds of 33,000 physicians who responded to a nationwide poll said they favored the Supreme Court's recent ruling giving women the right to decide whether they want abortions during the first six months of pregnancy. The results of the poll, taken, by Modern Medicine magazine a month after the Court's ruling late in January, were re leased yesterday. One in six physicians receiving the magazine sent in a reply. Younger physicians favor the decision in greater numbers than older doctors, with 75 per cent of those under 35 years, of age agreeing with the Court, compared with 59 per cent of those 65 and older. Along religious lines, 92 per cent of the Jewish physicians, 69 per cent of the Protestants and 27 per cent of the Roman Catholics supporting the abortion decision. When analyzed by physician specialties, the poll indicated that those doctors most likely to become involved with the performance of abortion were least favorable to the decision. Thus, surgeons, obstetrician‐gy, necologists and general practitioners were 59 per cent in favor; pediatricians, 69 per cent; internists, 71 per cent, and psychiatrists, 86 per cent. As one psychiatrist‐respondent commented, “While I may recommend abortions, It's easier to say it's O.K. for somebody else to do them.” Geographically, physicians practicing in the Northeast and West approve the Court's decision more heavily than those in the Middle Western states. The poll indicated, however, that a liberalization of a state's abortion law before the Court's decision was accompanied by more liberal views on the part of physicians. Thus, doctors in Hawaii, where an abortion‐ondemand law has existed for several years, were much more favorable toward abortion than doctors in a state like Idaho, where a strict abortion law has prevailed: In Comments at the end of the poll, a “substantial number” of physicians expressed concern about the possible lack of abortion facilities for underprivileged patients who may be unable to afford abortions in hospitals."
Candidates’ Day,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/15/archives/hostile-questions-for-blumenthal-candidates-day-no-musical-solution.html,"Assemblyman Albert H. Blu menthal defended public edu cation, legalized abortion an the need for New York City'; communities to survive, as sep arate entities, as he campaigner yesterday for the Democratic nomination for Mayor. Mr. Blumenthal maintainer his positions in the face of hos tile questions as his three ri vals in the June 4 Democratic primary watched at a luncheor meeting of the New York City Affairs Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America, a Congregation Judea Center 2059 Bedford Avenue, in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. One questioner at the meet ing asked Mr. Blumenthal if hr would support tax credits for parents who educated their children in Jewish day schools. Mr. Blumenthal replied than “as a Jew,” he was committee to the idea that the Jewist community was responsible for providing “religious education for our children.” However, he declared, “Public money belongs to the public education system.” Another questioner asked Mr. Blumenthal if he was aware that New York City had become “the abortion mill of the country” as a result of New York's law legalizing abortion, The Rabbinical Council is an Orthodox group and, as such, has opposed liberalized abortions. Mr. Blumenthal, who pioneered in obtaining enactment of the law, asserted that the city was “no longer the abortion mill of the world” because abortion had been legalized in this state and elsewhere in the nation. He said he had led the “five‐year‐long fight” for New York's law because “we found too many women dying after abortions outside of hospitals.” ‘No Musical Solution Mr. Blumenthal stressed the importance of the survival of the city's “62 very different neighborhoods” at the Rabbinical Council meeting and later at a meeting of the Black Baptist Ministers Conference at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church, 145th Street and Convent Avenue. “Somebody has been very good at putting us at each other's throats,” Mr. Blumenthal told the rabbinical group. He added that he had “no magical solutions,” but believed the “tragedy of community set against community” could be solved. Discussing the same subject before the black Baptist ministers, Mr. Blumenthal said he believed his 10 years as an Assemblyman—four of them as minority leader—had proved It that he was “tough and honest” and and able to find a way to maintain the separate communities as places for “the kind of life that allows us to enjoy life.” In a “position paper” issued during the afternoon, Mr. Blumenthal, who believes the race a has narrowed to one between him and Controller Abraham D. Beame, called for measures to improve the city's fiscal system. They included mobilization of state and Congressional delegations to obtain more funds, improved management of revenues, and more efficiency and coordination among city departments.  EDITH EVANS ASBURY Experience Issue Cited by Beame At the Rabbinical Council meeting, Mr. Beame described his mayoral opponents as Johnny Come Latelies” to the kind of experience with city problems that he has had in the last 25 years as Budget Director and Controller. “There is a mistaken notion of what the Controller's job is, and some of my opponents ought to know it,” Mr. Beanie said. He acknowledged later that he was referring to Mr. Blumenthal, who has been stepping up his campaign against the Controller. On Sunday, Mr. Blumenthal referred to Mr. Beame as an “accountant who has failed to be accountable” and criticized some of the investments of the city's $6.2billion pension fund, of which Mr. Beanie is executive officer. A spokesman for Mr. Beanie said Mr. Blumenthal had also been dealing in “half‐truths” and making “totally misleading statements” when he said recently that the pension fund now yielded an annual return of 5.19 per cent. The spokesman pointed out that when Mr. Beanie became Controller in 1970, the pension money was invested in City bonds yielding a 3.4 per cent annual return. At Mr. Beame's urging, legislation was passed allowing the city to reinvest the bonds and amortize the losses over a period of time. Mr. Beame's aide said the funds had bees reinvested and were now yielding “well over 7 per cent.” At the rabbinical meeting Mr. Beame repeated his belie that all city employes shoulc live within the city limits. HI said he favored having a lay to this effect, although he saic that it should apply only tA new employes. He conceded that it would be too difficul for those who now lived out side the city to be forced to move back, but suggested tha they could be offered incen tives to do so. DEIRDRE CARMODY Biaggi Encouraged By Longshoremen Mario Biaggi started his cam paign day at 7 A.M. with ar appearance at the Waterfron, Commission hiring hall at 60t1 Street and Third Avenue in tha Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. The Democratic candidate was immediately surrounded by several thousand enthusiastic longshoremen shouting messages of encouragement and support—""You're fighting good, Mario, you gotta fight harder,” “You're the only decent guy running; the others are nothing,” “Don't worry, you're in, Mario, you're in. When Mr. Biaggi entered the hall, crowded because it was slow day on the docks, the first shouted question came from Leonard Santise. “You gonna do any better than the Mayor we got now?” “One hundred per cent better,” Mr. Biaggi said. Since the candidate had not asked permission to make a campaign appearance, he was soon asked to leave by Ray Layden, the manager. Outside, he was mobbed again as thel, men crowded’ around him to, shake his hand, seek autographs and exchange Italian phrases. He's the Man’ His popularity among the men appeared nearly unanimous. “With all his faults, I still think he's the man for the job,” said Anthony Diorio. In his appearance at the Rabbinical Council forum, Mr. Biaggi told the Orthodox rabbi of his strong belief that the city's neighborhoods could be maintained with adequate services. The candidate, wearing a yarmulke he had borrowed from Rabbi Jacob We,ndroff of Queens Village, a supporter, also said that the responsibility for failures in things like the criminal‐justice system lay with the Mayor. “There's an old saying, ‘The fish stinks from the head,” he remarked. One of the rabbis asked Mr. Biaggi how the public's response to him had been since the disclosure that he had refused to answer questions before a grand jury despite his repeated denials in the past that he had done so. “Excellent, it's been excellent,” the Congressman replied. “They're giving me many, many notes of encouragement. And let's remember, nobody says did anything wrong. If there was an error in judgment, it was an error of the heart” PAUL L. MONTGOMERY Badillo Visits Scene of Dispute Representative Herman Badillo moved’ into the controversy between residents of Brooklyn's Northside area and a factory that wants to displace them so it can expand. Walking through the area, which is bedecked with “Save Our Homes” signs, Mr. Badillo stopped at Bedford Avenue and Third Streit to talk with Nicholas Geniale, owner of the gorthside Private Car Service, one of the private businesses the city officials have said would have to go for the factory's expansion. “They just come along and hand you a paper and say: Out,” Mr. Geniale said. “What are we, dogs? I'm not getting ut ofor , nobody. I'm going to stay.” Mr. Badillo then went across the street to talk with the management of the company, the S & S Corrugated Paper Machinery Corporation. The company said it was willing to negotiate its expansion and Mr. Badillo said that city officials, in their rush to save an industry, had not consulted the community properly. “During the four years was Commissioner of Relocation,” said Mr. Badillo, who held that post under Mayor Robert F. Wagner, “we didn't have to evict a single person.” Earlier Mr. Badillo said at the gathering of rabbis that one of his most difficult jobs was to “overcome the stereotype of the Puerto Rican community..’ He said that Puerto Ricans came in all sizes and from all’ backgrounds. He told the rabbis that his own background was Spanish and Italian and that his wife was Jewish. During the luncheon meeting, Mr. Badillo toyed with the tuna‐fish salad and American cheese sandwiches in front of him on a paper plate. “I'm from Puerto Rico,” he said later as he drove his car to the next stop, “and I can't eat sandwiches. In the Latin tradition, when we sit down, we sit down to eat a real meal.” DAVID BIRD Shaw Assails Rose And Blumenthal J. Stanley Shaw, who is seeking the Liberal party mayoral nomination, last night attacked the “strange alliance” between Alex Rose, the Liberal party leader, and Assemblyman Blumenthal, Mr. Rose's choice for the Liberal nomination. Mr. Shaw, in a speech prepared for delivery at a West Side Tenants Association meeting at St. Gregory's Church on West 96th Street, noted that Mr. Blumenthal was a member, of the New Democratic Coalition, which has opposed political bossism, and asserted that Mr. Rose completely dominated the Liberal party. Mr. Shaw also demanded equal time from WNBC‐TV because he was not invited to appear at a joint interview of the four Democratic mayoral candidates, including Mr. Blumenthal, Sunday. Mr. Shaw, who is also the Queens Liberal chairman, contended that he should have been invited because Mr. Blumenthal is running in the Liberal primary as well as the Democratic primary. Bar Group Rates Contenders for D.A. Frank S. Hogan won a rating of “outstandingly qualified” from the New York County Lawyers Association; his opponent for the Democratic nomination for Manhattan District Attorney, William J. vanden Heuvel, was rated as “qualified.” The rating for Mr. vanden Heuvel, however, which was voted at a lengthy meeting of the association's board of directors, was higher than that recommended by the association's Committee on the Judiciary. The committee, in what Mr. vanden Heuvel termed “political charges,” had found Mr. vanden Heuvel “unqualified.” Although the committee's finding was not announced publicly, it was apparently based on two grounds: Mr. vanden Heuvel's lack of experience in criminal law and the allegedly “misleading” nature of some of his campaign statements."
The Nixon Commission,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/16/archives/the-nixon-commission.html,"President Nixon has moved rather swiftly from insisting that no one in his Administration was involved the Watergate scandals to asserting that people in both parties have always engaged in such scandalous behavior. As part of his effort to diffuse the responsibility as broadly as possible, Mr. Nixon now plans to urge Congress to establish a commission to study campaign ethics, political finance, Electoral College reform, and various related topics and to report back in nine months. Study commissions as a device for evasion and delay have been much too frequently indulged ‘in by this and previous Administrations. A ritual has evolved which includes the search for a prestigious chairman and a nice balance among the other members, the recruitment of chief counsel and additional staff, the holding of public hearings, the preparation of a lengthy report with more or less learned appendices, the acceptance of the report by the President in a well‐photographed meeting in the oval office—and then the silence of oblivion. Since there are occasional violations of this ritual when recommendations are actually acted upon, total cynicism is not in order. But President Nixon's record with regard to. commissions is notably bad. He early rejected the report of a Cabinet committee headed by George Shultz recommending abolition of fuel oil import quotas. He Publicly rejected the recommendation of the Commission on Drug Abuse chaired by former Governor Shafer of Pennsylvania, which urged the decriminalization of marijuana. He rejected the advice of the Commission on Population chaired by John D. Rockefeller 3d with regard to abortion and birth control education. During the Cambodia‐Kent State crisis when campuses were exploding with protest, Mr. Nixon named Chancellor Alexander Heard of Vanderbilt University and President James E. Cheek of Howard University as his co‐advisers on campus unrest. When they submitted their final report two months later, he stamped it “file and forget.” (Incidentally, Mr. Heard was chairman the President's [Kennedy] Commission on Campaign Costs a decade ago.) Since Mr. Nixon has been consistently unsympathetic to campaign reform, any prospective members who agreed to serve on this commission would be on notice that they were proceeding at their own risk. In any event, nine months are scarcely necessary for this task. As Senator Mansfield observed, sixty days would be a more reasonable time. The central issue the balance between public and private financing campaigns. There are those who favor the status quo in which private money is in control and those who favor complete public financing. In between, there are those who favor various kinds of public assistance for candidates with corresponding restraints on the size of private contributions. Since any commission would in all likelihood be divided on this issue, the appropriate committees Congress are in the end going to strike their own balance. If President Nixon wishes to make a contribution to Congress's thinking on campaign practices, he could do so on the basis of his own experience in his many campaigns for the House, the Senate, the governorship of California, and the Presidency. This is one subject which has been studied enough."
ABORTION RULES REVISED BY CITE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/16/archives/abortion-rules-revised-by-city-guidelines-minus-force-of-law.html,"The city's Board of Health yesterday scrapped Its regulations governing early abortions and replaced them with a series of guidelines that, while Incorporating the main provisions of the regulations, lack the force of law. The move was necessitated by the United States Supreme Court decision last January or abortion that prohibited states from interfering with a woman's right to obtain an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. The decision has been interpreted to mean that any law, other than one requiring the abortion to be performed by a physician, would be unconstitutional. The original regulations were incorporated into the city's Health Code in October, 1970, three and a half months after the state's abortion law was liberalized. Among other things, the regulations prohibited the performance of abortions in doctors’ offices and established standards of safety for abortion clinics. One Provision Remains The only mandatory city provisions now remaining are that abortions be done only by licensed physicians and that pregnancy ‐termination certificates and related data be filed with the Health Department. The new guidelines suggest that abortions be done only by physicians qualified in obstetrics and gynecology, or under the supervision of such physicians. They also state tut abortions should be performed only where facilities, equipment and staff are adequate to deal with emergencies and only if there is a formal agreement with a hosptial to serve as a backup. Beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy, the guideletes say, abortions should be performed only in a hospital setting. Gordon Chase, Health Services Administrator, said that the guidelines, while lacking the force of law, would carry weight in ,malpractice actions and in determining acceptable quality of care for Medicaid payments. Last week, Mr. Chase announced that, since the Supreme Court ruling, the number of nonresidents seeking bortions in the city had dropped by 15 to 20 per cent."
Rhode Island Abortion Law Is Declared Unconstitutional,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/17/archives/rhode-island-abortion-law-is-declared-unconstitutional.html,"PROVIDENCE, R.I., May 16 (AP) — Rhode Island's law against abortions, adopted two months ago, was declared unconstitutional today by Chief Judge Raymond J. Pettine in United States District Court. Gov. Philip Noel said the state would seek a stay of the decision pending the outcome of an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston. The abortion statute bans all abortions except those deemed necessary to save the life of the mother. To avoid the provisions of a United States Supreme Court ruling that led to the invalidation of the state's old law, the new measure declares that human life begins at conception, giving the fetus constitutional protection of life."
Candidates',https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/17/archives/blumenthal-critical-of-funds-for-beame-candidates-day.html,"Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal said yesterday that an analysis of $90,996 contributed to Controller Abraham D. Beame's campaign for Mayor showed that more than half came from real‐estate interests that would, therefore, dominate Mr. Beame, should he be elected Mayor. With such a large proportion of campaign funds‐54 per cent—coming from one industry, it would be impossible for Mr. Beame to be an independent Mayor who would fight for the repeal of the vacancy decontrol law and continuation of rent stabilization, Mr. Blumenthal told a mayoral candidates forum of the Council of Churches of the City of New York. Mr. Beame, asked for comment on Mr. Blumenthal's statements, said: “Mr. Blumenthal should know what the people of New York City know — that I have always been independent. He hasn't kept up with the people of New York. The two men are running against each other and two other candidates — Representatives Herman Badillo and Mario Biaggi — for the Democratic nomination for Mayor in the June 4 primary. Father‐in‐Law Helps Mr. Blumenthal, asked about his own campaign contributors, said that “one or two very minor contributions” had come from real‐estate interests. The largest single contribution he received was $10,000 from his father‐in‐law, Leslie Winik, maker of sports films, Mr. Blumenthal said. ‘ On April 19 Mr. Beame released a financial statement showing campaign contributions. Mr, Blumenthal released a financial statement April 15 showing contributions totaling $114,161.78. Mr. Blumenthal told the Church Council meeting that if elected he would declare moratorium on further demolition of sound housing. “The city is the biggest blockbuster in the city,” he asserted, guilty of destroying existing scarce housing, which he said led to the destruction of neighborhoods. At the close of the meeting, at 475 Riverside Drive, George Duff, president of the council, said to Mr. Blumenthal: “The council thanks you very much for all you have done for abortion. Sometimes we forget we have had some constructive things done.” Rally Held at College During the afternoon, Mr. Blumenthal appeared at a rally held by his supporters at Brooklyn College's Student Union Building in Flatbush. One of the students asked what he would do, if elected Mayor, about the parking problem at Brooklyn College. “You had to ask that, didn't you?” Mr. Blumenthal said with a wry grin. Then he went on to say that wider use of improved and subsidized public transportation was the best answer to all parking problems. “Nobody should go to school in one‐person cars,” he admonished the students. “You (have to exercise the same kind of self‐control we ask of commuters.” EDITH EVANS ASBURY 9 Conservatives Repudiate Biaggi William F. Buckley Jr. and eight other prominent members of the Conservative party, including two officials of the I party's county organization, yesterday withdrew their support of Representative Biaggi as the Conservative candidate Ifor Mayor. A statement drafted by Mr. Buckley, a mayoral candidate in 1965, said that he and other former Conservative party candidates for office “support the position” taken by the party's leadership on Mr. Biaggi. On Monday, J. Daniel Mahoney, state chairman of the ‘Conservative party, and two other top state party leaders repudiated Mr. Biaggi, while five others reaffirmed their support for the Conservative candidate, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, too. “We believe that the Conservative party's historical contribution is to a better politics which are not served by any candidate who seeks to deceive the voters,” the statement said, referring to the current controversy over Mr. Biaggi's refusal to answer questions asked by grand jury despite his continued assurances that he had answered all questions. The two county officials of the party, Michael Canning and Karen Furey, “demanded” in a statement that the party remove Mr. Biaggi's name from the Conservative line “on grounds of fraud.” Statement Is Derided Asserting that the statements of the county chairmen, Henry Middendorf of New York County, and Thomas F. Cronin of the Bronx, supporting Mr. Biaggi were “a joke,” the officials complained that other officials and members of the party were not consulted “before a decision to sink’ with Biaggi was announced.” Mr. Cronin “wasn't even straightforward enough to. disqualify himself because of his patent conflict of interest,” they declared, referring to the Broux chairman's “fat‐salaried” ($17,100) position on Mr. Biaggi's Congressional payroll. Mr. Buckley's statement was signed by him and Paul L. (Adams, candidate for Governor in 1966 and 1970; Assemblywoman Rosemary Gunning, the only Conservative in the Legislature and a candidate for City Council President in 1965. Also signing were David H. Jaquith, candidate for Governor in 1962; Leo J. Kesselring) candidate for Attorney General in 1970; Ed1ward F. Leonard, candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1970, and Hugh R. Markey, candidate for City Controller in 1965. RUDY JOHNSON Antipoverty Plot Charged by Badillo Representative Badillo charged yesterday that the Nixon Administration was “dismantling"" the antipoverty program of the Office of Economic Opportunity in this area despite a Fedefal Court ruling that it be continued at least through June 30. He said the dismantling was being carried nut under the supervision of Louis P. Wein, a 31‐year‐old consultant to the O.E.O., “whose sole qualification is the fact that he managed campaigns for unsuccessful Republican candidates.” The charges were denied by Angel F. Rivera, director of the agency's Northeastern Regional Office, which covers New York State. He said he began to phase out the program at the direction of his Washington office late in January, but reversed the process after the court order and was financing antipoverty programs as usual. Mr. Wein said that as a consultant to the agency he had advised on dismantling during that process but was now advising on other activities. He said that he was well qualified for the job and that Mr. Badillo was “trying to further his candidacy for Mayor.” Legislation Planned Mr. Badillo disclosed that he was preparing legislation to continue programs of the Office of Economic Opportunity during the fiscal year beginning July 1. Without this legislation, he said, the antipoverty program would end on June 30. The Congressman, an aspirant for the Democratic mayoral nomination, made his charge at his campaign headquarters after exchanging endorsements and praises with Arnold Segarra, who seeks the Democratic nomination for Manhattan Councilman at Large. He told a mayoral forum of the Council of. Churches of the City of New York at the Interchurch Center, 475 Riverside Drive, that one of his main concerns as Mayor would be to try to create a new middle class from the poor to add to the present middle class. THOMAS P. RONAN Two Union Locals Support Beame Two A.F.L.‐C.I.O. locals, representing 17,300 members who are residents of the city, yesterday announced their support of Controller Beame for Mayor. The labor groups were the International Union and Local 1153 of the Office and Professional Employes and the United Optical Workers Union. John Kelly, secretary‐treasurer of Local 153, said that Mr. Beame's election as Mayor was “essential to the revitalization of New York.” Sebastian J. Rebaldo, business manager of the Optical Workers union said: “It is clear that Abe Beame is the overwhelming chloice of New York City's working men and women. He will make a first rate mayor based on his record of performance in city government.”"
A revisionist view of female sexuality,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/20/archives/our-bodies-ourselves-a-revisionist-view-of-female-sexuality-a-book.html,"The essential astonishing revelation to come out of the women's‐liberation movement is that American middle‐class college‐educated women feel crushed under the boot of male tyranny. Throughout the 1950's we had been hearing from the psychiatric sages that American women were overaggressive and competitive, castrators in the world of work as well as in the home. Their rampant “Momism” was driving American men to homosexuality and worse—a passion for milk and ice cream, clearly symptomatic of infantile addiction to the breast. Then suddenly in the 1960's women talked back: they were feeling worthless and powerless, mere sex objects, child‐bearers and domestic slaves in and out of the office. They saw themselves as victims of the oppressive male construct that biology is destiny. “We have lived our lives as if there was something intrinsically inferior about us,” reads one of the early sentences of “Our Bodies, Ourselves,” a feminist sex and health book. The statement serves as a kind of underlying revolutionary rallying cry to the contents of the book—most of it down‐toearth, rudimentary information about sexuality, female physiology, child‐bearing, birth control, abortion, menopause, venereal disease, nutrition and exercise. But the book is intended to be more than an updated self‐help document in its field —it is issued as a manifesto stating that women are taking a step toward throwing off their chains by daring to think about and write down their own version of their bodily ex The writers essentially responsible for the project are 12 educated women in their twenties and thirties who are or have been married or have lived in long‐term relationships with men. They found that they were not “totally fulfilled” by Elenore Lester is a freelance writer who teaches courses on the images of woman and the new arts at New York University. these relationships or motherhood or by “a ‘typically feminine job.” Many other women also contributed to the book by offering their thoughts and feelings and helping with the research. In ‐an introductory chapter the authors describe, with some pathos, how their culture led them to feel like passive objects, exclusively wives and mothers, but how their collective efforts to learn more about their bodies made them feel “exhilarated and energized” and in time able to elevate themselves to the point at which they could think of undertaking a “'male’ productoriented activity.” They would write this book. The work they have produced is in some respects useful manual, gathering together a variety of information, a good part of which is available in individual articles in women's mass circulation magazines, medical pamphlets and books. A bibliography at the end of each chapter includes feminist‐oriented evaluations. The book offers a thorough rundown on contraception and is sensible in its discussion of abortion, venereal disease, childbearing and the orgasm. It incorporates a revisionist view of female sexuality, that is a positive attitude toward the clitoral orgasm, masturbation, abortion, bisexual experience, but is somewhat chary of nonmonogamous relationships—""We have come to value long‐term commit However, the book sends up no revolutionary flares. On the contrary, it seems oddly reactionary in its effort to anchor woman firmly in her physiological being and bolster her in what is apparently seen as the eternal, totally absorbing and momentous task of keeping the life cycle going. The book is replete with ringing affirmations about women's feelings and capacities and with right‐on. pictures and diagrams of women and their parts sprawled on the gynecological table, with women assertively and smilingly involved in the reproductive process or in attempting to thwart that ess. (It is clear that the ultimate goal of thwarting that process is the production of better families—""But we and our children fare better when conception chosen freely out of a desire for a child to love and care for, and not as means to fulfill other needs.”) Despite the nutrition charts and the exercise routines and the laughing women in groups, one finally gets the sense that some desperate masochism is at work here, with women telling one another that they are being given this information so that they can go about their traditional business with more knowledge and more grand cheer. “In no way do we want to become men,” the writers state as if there were some imminent danger that this could happen. And they seem to feel that serious and “sustained work on a tangible product” is a form of male activity that they can engage in only at great risk. They express their satisfaction that they have managed to come through the book project without having “sacrificed the quality of our relationships with one another the way men often do when they work together.” Perhaps it is fear of creating negative interpersonal vibrations that leads the women to get their message across to one another and to their readers in a manner that is undoubtedly intended to be warm, feminine and reassuring, but that too often lapses into baby talk and pseudo‐primitive homilies: “I am aware that I am responsible to other human beings—my parents, my husband, my children, my friends. What greater responsibility is there?” “As women we often find ourselves responsible for the diet of others, especially children.” “In lovemaking I have come to take great pleasure in taking a passive role as long as I actively choose it.... It is wonderful to know that there is time to both give and receive love and caresses.” “Now that I exercise, I'm happier about my body. It acts and reacts in ways that please me.” Readers who are not allergic to this style of communication can undoubtedly glean a good deal of solid information from the content of some of the chapters. And others may enjoy the sharing experience afforded by folksy woman‐to‐woman anecdotes about abortions, hysterectomies, pregnancies, Caesarians, vaginal infections, natural childbirths, post‐partum depressions, side‐effects of the pill, dilations and curettage, gynecological examinations and uncertainties about whether or not to have children. The question arises, however, how involved can any individual be come in this morass and still have time or energy for the world outside the pelvis. Hopefully, one turns to the chapter on lesbians, written by A separate collective of gas women, and titled “In Amerika They Call Us Dykes.” (Other countries have more flattering terms?) One looks forward to hearing from some vigorous, independent women whose energies are not being sapped by physiological processes. No luck. This particular group of gay women seems as closed off from vital activity as heterosexual women. As they tell it, their creativity is totally absorbed by forming and dissolving relationships, setting up gay dances at which they don't have to put up with the insults of the straight world and in writing execrable pseudo‐poetics: “The earth trembles before our collision as we walk a path this side of loneliness, this side of what can be known through words alone—that side of revolution and madness—and ev It is disheartening. The women blame their middle‐class backgrounds for programming Them into being objects, wanting to fail or “walk a fine line between success and failure,” but if Veblen were alive today he would have to be amazed and touched at the degree to which these young American middle‐class women have fallen into futility and despair, justifying his analysis of their marginal position in society. With wistful triumph they catalogue their new‐found “liberated” accomplishments—they can do karate, paddle a canoe, handle tools, climb a mountain, print a batik, and one woman has had the ingenuity to design a front‐to‐back zipper for the crotch of her pants to enable her to urinate standing up! Even these small gains are precariously held: “We are forever. fighting a constant, inner struggle to give up and become weak, dependent, and helpless again.” And in the book, which represents their effort to reach into the “task oriented” world they see as male, they program themselves toward more efficient sex role Has society really cast the middle class woman into so deep a pit that even in trying to claw her way out she digs in deeper? Or are the women themselves involved in some game by which they can decry the sexual status quo, even while reinforcing it? I don't know, but it is curious that after a century of feminism, and in the guise of liberation, this Boston collective has come the long way round back to the “feminine mystique” of the psychiatrized fifties and embraced the idea that biology is indeed destiny.

"Despite Couit Ruling, Problems Persist in Gaining Abortions",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/20/archives/despite-court-ruling-problems-persist-in-gaining-abortions.html,"PHILADELPHIA, May 19—Nearly four months after the Supreme Court struck down restrictive abortion laws, women In many areas of the country still find that terminating a pregnancy means leaving their home state, paying high prices or running the risk of exploitation by commercial referral services. At the same time, greatly eased restrictions in many urban areas have meant that fewer women travel elsewhere for an abortion. Clinics in New York are cutting back their operations and some reportedly may close down. The pattern varies, but there are indications that the “better” abortion clinics — those that provide the best care at the lowest cost—are the ones facing the most serious financial problems because, generally, they do not compete for abortion business. Depending on what part of the country she is in, a woman can pay from about $125 to $500 for an early‐term abortion. In many places, there is open competition among agencies advertising solutions to “problem pregnancies.” And there is almost no regulation. In Philadelphia, for example, “abortions are being sold like soap or shoes,” according to Susan Weiss, a 31‐year‐old feminist who is president of the board of directors of Women's Medical Services, Inc., an abortion and gynecological clinic with three doctors on its staff. Mrs. Weiss says her clinic, regarded as one of the best run and least expensive in Pennsylvania, faces financial problems because it has refused to ally itself with commercial referral services or to advertise. “But now we've hired an ad agency and we're trying to work out the best approach,” she said. “Everyone is sick about it. Nobody likes doing it, but we're going to have to do it to stay in business.” Fee Set at $160 Similarly financially troubled, but to a more advanced degree, is thee Philadelphia Family Planning clinic, which is also run along what woman activists regard as model lines—providing, besides the abortion procedure itself, a wide range of counseling and free after‐care, if necessary, for a single moderate fee. Both clinics charge $160 for an abortion for a woman through‐the first three months of pregnancy. After that, the wornn'is referred to a hospital because a more elaborate procedure is required for later pregnancies. All services attendant to the abortion are included in the fee, including counseling, after‐care, and, if needed, an injection of Rho Gam, required by about 15 per cent of abortion patients who have Rh‐negative blood. By contrast, an abortion arranged through a referral service might cost up to $275 for a first‐term, outpatient procedure, with an additional charge of $35 for Rho Gam, if needed, and possibly charges for anesthesia or other items. For a woman seeking an abortion, the situation now varies greatly from state to state, and even from city to city within a state. Thus, a woman wanting an abortion in New York City can get it readily and for a fee of about $125 for an early pregnancy. Resistance in Utah But if she lives in Utah or Indiana, for example, she will probably have to leave the state. Resistance in Utah stems largely from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints, which owns and operates most hospitals in the state and exercises considerable political power. Mormons believe life begins with conception and an aborted fetus cannot have a full existence in heaven. In Arkansas, as another example, “any woman can get an abortion if she wants it—and is rich,” according to Marilyn Criner, a counselor with the Arkansas Women's Rights, Inc. State law requires all abortions to be done in a hospital, and the result is that fees run to about $500 for a first trimester abortion. Women's groups thus refer most women seeking an abortion to out‐of‐state clinics, primarily to those in New York. Despite such referrals, the abortion business in New York is “hardly a business any more,” according to Dr. Michael Truppin, a Manhattan gynecologist. Services Cut Down Large clinics dependent on referrals from out of state have cut down on their services. Women's Services, on East 61st Street in New York now operates four days a week instead of seven; Eastern Women's Services also now provides abortions just four days a week. Even so, New York remains the center for abortion activity, in part because of the price. In the Detroit area, for instance, more than a dozen abortion clinics are operating, but because of varying quality of the medical service and high costs for late pregnancy abortions, many women are still being referred to clinics in New York. The state says it cannot regulate the quality of the clinics because to do so.would violate what it interprets as the Court's ruling of noninterference with early term abortions. Most Detroit clinics charge about $150 for an abortion in the first three months but inpatient procedure for an abortion in the second three months can cost as high as $1,000, including doctors’ fee. Even with air fare, it is cheaper to come to New York. At the same time, Michigan's commercial referral services are reincorporating as nonprofit groups and, instead of sending clients out of state, are opening their own clinics—a practice that means a referral service can effectively advertise its own services, then refer women to its own clinics, thus circumventing the ban on advertising by hospitals or clinics. There are now five “fret, standing” abortion clinics—those not affiliated with a hospital—in Philadelphia. Several hospitals in the area also perform abortions, the larger ones on a limited basis. At least two small private hospitals that do a number of abortions appear to rely heavily on referrals from commercial services. The fees for a referral by a commercial agency vary. In some cases, it might be $25, but previous practice indicates that a referral to a New York clinic might net the service as much as $50, or in some instances, even $100. Often, the referral fee is simply included in the “package” cost of an abortion, with the woman having no idea how much she is paying for the referral. At least a half‐dozen commercial referral agencies operate in Philadelphia. Some receive support from the facilities they refer clients to, others charge a flat fee. Pennsylvania and most other states have no laws regulating the referral services. There is no legislation pending here to control them, nor could any state agency be found that seemed interested in such regulation. The names of abortion facilities are available without charge through several agencies in the area. Some will arrange appointments without charge. A woman seeking an abortion is considerably, more likely to run across the name of a commercial referral service, however, because they are heavily advertised throughout Philadelphia on billboards, in newspapers and in the Yellow Pages. One agency has two listings under different names, which increases its chances of being called. Another is opening its own clinic. The whole question of abortion in Pennsylvania ‐which has a fairly large number of Roman Catholics—“is a political hot potato [and] nobody wants to deal with it,” according to a spokesnian for the state's consumer protection agency. Moreover, the position of the state medical society remains unchanged by the Supreme Court's decision. According to John Rineman, executive vice president of the society, that position is “that the society does not condone abortion on demand.” Instead, it maintains that the older guidelines —which are advisory, not mandatory, for member physicians—should be followed. Basically, these are that a doctor should berform an abortion only when the mental or physical health of the mother might be impaired, in cases of inecst or rape, and even under these circumstances only with the concurrence of two other physicians. Across the country, feelings about abortion continue to run high, and opponents have been fighting the loosening of restriction with renewed zeal and in many areas with telling effect. In St. Louis, City Attorney Brendan Ryan has threatened to arrest any physician who performs an abortion. One result, according to Lawrence Lader, chairman of the National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws, is that the association's new abortion clinic there has lost the services of its doctor. The association has sought an injunction against the city attorney to restrain him from going through with the threat. In Green Bay, Wis., Mr. Lader reports, the association has brought suit in Federal court alleging that the Methodist hospital there has refused to perform abortions under pressure from two other hospitals in the city, both Roman Catholic. Altogether, Mr. Lader said, the association is going to court against 10 public hospitals in 10 states to force them to provide abortion services—a step that would be difficult under provisions of a proposed Federal measure that would assure hospitals the right to refuse to perform abortions and still receive Federal funds. The measure has passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 1 and is being considered by the House. A half‐dozen state legislatures have already adopted such provisions, and similar proposals are pending in a score of others. Also proposed are several constitutional amendments that would either outlaw abortions or leave the matter to the states."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/23/archives/room-at-the-bottom-too-books-of-the-times-artist-as-calculator.html,"In “The Queen of a Distant Country, John Braine has postulated a novelist who pours everything into his work and has nothing left for the ordinary purposes of humanity. Then he unreasonably asks us to take an interest in the fellow, which is rather like calling a father in from the hospital waiting room and putting the placenta, instead of the baby, into his arms. If Tom Metfield is the archetype of the writer, then we all ought to lay down our pens. Once the best known of Britain's “Angry Young Men,” Mr. Braine has become a complacent old hen. His latest novel consists, for the most part, of a clutch of dogeared dogmatisms about writing and it reads as if believes them. Though Tom Metfield averages £30,000 year from his book, nobody, even in these inflationary times, would give a penny for his thoughts. He believes, for example, that the better the novelist, the duller his personal life. The practice of any art, he contends, destroys personality. This, naturally, would include Dostoyevsky, Melville, Tolstoy, Flaubert—or, for that matter, Picasso, Rembrandt and Goya. Artist as Calculator A writer, according to our best‐selling Mr. Metfield, will betray anything if he can put it to use in his books. In one of his livelier moments, he calculates that when a girl spat in his face, it was worth £2,000 in print. Mr. Braine's hero is the unremarkable son of a shopkeeper in a small town. His only distinguishing feature, at first, is the fact that he is “hooked on reality.” We are told that he sees things with a particular vividness, though there is little evidence of it. When we met him, he wasting his vividness in amateurish stories, until he meets Miranda Abberwick. (How's that for a literary name?) Now in her middle 40's, Miranda once wrote a daring best‐seller. But she never recovered from the failure of her next two novels, and now she is a Machiavellian creative‐writing teacher, who with a few quick strokes of the blue pencil can render anything publishable. She soon becomes Tom's literary mother, teaching him to eat his spinach and wear long pants. She advises him against fiction because he knows nothing about people, and apprentices him to the inanimate for the next 10 years. Under her guidance, he becomes a successful columnist for The New Statesman. He uses his environment as his subject, describing the ambiance of towns, apparently, for a whole decade. You might say he is the modern equivalent.. of Cobbett's “rural rides.” Tom's sole venture into interpersonal relations is an affair, at 19, with Cora—which earns her an abortion and him beating from her father. Neither the affair, the abortion or the beating seems to make much of an impression on the neophyte writer, who is about as lively as flat pint of bitter. It is only when Miranda “betrays” him with Ralph—who tosses her like a coin in an attempt to decide whether he is homosexual or heterosexual—that Tom finds his true métier, as they say. He feels “dirtied irretrievably” and as if he had somehow “lost his manhood.” However, this has a forced ring, for he himself has never made a pass at Miranda and it is a bit late in the day for a primal scene. In any case, Tom sulks off to London for a life of cozy narcissism. He can't wait to “use” Miranda in his first novel, just as he has used her all along. And here Mr. Braine asks us to believe that his little nonentity puts so much truth and passion into his story that it is an instant success. One that is followed by another success each year. Shuns Family Involvement When Tom, who marries, is divorced, his work, not his wife's lover, is the real correspondent. He resolves never to see his young son again, because to do this would be to become involved—and as we all know, the writer must wander lonely as a cloud. Besides, our novelist already has a marvelous life, as he keeps telling us. We know nothing about it, just as we know nothing about his books. We do have a description of his house and his clothes, however, and even these are difficult to reconcile with his reputation as a “serious” writer. While many a girl has failed to make so much as a dent, a red‐haired one named Deirdre opens a crack in Tom's facade. He begins to think of his little stepsister whom he once dandled on his knee—and who was the only one who liked his stories at the time. He envies a friend's full‐blown domesticity. He begins to ruminate on Miranda, like a man sticking his finger down his throat to bring up something he can't digest. He goes to see Miranda and discovers that she has become a Communist, a party poop and parrot who attacks him for his indulgence in decadent “private sensations.” And there we leave him, maundering about “waking from the dream to seize the pen from the bedside,” hesitating because ‘the truth takes me too deep.” Though his first novel was not as brilliant as it was timely, Mr. Braine was better when he was an Angry Young Man. Perhaps when he reads the reviews of “The Queen of a Distant Country,” he'll become an angry middle‐aged man. It may do him good."
HOSPITAL EASES ABORTION POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/25/archives/hospital-easesabortion-policy-pickets-fail-to-deter-move-in.html,"ATLANTIC CITY, May 24—While at least 500 pickets proitested outside, the Atlantic City Hospital Board of Governors announced last night that the hospital would begin to allow abortions during the first three months of pregnancy if approved by the woman's physician. The pickets included 35 Roman Catholic priests, 30 nuns and some Protestant clergymen. The decision made Atlantic City Hospital the first in south Jersey to liberalize its abortion policy in the face of massive protests mounted by the New Jersey Citizens United for Life. Underwood Memorial Hospital in Woodbury liberalized its policy earlier this month, but did not put it into effect after similar protests. The hospital policy change was the result of the United States Supreme Court decision that held that no state could forbid an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy where the woman's decision to have an abortion is concurred in by her physician. The hospital board said in a statement: “The board affirms that human life is sacred but recognizes that different groups have varying beliefs as to when human life begins. Since life is sacred no single rule is applicable in every situation. The board believes that a prohibition may result in abortions being performed in facilities not meeting the standards of an accredited hospital. “It wishes to assure the community that there will be no abortion on demand or solicitation. There will be no abortion mill.”"
PLAN FOR ABORTIONS SET IN CONNECTICUT,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/25/archives/plan-for-abortions-set-in-connecticut.html,"HARTFORD, May 24—Without an abortion law and without a chance of getting one in the twilight days of the 1973 session of the General Assembly, Connecticut will attempt to control abortions by public health regulations, Health Commissioner Franklin M. Foote said today. Twice last year, a three‐judge Federal court in Hartford struck down the state's abortion laws, the first of them 112 years old and among the strictest in the country. The General Assembly passed the second law last May, even more strict than the old one, allowing abortion only to save the woman's “physical” life. That was struck down by the Federal court in Hartford last September. In April, the United States Supreme Court refused to rehear the case. Under the regulations proposed by Commissioner Foote and approved last night by the Public Health Council, abortions would be allowed in the first three months of pregnancy when performed by a licensed physician with the consent of the pregnant woman. In the second three months, the abortion would have to be performed in a state‐approved medical facility. In the final three months, it could be performed only to safeguard the life or health of the woman."
Housewife With a Flair for Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/27/archives/housewife-with-a-flair-for-politics-complicating-factors-womans.html,"At a recent political fundraising party, Gloria Steinem, the women's lib leader, told her audience: “You've all got to give money and tell your friends to give. It'll be worth it to see the expression on Mr. Steingut's face when Helen wins.” The 27‐year‐old Robert S. Steingut and Helen Polonsky are the major contenders in the crowded race for the Brooklyn Councilman‐atLarge seat being vacated by Ruth Lerner, who seeks the Democratic nomination for Brooklyn Borough President. The other contenders are Myrtle Whitmore, Louis W. Pownser, John C. DiGiovanna and Arthur J. McCarthy. While Mrs. Polonsky won the endorsement of the Kings County Democratic Coalition, the Reform organization in Brooklyn, Mr. Steingut is the regular party candidate and son of Stanley Steingut, State Assembly minority leader and former Brooklyn Democratic county chairman. “My father — a retired blue‐collar worker — is as great as Bobby Steingut's,” noted Mrs. Polonsky, a 37‐year‐old houewife and former teacher who has been active in Brooklyn politics for 10 years. “But I'm running on my own accomplishments.” Complicating Factors In Mrs. Polonsky's case, the usual grueling pre‐primary schedule — 6 A.M. handshaking at subway stops, speeches, fund‐raisers, and challenging the petitions of opponents — is complicated, but not hindered, she insists, by having four young children. The three girls, ages 4, 7 and 11, attend public school. Her 3‐year‐old son is in nursery school. “Women come up to me after a speech and ask how I can do it all,” She said “The answer is organization —every hour is planned—and a terrifically supportive group of family and friends. My father and father‐in‐law babysit at a moment's notice and even bring the kids shopping and to Sunday school. My husband shares in all the chores, and we have a parttime housekeeper. So when I'm with the children, I'm really with them.” Having children, in fact, sparked her interest first in civic work and ultimately in politics. Mrs. Polonsky “retired” from high school teaching when her first child was born, although she continued to substitute over the years. “I was raised in the traditional way—you know, a little work, marriage, children,” she explained. “But that doesn't mean you don't do any thinking at home about the issues affecting your family. I suppose I was pretty outspoken at P.T.A. and civic meetings. Someone finally suggested I do something about my convictions.” In 1965 she joined a Bay Ridge Reform Democratic club, which later merged with the New Era Independent Democrats. She worked on local and Presidential campaigns and won election last year as a McGovern delegate to the Democratic National Convention. There Mrs. Polonsky became the Brooklyn delegation's liaison with the National Women's Political Caucus, one of whose concerns was hammering an abortion plank into the party platform. “Helen convinced me and other male delegates to relinquish our votes on the abortion issue to our female alternates,” recalled a Brooklyn delegate. “The way she put it seemed so just, we simply had to do it, Helen has that quality of getting her point across without making everyone furious.” Woman's Role Descirbed “I felt that it was for women to decide, no matter which way they voted,” said Mrs. Polonsky “Women must expand their role in politics—their lives are at stake, too.” Among the issues she espouses are a return to rent control and reworking of the maximum base rent program, which she termed a failure. “We need state legislation to bring rent laws under home rule,” she said. A Councilman, she slated, has the responsibility — and the platform — to speak out on issues even if they go beyond the Council's urisdiction. “But many Councilmen are afraid to use this power, afraid of bucking the political machine that got them elected. I'm completely independent and can afford to he critical.” Born and raised in the heavily Italian and Republican section of Bay Ridge, Mrs. Polonsky attended Brooklyn College and taught English in Bedford‐Stuyvesant and Sheepshead Bay schools for seven years. “I met my husband in Bay Ridge, and we've lived in Flatbush and Brooklyn Heights as well,” she noted. “If nothing else, I know Brooklyn. Three years ago, she and her husband Jay, a partner in a Wall Street brokerage concern, were on the verge of moving to the suburbs. Instead they bought a comfortable brick house on a tree ‐lined street in Bay Ridge. “We decided to stay and fight it out where we were born,” she said. “Now I'd never leave.”"

Before he left, Mr. Rogers conferred with Dr. Hdctor J. Campora, Argentina's new President, but details of their discussion were not immediately available. Mr. Rogers, who spent three days in Buenos Aires, was among more than 60 foreign‐delegation chiefs who were on hand for the inauguration of the new Peronist Government that replaced a military regime. Aides of Mr. Rogers said that he declined to attend the actual inauguration ceremony because of civil disorders that occurred as hundreds of thousands of Peronists danced in the streets. The hotel where the American delegation was staying was stoned.

Abplanalp, a multimillionaire businessman, who is a close friend of the President. The White House said it could not name the investment company, and that the information would have to come from Mr. Abplanalp, but it did disclose that the Government paid $39,525 for improvements to the property, mostly for security reasons, and that the Nixons spent $123,514 on additional improvements.

ABORTION CLINICS FACE CRISIS HERE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/27/archives/abortion-clinics-face-crisis-here-eased-restrictions-reduce-clients.html,"The Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health, Inc., one of the city's larger abortion clinics and one with a mainly out‐ofstate clientele, has become the first to suspend activity as the result of the United States Supreme Court decision in January that made abortion as legal elsewhere as in New York.The nonprofit clinic, at 424 East 62d Street, originally and still generally known as Women's Services Inc., was organized in alliance with the Clergy Consultation Servtice, a nationwide abortion‐referral network, under the liberalized 1970 state law. The clinic was reported by a woman who answered the telephone on Friday to be “closed tighter than a drum and making no further appointmen's for abortions or any other services.” She said that follow‐up visits previously scheduled had continued, but that most of the staff had been dismissed. Dr. Robert Landesman, medical director of the center, would confirm only that abortions had dropped to 150 or 200 a week, compared to the 750 capacity, and that the clinic was “seriously in the red, is no longer viable and — in its present form — will have to go.” He would not discuss what the center's plans were. Predictions Realized “The Supreme Court decision put us in an outmoded situation and nullified our use by residents of most other states, except where social pressure is so heavy that a woman still prefers to come to New York,” Dr. Landesman said. Out‐of‐state patients seeking abortions here have declined 15 to 20 per cent of the total since the court ruling, according to city statistics released early this month. This was con sistent with predictions of declining business for “free‐standing” (non‐hospital) clinics, both commercial and nonprofit, in the wake of the decision. Planned Parenthood of New York City, which operates the other major nonprofit clinic here for abortions in the first three months of pregnancy, said abortion queries to the agentey had dropped from 9,000 a month last year to 4,500 with the percentage from out of state down from 60 or 65 per cent to 40 per cent. Patients actually referred to New York abortion services dropped from 7,000 a month to about 2,000, according’ to Alfred E. Moran, executive vice president. ‘Frankly Troubled’ He said, however, that Planned Parenthood‐New York's own two abortion facilities —on East 22d Street in Manhattan and East 149th Street in the Bronx — had remained “about stable” at 900 and 200 abortions a month, respectively. Mr. Moran said he was “frankly troubled by the closing of the other nonprofit clinic.” He noted that Planned Parenthood had drawn more of its clientele locally — doing more advertising and also “feeding in” from seven Planned Parenthood pregnancy‐consultation centers in the city — and that it also had more resources from donations than Women's Services. The percentage of nonresident abortion patients at the Planned Parenthood clinics here has dropped from 60 per cent to 40 per cent, Mr. Moran said, describing the latter as “mostly New Jersey and mostly low‐income.” Alternative Plan Mr. Moran and Dr. Landesman noted that the drop here in out‐of‐state patients was coupled with reports that abortion facilities were still limited in many states and speculated, in almost identical words, that “a lot of doctors out there” may be doing “abortion procedures” in their own offices. If Women's Services is not “resuscitated,” Mr. Moran said, one result may be that Planned Parenthood will reactivate its own intention to provide endometrial (menstrual) extraction, a vacuum‐aspiration technique most often performed between the 7th and 17th day after a missed.period. Planned Parenthood, he said, has been sending “the 30 or 40 women a week who request it” to Women's Services. Many of the city's 17 private commercial clinics for firsttrimester abortions have been casting about for ways to counteract the financial problems that have followed the Supreme Court decision. Eastern Women's Center, 14 East 60th Street, has rented one floor in Park East Hospital, a proprietary institution at 112 East 83d Street, to enable the clinic staff to perform secondtrimester abortions, which the city health code requires be done in a hospital."
And Bruno Takes Showers With His Socks On,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/27/archives/and-bruno-takes-showers-with-his-socks-on-and-bruno-takes-showers.html,"I HAVE for some time thought Steve Tesich, whose plays are normally seen only by subscription audiences at the American Place Theater, one of the most promising young dramatists lurking in the land. now think he's crazy. And I'm glad he's crazy because if, in this desperate time of our lives, we can't have orderly plays we might as well have funny ones. “Baba Goya,” now being seen by subscription audiences at the American Place Theater, is as funny as it is inexplicable. Having called it inexplicable, let's go ahead and explain it. It's about relationships that aren't, sort of. Or about the need for relationships, even if they aren't related. The first thing we learn as John Randolph, father of a lower‐middleclass household, comes downstairs of a morning is that he is very likely to drop dead at any moment. (He doesn't, don't worry about that.) With this in mind, he has placed an advertisement in the local newspaper soliciting potential new husbands for his wife, played by Olympia Dukakis‐with her hair pulled back tight and her mind more on coffee than death. She thinks Mr. Randolph's gesture rather sweet, but will accept no Germans if the door. Over coffee,. they make a list of their current problems, just to be sure they haven't missed any Their wayward daughter Sylvia she is really Miss Dukakis's bastard daughter by another man, well lost — has secretly come home during the night and then, not very secretly, sobbed aloud in her bedroom till dawn. That is a worry, though they are fairly certain that people who sob through the small hours are not as ill as your “midday weepers.” On top of this, their son Bruno, a policeman who is actually an orphan they have adopted, has been noticed taking showers with his socks on. What is disturbing Bruno? They are also out of cheese. When Sylvia comes downstairs, beating her wrists against her forehead and calling out that “your little sinner's done it this time,” we learn Something of her difficulties. She has left her latest husband, a very liberal type, because, among other things, he insisted on getting her pregnant so that she could have an abortion. He wanted to test some law or other. Since then, she has rolled men, gone on drugs and voted for Nixon to spite her husband. Because of the last, she is now certain that the entire country hates her, which’ is why she has shifted to beating her fists against the floor. Bruno, emerging fro m sleep, without seeming to wake up and doling out his words as if he were retrieving coins from a pay phone, has another sort of problem. His status as an orphan has been much on his mind of late, so much so that it is interfering with his work: he finds himself unab e to arrest anyone who lucks orphanly, which is why, a little later on in the imperturbable evening, he brings home —locked tight in his arms, lames up — a young Chinese he has caught thieving. Unwilling, in his heart of hearts, to take him to the station, he handcuffs him to the rusty radiator that seems to separate living room from dining room. The Chinese, incidentally, eventually turns out to be Japanese, and angry. He is angry because everyone in this damned country supposes that every Japanese knows all about cameras, and people keep coming up to him on the streets asking for advice about their filters. He is otherwise reasonable, however. When Sylvia wants to know if he has ever raped anyone, he replies, quite swiftly, “I got my pride, you know. I don't have to rape. I can pay for it.” The Chinese who isn'e a Chinese is played by Randy Kim with a pencil‐thin mustache, glowing smile and a haircut that looks as though a melon had been opened up, dyed black and dropped on him. There are others about. Lou Gilbert, exploding reguearly from his downstairs room with. each hair of his kinky gray beard aquiver, has been taken on by the family as a grandfather. He is unwilling to, accept the role, since he “simply cannot stand the presure of doing something grandfatherly A every day of the week,” but he's stayed on. And James Greene arrives as a suitor, if only Mr. Randolph will drop dead. He is taken on as an uncle, though not before he has asked “Is anything else available?” Enough of this. Mr. Tesich's unpredictable car toon belongs somewhere be tween early Schisgal and late “House of Blue Leaves,” and the crayon occasionally slips. The author is still capable of routine jokes (“You don't ask about your father.'’ “Oh, how is dad?” “Don't ask.”) and he is very willing to let scenes go on too long. It's also true that director Edwin Sherin hasn't quite decided how stylized the performing is to be: here and there it scrapes glass. But the very randomness of the author's little tribute to everybody's need for a link (there's a splendid three‐way kissing scene that looks like Rodin's lovers caught up in the Laocoon) proves something about him. If, with no chart at all, he can keep us sailing along with him, and if, without understanding where the base for a laugh has come from, we laugh, then he's got something. He's got that one screw loose that lets tal‐ent in. Ogden Nash unscrewed the nuts and bolts of traditional light verse all over the place, and fetchingly, as we well know. But to subject his freedoms to the regularities of music, as Milton Rosenstock and friends have done with a n entertainment known as “Nash at Nine,” may have been an irremediable mistake. A few points about the doodle at the Helen Hayes: (1) Almost all of the Nashinspired laughs.that do pop out of us during the evening come from lines that are spoken rather than sung. When E. G. Marshall, as a tweedy. Nash‐figure with oversized bow tie and hardearned elbow. patches, manages to slip “If called by a panther, don't anther” somewhere in between the steady beat of a tune, or when he tells us, with no accompaniment at all, that in church he feels like a criminal without a hymanal and that in spite of Isobel's sniffle she is chiffle, we are all right.. All right, too, when the lyric that has been turned into a song was virtually a song to begin with, as in the lovely, perfectly straightforward “Always Marry an April Girl.” (2) But much of the effect of Nash stems from the tension that is generated by having an overextended, indeterminate line rhyme with a shortie, fore or aft. The fun, very often, lies in seeing how long we can hold our breath until the rhyme‐relief comes, in sustaining a cadence improbably before. arriving at the improbable matching word. Nash isn't just oddball rhymes; the zaniness is as much in the rhythms. Music — or at least the music used here — tends to condense, regiment, formalize what is better off left free‐floating. And the rhymes themselves don't seem as funny once they're straitjacketed by a conventional (3) As though realizing that they've lost something in eliminating the structural suspense of Nash, the present company is hardpressed, under. Martin Charnin's coy direction, to make up for it by hustling cute props around: striped umbrellas, beach balls, red wagons, portable bars, zoo fences, boxes of cornflakes. Although David Chapman's basic set — white‐on‐black pages ripped from a thesaurus — is attractive to begin with, it is very busily and sometimes awkwardly used. The leaping about gets fussy: it further fragments what it ought to be fusing. (4) Note that E. G. Marshall, when he is finally given a bit of verse that is naturally dramatizable, makes a very fine thing of his trying, fiercely but forlornly, to get coffee served with his meal, and that Virginia Vestoff, gowned and coiffured to resemble a 19th‐century schoolmarm in first bloom, is charming."

Borough Presidencies,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/28/archives/borough-presidencies-the-bronx-brooklyn.html,"Two good candidates of unusual promise confront old‐line, organization opponents in Democratic primary contests for Borough Presidencieson June 4. In each case, the Democratic nomination is virtually the equivalent of election. The Bronx Bronx Borough President Robert Abrams seeks second term. He has been a forceful advocate of positive programs to benefit not only the Bronx but the rest the city as well. A vigorous and responsible critic of the city's uncertain subway system, he has exposed dangerously inadequate maintenance schedules and campaigned for a “no‐fare” system to be financed entirely from tax revenues. Young, energetic and active as a member of the Board of Estimate and as a political leader, Mr. Abrams opposed by the hand‐picked candidate of the old‐line organization, once all‐powerful in borough activities. Assemblyman Alan Hochberg has the further liability running on a platform that is at once regressive and divisive. We recommend renomination of the incumbent, Bronx Borough President Robert Abrams. Brooklyn In Brooklyn, Borough President Sebastian Leone, now seeking another term, was originally a district leader selected by the Meade Esposito organization to replace Abe Stark. Though in some ways more enlightened than other regular organization Democrats, Mr. Leone remains loyal to a machine that has too often selfishly served its members at the expense of the public. He has failed to display bold initiative or effective leadership. Mr. Leone's primary opponent, State Assemblyman Stephen J. Solarz, is one of the Legislature's outstanding young lawmakers. A three‐term member of the Legislature, Mr. Sblarz is a leader in the continuing effort open the legislative process to public view and honest debate. He has been prminent in the fight for rent control powers for New York City, for free tuition for City University, for tax reforms and legalized abortions. Mr. Solarz’ nomination and election would give promise that Borough Hall would become more responsive citizen needs."
"Down on the Farm, a Wife's Life Isn't the Drudgery It Used to Be",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/28/archives/down-on-the-farm-a-wifes-life-isnt-the-drudgery-it-used-to-be.html,"RUGBY, S. D. (AP) — Glory Monson shops in the grocery store, can't remember the last time she was up dawn and smiles at talk about weatherbeaten farm wives in gingham dresses slaving over hot stoves. Gingham, in fact, is what this 36‐year‐old grain farmer's wife uses to cover her dining room walls. She wears smart, brightly colored pants outfits, and she says her hours are no different than those of any mother of two small children. Glory's mother cooked for 15 hireit men, an all‐day chore. But because of mechanization, Glory has only one hired hand to feed. Her mother canned 500 to 600 quarts of meat and vegetables, enough to feed her family for a year; Glory makes, jelly and freezes about 50 quarts of vegetables from her garden, but she wheels a cart once a week M a grocery store—just like her ‐suburban and city counterparts. There are, of course, farm wives who rtill spend their time much like Glory Monson's mother did. But the Department of Agriculture reports that, on the whole, the life‐style of farm wives is changing. They have more spare time and women like Glory Monson are filling it with study, travel, the arts, volunteer work—and, frequently, off‐the‐farm jobs. Reasons for the change, the Federal agency says, can be found in both the women and the kinds of farm work they do. Farm women, for instance, are becoming better educated. The department found that those 25 years old and older average 12 years of schooling, compared to 9.2 years as recently as 1960. Thirty‐five per cent of farm women between 20 and 64 years old seek and obtain jobs off the farm, the Department of Agriculture report noted. The agency also found that less than 25 per cent of American farms have chickens or milk cows and that many of the farms that do have them tend them mechanically. That means fewer farm women have to worry about such chores as helping to milk the cows or gather eggs and get milk, butter, eggs and chickens like other housewives —at the store. Farm kitchens are becoming mechanized, too. A look around kitchens in Rugby, a farming community of 3,200, shows that dishwashers are fast taking their places beside freezers, clothes washers, dryers, blenders, mixers—and fondue pots. “There's room for creative things now,” ,said Mrs. Monson, a former teacher who instructs a painting class, serves as secretary of the Village Arts Council and directs the community's annual musical production. At first, Mrs. Monson found it difficult to get participants in the musical. She had to play the lead and direct the first two productions, “My Fair Lady” and “The Sound of Music.” Last year, however, she had no trouble recruiting performers, and 1,700 people attended the production. “Each year the musical gets a little more professional,” she reflected. “In a way people here are more creative than the people on the West Coast. They had to be to entertain themselves for so many years before television and radio.” A delicate woman who resembles Audrey Hepburn, she and her husband Bill, 34, a former University of North Dakota basketball star, lived in San Francisco and Sacramento, Calif., for six years. They returned to North Dakota in 1967 to take over the farm owned by Mrs. Monson's father. The Monsons’ farm covers 1,500 acres of the black soil that has made North Dakota the nation's largest producer of durum wheat and flax. The family lives in the same modest, three‐bedrooth farm house where Mrs. Monson grew up. Homemaker clubs, once the only outside activity of farm wives besides the church, have begun to widen their choices from traditional cooking and sewing to lessons on interior decorating, candlemaking, flower arranging and —a sure sign of new leisure—exercise classes. Bicycles are in vogue. Ceramics, macrame and decoupage are popular hobbies. Though Mediterranean‐style furniture and crushed velvet couches are in style, antiques have been discovered. At some auctions local people say prices get higher than they do in Chicago. Oak organs are at a premium. Some of the older women are amused at interest among city dwellers in natural childbirth, quilting, bread baking, canning and wine making. “Out here,” Mrs. Monson said, “we do not use kits. “When I was a little girl, somehow you felt inferior, because you lived on the farm. It's kind of the reverse now. My daughter is so proud of living on the farm. I know she will never feel what I did. All the farms were slower getting electric lights and bathrooms and telephones. Now more often than not you find the biggest, fanciest homes on the farm.” Though some older farm women have gone to work to fill the leisure time after their children grow up, many others work to supplement farm income (at the local day care center, one‐third of the children are from farms). When they do go to work, few of the women abandon their domestic chores. Hiring a cleaning woman is considered a sign of laziness or ostentation. Bonnie Teigen, 36, works four and half days a week as a Girl Friday in a veterinarian's office, sometimes assisting in small animal operations. In the summer, someone else takes the job so Mrs. Teigen can be at home with her three children. She took the job because, with the children in school and her husband Curtis, 35, raising beef cattle and hogs, she was home alone much of the day. “I felt that going to coffee at someone's house was wasting their time and I felt this was more rewarding for my time,” she said. Mrs. Teigen still freezes chickens and vegetables and cans pickles. She no longer cans fruit because, with the price of sugar up, she says, it is not economical. Now that she works off the farm, she no longer sews during the winter and she has her hair done in a beauty salon once a week. One of the young activists in the community is Diane Fritel, 32, who met her husband Robert, 28, traveling through France when she was a teacher in Germany and he was in the Army. Mrs. Fritel, who is a native of Cleveland and has a masters degree, spent her first summer in Rugby organizing tennis classes and held the town's first tennis tournament. Now she's city editor and only reporter for The Pierce County Tribune, a weekly newspaper. Mrs. Fritel said she misses the company of women who can talk about politics as easily as pickles, but she has grown to respect the farm women tremendously. “They are really much more talented than I am,” she said. She has decorated their modest threebedroom farm house with the purchases of her world travels — an Egyptian pouff, brass rubbings from England, Moroccan blanket, African masks and the spear of a Masai farmer. Ironically, at a time when storebought conveniences are most available, some young farm women are going back to doing handwork. Susan Jorgenson, 23, who became engaged to her husband Larry, 26, when they were attending Arizona State University, plans to sew by hand, not machine. Mrs. Jorgenson has a degree in psychology and works as a secretary at the Heart of America Human Services Center in Rugby, a six‐county agency. She hopes to move on to counseling but also is anxious to set up housekeeping. For the time being, the Jorgensons are living in a basement apartment int Leeds, about 30 miles east of Rugby, while Larry farms in partnership with his 71‐year‐old bachelor uncle. Though many women are anxious to build new ranch‐style homes, Susan wants an old farmhouse she can fill with old furniture. The one modern piece they will use is their king‐size water bed, already a subject of curiosity ty in the community. Someday she would like to have a baby at home, instead of in a hospital. Feminists are scarce. Separate checking accounts are considered radical by some, the feminist movement, abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment have few sympathizers. One young woman who lives like traditional farm wife is Harriet Volk; 34, daughter of a Birmingham, Ala., pharmacist and a graduate of Auburn University and Northwestern University, where she earned a master's degree in speech therapy. She has three children and a fourth is on the way. Her work includes tending the yard and a large garden, freezing and canning a year's supply of vegetables, caring for hogs and chickens, handling eggs and delivering them to market. Mrs. Volk loaned her mother‐in‐law most of the 10 place settings of silver and 14 place settings of china she received at her fashionable Birmingham wedding. A casual, practical woman, she wanted to sell the silver, but her husband, Ed, persuaded her to keep it. He said one of their boys might bring home a city girl someday to meet his parents. As a tribute to his wife's practicality, Mr. Volk gave her an anniversary present no city dweller would duplicate. He gave her an automatic hog feeding and watering machine."
FOES OF ABORTION CALL FOR BOYCOTT,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/30/archives/foes-of-abortion-call-for-boycott-atlantic-city-hospital-target-of.html,"ATLANTIC CITY, May 29—Some Roman Catholic Churches in this area have been circulating petitions calling for a financial boycott of Atlantic City Hospital because of its liberalized abortion policy. However, one priest has refused to make the petitions available because he believes some unmarried pregnant girls can be medically diagnosed as “sick.” The petitions, sponsored by the New Jersey Citizens United for Life, a militant antiabortion organization, have been placed in the church vestries and priests at masses have been announcing to their congregations that they are there and available for their signatures. Policy Began Last Week The 450‐bed nine‐story hospital at Ohio and Pacific Avenues, which is in part supported by public money, liberalized its (policy last week to allow abortions during a woman's first three months of pregnancy on recommendation of her physician. The policy change triggered a protest march around the hospital by more than 500 anti‐abortionists. The hospital is the first in south Jersey to approve what anti‐abortionists describe as “abortion on demand.” The hospital is overcrowded', patients sometimes have their beds in the corridors. The petition urged that the hospital “use all available bed space for those who are genuinely sick.” Ong priest who did not make the petitions available for signatures was Rev. John Casey, pastor in charge of St. Monica's Church on North Pennsylvania Avenue, a parish whose congreigation is half white, half black Priest Explains Reasons Father Casey said he did no put out the petitions because he felt that some unmarriec pregnant girls can be medically diagnosed as “sick” because of their predicament. He explained that the situation a being pregnant and unwed traumatic in many cases. He said also that the basil thrust of the petitions did no take into account the problems and dilemmas of some mem bers of his congregation. He also objected to the peti tion because an accompanying memorandum was unsigned The petition stated that copies of it with signatures should be returned to Msgr. Martin Mc Mahon, pastor of the Church of the Epiphany in Longport. Bishop George H. Guilfoyle of the Camden Diocese which the Atlantic City area is a part in a letter has appeale to the hospital's board of governors not to liberalize its abortion policy. In the letter he referred the United States Suprem Court decision that led to the change of hospital abortion policy and condemned it as “contrary to God's law.”"
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/31/archives/a-hug-for-the-antiheroine-books-of-the-times.html,"AFTER CLAUDE. By iris Owens. 206 pages. Farrar, Straus & Girous $6.95. The antihero has been hanging around in fiction for quite a while, but the antiheroine is just now making her debut. As one of the fringe benefits of their liberation, women are beginning to realize that they have fully as much right to disappoint the world's expectations as men do. They have become exhilaratingly aware that they are our equals not only in achievement but also in failure. And it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this discovery. It may turn out to be one of the most far‐reaching of all the momentous insights they have gained in the last decade. Probably the greatest of all antiheroes is Dostoyevsky's protagonist in “Notes From Underground.” The book opens with these lines: “I'm a sick man. In a spiteful man. I'm an unattractive man. I think there's something wrong with my liver.” But Dostoyevsky's character is positively benign next tO Iris Owens's antiheroine Harriet. Harriet, by the way, is the perfect name for her: She is, above all, a harrier, like that breed of dog that is trained to wear down its prey. Though Harriet's sexuality is virtually prehensile, her conversation conjures up castration. She plays at bitching as her mother plays canasta. Her intelligence is a St. Vitus's dance of vituperation, and she wears her injuries like pornographic underwear. As if the much‐maligned Jewish mother had turned bohemian mistress, Harriet cries Communicate! instead of Eat! But communication—the other consummation of all loving couples—is, for her, essentially an opportunity to exercise her inalienable right to be wrong. In an America where Jewishness has lost most of its stigma, her insistent ethnicity leaves her a rebel without a cause. As part of her personal charm, she has a compulsion to point out everyone's deepest insecurities as if she were merely plucking a thread off their sleeves. A Sexual Crusader When Harriet goes to bed with a man, she always takes her wet blanket with her. She is a sexual crusader, determined to establish woman as an outrageous but necessary inconvenience. Her life is lie‐in, a protest against the fact that to be female is to be at the mercy of a double irrationality: her own and men's. The impact of her personality is staggering. It reminds one of Paul Valery's definition of a poet as someone who assembles, bit by bit, a tremendously complicated piece of machinery, and then shoves it off a rooftop onto the head of the unsuspecting passer‐by. Harriet has just come back from a five‐year stay in Paris, where she must have soaked herself in the work of that incomparable grievance collector, Louis‐Ferdinand Celine. In spite of her disenchantment with France and the Frencli, we find her living in New York with Claude, Parisian. Or perhaps it is because of her feelings about France—perhaps she is revenging herself on that country in the person of Claude. Claude is here to produce documentary films on the American way of life for French television. As Harriet describes them, they are “riot commercials. Student riots, antiwar riots, gay liberation riots, convention riots, ghetto riots; in short, Democracy at work. The only faces he filmed were covered with. blood or gas masks.” To hear Harriet ten it, she worked so hard at entertaining Claude that she “should be required to apply for a cabaret license.” When he complains about the filth in the kitchen, she promises to get it so clean that Claude's dinner guests “could perform an abortion in there.” She is a “slave” who works her fingers to the bone reducing her master's life to chaos. Irritated by Everybody Harriet's jaundiced views are not confined to Claude: She is irritated by everybody. Of her oldest friend she says: “Maxine was under the impression that since we had jumped rope together in Brooklyn, our insults were predicated on love.” Maxine, she adds, “had more accents than Peter Ustinov, but unless you punched her in the stomach, you never heard the real one.” Every man not drooling over Harriet—or failing to produce the same effect in her—is a “fag.” Every other woman is a whore or a nymphomaniac. Watching TV, our antiheroine impatiently fidgets before “a panel of blacks demanding back payment for 300 years of ‘tap dancing.” When Miss Owens's style works, it has an ammonialike astringency: It cuts through the grease, so to speak. When Harriet finds a lover—through a newspaper ad—for frigid friend, she remarks: “I believe his name was Lloyd. I never established if that was his name or the self‐effacing manner in which he said hello.” No matter what time of day Harriet phones her parents, who have moved to California, she interrupts their “napping tournament,” and one or the other struggles up out of unconsciousness to mumble Who? Oh, yes, the weather's beautiful. When Claude suggests that she lose some weight, Harriet observes that “to men who are not basically fond of women, every additional ounce of flesh is like a thorn in their side.” When Claude finally threatens to throw her out and she attempts to seduce her way back into his affections, the progression is typical of her. She begins by crooning, Why don't you lie down here next to me and let nature take its course? When he shows no sign of responding, she reverts to type and says, “To hell with nature. I'll take nature's course.” After Claude does evict Harriet, Miss Owens seems as much at a loss where to go and what to do as her character. It is as though she suddenly looked at Harriet and said—as they once did in Hollywood movies—“This thing is bigger than both of us.” The conclusion of “After Claude” is so far below the rest of the book that seems to have been written by someone else. It may not matter, though. If you can salvage Harriet, you'll find that Miss Owens has created a new kind of monster for your compasion. And isn't that, after all, one of the classical functions of contemporary fiction?"
House Urged Not to Curb Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/31/archives/house-urged-not-to-curb-abortions-rights-underscored-reverse.html,"WASHINGTON, May 30—A dozen national religious, civi liberties and women's organi zations joined today to ask tilt House of Representatives to reject an amendment restricting the availability of abortions. The amendment, which is in eluded in a health service: bill as reported to the House would permit any hospital of other health facility funded by the legislation to refuse to permit abortions or sterilizations. The Senate has passed counterpart bill that contains a similar provision. The organizations opposing the amendment said at a news conference that an institution receiving Federal funds should be required to allow any medical procedure to be performed by a properly accredited doctor. Rights Underscored Otherwise, they said, some individuals could be denied their right to full medical care. This could happen, for example, to individuals who live in an area where the only available hospital prohibits abortion, they said. Tilford Dudley of the United Church of Christ, one of the organizations protesting the amendment, said that the situation was analogous to public accommodations cases, in which the Supreme Court said that all customers, regardless of race, had to be served. Carol Foreman of the Women's Equity Action League emphasized that the opponents of the provision did not believe in forcing any individual to perform an abortion or sterlization against his religious or moral convictions. In fact, she said that safeguards protecting against dismissal or other penalties against individuals who do not wish to participate in these procedures should be written into the legislation. The Senate bill contains such safeguards. Reverse Protections The protections should also work the other way around, she said. That is, persons who are employed by institutions that disapprove of abortion or sterilization should not be penalized for participating in such pro cedures in off‐duty hours. The amendment is contained in a bill to authorize Federal expenditure of $1.27‐billion for 12 health programs, including the Hill‐Burton program of hospital construction, community mental health centers, regional medical programs and health services for migrant workers and other persons. The organizations that joined in criticizing the anti‐abortion amendment were the American Civil, Liberties Union; Church of the Brethern; American Baptist Churches, U.S.A.; Young Women's Christian Association; National Council of Jewish Women; National Organization for Women; National Women's Political Caucus; Planned Parenthood; United Church of Christ; United Methodist Church; Women's Equity Action League and Women's Lobby, Inc."

The vote came several hours after the Pentagon announced a reduc tion in bombing missions over Cambodia, partly because Congress had not authorized a requested transfer of defense funds. The two houses’ versions must now be reconciled before the bill can be sent to the White House. [Page 1, Column 8.]  FRIDAY, JUNE 1, 1973 The Major Events of the Day International In Saigon, Government sources said the United States believed that the prospects for a cease‐fire in Cambodia were “very sunny.” The officials said they had been told that North Vietnam had agreed to a sharp reduction of the Cambodian, hostilities and that Washington and Hanoi had also agreed on a new effort to carry out the cease‐fire in South Vietnam.

Persian Gulf states, the State Department said that the United States would make no military sales that would jeopardize Israeli security. Citing a policy of encouraging mutual security in the area since the British withdrawal in 1968, a spokesman said the sales—described in Congress as totaling more than $5‐billion— would include a “limited number” of the so phisticated F‐4 Phantom fighter‐bombers to Saudi Arabia. [3:5–8.] The army‐backed Government of Greece dismissed the head of the Navy amid re ports that it was speeding plans to replace the monarchy with a republic. Qualified sources said that the move would begin with publication of evidence that the exiled King, Constantine, knew in advance about last week's abortive coup by the navy. [1:7.] Watergate Investigation H. R. Haldeman denied “categorically” that he had participated in the Watergate cover‐up, but two of the Senators who ques tioned President Nixon's former top aide said they were skeptical about some of his testi mony.

BUCKLEY PUSHES CURB ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/01/archives/buckley-pushes-curb-on-abortion-6-senators-join-in-seeking.html,"WASHINGTON, May 31— Senator James L. Buckley and six other Senators introduced today a constitutional amend ment designed to prohibit abor tions except to save the life the mother.  Senator Buckley, a Conserva tive‐Republican of New York, said at a news conference that he believed the amendment would be approved, in time, if there was enough debate on the issues. He commented that in the only two states where the abortion issue has recently been presented to voters — North Dakota and Michigan—they de feated proposals to liberalize abortion laws. The proposed constitutional amendment is designed to over turn a Supreme Court decision, handed down earlier this year, which had the effect of prohib iting any type of state interfer ence with abortions performed during the first three months of pregnancy and permitted in terference only to the extent of imposing some medical safe guards in the second three months. Senator Buckley said that enactment of a constitutional amendment was the only way to reinstate restrictions on abortion. Some other, members of Congress have proposed leg islation on the issue. Senator Buckley and one co sponsor of the amendment are Roman Catholics. The five other co‐sponsors are Protes tants. ‘Depersonalization’ One of them, Mark O. Hat field, Republican of Oregon, said that he considered the in crease in abortions part of a wave of “depersonalization and violence” that is spreading throughout the nation. Other examples, he said, are the war in Indochina, with its body‐counts, the denial of am nesty to those who would not fight in the war, and the condi tions that led to rioting in the Attica, N. Y., prison. Senator Buckley's bill differs from the approach most com monly taken by opponents of abortion in two major ways. First, it permits abortions in “an emergency when a reason able medical certainty exists that continuation of the preg nancy, will cause the death of the mother.” Traditional Roman Catholic doctrine has not per mitted abortion even in such cases. Second, it leaves open as still not scientifically decided the issue of when the life of a per son can be said to have begun. Before life begins, the use of drugs or medical procedures de signed to prevent the beginning of a life would be legal under the amendment. This means that use of a “morning after” pill would be considered contraception, and therefore legal, rather than abortion, and therefore illegal. Medical treatment commonly given in hospitals following rape would also be permitted under the amendment. The key issue, Senator Buck ley said, is that scientists are tending increasingly to believe that life begins not when fer tilization takes place—that is, when the sperm cell penetrates the ovum—but when the fertil ized ovum implants itself in the wall of the uterus. Senator Buckley said that this takes place two or three days after intercourse. Some medical authorities indicate that the average length of time may be about a week after. While Catholic doctors are among those actively research ing the question of when life begins, the established Catholic Church position is that life begins at the moment of fer tilization. Last week opponents of abor tion advocated a ban on the use of Federal funds to dispense intrauterine devices on the ground that these devices work by preventing implantation after fertilization and thus, in effect, cause abortions. Other co‐sponsors of the amendment are: Wallace F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, a Mormon; Carl T. Curtis, Repub lican of Nebraska; Milton R. Young, Republican of North Dakota, and Harold E. Hughes, Democrat of Iowa, all Protes tants; and Dewey F. Bartlett, Republican of Oklahoma, a Catholic."
"News Summary and Index SUNDAY, JUNE 3, 1973",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/news-summary-and-index-index-to-the-other-news-in-section-1.html,"King Constantine II held a dramatic news conference in the garden of his villa in Rome and said earnestly that he was confident of returning to Greece as guardian of consti tutional liberties. In a statement, in English, that he read to about 100 newsmen, the King said: “The real problem lies not in whether Greece should have a democracy with or without a King, but whether she should have a democracy at all, and whether the people of Greece has the right to be master of its fate and to enjoy its freedom.” [Page 1, Column 8.] The Major Events of the Day—Section International Four senior officers of the Greek armed forces resigned as the security police con tinued to arrest supporters of King Constan tine II, deposed Friday by the Government. The resignations included the logistics chief and the deputy chief of the navy, shaken two weeks ago when a group within its ranks attempted a coup. The Government, meanwhile, launched an intensive campaign to persuade Greeks of the value of the decree that abolished the 140‐year‐old monarchy and proclaimed Greece a republic. [1:7.] A terrorist shot and killed an American military adviser outside his home in Teheran, Iran, and then fled on a motorcycle driven by a second man, the United States Embassy reported. The embassy identified the slain American as Lieut. Col. Lewis Hawkins, 42 years old, of Plymouth, Ind. After the shoot ing, the Iranian police posted guards at American installations, including three American schools. [1:6.] National John W. Dean 3d has told the chief coun sel for the Senate Watergate committee that he met alone and in small groups with Pres ident Nixon more than 40 times between last January and early April of this year, sources close to Mr. Dean said. Mr. Dean, the former White House counsel, said this, according to the sources, during a more than four‐hour private conference with Sam uel Dash, the committee counsel. In that conference, Mr. Dean said he could supply firsthand testimony about those meetings that he believed would show that Mr. Nixon had “substantial knowledge” of what White House officials were doing about the Water gate investigation, one closely involved source said. [1:1.] Contrary to assertions in a sworn state ment by former White House aide Egil Krogh Jr., the Federal Bureau of Investigation had knowledge in late June, 1971, that the Soviet Government did not possess the Pentagon papers before they were published by The New York Times, according to Justice De partment sources. These sources said that although the bulk of the top‐secret Defense Department study of the Vietnam war was mysteriously delivered to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, it did not arrive until after The Times had printed its first three install ments from the papers and had been placed under a temporary court order that halted their publication. [1:2.] A Los Angeles County grand jury will be gin its investigation Tuesday of the break‐in at the office of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg's psychia trist, and it has two main questions to ex plore: Who knew about the break‐in before and after it happened, and was their conduct criminal? “We are interested in whether or not there was a conspiracy to commit a crime or burgalry or malicious trespassing,” explained District Attorney Joseph P. Busch in an interview. “We know a certain group had certain authority to a certain thing. Whether that amounted to criminal activity depends on what the witnesses have to say,” Mr. Busch said. [43:1.] QUOTATION OF THE DAY: “I, King of the Hellenes, have not only the hope but the unshakable conviction that I shall return to my beloved country as guarantor of the dignity and of the constitutional liberty of the Greek people.”—King Constantine, at a news conference in Rome. [1:8.] Wednesday is graduation day at the United States Air Force Academy in Colo rado Springs, and 844 members of the Class of 1973 are preparing themselves for what academy officials hope will be a display of pride, purpose and shorter haircuts. It is an annual day to renew faith in the 18‐year‐ old academy, but that won't be easy this year. The academy is in trouble, and its cadets are leaving in record numbers. [1:3.] Chicago on Friday became the first City in the nation to begin mandatory tests on the exhaust emissions of private motor vehicles. The tests also were among the first of a variety of measures that states and munici palities across the country must begin tak ing in the months ahead as they strive to meet Federal air quality standards that will take effect in mid‐1975. [1:2–5.] Metropolitan Seven crew members were dead, nine others were missing and presumed dead after an American cargo ship, outbound in the early morning darkness, impaled her prow amid ships of an oil‐laden Belgian tanker at anchor in the Narrows of New York Harbor, touching off an inferno of explosion and fire. The American ship was the Sea Witch, a 610‐foot containership. She plowed into the starboard side of the 700‐foot Esso Brussels, spilling oil from the tanker that ignited and covered the surrounding water with flames, which partially engulfed both ships. [1:3–6.] With voter turnout vitally important to their fortunes in tomorrow's primary, four Democratic mayoral candidates mobilized their campaign workers this weekend to get out big votes in areas where they expect to run well. Several thousand campaign work ers distributed last‐minute campaign litera ture, electioneered in telephone calls and prepared to man as many of the city's 4,569 election district polls as possible. [1:4–5.] A wide‐ranging traffic control program, described as one of the most sweeping of its kind in the city's history, is scheduled to begin here on July 1. Details of the plan will not be released for another week or 10 days, but it was learned that the program includes the designation of traffic control of ficers, who would direct traffic at intersec tions and would issue summonses for some moving vehicular violations. [1:1–2.] New Jersey's bitterly contested Repub lican primary election campaign for Gover nor, dominated by charges of corruption and confronted with apparent widespread public cynicism and apathy, ended this weekend with each of the two major candidates charging that the nomination of the other would wreck the party. The Republican race between Governor Cahill and Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. has been virtually unparalleled in the state.

Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/score-two-for-the-police-supreme-court.html,"WASHINGTON—In June of 1969, on its last day under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Su preme Court handed down three de cisions that broadened the rights of criminal suspects and correspondingly curbed the practices of law enforce ment officials. Last week, almost four years later, a high court with four new justices appointed by President Nixon decided two criminal cases in just the oppo site way: approving police procedure that had been challenged as damag ing the constitutional rights of al leged criminals. Neither decision day raised a clear ly discernible milestone. After Justice Warren's retirement, the court con tinued to come to the aid of the accused, but less consistently. Under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the law and order court has prevailed on an increasing number of occasions but not on every one. Future decisions may reverse this trend—the justices have another 50 cases to resolve before adjourning for the summer—but it seemed reason able to conclude that the United States, for the purpose of interpret ing its criminal laws, now has a Nixon Court, reflecting the President's re peated political pledge to balance the “criminal forces” of the country with the “peace forces.” The “new” criminal court emerg ing reflects the retirement of Chief Justice Warren, the deaths of Asso ciate Justices Hugo L. Black and John M. Harlan and the withdrawal of Abe Fortas, and the replacement of these men with Chief Justice Burger and Associate Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr., and William H. Rehnquist. This core of what the President calls “strict constructionists” has been frequently joined on criminal deci sions this term by either or both of the two “swing” justices—Byron R. White and Potter Stewart. The major ity they produce is not always firmly predictable but it is growing more so. Both the swing justices were in the six‐man majority that ruled last week that a police search, without a war rant, of a car was permissible when one of the car's occupants consented, even if the prosecution could not sub sequently prove that the suspect knew he had the right to prevent the search, by withholding his consent. The case arose when California po lice stopped a car that was running at night with one headlight and its license plate light both out. A pas senger agreed to a search of the ve hicle and three stolen checks were found under the back seat. The sub sequent burglary conviction of anoth er passenger was ultimately reversed by the United States Court of Appeals on the ground that the prosecution had failed to prove that the passenger authorizing the search knew he could have refused. But the Supreme Court rejected this reasoning. In the second case, decided 7 to 2, the Court found it constitutional for the prosecution to rely on evidence taken against his will from a murder suspect who had not been arrested but who had come to the police sta tion voluntarily. The majority said there had been “probable cause” to believe the sus pect was guilty, thus validating the taking of incriminating fingernail scrapings that resulted in his convic tion for strangling his wife. In earlier decisions this year, the Court had also restricted the ability of criminal defendants to maintain they had been “entrapped” by gov ernment agents, limited the right of a criminal to challenge the grand jury system after his conviction and eased restrictions on the power of judges to impose harsher sentences on crim inals after a second trial made nec essary by reversal. It is clearly too early to contend that the Court has taken on the philo sophical coloration of the President over a broader range of social and political issues. Its decision last Jan uary to legalize all but end‐of‐term abortions is testimony to the Inde pendence of the justices in the face of a strong contrary public stand by the President. Mr. Nixon has not been the first President to get less than he hoped from a Court so much of his own making, nor will he be the last.,"
New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/the-issue-is-law-and-order-the-electorate.html,"“Hard footsteps follow you home at night. A knife at your throat, a jab in your stomach, your purse or wal let gone and it's over. You're another statistic in the war we could lose— the against the criminal.” —From a campaign flyer for liberal Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, one of the four candidates for the Democratic mayoral nomination in tomorrow's primary. The normal cliches compare New York politics to feudal alliances com plicated by ethnic preferences, but this year the Democratic primary is more like the musical comedy Piran dello never wrote. That Mr. Blumenthal should be cam paigning on an issue only recently re garded by liberals as obvious code for racism is no aberration, but a sign of the political times. It fits nicely into campaign that: • Began In January with nine can didates seeking the Democratic nom ination; • Saw Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, the Republican power in the state, teaming up with Liberal party leader Alex Rose. Their purpose: to bring former liberal Democratic Mayor Robert Wag ner back to City Hall to replace Mayor John Lindsay — eight years after Messrs. Rockefeller and Rose had sponsored Mr. Lindsay to save the city from Mr. Wagner; • Focused for weeks on whether Mario Biaggi, a decorated former po liceman, had in fact claimed the Fifth Amednment, a constitutional privilege many of his admirers thought reserved for the dangerous and the degenerate. With Primary Day finally at hand, the field is down to four, Mr. Biaggi, Controller Abraham D. Beame, Rep resentative Herman Badillo and Mr. Blumenthal; Mr. Wagner has decided retirement is the better part of linger ing ambition; Mr. Rockefeller has absent‐mindedly endorsed John Mar chi, the candidate of the party Rocke feller leads, and Mr. Biaggi, his Fifth Amendment pleas made public by his own tactical miscalculations, was hop ing for a sympathetic backlash. Clear ly none of the candidates has cap tured the electorate's enthusiasm and imagination, and just as clearly all had been obscured by the pall, Water gate, that rightly or wrongly now hangs over every politician. With the campaign for the nomination possibly only at the half‐way mark (unless, one candidate gets 40 per cent of the’ vote tomorrow, there will be a runoff election June 26) here is how the four men stood: The Candidates Representative Badillo, 43, a law yer, accountant and former Bronx borough president, would be the city's first Puerto Rican mayor. In New York, a city where politics usually starts to the left of where it ends in many other places, Mr. Badillo has clearly taken the most liberal stance of the four candidates. He emphasizes jobs as a way of elevating the wel fare poor to the taxpaying middle class and has called for a city income tax increase, if necessary, to prevent a new subway fare rise. He hopes to build on his black and Puerto Rican base by adding white liberals, particu larly in Jewsh areas, but these are also likely to look kindly on Mr. Blum enthal. City Controller Beanie is, at 67, the oldest of the candidates, and much of his expensive TV campaign empha sized his vigor. For 23 years a budget official and controller under four mayors, he ds a product of the Brook lyn Democratic organization and is generally rated “the establishment candidate”; in fact, he is, politically, a reasonable stand‐in for the reluct ant Mr. Wagner. He has been the chief beneficiary of most of Mr. Biaggi's problems, and ac cording to most polls and politicians, is so far ahead of the‐field that the only question is whether or not he will get 40 per cent of the vote and so prevent a run‐off. Mr. Beame is the only candidate who has not been hampered by a shortage of money. While Mr. Beanie is by philosophy the candidate closest to the center of the political spectrum, he has found a crowd there. Mr. Biaggi, on the right, has been careful to temper his law and order image by stress ing that he, too, is for the little man. Mr. Blumenthal, on the left, has been edging to the right on the law and order issue. Representative Biaggi, 55, is a re tired police lieutenant turned lawyer and politician, initially with the bless ing of Governor Rockefeller. Law and order is his big issue; he often boasts that he was a hardliner on the sub ject long before it was fashionable to be so. Mr. Biaggi is the nominee of the Conservative party, but some top Conservative leaders have repu diated him because of his Fifth Amendment problems and say they will try to strip him of the Con servative nomination after the Dem ocratic primary. Assemblyman Blumenthal, 44, lawyer and deputy minority leader of the Assembly, is best known for his role in initiating the liberalization of the state's abortion law. Until he scored a surprise victory over Con gressman Badillo in securing the en dorsement of the New Democratic Coalition, his candidacy was not taken too seriously by other politicians. But since then, as a result of the Wagner fiasco, he has won the support of Mr. Rose, though he is being chal lenged for the Liberal party nomina tion in tomorrow's primary. The challenger is J. Stanley Shaw, leader of an anti‐Rose faction in the Liberal party. The Issues All four candidates, in varying de grees, have resorted to the law and order issue because it was the one approach almost certain to catch the voters' attention. But in the process, despite their policy statements and earnest efforts, traditional issues of concern to New Yorkers, such as civil rights and housing and social service for the poor, received less attention than usual. Instead, along with law and order, the campaigners took positions on welfare, rent de control, a threatened rise in the trans it fare and proposals to dismantle the city's superagencies. There were few fundamental disagreements; usu ally, the differences centered on methods for achieving agreed‐on ends. Most of the rhetoric centered on the supposedly lenient and inefficient courts and proposals to add thousands more police to a 30,000‐man force that is already the size of many armies. Mr. Biaggi, thanks to his care fully cultivated image as a hero‐cop, clearly had the edge on the issue un til the dramatic controversy over his refusal to answer 16 questions be fore a Federal grand jury 18 months ago. Confronted with reports that he had refused to answer questions be fore the grand jury, Mr. Biaggi re peatedly denied that he had declined to answer. When a series of Biaggi legal ma neuvers failed to block disclosure of his grand jury testimony, Mr. Biaggi conceded that he had indeed “mis led” the public, press and other poli ticians. Mr. Badillo had a different description. “A public liar,” he de clared. The controversy undermined Mr. Biaggi's campaign, dropping him from a front‐runner position, drying up his campaign finances and dividing his staff. The Electorate Even if it had been a normal pri mary, the candidates would face huge tactical problems. They are courting an electorate that does not neces sarily reflect the general population. Up to half the primary voters, for example, are expected to be Jewish while up to 20 per cent might be black and Puerto Rican, reflecting the strong representation of these popu lation groups in the party. In any event, tomorrow, if the turn out is as expected, about one‐third of the 2.4‐million enrolled Democrats will choose among the four B's. There is also a contest between the veteran Frank Hogan and William J. vanden Heuvel for the Democratic nomination as Manhattan district at torney. And in Westchester there is a three‐way Republican contest for county, executive among Edward N. Vetrano, Daniel McMahon and Michael Roth. (For a full list of primary races see the main news section of today's paper). Everywhere, the candidates are also running against an apathetic elector ate, a condition not improved by the length of the campaign and the Water gate backdrop. No less an expert than Meade H. Esposito of Brooklyn, one of the few remaining effective political bosses, said: “People are disgusted and confused.” —FRANK LYNN"
"Badillo, Biaggi, Blumenthal, Beame",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/running-for-the-unrunnable-badillo-biaggi-blumenthal-beame.html,"Even the candidates themselves, enveloped in the clouds of incense burned by their votaries, intoxi cated by the power of their own oratory, adept the art of self‐delusion, have not been able to re main unaware of the pestilential fog that hangs over the city on the eve of the Democratic mayoral primary. This cloaca( odor, compounded of a loss of confidence in government that has made Hellgate a branch office of Watergate, of the threat of con tinuing inflation, of the fear of loss of jobs, of the possibility of new disorders in the streets this sum mer, is unmistakable. Communicated to the candidates, it intensifies the fatigue of months of campaigning. Phrases that seemed eloquent in March ring hollow now. The thin gold plating of novelty applied to programs and policies has been worn away by constant han dling, exposing the dull brass of counterfeit coinage. Like old vaudevillians who realize they are “dying” in Kokomo and Kansas City, that their material has lost its sparkle, they begin to press too hard. Herman Badillo's eloquence turns glib. He seems to be trying to pack 40 minutes' worth of words, many of them “I,” into a 20‐minute speech. Albert H. Blumenthal scowls and puffs himself up and forces his voice to boom with indignation. Mario Biaggi, a ghost now of the man who seemed like a possible winner only a few months ago, goes through the motions of campaigning and arouses pity rather than the disdain ordinarily reserved for a man who lies foolishly and repeatedly and is caught. For Abraham D. Beame, it has been easier. The old professional, who learned his politics in a tougher school, has smiled his wintry gray smile, said little and watched his rivals destroy themselves and one another. It has been, all in all, the oddest Democratic primary in the city's modern history, making even the five‐sided melee of 1969 look like a model of sophisticated politicking and intelligent debate by comparison. Caught up in their feuds and intrigues, the candidates have been unable to focus the atten tion of the electorate on the issues, which may be just as well because the more closely they are examined the more intractable they begin to seem. Privately, at least, all four men agree that with out enormous grants of Federal funds for housing, mass transportation and for effective programs to train and create jobs for the increasing numbers of young unskilled and semiliterate blacks and Puerto Ricans, the best that can be hoped for is partial and probably ineffective remedies. Given the policies of the Nixon Administration, it is further conceded, there seems to be little reason to hope that the money will be forthcoming. Everyone also agrees—and visits with the candi dates to every corner of the city bear out the opin ion—that the white working‐class and middle‐class voters are near the flashpoint of rage over what they see as the enormous burden placed on them by these minorities. They see themselves carrying not only the greatest part of the $2.5‐billion a year in welfare payments, which make up nearly 25 per cent of the entire city expense budget, but also the cost of the auxiliary services—hospitals, courts, poverty projects and the like—as well as the enor mous and incalculable cost of the crimes they com mit. “It would still be a great city if it weren't for them,” is a refrain heard in one form or another on every side. At the same time, sneering references to “nig gers,” “jungle bunnies” and “spics,” or long‐winded, ignorant disquisitions on theories of racial inferior ity, are not heard so often in the corner taverns of the city as in the past. There seems to be a grow ing willingness to accept the fact that the great majority of black and Puerto Rican men—and women, too—hold jobs and try to raise decent families, often against heavy odds. It is the most desperately deprived members of these groups who are seen as having been trans formed in recent years from a serious nuisance to a mortal menace to the well‐being of the entire city. This opinion now appears to be strongly, even vehemently, held not only by Catholic white ethnics but also by blacks and Puerto Ricans who have taken their first difficult steps up the economic and social ladder, and most importantly, in political terms, by increasing numbers of the city's Jewish residents. The phrases you hear are these: “They don't want to help themselves .... How much can you do for people? ... I know they've had a hard time, but .... What kind of city is this, when you can't go out at night to get a paper? ... We're hunted ani mals in the neighborhood.” For this situation, as well as for other municipal ills, the blame is placed on the Lindsay administra tion. The detestation In which the Mayor is held in such communities is so intense that if it could be captured from the air, liquefied and bottled it would eat its way through case‐hardened steel. It was Lindsay, in this formulation, who coddled the blacks, refused to strike the ineligibles off welfare, made it possible for them to believe that they could live well, drive Cadillacs, live in Forest Hills, for God's sake, send their children to schools in quiet neighborhoods and frighten everyone to death, all without the inconvenience of working. In fact, it might be a happier city if Lindsay had decided to run again. Countless thousands of New Yorkers could have worked off their frustrations by pelting him with dead cats, hanging him in effigy and, conceivably, turning out in far greater num bers than the maximum of 800,000 expected to go to the polls tomorrow, not so much to vote for anyone in particular as to vote against him. Last summer, when the mayoral race was first being discussed, Meade Esposito, the Brooklyn Dem ocratic leader, mentioned the possibility of a fusion candidate who could end the polarization between the white middle and working classes on the one hand, and the minorities and their allies among the limousine liberals and West Side reform ideologues who had so strongly influenced the Lindsay admin istration on the other. But while such an effort was to be made, under rather different circumstances, to get former Mayor Robert F. Wagner to assume this role, it seemed clear from the start that no strong consensus candi date was likely to emerge. Ten or 15 men and one woman, Bess Myerson, the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, were being mentioned as potential candidates in the Democratic primary alone, but none dominated the field as Lindsay had in the mayoral election of 1965. By the beginning of the year, in fact, the “three B's”—Badillo, Beame and Biaggi, representing, respectively, the left, the center and the right—seemed to be the only candidates likely to attract the funds and the organizational support to go into the pri mary with any hope of suc cess. This relatively clear‐cut sit uation began getting confused in March, when the conven tion of the New Democratic Coalition, a grouping of the city's 75 reform clubs, gave its endorsement to Blumen that instead of Badillo, to whom it had all but been conceded. One of the reasons, oddly, was that Blumenthal had agreed to drop out of the race if he didn't get the en dorsement, while Badillo would not make a similar commitment. The designation, in effect, legitimized Blumenthal's can didacy, which had previously been taken not much more seriously than those of Har lem Assemblyman Jesse Gray, City Council President San ford Garelik or former En vironmental Protection Ad ministrator Jerome Kretchmer. There was the possibility of course, that Mayor Lindsay might enter a local Demo cratic primary for the first time in an effort to gain a third term. For months he re fused to commit himself and then finally withdrew from the race in March when it became clear from polls and other soundings that he faced a second disastrous defeat (the first had been in his Presidential campaign) that could have adversely affected any future political plans. Then, too, Alex Rose, the leader of the Liberal party, which had supported Lindsay in 1965 and had given him his only party line on the voting machines in 1969 after his defeat by State Senator John Marchi in the Republican pri mary, urged him not to run. “What I told him,” Rose told me a couple of weeks ago, “was that some of your best friends, including myself, think you ought not to run. If you run and don't get elected all your pluses get wiped out. There's nothing wrong with not running, after all.” What was probably decisive was the broad hint that Rose dropped when he said he told the Mayor, “I'm not sure the party will renominate you.” Since Rose's influence is dominant, the hint in the advice, realistically speaking, became a withdrawal of support date. At about the same time, Rose was trying to put to gether, with Governor Rocke feller, perhaps the most bizarre deal in the city's political history: the nomina tion of Wagner—a lifelong Democrat, the three‐time May or who preceded Lindsay—as the Republican‐Liberal candi date. ROCKEFELLER had already made it clear that he did not think that Biaggi was up to the job, and apparently saw no chance of Marchi, a highly intelligent man but an unin spiring campaigner, winning election. By then, too, ap parently Esposito and the other regular Democratic leaders had changed their minds on fusion, thinking per haps that they had a winner in Beame. In any event, it was clearly important to Rocke feller to have a friend at City during the four‐year period in which he was expected to seek his fifth term as Gov ernor and then make his last try for the Presidency. Al though of opposing parties, he and Wagner had always gotten along well, in contrast to the Governor's increasingly sour relations with Lindsay. Wagner, who is generally regarded nowadays as having been an underrated Mayor, toyed with the idea for a cou ple of weeks. Always slow to make up his mind—he has often said he found that many problems eventually solved themselves if left alone—he called a couple of press con ferences simply to announce he hadn't yet made up his mind. It was also likely that he was gauging the response among the city's Republican leaders, who are usually docile handmaidens of the Governor, the source of all their patron age. It turned out to be not at all favorable. A couple of leaders, not surprisingly in eluding one with considerable private means of his own, noisily denounced the Gov ernor's plan. Finally, on television—the night before Marchi, according to reports that turned out to be correct, was going to an nounce his own candidacy, thus forcing Wagner into a primary fight that he was not thus forcing Wagner into a at all certain to win—the for mer Mayor announced his withdrawal. “I found I just didn't have the desire to go through it all again,” he told me later. “It's a job that you really have to want to do, and I just didn't want it bad ly enough again to put up with all the headaches and the sleepless nights. Also, I wanted to do what was best for Bob Jr. [who is running for Coun cilman at Large in Manhattan as a Democrat) and I thought this might hurt his chances.” After Wagner's withdrawal, Rockefeller, rather grudgingly it seemed to everyone, got behind Marchi's candidacy. Rose and the Liberals nom inated Blumenthal, who must have been pleased that he had not been taken up on his pro posal that the Democratic candidate (aside from Biaggi, who already had the Con servative nomination) agree to support the winner of the primary. Just when it seemed that at least some of the tangles had been cleared, and that the candidates might get an audi ence for their views of what could be done for Gotham, the Sick Man of the Eastern seaboard, the Biaggi affair broke into the papers. The Times supplied the revelation that, despite his denial, he had invoked his constitutional rights against self‐incrimina tion before a grand jury that was looking into the possible abuse of private immigration bills by members of the House. ASIDE from Biaggi, who counted on his 19 years in the Police De partment to put him over as a law‐and‐order candidate, his three rivals found varying degrees of difficulty in accom modating to the swing to the right in the city. It was easi est for Beame. A moderate Democrat of the old organiza tion type who had always been highly acceptable to bus iness, organized labor and the small homeowner, Beame has emphasized his fiscal conserv atism, his opposition to higher taxes, the brakes he had ap plied with at least some suc cess to what was described as the prodigal spending of Lind say's second term, and his intimate and long‐standing knowledge of city govern ment. Except for four years out of office after his defeat by Lindsay in the 1965 mayoral ty, Beame, who is 67 years old, has held Thigh city jobs continuously since 1946, when he was chosen as assistant budget director, a post for which he was suited not only by his qualification as a cer tified public accountant and years of teaching accountancy in city high schools, but also by long years as a captain in the James Madison Democrat ic Club in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. From 1952 until 1961 he served as budget director, which is generally regarded as the most important non elective post in city govern ment. Then he did something that he believes establishes his credentials as an inde pendent. When the party lead ers reneged on their promise to him of the nomination for Brooklyn Borough President, Beame accepted the offer made by Wagner, who had been denied renomination by the leaders for a third term as Mayor, to run as Control ler on his slate in the Demo cratic primary. With Paul Screvane, the Sanitation Commissioner, run ning as City Council Presi dent, they easily defeated the regular ticket headed by State Controller Arthur Lev itt, whose candidate for Coun cil President, interestingly enough, was Thomas Mackell, who resigned under fire in April as Queens County Dis trict Attorney. That Novem with Liberal endorsement, swamped the Republicans, whose standard‐bearer was that amiable old wheelhorse, State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz. His titular cam paign manager, receiving his first city‐wide exposure in an ticipation of his own cam paign four years later was the handsome East Side Con John V. Lindsay. All in all, 1961 was a water shed year in municipal poli tics. The rising reform move ment broke the back of the regular organization's power in Manhattan. Sixteen of 21 regular district leaders, in eluding Carmine DeSapio, the head of Tammany Hall, were defeated. Working hard for Wagner that year was Al Blumenthal, and one of the insurgent candidates for dis trict leadership who was nar rowly defeated was Badillo, then an obscure young lawyer in East Harlem. Badillo challenged the re suit in the courts and was on his way to winning a reversal. Wagner, however, anxious to reunite the party and spotting Badillo as a corner, struck a bargain. He appointed Badillo as a deputy commissioner in the Real Estate Department and, a year or so later, as Commissioner of Relocation. Badillo was the first Puerto Rican to hold a city commis sionership and it led, again with Wagner's support, to his election in 1965 as Bronx Borough President. In 1969 Badillo, however, declined to withdraw from the mayoral primary after Wag ner decided to try a come back, although Wagner of fered him his choice of running for Controller or City Council President. As a result, the two men divided the bulk of the moderate and reform Democratic vote, permitting Mario Procaccino to win the nomination. He was generally regarded as the only candi date—perhaps the only man in the city—whom Lindsay could have beaten. It was a mistake that Badillo now says that he's sorry about, and he has right to be. Biaggi was also up to some thing in 196L He was then a detective lieutenant assigned to borough headquarters in the Bronx. He was on the shelf, having been removed from a squad command four years earlier by Commissioner Stephen Kennedy, and was, it was said, distrusted by Ken nedy's successor, Michael Murphy, despite Biaggi's many decorations. (Biaggi is not, as he claims to be, the most highly decorated man in de partment history nor was he “wounded 11 times” on active service. According to a Police Department spokesman, the actual figure in departmental records appears to be once, but it may be that his public relations man's typewriter stuttered. Anyhow, from the time he joined the force in 1942, Bi aggi had operated in the twi light zone of police politics. He had been first vice presi dent of the Patrolmen's Be nevolent Association, and when his promotion to ser geant forced him to relinquish that post, he began organiz ing the Columbians, an organ ization of Italian ‐ American members of the department. Gradually, as president, he expanded it to other city de partments and to state gov ernment well. It has been suggested that it was the influence that this organization wielded, as well as his connections with the P.B.A., that may have helped keep him from being removed from the detective division altogether, given the reports at the time—never proved, it must be added—that he had associations at least with the periphery of the underworld. SO it was in 1961 that Biaggi, with 19 years of police serv ice and no very bright future to look forward‐ to, approached a high official of the Wagner campaign with a proposition: The Columbians would support Wagner in re turn for a commitment to appoint him as a deputy po lice commissioner. “We didn't have any objection in princi ple,” the man said, “but Bob told me to clear it with Mike Murphy. When I went to him he told me, ‘I wouldn't have that S.O.B. around under any circumstances.’” The Columbians then en dorsed Levitt, and after Wag ner won the primary, the organization moved over to Lefkowitz, briefly making Lindsay and Biaggi allies. Al though Lefkowitz lost, Biaggi, on a leave of absence from the department, was rewarded with a job in the State De partment of Housing that per mitted him to transfer from the night session at New York Law School to a full‐time day course. In 1965, after gradu ating and passing the bar exam on his third try, he re tired from the department, being awarded a 75 per cent physical disability pension, al though the three doctors who examined him for the board said the disability could not be attributed to work‐related injuries. Late in Wagner's third term, Beame, anxious to stake out his own position for a run for the mayoralty, and feel ing the gravitational tug of the regular organization, broke with the Mayor over a question of municipal finance. In 1965, with organization support, and the endorsement of Biaggi's Columbians, he defeated Wagner's candidate, Screvane, in the primary, only to lose badly to the golden boy, Lindsay, in the general election. After four lucrative but un happy years out of politics, working as a consultant to a bank and brokerage firms and drawing a substantial city pension, Beame announced his independent candidacy for Controller in 1969, bucked the organization again, and won easily. The fiscal and admin istrative anarchy of Lindsay's second term was a happy hunting ground for Beame. It was like a prospector striking the mother lode. His inves tigators found irregularities everywhere, and Beame did his best to see that they got adequate publicity, although ordinarily news out of the Controller's office elicits yawns from most newspaper readers. This year, Beame says, he let the word get around that he was thinking about run ning for Mayor, and the regu lars, having nowhere else to go, came to him. “That's why it's ridiculous to say I'm a tool of the bosses,” he told me. “I hate to think what Al Blumenthal had to promise Alex Rose to get the Liberal nomination. [In fact, there will be a contest for that des ignation tomorrow, too, but Blumenthal is expected to win easily.] I haven't made a sin gle commitment to anyone. They need me more than I need them.” FOR Blumenthal, the swing to the right has been more dif ficult to handle. Stuck with the label of “West Side re former,” he could only appeal to what remained of liberal sentiment among Democrats in the city—which Badillo was cutting into—and be thankful that, like Beame, he had kept his head well down during the abrasive contro versies over school decentral ization, the busing of school children and the Forest Hills low‐income housing project. In the same way, he had to gloss over what was probably the most notable accomplish ment of his career in the As sembly, to which he was first elected in 1962. That was the enactment of the liberalized abortion law, which earlier this year received the seal of approval of the United States Supreme Court. It made him a hero on Riverside Drive and West End Avenue, but it was a serious handicap in appeal ing to both Catholic and Or thodox Jewish voters else where in the city. Conversely, the fact that Blumenthal served as deputy to Stanley Steingut, the minority leader of the Assembly and a ma chine man of such devotion as to make Abe Beame look like a bomb‐thrower by com parison, tended to make him suspect among reformers who demand the pristine, unadul terated product. Another problem was that refugees from the Lindsay ad ministràtion kept offering him their services. It was difficult to turn them down, particu larly for a little‐known and underfinanced candidate, but equally dangerous to be seen with them in public, since they were suffering from the political equivalent of leprosy, with a figurative bell hanging around their necks. So the intelligent and at tractive Blumenthal has had to run his campaign in a rather curious way, in an ef fort to gain at least a part of the decisive Jewish vote— something like 50 per cent of the total by most estimates— in the primary. He is a law and‐order liberal and supports scatter‐site housing and school busing, while believing that the communities con cerned should have some voice in such decisions. If the two Jewish candi dates (oddly, although the state has had Jewish Senators and Governors over the past 60 years, the city has never had a Jewish Mayor) symbol ized caution, hard work, self denial and respect for the law—the Protestant ethic, in short—the two Latins, Biaggi and Badillo, also seemed to embody certain typical quali ties. Both seemed proud, vain, vibrating with machismo. But Biaggi, the son of immigrants from Piacenza in the shadow of the Alps, his father a skilled marble‐setter, was the condottiere. He had led a squad of detectives and killed two men with his service re volver. But the vanity, it seemed, led to self‐delusion. In February, when rumors that he had invoked the Fifth Amendment were already cir culating, I told him in the course of an inter view that since he knew it was certain that the truth would come out one way or another before either the primary or the general election, it seemed out of the question that he lie. Indeed, if he had told the truth, and argued that he was being harassed because he was an Italian‐American, he might have minimized the damage to his candidacy, and perhaps eventually to his Congression al seat, which he otherwise could have held for as long. His decision seems all the stranger since it was clear from the start that he was not well equipped by tempera ment or experience to govern the city. During the brief period when he served as Biaggi's campaign manager, the madcap Matthew Troy, City Councilman and Demo cratic leader of Queens Coun ty, said he would spend a week giving the candidate a crash course on the issues. All Biaggi seemed to know at that point was that he was flatly opposed to busing— which really didn't matter much, since it was being done under Supreme Court mandate —and that he had opposed the Forest Hills project but not scatter‐site housing in principle. As to his one field of expertise, the crime prob lem, he kept repeating, in the manner of President Nixon, that he had a secret plan to get more cops on the street, but would not go into it until later in the campaign because he did not propose to run “a school for the other candi dates.” When it was finally re veah?d, the plan turned out to be the prying loose of some 2,500 members of the depart ment (who, Biaggi said, were clinging like barnacles to cushy administrative jobs) and replacing them with civil ians. It is a proposal that has been kicking around for 15 years or more, and has al ways been fiercely opposed by Biaggi's allies in the P.B.A. and other police organiza tions. IF Biaggi possesses, at least, a certain rough warmth, a confused and inarticulate sort of eloquence that speaks to the common man, Badillo seems almost crippled by an arrogance or reserve or under lying insecurity that prevents him, figuratively and literally, from putting his arm around another man's shoulder. It may be that, having been orphaned at the age of 5 in Puerto Rico, shuttled among relatives there, in East Har lem, Chicago and Burbank, Calif., and having with enor mous effort gained an educa tion, Badillo is incapable of relying on, or considering, but himself. However it may be, it is a fact that since early 1969, when, still only 39, he was too young to consider himself seri ously as a mayoral candidate, he has done little but make a series of blunders that have led to his isolation not only from the party as a whole but now from its reform wing. Although Blumenthal mount ed a major effort for the N.D.C. endorsement, it is ac cepted that he did not really win the designation, which made him a viable candidate, but that Badillo threw it away. “He acted like it was his by divine right,” said one of the other defeated seekers after the N.D.C. designation. “He couldn't be bothered talk ing to people, trying to win them around, giving them a promise that he would at least consider them for some job or other if he got elected.” Badillo's subsequent cries of “racism” were almost funny, considering the fact that he never fails to make clear that his own ancestry is entirely European, and his vow to “destroy” the N.D.C. has prob ably put any reconciliation out of the question for years to come, if an independent reform movement lasts that long. And while Badillo, as he says, probably has a certain amount of support among black voters, their leaders generally oppose him, both for personal reasons and because, unspoken, they find the idea offensive that a Puerto Rican might be elected Mayor, or hold citywide office, before a black. At the same time, Ba dillo was the only one of the candidates who gave his full support to the original Forest Hills project—and now says he was double‐crossed into doing it by Lindsay—and to school busing, which has pretty much destroyed his chances among white voters in the outer boroughs. So, except as the leader of the city's Puerto Ricans and their spokesman in Congress, it appears that Badillo, as they say, has a great future behind him. And many people, in cluding several who don't count themselves as his friends or supporters, regard this as a great pity, because he is generally acknowledged to be a man of singular abili ties. Indeed, if the mayoralty were awarded by civil service instead of being decided by the voters, Badillo might win it easily on the basis of his test score, his education—he qualified with high honors both as a lawyer and a cer tified public accountant—the wide range of his experience, his energy and intellect. NONE of the can didates is a ball of fire on the sidewalks of New York, but, as has fre quently been said, this may not be a good year for charis ma. The old Biaggi came closest, but even then he was picking his spots carefully, sticking pretty much to white ethnic neighborhoods, partic ularly those of his fellow Italian‐Americans, where he could be sure of an enthusi astic welcome. As far as I could learn, he did not ven ture into the black or Puerto Rican sections, although he often announced that he had no fears of doing so. Biaggi asserted that he understood them best of all the candi dates, having been assigned at one time to a Harlem pre cinct, and, quite correctly, that it was these groups that suffered most severely from crime. With his fine head of wavy graying hair, his full face, Roman nose and brilliant smile, his broad chest and careful tailoring, Biaggi pre sents at least the appearance of power and decisiveness. From the time he announced his candidacy, however, many observers said he would not be able to stand up under the pressure of a mayoral cam paign, and, by general agree ment, this seems to have been the case. As the charges and counter charges have swirled around him, Biaggi has tended to lose his composure, to show his nervousness in a variety of facial tics and twiches, and by the loss of his ability, never pronounced, to speak coherently when he wanders away from his set speech, in which he has been repeating the theme that he is the victim of a plot masterminded by Governor Rockefeller. All through the campaign, Blumenthal has had an iden tity problem. He was by all odds the least well known of the candidates, having repre sented only a West Side As sembly District for the past 11 years, and having made few appearances elsewhere in the city. Although he is a fine speak er and stands for all the civic virtues, Blumenthal, like Ba dillo, seems to have difficulty in creating an aura of warmth and receptiveness in small gatherings on handshaking tours. Like many reformers, he projects the feeling of poli tics‐as‐duty, and acts as though it would be fatal to his chances if he seemed to be enjoying himself at any time. Comparatively speaking, he is this year's silver‐spoon can didate. Like his three rivals, he went to city elementary and high schools. But while Beame and Badillo were work ing their way through City College, Blumenthal, the son of a lawyer, who grew up in tree‐shaded Flatbush, was en joying campus life at William and Mary, where, among oth er things, he played the bass in a dance orchestra. (Biaggi got into New York Law School in his mid‐40's on a scholarship, without having gone to college.) This relative ly comfortable background, and a life since then without crises or major complications, seems to reflect itself in the fact that Blumenthal is often taken for younger than his 44 years. Last year, when I wrote about Badillo's Congressional campaign in the Bronx, he asked me to be sure to men tion the fact that he stands 6 feet 1 inch. “Everyone auto matically thinks that, because you're Puerto Rican, you have to be short,” he said. This year, depending mainly on the Puerto Ricans, who may not all be short but few of whom are tall enough, say, to play professional basket ball, he told me he was de emphasizing the height issue. There always seems to be a quality of discomfort about Badillo when he is on the street, and one of the few times it looked as though it disappeared was when we walked together in the old East Harlem barrio to visit the apartment building—not quite a tenement—on 104th Street where he had lived briefly with an aunt after his arrival in the United States. The Latin high spirits there were infectious, and when a woman threw her arms around him, he hugged back with every appearance of en thusiasm. Certainly, if Beame wins tomorrow it will not be be cause he arouses great en thusiasm. Only partly because of the fact that he is about a foot shorter than Badillo, he tends to get lost in a crowd. “He has all the personality of a loaf of Wonder Bread,” a woman in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn told me, “but I'm going to vote for him.” What he does provide is the warmth of long acquain tance and the sense of a more stable past. Beame is almost the last of the gener ation of immigrants who ar rived here before World War I who are still active politi cally. He is a reminder of the city's vanished supremacy, of streets paved with gold, of brighter tomorrows. Beyond that there is the delayed realization that good looks and fine words—shades of Jimmy Walker and Bill O'Dwyer—can carry a city only so far, and that budgets and tax rates, the building of sewers, the floating of bonds come a good deal closer than homilies on the world situation to being what governing the city is all about. The city still likes a gam bler, even when he is an ac countant, and Beame, unlike any of his opponents, is stak ing everything on tomorrow's vote. He has given up his almost certain chance of re election as Controller to run for Mayor, and there will be no second chance for him, while the others still will have their present jobs if they lose. “That's all I ever wanted to be,” he told me, “Mayor of the greatest city in the world, and I think I'm going to get there at last.” ■"

It's Not What You Expect,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/its-not-what-you-expect-by-norma-klein-128-pp-new-york-pantheon.html,"If there were a single word to describe “It's Not What You Expect,” it might be “modest.” But “modest” only in the very best sense of that word: restrained, unpre tentious, calm, clear, unconfused. In the young adult genre, this is a rare set of attributes. Norma Klein, author of “Mom, the Wolf Man and Me,” is not only singularly adept at delineat ing fine female characters but knows she shouldn't impose Categorical Im peratives on her young readers. In deed her novels reveal that life is a mystery and a pretty good one, at that. Were this a novel for “adults,” the plot might seem old‐hat: an ad mirable if unaccomplished woman and her equally admirable but unac complished husband have a trial sep aration over the summer. The hus band—in the midst of the Fortyish Blues — flees to a bachelor apart ment so that he can finish the novel that even Carla, his 14 ‐ year ‐ old daughter, deems “lousy.” However, Carla is the narrator and so the reader is given a different set of problems and a different resolution. To salvage what portends to be an emotionally tense summer, Carla and her twin brother Oliver (a food maven) and her 18‐year‐old brother Ralph and several other young friends start a restaurant, and their project succeeds. Moreover, through some trip‐mechanism of fate, in men tioning Ralph's girlfriend's abortion to her mother, Carla discovers that her mother had not only had a love affair (and abortion) prior to meet ing Carla's father, but that the young men's tragic death had left deep—un speakably deep—scars. This revela tion, coming from a woman at a time when things seem to have hit rockbottom, makes Carla feel grown‐up, privileged to be fe male and closer to the woman whom she'd previously regarded as a maternal anomaly. When the marital crisis is over, Carla sees her parents as individuals with experiences and problems unconnected to the family. With her father's return, things aren't quite the same. How ever, as Oliver sagaciously ob serves, “They never were that way to begin with.” Through a natural (“modest”) blend of comedy and mellowed irony, the story comes across without much fuss. If Carla and Oliver with all their classi cal music and Gourmet maga zine hang‐ups seem a bit mid dle‐aged, well, that's the way kids are at 14. What many writers (not Norma Klein!) have forgotten is that while kids at this age may be quite knowledgeable in a factual sense, their sympathies are misered for themselves. It's only years of experience—vi carious and direct— that weld one's emotional response to the details of another person's life. In the words of Bob Dylan, “Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.”"
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/news-summary-and-index.html,"King Constantine II held a dramatic news conference in the garden, of his villa in Rome and said earnestly that he was confident of returning to Greece as guardian of consti tutional liberties. In a statement, in English, that he read to about 100 newsmen, the King said: “The real problem lies not in whether Greece should have a democracy with or without a King, but whether she should have a democracy at all, and whether the people of Greece has the right to be master of its fate and to enjoy its freedom.” [Page 1, Column 83. International Four senior officers of the Greek armed forces resigned as the security police con tinued to arrest supporters of King Constan tine II, deposed Friday by the Government. The resignations included the logistics chief and the deputy chief of the navy, shaken two weeks ago when a group within its janks attempted a coup. The Government, meanwhile, launched an intensive campaign to persuade Greeks of the value of the decree that abolished the 140‐year‐old monarchy and proclaimed Greece a republic. [1:7.] A terrorist shot and killed an American military adviser outside his home in Teheran, Iran, and then fled on a motorcycle driven by a second man, the United States Embassy reported. The embassy identified the slain American as Lieut. Col. Lewis Hawkins, 42 years old, of Plymouth, Ind. After the shoot ing, the Iranian police posted guards at American installations, including three American schools. [1:6.] National John W. Dean 3d has told the chief coun sel for thd Senate Watergate committee that he met alone and in small groups with Pres ident Nixon more than 40 times between last January and early April of this year, sources close to Mr. Dean said. Mr. Dean, the former White House counsel, said this, according to the sources, during a more than four‐hour private conference with Sam uel Dash, the committee counsel. In that confeience, Mr. Dean said he could supply firsthand testimony about those meetings that he believed would show that Mr. Nixon had “substantial knowledge” of what White House officials were doing about the Water gate investigation, one closely involved source said. [1:1.] Contrary to assertions in a sworn state ment by former White House aide Egil Krogh Jr., the Federal Bureau of Investigation had knowledge in late June, 1971, that the Soviet Government did not possess the Pentagon papers before they were published by The New York Times, according to Justice De partment sources. These sources said that although the bulk of the top‐secret Defense Department study of the Vietnam war was mysteriously delivered to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, it did not arrive until after The Times had printed its first three install ments from the papers and had been placed under a temporary court order that halted their publication. [1:2.] A Los Angeles County grand jury will be gin its investigation Tuesday of the break‐in at the office of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg's psychia trist, and it has two main questions to ex plore: Who knew about the break‐in before and after it happened, and was their conduct criminal? “We are interested in whether or not there was a conspiracy to commit a crime or burgalry or malicious trespassing,” explained District Attorney Joseph P. Busch in an interview. “We know a certain group had certain authority to a certain thing. Whether that amounted to criminal activity depends on what the witnesses have to say,” Mr. Busch said.

[1:8.] Wednesday is graduation day at the United States Air Force Academy In Colo rado Springs, and 844 members of the Class of 1973 are preparing themselves for what academy officials hope will be a display of pride, purpose and shorter haircuts. It is an annual day to renew faith in the 18‐year‐ old academy, but that won't be easy this year. The academy is in trouble, and its cadets are leaving in record numbers. [1:3.] Chicago on Friday became the first city in the nation to begin mandatory tests on the exhaust emissions of private motor vehicles. The tests also were among the first of a variety of measures that states and munici palities across the country must begin tak ing in the months ahead as they strive to meet Federal air quality standards that will take effect in mid‐1975. [1:2–5.] Metropolitan Seven crew members were dead, nine others were missing and presumed dead after an American cargo ship, outbound in the early morning darkness, impaled her prow amid ships of an oil‐laden Belgian tanker at anchor in the Narrows of New York Harbor, touching off an inferno of explosion and fire. The American ship was the Sea Witch, a 610‐foot containership. She plowed into the starboard side of the 700‐foot Esso Brussels, spilling oil from the tanker that ignited and covered the surrounding water with flames, which partially engulfed both ships. [1:3–6.] With voter turnout vitally imiortant to their fortunes in tomorrow's primary, four Democratic mayoral candidates mobilized their campaign workers this weekend to get out big votes in areas where they expect to run well. Several thousand campaign work ers distributed last‐minute campaign litera ture, electioneered in telephone calls and prepared to man as many of the city's 4,569 election district polls as possible. [1:4–5.] A wide‐ranging traffic control program, described as one of the most sweeping of its kind in the city's history, is scheduled to begin here on July 1. Details of the plan will not be released for another week or 10 days, but it was learned that the program includes the designation of traffic control of ficers, who would direct traffic at intersec tions and would issue summonses for some moving vehicular violations. [1:1–2.] New Jersey's bitterly contested Repub lican primary election campaign for Gover nor, dominated by charges of corruption and confronted with apparent widespread public cynicism and apathy, ended this weekend with each of the two major candidates charging that the nomination of the other would wreck the party.

Arizona Regents Act to Allow Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/03/archives/arizona-regents-act-to-allow-abortions.html,"PHOENIX, Ariz., June 2— Overriding legislative opposi tion, the Arizona State Board of Regents has voted after three weeks of controversy to permit abortions at the state funded University of Arizona Hospital in Tucson. Almost all of the state's pub lic officials have been vehe ment in opposition to the Su preme Court's landmark ruling since it was announced Jan. 22. State Representative James Skelly of Phoenix, a leader of the anti‐abortion forces, intro duced a memorial to Congress urging a constitutional amend ment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision. The proposed memorlal passed three State house committees but was bottled up in a fourth. On May 8, Mr. Skelly an nounced that he had learned that the University of Arizona Hospital was performing abor tions. He said that he had enough votes to kill the $518‐ million general appropriations bill then before the Legislature if the University Hospital did not alter its policy. The university responded by ordering a moratorium on abor tions until the Regents could consider the matter, and the ap propriations bill was passed. Last Tuesday, the Regents voted 5 to 3 to allow abortions at the hospital, which is a teach ing institution. The Regents, all except one of whom were appointed by the state's current Republican Gov ernor, Jack Williams, are con servative. Most of those who voted to permit abortions cited their personal objections to abortions, but said that they felt bound by the opinion of the State Attorney General that the university must comply with the Supreme Court ruling. The Regents rejected the ar gument of one Regent, Weldon P. Shofstall, who compared the Supreme Court's decision on abortion with the Court's earlier decision on school prayers. Mr. Skelly was critical of the Regents' action, saying that they should have waited until court action forced them to per mit abortions. He said that he was optimis tic that courts would uphold the right of any hospital, public or private, to refuse to perform abortions. He said that he planned to reintroduce his anti abortion memorial in the next Legislature. State Representative Frank Kelley, a Republican and the majority whip, agreed that “the overwhelming sentiment in the Legislature now is to be as re strictive as possible.” But he disputed Mr. Skelly's contention that a tide of anti abortion public sentiment was building. “Unless there are some serious abuses, some flagrant abuse of the whole process, I think it's pretty well going to die down,” Mr. Kelley said. Currently in Arizona, county hospitals and some large pri vate hospitals in the Phoenix and Tucson areas are perform ing abortions. Ruth Green, director of Planned Parenthood in Tucson, said that Arizona abortion costs continued to be high, ranging from $225 to $350. “If I needed an abortion today, and my only concern were money, it would still be cheaper for me to go to California,” she said. Planned Parenthood, which processes 200 or more abortion cases each month, has applied for permission to operate an abortion clinic in Tucson. The organization is meeting with increasing success in per suading local physicians to perform reduced‐rate abortions for women whose income is too high for county hospital eligibil ity but who cannot afford the going rate for private hospital abortions, Mrs. Green said. A continuing problem, she said, is that the less populous counties in Arizona have their county hospital services pro vided by private hospitals, which in some cases refuse to perform abortions.

Pressure Grows for U.S. Rules on Intrauterine Devices,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/04/archives/pressure-grows-for-u-s-rules-on-intrauterine-devices-three-million.html,"Charges last week that cer tain intrauterine devices are not as safe or effective as their manufacturers contend have created pressures in Congress that may lead ultimately to a long‐awaited requirement that the birth control devices be cleared for marketing by the Federal Food and Drug Ad ministration. Several gynecologists told hearings of the House Inter governmental Relations sub committee last week that they had encountered higher‐than expected pregnancy rates with some IUD's and serious compli cations with others, including infection, heavy bleeding, diffi culty in removing the device and spontaneous abortion when pregnancy occurred with the device in place. While the doctors' charges are not new, Congressional sources say they are expected to spark interest in proposed legislation that would give F.D.A. premarketing authority over medical devices. Under the legislation, the safety and ef fectiveness of intrauterine de vices—which are classified as medical devices rather than drugs—would have to be dem onstrated to F.D.A.'s satisfac tion before they could be marketed. Currently, only new drugs must undergo such premarket testing, and when they are marketed they must include a statement of the test results in the package and in advertise ments. In every Congress since 1966, legislation has been introduced to give F.D.A. similar premar keting authority over certain medical devices, including IUD's, but no bill has yet come to a vote. Three Million Users In the absence of specific enabling legislation, the Federal watchdog agency has been re luctant to assume such author ity over IUD's, which are currently used for contracep tion by an estimated three million American women. “We were afraid that every decision classifying such‐and such a device as a drug could have resulted in a court chal lenge to our classification,” Larry R. Pilot, of the F.D.A.'s Office of Medical Devices, ex plained in an interview. While the drug agency was debating how to deal with IUD's, they became the nation's fastest growing method of birth control, with a steady stream of new types of devices placed on the market, none of which had to pass Federal inspection. Several years ago, the F.D.A. decided to recall all so‐called “closed‐type” IUD's after re ceiving reports of several deaths that occurred when the devices escaped from the uterus and trapped a piece of intestine. And ten days ago, with the Congressional hearings pending, the F.D.A. finally acted to halt distribution of a type of IUD known as the Majzlin Spring, about which the agency had been receiving adverse medical reports since 1970. Mr. Pilot told the Congres sional hearing Friday that his agency has begun an extensive investigation of concerns that manufacture IUD's to collect all reports—pro and con—that the companies have received about their products. Among the several dozen that have been devised, the most common types of IUD's currently in use are the Lippes Loop, the Saf‐T‐Coil, the Dalkon Shield and the still‐experi mental Copper‐T. The Copper‐T and other experimental devices that incorporate heavy metals or chemicals to act as con traceptives, have been classified as drugs and must pass through the premarket testing procedure for regular drugs. IUD's are hardly a new con cept in contraception. Perhaps, the first IUD wearer was the female camel, whose uterus, used to be fitted with a stone to prevent pregnancy during long journeys across the desert. In the early part of this cen tury, a variety of intrauterine devices were experimented with but a host of serious complica tions ensued and this approach to contraception fell into dis repute until the nineteen‐sixties. It is still not known precisely how IUD's act to prevent preg nancy. Current evidence points to a local action in the uterus that somehow incapacitates the sperm or the egg. According to Dr. Elizabeth B. Connell, who has headed fam ily planning services, at Colum bia University and Metro politan Hospital, the IUD comes close to being an “ideal” con traceptive in that its use is removed from the sex act, requires little motivation on the part of the user and is generally highly effective in preventing pregnancy. In terms of effectiveness, studies have shown that the IUD ranks as levseffective than the pill but mere effective than such traditional methods as the diaphragm and condom or the newer chemical foams. The pill, when used consistently, results in an average of one pregnancy per 1,000 women a year; the IUD, when in place, results in from one to three pregnancies per 100 women a year. Advertising for the Dalkon Shield claims that it is among the most effective of the devices —a claim that was challenged in the hearings last week. A recent study conducted in 11 family planning clinics in the United Kingdom showed that the shield was no better than the loop or coil. A number of physicians and some Planned Parenthood clin ics recommended enhancing the IUD's effectiveness by using contraceptive foam when inter course takes place in the middle of the menstrual cycle, the time when conception is most likely to occur. Should conception occur with an IUD in place, numerous studies have shown that about half of the resulting preg nancies are spontaneously aborted within a month or two. Pregnancies that proceed beyond the first few months generally are unaffected by the presence of the IUD, the studies have indicated. The biggest problem with the IUD is not what happens when it is in place, but the difficulty in keeping it in place. For every 100 women given IUD's, only 75 to 80 can be expected to be still wearing them at the end of a year. Some of the women—ranging from about 2 to 20 per cent, depending on the woman and the device used—spontaneously expel the IUD. Between 10 and 15 per cent can be expected to request that the device be re moved, usually because of excessive menstrual bleeding, bleeding between periods or cramping. While these rather common side effects of the IUD usually subside after a few months of use, some women find them intolerable. Dangers Exist Thus far, there seems to be no good way to predict in advance which women will be unable to wear IUD's (generally, the expulsion and removal rate is highest in women who have never borne children), and sometimes one device will work in a woman where others have failed. The most common serious side effect that has been asso ciated with the IUD is uterine perforation—a piercing of the wall of the uterus, usually while the device is being in serted. Studies have shown, however, that perforation is very rare when the physician is experienced in inserting IUD's. On the average, the perforation rate is about four in 10,000 insertions. Another serious side effect has been pelvic infection, but recent improvements in sterile packaging, insertion techniques and patient selection have greatly reduced the incidence of this complication. Generally, the IUD is not recommended for women who have pelvic inflammatory dis ease or an abnormally shaped uterus, a history of very pain ful or heavy periods, or a his tory of cancer of the cervix or uterus. An IUD does not appear to have a permanent effect on fertility. Once the device is removed, a woman desiring to become pregnant has the same chance of conceiving as some one who has never used an IUD, according to medical reports. GIVE A KID A BREAK.

Strengthening Family Solidarity With a Home Evening Program,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/04/archives/strengthening-family-solidarity-with-a-home-evening-program.html,"To many casual observers, the American family of the mid‐20th century appears headed down the drain in a swirl of divorce, drugs, venereal disease, alcohol, adultery and group sex. “Marriage Is passe!” is a rallying cry of many young people. Children are passe, they say. The family is passe. But for at least one sizable group in American society, the family is still the thing. The group is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints (Mormon), and their way of attacking delinquency and deteriorating morality is to strengthen family solidar ity through a Monday night get‐together in the home called the “family home evening.” This is the time, usually about 7 P.M., when Mormon families pray together, sing together, talk out their prob lems together, study their genealogy together, play games together, and then, usually, have an extra special dessert that they saved over from dinner. Schedule Interferes “It's particularly important in your children's younger years to lay the ground rules at family home evenings,” said Harmon Killebrew, the hard‐hitting first baseman of the Minnesota Twins. “If you know those rules, it helps you play the game of life better.” Mr. Killebrew, a convert to his wife's Mormon faith, said that because of his trav els during the baseball sea son his family (the Killebrews have five children) could not always have their family home evenings on Mondays. “It's catch‐as‐catch‐can,” he said, in a telephone inter view from his home in Prior Lake, Minn. “But we always fit it in somewhere during the week,” he added, noting that his favorite meetings were those that included a dessert of homemade ice cream. The family home evening program was conceived in 1915 by Joseph F. Smith, then president of the Mormon church, who said that if Mor mons gathered their children around them once a week to instruct them in the gospel, those children would “not go astray.” A more organized program began nine years ago, with the publication of the church's first Family Home Evening manual, an annual guide to parents in planning weekly religious studies, wholesome recreation activ ities, even suggestions for refreshments. More than 675,000 copies of the 1972–73 manual were printed, in 17 languages. The church's emphasis on the family home evening pro gram is led by its current president, 74‐year‐old Harold B. Lee, of Salt Lake City. His counsel that “the home is the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place nor fulfill its essential function” is widely quoted in Mormon literature. Today, family home eve ning programs are held for inmates of the Utah State Prison, as well as in homes of such prominent Mormons as George Romney, former Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Devel opment; Billy Casper, the golfer; Johnny Whitaker, the child actor; J. Willard Marri ott, founder and chairman, Marriott, Inc.; Jack Ander son, the syndicated Washing ton coumnist; David M. Kennedy, former Secretary of the Treasury; and the Os mond Brothers, the recording stars. “We started singing through our family home evenings,” said Alan Osmond, 24, the oldest and leader of the five singing brothers, who have 12 gold records. “Our parents always made us get up and juggle or turn ble or tell what we had learned, and it was just easier to get up and sing.” A Source of Stability Speaking from the family's home in Provo, Utah, Alan said that the Osmond family home evening was “always something we looked forward to, mother getting out the best silver by candlelight, or cooking popcorn in the fire place, or the whole family going roller skating.” Mormons point with pride to their low diyorce rate. Ac cording to a 1969 study made at Brigham Young University in Provo, the Harvard of the Mormon educational system, only 6 of 205 temple mar riages ended in divorce. (Couples married in one of the 15 Mormon temples throughout the world are considered sealed together in an “eternal marriage.”) Of 150 marriages performed outside the temple where both partners were Mor mons, 21 ended in divorce. Of 25 marriages where only one partner was a Mormon, 6 ended in divorce. According to Government statistics, there is currently one divorce for every three new marriages in the United States. In 1972, there were 2,210,000 marriages and 788, 000 divorces. Mormons also believe that family stability is encouraged through members' abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea (many families also abstain from cola drinks), their encouragement of large families, and their belief that abortion is wrong. A typical family home evening was held on a recent Monday in the David P. For syth home in North Caldwell, N. J. It began with the par ents and their three blond children, Tamara, 15, Tod, 14, and Terence, 9, kneeling in prayer. (A fourth child, Tom, 11, is a student at a school for the deaf in Tren ton.) The Forsyths then thumbed through their Book of Re membrance, a scrapbook of family genealogy. Much em phasis is put on remember ing forefathers in Mormon homes, in accordance with the church's teachings to seek out one's ancestors as a means of tying children to the past. The meeting also included a slighly off‐key duet by Tod and Terence—“Dearest Chil dren, God is With You,” written by their maternal great‐grandfather—and lis tening to a tape recording of their paternal great‐grand father, who talked about the old days in Utah. After the 45‐minute meet ing was over, the Forsyths gathered around a table laden with root beer, chocolate chip cookies and popcorn, and talked about what it was like to be among the 11,500 Mormons living in the New York metropolitan area. (The church's United States mem bership is 2,134,000; world wide, it is over 3 million.) “Every time I get into a conversation, someone brings up the subject of polygamy —even though they know full well I have only one wife,” Mr. Forsyth, vice pres ident of a New Jersey pub lication management consult ing firm, said with a grin. “I tell them Mormons no longer practice plural mar riage, but that my maternal grandmother was a polyga mous wife and that she was a wonderful woman.” College Is a Goal The Forsyth children, like many Mormon youngsters, said they hoped to go to Brigham Young University, and then get married in a temple and have an “eternal marriage” as their parents do. “I wouldn't mind dating boys who weren't of my faith,” Tamara said, “but would never marry one.” A rather elaborate family home evening was held re cently in the Weston Edwards home in Scarsdale, where each of the 12 children took turns presenting a lesson with a Biblical moral. The lessons involved costumes, homemade visual aids and props. “One of my favorite family evenings was the night we pretended we were making a journey to the celestial king dom,” Mrs. Edwards recalled. “We started with being born in the basement, were tempted [by food] in the kitchen, worked our way, up through temple marriage in the bed room, and entered the celes tial kingdom on the third floor.” Several members of the Ed wards family said they had been criticized by ecology minded people because of the large size of their family. The bespectacled Mr. Ed wards, who is president of a relocation management com pany and holds a doctorate in business administration from Harvard, said he usually answered critics by saying that the economic conse quences of zero population growth would be far more serious for this country's world position than most peo ple realize. “People in school always tell me that large families are ruining the country,” said Marianna Edwards, an attrac tive 18‐year‐old, who will be a freshman at Brigham Young University next fall. “I say that people in Rome were hav ing only two children before Rome fell, and that the most important thing is people power.” Students at Scarsdale High School have other “strange ideas” about Mormons, Mari anna said, such as thinking they still practice polygamy, don't use cosmetics, wear dresses down to their ankles and their hair pulled back in buns. The Edwards children glee fully recalled a recent drink ing contest where a Mormon high school basketball star defeated another player. The Mormon drank milk; his op ponent drank beer. Still, although the Edwards family prays together, travels together in their 15‐passenger van, and sometimes attends church in Scarsdale every day of the week, there has been some minor strife in the family. The youngsters don't especially care for the rule that you must be 16 to date, and 14‐year‐old Charles was especially miffed by the no kissing rule. “My dad and I discussed it one day for 2½ hours,” Char les said. “I won.” So far, according to his mother, Charles has parlayed his de bating triumph into kissing one girl—on the cheek, Donny Osmond, left, leads Mormon family home evening in Provo, Utah; the Weston Ed wards family, above, used visual aids in their get‐together; David P. Forsyth family, right, glances at its Book of Remembrance album."
Supreme Court's Actions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/05/archives/supreme-courts-actions-abortion-civil-rights-discrimination.html,"WASHINGTON, June 4—The Supreme Court took the following actions today: ABORTION Returned to District Court for revision in the light of the Supreme Court's January ruling against curbs on all but late‐term abortions, two cases that permitted welfare mothers to obtain free abor tions under New York's medicaid program. (No. 72 770, Commissioner of Social Services v. Klein; and No. 72 803, Nassau County Medical Center v. Klein).

COURT BACKS FEES TO AID RACE SUITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/05/archives/court-backs-fees-to-aid-race-suits-role-of-lawyers-in-school.html,"WASHNGTON, June 4—In a move to encourage school de segregation lawsuits, the Su preme Court ruled today that the lawyers who prosecute such cases successfully are en titled to fees paid by govern mental agencies under all but “special circumstances.” “The plaintiffs in school cases,” a unanimous Court de clared, “are ‘private attorneys general’ vindicating national policy” in the same sense as those who bring suits to de segregate hotels and restau rants, for whom the Court ap proved counsel fees in 1968. The ruling involved a suc cessful effort to win Court authorization for a desegrega tion of the Memphis public school system, which was brought by attorneys for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. These lawyers later moved in the United States Court of Ap peals for the Sixth Circuit for an award of costs and legal fees. The court denied the mo tion without any explanation, and the lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court. The size of legal fees award ed in any court case is normal ly set by the court and assessed as a charge on the losing party. In the cases affected by today's ruling, when a city, county or school board resists a desegre gation action and loses, all court costs, including the legal expenses of the successful plaintiffs, will now be paid out of tax revenues. The Supreme Court con cluded that parties who win school desegregation cases “should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.” It said that its purpose was “to encourage individuals in jured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief,” as they already can in cases in volving places of public accom modation. The Court sent the case back to the Court of Appeals to determine whether there were any factors that should pre vent an award of legal fees in the Memphis case. The Jus tices specified that their ruling applied only to cases finally decided after July 1, 1972, when an enabling statute be came effective. Officials of the Legal De fense Fund predicted that the decision might deter school boards from defending desegre gation cases when the strength of their case was in doubt. Such defenses are financed with public tax money, which will now underwrite the other side of the case when it proves successful. ABORTIONS IN NEW YORK In another decision, the high court sent back to Federal Dis trict Court for revision two New York abortion cases brought by welfare mothers who had argued that their pregnancies should be term Inated at state expense under the Medicaid program. Without any explanation, the Justices instructed the lower court to undertake “further consideration” of the two cases in the light of the Supreme Court's abortion decision of last January. In that decision, the court ruled that a state could only regulate abortions in the last six months of pregnancy and only prohibit the practice in the final 10 weeks. In the cases remanded today for revision, the District Court has invalidated the policy of the New York State Commis sioner at Social Services that prohibited welfare mothers from obtaining abortions. The District Court ruling was based on the grounds that the state ruling was a form of discrimi nation against the poor. Legal authorities speculated that the Supreme Court would expect the District Court to amend its decision by adding such guidelines as these: An indigent pregnant woman should be required to obtain the advice of a doctor before seek ing a free Medicaid abortion. Such abortions should be available for the first 30 weeks of pregnancy, following the Su preme Court's timetable, rather than for 24, following the New York Abortion Law of 1970. These were the most obvious discrepancies between the high court's earlier ruling and the District Court decision in the welfare abortion cases. In a related ruling, the Su preme Court affirmed a deci sion rejecting a protest that abortion for welfare mothers violated the right of their living but unborn children. G.I. LIQUOR SALES In a Mississippi case, the Court held that the state could not charge suppliers a mark‐up on liquor they brought into the state for sale at military instal lations, where the Federal Gov ernment has exclusive jurisdic tion. The vote was 7 to 2. DEPORTATION TO ITALY The Court also gave tacit approval to th deputation of Russell Bufalino, one of the delegates to the Apalachin gangland convention of 1957. by declining to review a deci sion ordering him returned to Italy. The Government has been trying to deport him since a month after the upstate New York meeting."
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/06/archives/klein-to-quit-july-1-notes-on-people.html,"The resignation of Herbert G. Klein, the White House Communications Director since the start of the first Nixon Administration, was accepted by the President “with deepest personal re gret.” Mr. Klein, whose resig nation takes effect July 1, will become a vice president with Metromedia, Inc., with headquarters in Los Angeles. The 55‐year‐old Mr. Klein, who has been a friend of the President for 27 years, said in an interview that a recent report describing him as crit ical of White House aides involved in the Watergate scandals was inaccurate. Mr. Klein also denied that in re cent years he had been placed in a relatively remote position from the Adminis tration policy‐making level. He denied too that he had been given a subordinate role in the President's re‐election campaign last year, noting that he traveled 65,000 miles during the campaign. • In London, replacements were named for Lords Jellicoe and Lambton, who resigned from Cabinet posts after their relationships with prostitutes were disclosed. Lord Windle sham, a top assistant of Wil liam Whitelaw, Secretary for Northern Ireland, will replace Lord Jellicoe as Lord Privy Seal and leader of the House of Lords. Replacing Lord Lambton as Under Secretary of Defense for the Royal Air Force will be Anthony Ker shaw, who has been an Un der Secretary in the Foreign Office. • What did Princess Anne of Britain and Lieut. Mark Phillips, her fiancé, and their friends, do at a Monday night party at Wolf sgarten Castle, near Frankfurt, West Germany? Well, according to Princess Margaret of Hes sia, who is Princess Anne's cousin, “We had dinner and walked in the garden.” • Someone, presumably, had to be the first Third Deputy City Controller to earn a Doc tor of Philosophy degree in public administration by go ing to school at night. That distinction now belongs to Melvin N. Lechner, who te ceived a Ph. D. from New York University. Mr. Lechner work for Controller Abraham D. Beame, who is seeking the Democratic mayoral nomina tion, and a Beame aide said yesterday that while some people in the Controller's of fice were thinking of calling Mr. Lechner “Doctor,” Mr. Beame would continue to call him “Melvin.” “Well, my friend, how are you?” said President Nixon as he greeted President Wil liam R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia at the White House. Then, as ceremonial trumpets blared, the two Presidents embraced and posed for photographs. Mr. Tolbert is on a 20‐day tour of this country. • Australia's outspoken Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, has spoken out on two more is sues of vital interest in his country. In a television inter view, he castigated a Roman Catholic Bishop who had op posed the liberalized abortion law proposals of the Labor party. But some of the words the Prime Minister reported ly used—such as “wicked ... contemptible . . . liar” were obliterated on television by bleeps. The Bishop, the Most Rev. Denis Stewart, of Sand hurst, Victoria, said “God will determine my wicked not Mr. Whitlam.” In New Delhi on a visit, the Prime Minister shrugged his shoulders when asked about the censorship of his words, which led The Sydney Daily Mirror to comment, “If Gough gives a bleep, he isn't saying.” On another topic, Mr. Whitlam said in India that “Waltzing Matilda” would probably replace “God Save the Queen” as the Aus tralian national anthem as the result of a contest being conducted by the Govern ment."
Judge Rules Law on Abortions In Montana Is Unconstitutional,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/06/archives/judge-rules-law-on-abortions-in-montana-is-unconstitutional.html,"MISSOULA, Mont., June 5 (AP)—A United States District Court judge has declared Mon tana's entire abortion statute unconstitutional, leaving the state with no prohibition against abortions.  The order issued by Judge Russell Smith said Montana's law was basically no different from the laws of Texas and Georgia that the United States Supreme Court struck down earlier this year. Judge Smith's order, signed yesterday, said that the Mon tana Legislature's failure to tailor a new law to fit the Supreme Court decision meant the state abortion laws were “unconstitutional and void in their entirety.” The Montana law prohibited abortions except to save the life of the mother. The Supreme Court's guidelines said that states might not interfere with the, right of a woman to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy and might interfere during the sec ond three months only to reg ulate the medical safety of abortions. Louisiana Passes Bills BATON ROUGE, June 5 (AP) —The Louisiana Legislature to day passed a package of five bills aimed at making abortions as inaccessible as possible with out violating a United States Supreme Court decision."

Many Hospitals in City Withhold Contraception After Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/11/archives/many-hospitals-in-city-withholdcontraception-after-abortions-a.html,"A study of women who have had more than one abortion in New York City hospitals has disclosed that although, nearly 9 out of 10 requested contraception before leaving the hospital, only two‐fifths got the method they asked for and nearly half got no method at all. Of those who got a different method than the one they had requested, nearly all got some thing less effective than what they had wanted. This finding, released yester day, puts a new perspective on the reasons why some women have repeated unwanted preg nancies. Slime all patients aborted at city hospitals and abortion clinics are supposed to receive postabortion con traceptive counseling, the wo men themselves are usually blamed for a second unwanted pregnancy. A Lesson Is Cited The authors of the study, published in the current issue of Family Planning Perspec tives, the national journal of Planned Parenthood‐World Population, said that their find ings should be a lesson for all facilities providing abortions, especially as more medical in stitutions around the country are beginning to establish or expand abortion services. As a result of the findings, the authors said, several munic ipal hospitals here have modi fied their postabortion contra ceptive policies. Much of the difficulty seemed to stem from, a policy at some hospitals not to provide con traception until the first visit after the abortion, which is usually set up for about six weeks later. However, recent research has indicated that 85 per cent of women become fertile within a few weeks after an induced abortion, and virtu ally all ovulate within the first five weeks. Besides, the authors pointed out, a third or more abortion patients never return for their six‐week checkup. Increase in Repeaters The study, conducted by Dr. Edwin F, Daily, Nick Nicholas, Freida Nelson and Dr. Jean Pakter, all of the New York City ‘Department of Health, in dicated that about 2.5 per cent of city residents receiving abor tions between July 1, 1970 (when the new state law took effect) and June 30, 1972, had returned for a second. abortion. During the last six months of the study period, the per centage of abortion repeaters had increased to 6 per cent. Repeat abortions were most common among white women and women in their twenties. Three hundred and fifty‐five women were interviewed after their second abortion. Of the total, 306 had requested con traception before leaving the hospital, but 140 got no method at all and 40 got a method that was less effective than the one they requested. According to the findings, of the 31 women who requested sterilization, only three were sterilized and 19 got nothing. Of the 85 requesting IUD's, 42 had them inserted and 30 got nothing. Of the 148 women who asked for birth control pills, 75 got them and 66 re ceived nothing."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/11/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-ervin-hearings-and-the-pursuit-of-truth.html,"To the Editor: Senator Sam Ervin was stating a truism when he told John J. Caulfield that “our greatest conflicts arise when we must choose between our loyalties.” The current debate raging over whether Senator Ervin's committee should con tinue his open, televised hearings represents such a choice for the American people. The choice is whether we want the truth to come out as soon, as clearly and as openly as possible or whether we want to rely on the slow, secretive and technical process of the judicial system. On the one band, our faith in and loyalty to the American system of checks and balances is pulling at us; on the other hand, our faith and loyalty to a “rule of law” is strongly at work. In a normal case, I think most of us would favor the latter choice; but there are, I think, many points in favor of choosing the first procedure in view of the unique seriousness of the matter: ¶Public cynicism: Distrust of any form of secretive procedure in relation to this case is obvious among the American electorate. Re‐establishing some semblance of faith in the system of checks and balances is more im portant than extracting some form of legal vengeance against those guilty. At this time, the plea for semisecre tive criminal procedures reeks of last‐gasp effort to conceal whatever can be concealed. ¶Expediency: The United States Government is in a state of near paralysis and will remain that way as long as the Watergate affair is unclear. Open hearings are the fastest way to get the facts out in the open. This affair is a predominantly political affair, and if we are to follow the in tentions of the Constitution, the facts must be open to political debate as soon as possible. We must do our best to keep politics separate from the legal proceedings; but the former takes precedence over the latter. ¶Public censure: It is always im portant in a society that respects law to prosecute those guilty of a crime. But in this case, public censure of the guilty would be as effective as prose cution. The diabolical and arrogant nature of the affair is the real cancer, and that cancer must be openly and forthrightly exposed and eliminated from our political system. The point of the Ervin hearings is to re‐establish true legitimacy in our political process. Whether Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, Mitchell et al., spend one day in jail matters little to me. If they are proven guilty but spared jail sentences because of legal technicalities, their disgrace and dis honor will not be any less real, and that will be vengeance enough. The important point is that our political system must be set aright as quickly as possible. BILL DICKENS East Lansing, Mich., June 4, 1973 To the Editor: The George Washington syndrome is a malady that is now well endemic in our culture and has perhaps spread to others. This is the ploy so well used by little George when he success fully avoided punishment by his father by simply owning up about his cherry tree axing. Not only did he avoid punishment, he was even lauded for “telling the truth.” Since little George's day that myth has become not only a well ingrained lesson for every American schoolchild but sometimes a useful tool of the manipulator. Obviously, the truth is to be re spected. But one cannot help think back to little George when one be comes exposed to the use of the syndrome in our daily lives. Senator Sam Ervin of the Watergate commit tee was even blatant in his use of when he announced that “we are interested in putting anyone in jail, but in just getting to the truth.” We must not allow ourselves to be duped further by those who would carry out criminal acts and then claim immunity from punishment simply be cause they “own up.” By the same token, everyone who is guilty of crime would merely plead so to avoid retribution. Good citizens are required to be honest in action, not only in word. DON SLOAN, M.D. New York, June 3, 1973 Penn Central: ‘Asking For a Major Catastrophe’ To the Editor: The recent fire on a Penn Central locomotive in the Park Avenue tunnel brought an inquiry into why the rail road took so long to notify the Fire Department of the blaze. Some months back, there was a similar fire and an other charge that Penn Central delayed in calling the Fire Department. Now the railroad will be given slap on the wrist and be made to promise to call the Fire Department sooner the next time. Inured though we are to the va garies and disasters on Penn Central (note what happened at Redding, Conn., two weeks ago), we commuters are extremely uneasy about the pros pect of “the next time.” We know it is bound to come. What I wonder about is the attitude of the public authorities who permit the railroad to send out locomotives and other equip ment that is undermaintained and not in serviceable condition. The Penn Central has shown itself incompetent and now irresponsible. It needs keeper—someone who will say “that train is not in condition to run today.” So far we all can consider ourselves lucky. Aside from the man who lost his life in Connecticut, what's a little vomiting from smoke inhalation? The railroad, the public authorities, the commuters are asking for it—a major catastrophe—one where the Fire De partment won't have to be notified. It will be so big it will be heard from one end of the line to the other. JAMES O. RICE Bronxville, N. Y., June 5, 1973 For a Day in the Park To the Editor: It is simply ludicrous that Mayor Lindsay, a man who does all his traveling via chauffeured limousine, should decide and put into effect plan prohibiting eight million New York residents from traveling into and out of their parks by car. By doing so Mayor Lindsay shows his contempt and disregard of families with babies, with elderly and crippled persons, for those people whose sole vacation is a picnic in the park, in contrast to his weekends in the Caribbean or Europe. The people should let their voices be heard about this restriction so that it may be rescinded in time for the parks to be enjoyed this summer. BLANCHE DREYFUSS Kew Gardens, N. Y., June 3, 1973 ‘Ashes for the Country’ To the Editor: Dr. Ellsberg admitted that he stole Government papers and delivered them to the newspapers, and you printed them. On what grounds do you lecture the President of the United States? Your conduct at this point dis courages belief in freedom of the press. Though you disapprove of his actions and his methods and dislike him personally, Mr. Nixon Is President and will be for some time. Harassment of him by the press can only help turn whatever wrong has been done into possible disaster. Any seeming profit from it will surely end in ashes for the press and the country. DAVID P. GAINES Waterbury, Conn., May 25, 1973 The Canadian Alternative To the Editor: In his May 22 column on the trans Alaska pipeline controversy, Robert Bendiner discussed the Canadian alter native to this pipeline without ade quately considering the numerous economic and energy implications of these two alternatives. While we are extremely concerned with the environmental consequences of a trans‐Alaska pipeline, we are equally concerned that the Midwest and East—where fuel prices are high est and reliance on foreign oil is greatest—will not receive the oil they need if such a route is followed. A trans‐Canadian line could easily ship part of its production to the West Coast—through existing pipelines from Edmonton to Seattle but a trans Alaskan pipeline would mean that the entire area East of the Rockies would be virtually cut off from Alaskan oil. Mr. Bendiner also stated that $8 billion in Canadian capital would be required for a trans‐Canadian line. In actuality, a trans‐Canada line would cost about $3.5 billion to $4 billion, and the equity portion of that cost would be only 20 per cent, or $700 million to $800 million. Therefore, Canada's insistence on majority equity ownership of such a line would mean that it would need to raise only about $400 million, well within the reach of Canadian capital markets. Mr. Bendiner states that current po litical conditions in Canada render approval of a trans‐Canadian oil line improbable. However, the ultimate de cision on such a line would rest with the Canadian Energy Board—not Par liament—and would not be subject to review by Parliament. No one would suggest that a trans Canadian oil line—or a trans‐Alaskan line—is without problems. Legislation we have introduced along with fifteen other Senators (S. 1565) provides for a study and negotiations with Canada over the next year to find the answers to these problems. At that point, a Congressional decision not subject to litigation would get one line or the other moving quickly, rather than sub jecting us to years of delay in the courts on a trans‐Alaskan line. This solution, we believe, will actu ally speed the delivery of North. Slope oil, by either a Canadian or an Alaskan route. It will give us the information neither we nor Mr. Bendiner currently possess on the feasibility of a trans Canadian line. And it will allow Con gress to make the final decision on project which will affect American energy policy for decades. (Senator) WALTER F. MONDALE (Senator) BIRCH BAYH Washington, June 1, 1973 A Succinct Observation To the Editor: At the same time anti abortionist Senator Buckley was telling us via television of the sacredness of human life, he was voting for the continued bombing of Cambodia. This succinct observation says more than any long winded dissertation his brother, the commentator, could possibly devise HENRY HEILBRUNN New York, June 1, 1973 S.E. C. Goals and Priorities To the Editor: While I was on a seventeen‐day trip through Latin America, The Times of May 21 carried a first page story on the S.E.C.'s action against I.T.&T. and an editorial on my own role in the Vesco case. Your story charged that, in its ac tion against I.T.&T., the Commission had not accepted a staff recommenda tion that the defendants be charged with fraud as well as transgressing the securities laws. The five members of the Commis sion have the responsibility to deter mine whether and what kind of an enforcement action should be brought after the Commission's staff com pletes an investigation. In the I.T.&T. case, the Commission did make fraud charges against some defendants. As to others, the Commission found to be illegal actions which it had never charged as violations before. Compe tent, reputable and experienced law yers had advised these defendants that the actions they had taken were proper and legal. In these circumstances a charge of fraud would have been harsh and in appropriate. The Times itself, in the very seine story, reported Acting Chairman Owens as saying that all commissioners believed there were in sufficient facts to sustain a fraud charge. On the Vesco matter, as we were pushing to complete this case, the S.E.C. received testimony that $250, 000 in cash had been brought to Vesco from a bank in the Bahamas which held I.O.S. funds. This hardly seemed of major significance, certainly not sufficient to divert our attention from our prime obligation of protecting over a half a billion dollars in I.O.S. funds. We had no knowledge as to how this money was used. The Times’ editorial would hold me responsible for not finding out how this $250,000 had been used. That to tally ignores the priorities and the purpose of the S.E.C. Our job was to protect a half billion odd dollars in I.O.S. funds. To delay this effort while investigating the use made of one twentieth of one per cent of the money involved would have been a total dis tortion of the S.E.C.'s obligation. We were seeking the appointment of a re ceiver to protect Investors’ funds and not the enforcement of the law on campaign contributions. Your editorial is not quite accurate when it refers to the deletion of ref erences to the $250,000. Information that this cash had been brought to Vesco came in as our complaint was being drafted. A paragraph about it was added to the draft complaint A chairman relies on the legal and en forcement staff for drafting documents to initiate an enforcement case. They agreed that, in the state of the S.E.C.'s knowledge about this cash and the possibility that other cash diversions might be unearthed, diversion of cash should be pleaded generally so that details as to amounts and surround ing circumstances could be submitted, as then known and appropriate, when the matter came to court. The S.E.C. officials responsible for this believed and still believe that the complaint filed in November demand ing protection of a half a billion dol lars of investors monies was sound and proper. In February, the S.E.C. did find but and bring to public attention how this cash was used. WILLIAM J.

Margaret Sanger Birth‐Control Clinic Will Merge Downtown and Expand Services,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/14/archives/margaret-sanger-birthcontrol-clinic-will-merge-downtown-and-expand.html,"The Margaret Sanger ke search Bureau, the nation's oldest family‐planning clinic, will celebrate its 50th anniver sary by closing the doors of its two brownstones at 17 and 19 West 16th Street on Aug. 31. The bureau has served 250,000 patients since 1923. Its activities will be merged with the 22d Street Center of Planned Parenthood of New York City in an expanded Mar garet Sanger Center. The latter will open in January as a me morial to the birth‐control pio neer and crusader who died in 1966 at the age of 83. The present center will dou ble its space at 380 Second Avenue, at 22d Street, to add an international contraceptive technical‐assistance and teach ing program for some 100 doc tors a year, as well as for nurses, midwives, administra tos and paraprofessional trainees. Since 1955 the Sanger bureau has trained more than 100 foreign doctors in addition to other family‐planning per sonnel. Help for Unmarried For many years it was the only birth‐control center in the country that provided contra ceptives to unmarried women and minors as well as abortion counseling and referral. In 1969 it opened the nation's first outpatient vasectomy serv ice. These services will continue at the facility on 22d Street, where the present center—un like the Sanger bureau—also provides abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. But plans are indefinite for continuation of the Sanger bu‐I reau's research into the use of the once‐a‐month pill and pros taglandin hormones for contra ception. Also unsettled thus far is the future of the bureau's infertility service. The largest in the world, it has treated 9,000 couples and reports hav‐il ing helped a third of them to achieve pregnancy. Alfred Moran, executive vice president of Planned Parent‐1 hood‐New York, said the “vir tual impossibility of getting Fed eral funds for research into con traception and family planning left unsolved the question of how to finance the money losing infertility service “on a high‐quality, but sliding‐fee basis without going broke.” Financial deficits of up to $400,000 a year and an “anti quated plant” had impelled the Sanger bureau since 1967 to seek affiliatioin witha larger in stitution, according to Charlotte Levine, the bureau's administra tive manager. Affiliation with New York University School of Medicine was explored first. A later plan for the bureau to be come a clinical division of Co lumbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Reproduc tion was dropped when expect Federal funds were not granted. The Sanger bureau will transfer to Planned Parenthood New York its assets of about $2‐million, including the esti mated sale value of the two brownstones. The bulk is money contributed since Mrs. Sang er's death for the Margaret Sanger Memorial Fund, raised nationally by a committee headed by Mrs. Cass Canfield. Most of it will become an en dowment for the new center. More than $1‐million will be sought through fund‐raising to meet the estimated $5‐million for the center's first two years —$770,000 for renovation and about $2,115,000 for the annual operating budget. The jobs of most of the 80 staff members of the Sanger bureau have already ended, but an undetermined number of employes, including Mrs. Levine, will join the new cen ter. The reaction of patients to the merger, Mrs. Levine said,1 has included “consternation, disbelief, sadness and under standing,” but arrangements have been made to guarantee them “the same continued care and methods they have been used to when they go to 22d Street” One of Mrs. Sanger's chil dren is Dr. Grant Sanger, who has been affiliated, as a sur geon, with the Columbia‐Pres byterian Medical Center and is a former chairman of the bu reau's board of directors. An other, Dr. Stuart Sanger, is an internist on the West Coast. A daughter, Peggy, died in ado lescence."
G.O.P. Aid to Liberals in '70 Recalled,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/16/archives/gop-aid-to-liberals-in-70-recalled.html,"A former staff member of the state Liberal party recount ed yesterday how he and other members worked out of the office of a Republican Assem blyman on Long Island to make calls on behalf of a Liberal candidate in an unsuccesful attempt to help the Republican defeat his Democratic opponent. He said that he did not real ize immediately he was in Republican office, and when he found out, he left. The others, however, remained, he said. The account was confirmed by the Republican, former As semblyman Vincent R. Balletta Jr. of Port Washington, who said he picked up the bill for the calls in the 1970 contest. “If you ask me today, I sup pose it's improper,” said Mr. Balletta, who lost to the Demo crat nevertheless. But, he said, “I never thought it was improp er at the time.” The story emerged amid acculmulating reports of Repub lican‐Liberal cooperation and some posible election campaign irregularities now under inves tigation by State Atorney Gen eral Louis J. Lefkowitz. In another case under in vestigation, William R. Baird, the abortion advocate and an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the Assembly last Novem ber, charged yesterday that the Attorney General's office and the Nassau District Attorney had failed to investigate ade quately charges that campaign literature under his name had been fraudulently circulated by Harold J. Relkin, who is on the Assembly payroll. A third case under official study centers on an Assembly race in Erie County in which a Liberal candidate drew crucial votes from a Democrat, who then lost, to the Republican, Albert J. Hausbeck. The Liberal, Rosalie Notaro, sister‐in‐law of a county Liberal official, after wards won a job for her daugh ter, Darlene Paul, on the Joint Legislative Committee on Higher Education. Mrs. Notoro was not available for comment. In the case of the Liberals working out of the Republican Assemblyman's office, the for mer staff member, Gerald Edel stein, now 32 years old, said he had been recruited to make calls shortly before the 1970 Liberal primary on behalf of the Liberal candidate, Jack Tenzer. Mr. Tenzer was facing a bitter contest against a Demo cratic write‐in candidate, Irwin Landes. As Mr. Edelstein, now execu tive director of the maverick Queens County Liberal Party, under Stanley Shaw, recounted in a press conference, he went to the designated address and made about 20 calls. “I had some questions,” re called. “People were asking me, ‘Who is the incumbent? ‘"" When he went upstairs to in quire, he said, he was intro duced to the incumbent, Assem blyman Balletta. When he learned, he said, that he had been working out of Mr. Ballet ta's law office at 150 Main Street, Port Washington, “I split.” Asked about the episode, Mr. Balletta, who subsequently lost to Mr. Landes, acknowledged having allowed the Liberals to use his “10 or 12” telephones without charge “one or two nights.” He said that “I would feel awfully cheap” charging them for the calls. Mr. Edelstein said he had been told at Mr. Balletta's of fice that Ben Davidson, execu tive director of the state Lib eral party, knew and approved of the activity. But Mr. David son denied knowing of it and said, “If they did it they were foolish and wrong.” Mr. Edelstein, who appeared at Mr. Shaw's law office at 770 Lexington Avenue, also said that Michael Dontzin, Mayor Lindsay's counsel and Liberal party appointee, had urged Mr. Edelstein at a state committee meeting in 1970 to vote to endorse Mr. Lefkowitz for the Liberal nomination be cause “he takes care of our election law cases.” Mr. Dontzin recalled yester day urging support for Mr. Lef kowitz, but because the Attor ney General had aided Mayor Lindsay. He first said he had “no recollection” of making any other statement, then called Mr. Edelstein's state ment “a lie.”"
Presbyterian Church in South To Resist Separatist Elements,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/16/archives/presbyterian-church-in-south-to-resist-separatist-elements.html,"FORT WORTH, Tex., June 15—Faced with its first schism since its founding more than a century ago, the general as sembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. (Southern) adopted this week a policy of firm but restrained resistance to dissident elements within its. ranks. The policy‐making body of the 950,000‐member denomina tion rejected an overture seek ing “peaceful and orderly” splitting of the church into two bodies and sent a message to local presbyteries emphasiz ing “peaceful and orderly” not permit “unilateral” with drawal of local congregations. At the same time delegates pointedly avoided condemna tion of clergy and laymen seeking to establish a break away conservative denomina tion. They adopted a resolution expressing “grief” over the di vision and urging “repentance for sin in the life of us all which has brought about this misunderstanding among brethren.” The specter of schism, a rare phenomenon among American churches in an ecumenical age, arose earlier this year when four conservative groups an nounced the formation of a new Continuing Presbyterian Church that would be loyal to Scripture. Plans were formalized last month for the meeting in At lanta attended by delegates from 255 of the 4,200 churches in the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. A constitutional con vention has been called for De cember. Withdrawal Movement Thus far 86 local churches have announced that they are withdrawing from the denomi nation. Separatist leaders hope this will grow to 200 con gregations by the end of the year. The fundamental issue in the break is the accusation by dis sidents that the denomination, which came into being in 1861 when the Civil War forced Presbyterians to divide into two churches, has strayed from its, traditional doctrinal base, the Westminster Confession of 1648. The separatists, whose com plaints are shared by many conservatives still in the church, hold to tie inerrancy of the Bible. They oppose the theory Of evolution on Biblical grounds and resent the church's tolera tion of clergy and professors who teach “universalism,” the belief that non‐Christians can achieve salvation. The dissidents have also Criticized the denomination's endorsement of divorce and abortion under certain cir cumstances and opposed its membership in ecumenical bod ies, including the National and World Councils of Churches. A major source of irritation is a plan for merger with the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., its more liberal northern counterpart, that has been discussed since 1969. ‘Hidden Agenda’ Seen Liberals, whose control of the church has been rather firm in recent years, reply that the changes to which dissidents object are in continuity with the denomination's Calvinist roots and charge that there is also a “hidden agenda” in the dispute. Whereas leaders of the schism may be genuine theo logical conservatives whose opposition to liberal social pro nouncements is rooted in the Bible, the liberals say, much of their support is based on self‐serving economic and so cial interests, including some lalent racism. Loyalists have also argued that a fundamental issue is simply an unwillingness to ac cept change. “The security of the old South is gone,” said Robert B. Smith, a liberal pastor from Midland, Tex. “Some people see their church as the last place to he secure. When this changes, it's like taking away motherhood.” The roots of the dispute lie deep in the denomination's his tory, Founded as a regional body and still confined primar ily to 15 Southern states, the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. has been shaped by the theological conservatism of the Bible Belt, the social conser vatism of Southern culture and the area's characteristic suspi cion of centralized authority. “We breathe the air of in dependence,” said one delegate here. “We have a strong sense of being our own man.” Modern Theological Trend At the same time, the de nomination, which always in sisted on an educated clergy and has tended to be con centrated in towns and cities, has been affected by modern theological and social thought. Many of its leaders were edu cated in Northern universities, and since 1955, when it for mally condemned racial seg regation, it has frequently taken liberal positions on social and moral issues such as the War in Vietnam. The current break has been building up for several years and was precipitated by the merger discussion. While op posed to union with the North ern church, conservatives were prepared to back the plan be cause it contained an “escape clause” that would permit local congregations to leave their property and to set up, a tradi tionalist denomination. In February, however, the merger committee decided to scrap the plan and begin to draft a new one that may or may not have an escape clause. Liberals explained that the “mood” of the church was not right for moving ahead on un ion. The separatists, however, accused them of breaking a promise because of a fear that, at this particular time, too many churches would take ad vantage of the escape clause and leave. Nevertheless, plans for the new denomination went ahead. “When you are sitting in a boat drifting toward a water fall, you reach a point where it's impossible to turn around,” said the Rev. G. Aiken Taylor, editor of the weekly Presby terian Journal, and a prime or ganizer of the Continuing Church. The 86 local congregations that have left the church have nearly 20,000 members and have organized themselves in to six presbyteries, or local governing units, in Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Virginia. Under Presbyterian law, a church cannot be dismissed without the consent of its local presbytery. In most cases, this consent has been given, thus leaving the separatist church with its property, but in at least three cases loyalist minor ities have taken the case to court. More legal battles are expected. Separatist forces stayed away from this week's General As sembly, which ended last night. As a result the sessions, dealing mainly with housekeeping mat ters, were notable for their lack of factional strife. Leaders seemed eager to avoid the personal rancor that as marked similar schisms in other churches, including one in the Northern church in the nineteen‐thirties."
"Feminism in the $12,000‐a‐year family; “What do I do for the next 20 years?”",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/17/archives/what-do-i-do-for-the-next-20-years-feminism-in-the-12000ayear.html,"“I'm short, fat and 45.” Rose Danielli digs her fork into a large piece of Sara Lee cherry cheesecake as she begins to de scribe herself at the first meeting of a women's consciousness‐raising group last September. Twelve women are crowded into the living room of a small red‐brick house in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn; many are old friends who have shared senior proms, weddings, births, miscarriages, fam ily deaths and all of the other minor and major events of life in a close‐knit working‐class com munity where neighbors still care about one another. Now they are supporting one another in a new experience: an effort to expand their middle‐aged lives beyond the comfortable roles of wife, mother and grandmother. No group of women seems further removed from the worlds of Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan, Ms. magazine, marriage contracts, “alternative life‐styles,” sexual experi mentation and all of the upper‐middle‐class para phernalia frequently associated with the feminist “My mother‐in‐law asked me the other day I was one of those ‘women's libbers,’ “ continues Mrs. Danielli, “and I told her I had always been something of a ‘libber’ even though I like being called ‘Mrs.’ She said she guessed I was telling the truth, because she remembered how hard fought for my girls to go to college. My husband and I never went to college, and everyone in the family thought our three girls would go to work to help put my son Johnny through. “Way back when the kids were in grade school, I told my husband, ‘Joe, if one of our kids is going to college, all of them are going. Your girls aren't gonna have 10 children like your mama—they've gotta do something with their lives just like our boy.’ “Both of our families were shocked when our oldest girl went off to college—Joe's papa kept asking if we didn't need the extra money she could bring in working as a typitt. We needed money, all right, but I never gave in—even when times were toughest and we were eating spaghetti with out meat sauce three nights a week.” There is a note of solid satisfaction in Rose Danielli's voice as she finishes both her story and the cheesecake. The women have agreed to begin their first session by describing the most significant failures and successes of their lives; they will start to talk about the future after evaluating the past. The old friendship and neighborly bonds give their discussion a more comfortable aura than the sort that usually prevails in Manhattan consciousness raising sessions, which frequently reflect the frag mented and transient nature of affluent high‐rise apartment living. “I was going to break the rules and interrupt,” admits Alice Martino, a construction worker's wife who grew up on the same block with Rose in East Flatbush. “I thought Rose might go on and on about being fat, as though there were nothing more to her story.” The life stories outlined by the women have many common elements. The women are all in their 40's; most grew up in first‐and second‐generation Italian or Jewish immigrant homes. A few have lived in East Flatbush since they were children, and the rest came from nearby blue‐collar neigh borhoods. Most of the women graduated from high school, went to work for a year or two at poorly paid jobs, married by age 20 and quickly started having children. Only two of the 12 had any edu cation beyond high school. Rose Danielli's back ground is typical; she worked as a telephone operator for a year before marrying Joe, a tele phone installer, when they were both 19. The husbands are blue‐collar union men or white‐collar workers employed by the city govern ment; their general income range is between $9,000 and $14,000 a year. Most of the families have at least three children. Homemade soups and clothes are a necessary economy for them rather than an expression of the “traditional female role.” Their houses represent the only important financial investment of their lives and are maintained with appropriate care—postage‐stamp lawns raked free of leaves, living‐room sofas glazed with plastic slipcovers and reserved for company, starched kitchen curtains, home freezers stocked with the specials the women unearth in numerous grocery stores on Saturday mornings. They worry in equal measure about the rising price of ground chuck, the fact that so many of their grown children are leaving the old neighborhood, and how to get along with the blacks who are moving into the area. movie and dinner in a local Chinese or Italian restaurant is a once‐a‐month event. Manhattan “the city,” a place to be visited on wedding anni  Whatever their problems, the women love their husbands and are not about to leave them. They do not expect to liberate themselves by living alone, although they understand why some younger women find marriage an unsatisfactory state. They have neither the education nor the work experience to be tapped as token women for high‐powered jobs in high‐powered companies. One woman in the group says she is waiting breathlessly for the day when the local 6 o'clock news will feature a broad caster who is not only black and female but over 40, thereby providing on‐screen representation for three oppressed groups instead of two. Nevertheless, the women are convinced that they can build a future different from the traditional path laid out by their mothers and grandmothers. The feminist movement is responsible in large measure for their belief that they can change the course of their middle‐aged lives. The movement was gaining strength and national publicity at a time when the women who make up the East Flatbush group began to face the void most full‐time mothers experience after their chil dren grow up and leave home. Their comments in the group sessions indicate that two main concerns spurred their interest in feminism: the feeling that society in general, and their husbands in particular, no longer viewed them as sexually interesting or even sexually functioning women, and the realiza tion that they were “out of a job” in the same sense as a middle‐aged man who is fired by his employer of 20 years. The idea of a formal consciousness‐raising group was suggested last fall by Lillian Schwartz, the only one of the women with any extensive con tacts outside the neighborhood. She had been active for many years in citywide organizations concerned with the public schools, and she was hearing more and more about the feminist move ment from the women she met in the course of her volunteer work. At the same time, her three clos est friends in East Flatbush were constantly mull ing over the question of what to do with the next 20 or 30 years of their lives. They agreed that an organized group might help them figure out what to do and quickly recruited enough interested women to make up a manageable dozen. Lillian hunted down a copy of Ms. with advice on how to form a consciousness‐raising group. The most important decision at the first meet ing was that the sessions would be held regularly on Tuesday nights. Except in emergencies, they would not be subject to interference by children and husbands who had other activities in mind. At the second session, several women reported with glee that the announcement of a regular meeting had caused a storm in their homes. “In our house, my husband expects me home every evening,” ex plained one woman. “That is, unless he decides to go bowling. Then I can go to the movies by myself or out to a neighbor's.” Some of the husbands resented the decision regularize the meetings because they had chosen to view the group as just another Kaffeeklatsch. The reactions of the men included bitter oppo sition, secret sabotage, amused resignation and quiet sup port. “My poor man asked what he should tell the neigh bors if they called and asked for me on Tuesday night,” re called a woman whose hus band is part‐owner of a Jew ish delicatessen. “I told him to tell anyone who called the truth, that I'm working out what to do with my life. He said the hell he would, he'd tell them I was doing some thing for the temple.” Sarah Thomas, the 40‐year‐old wife of a policeman, had the biggest problem: Every time she planned to leave the house for her women's group, her husband had a minor household accident requiring her attention. The women were appropriately sympathet ic when she arrived an hour late for the second meeting because her husband's ankle needed soaking after he twisted it on the front stoop. Before the next meeting, Ser geant Thomas carved a deep slice in his thumb with a potato peeler. When he poured boiling water over his hand, Sarah and the other women began to suspect the accidents were not entirely At the fifth meeting, Sarah reported that “I told him since he was an experienced police officer he was used to dealing with emergencies and I was sure he could take care of a slight burn by himself. I figure if I just sail out of the house anyway, he'll stop having these accidents.” (She proved a poor prophet, be cause she continued to attend the women's group meetings and, as of June, her husband was still chalking up at least two accidents a month.) Most of the women spent considerable time talking about personal sexual prob lems during the early weeks of the group. In this respect, they resemble the younger wives, single women and di vorcées who make up the membership of most con sciousness‐raising groups. But they are of a more reserved and modest generation than the younger feminists. No one mentions foreplay or sexual positions. If the East Flatbush women are worried about or gasms, they do not talk about it. An occasional men tion of premarital sex pro duces flushes of embarrass ment. But they are all acutely aware of the unful filled sexual desires that seem to be the lot of many middle‐aged women in Amer ican society. To a greater or lesser degree, most of the women reported the same problem: The frequency of sexual relations with their husbands diminished drasti cally after they entered their 40's. For the unluckiest wo men, sex—like a night out in “the city”—became an event reserved for birthdays and anniversaries. “It's more like a monument than an act of love,” one commented. “I just want to be recog nized as a woman,” said Ruth Levine, a mother of five whose 100‐pound figure and short black hair make her look a decade younger than her 46 years. Her husband is a cab driver who has worked 14‐to 16‐hour days through out most of their married life. “I'm going to be alive for another 20 or 30 years,” she observed. “My husband and sleep together maybe once a month. Oh, it's not that he wants another woman —don't think that at all. It's just that... I'm familiar. Men really don't think of women in their 40's that way, in a sexual way. I know it isn't the way I look—I'm pret tier now than I was when had five children under the age of 10 to run after all day. I don't feel like having orgies, but I'm too young for this... this... it's almost an end to sex. I don't know ‘how to make my husband realize this without hurting him. I don't want him to feel I'm making demands he can't meet. And I don't even know if I have the courage to talk about it with him, after all these years of letting the man lead the way....” Another woman sadly re called a night when she put her arms around her husband while he was watching tele vision and he pushed her away. “He said, ‘Help, I mar ried a sex maniac.’ He made it sound like a joke, but knew he was only half‐teas ing. Then he said, ‘You know, Debbie, we're really getting too old for much fooling around. Our kids are going to be getting married pretty soon.’ “ Alice Martino mocked the sex advice offered by conven tional women's magazines. “They tell you to be careful to keep up your looks, don't walk around in front of your husband in rollers, go out and buy a new black negligee. But those little gems are stu pid, because most women who like men have been following them for years. My hair is combed and my fanny is still pretty firm and I don't wear flannel pajamas to bed. It's the idea of settling into a new role after you get past a cer tain age that's so hard to fight. “You know, when you were 20 the thing to do was make love and have children. Our eldest boy is getting married next month. The other night Rick said to me, ‘Well, pretty soon I'll be able to call you grandma.’ I said he would over my dead body, that would have murdered him if he'd called me ‘Ma’ while our kids were growing up. He laughed and said he was a fool, because he'd forgotten the time I shut him out of the bedroom after he gave me a new baby carriage for my birthday. A baby carriage. For my birthday!” With the exception of Rose Danielli, who correctly sur mised that losing 60 pounds would make a major change in her own sense of physical well‐being as well as her hus band's sexual behavior, the women agreed that spending money on “a new look” was not the answer to a lagging sex life. As a group, they were somewhat more tolerant of the sexual insecurities of middle‐aged males than the younger women in conscious ness‐raising groups. Some of them compared the fatigue of their husbands with the ex haustion they felt when they were looking after small chil  “LIFE plays a dirty trick on wo men,” said Ann Nussbaum, whose husband is a book keeper with the city Finance Administration. “The men think you're gorgeous when you're too young to know anything about life. How well I remember how hard it was to take any interest in my husband when I had been changing diapers all day. Now I have much more time and interest for sex, but my hus band is the one who's beat. He does tax returns to make extra money on the side—I know he just feels like rolling over and going to sleep at the end of the day. “One of the things I feel I have to get across to him is that being physically af fectionate with each other doesn't have to mean sex; he doesn't have to feel all this pressure that men seem to feel about performance. agree with Ruth that it's hard to talk about these things after a lifetime of being si lent, but. I don't see how we can get anywhere unless we speak up about what's both ering us.” As the group sessions con tinued, most of the women reported considerable success in their attempts to talk about sex with their husbands. They began seeking out more sex information from medical studies and books on women's health by feminist writers. Several women said their husbands were especially im pressed by the Masters and Johnson finding that normal men and women can continue to enjoy sex into their 60's. Said Rose Danielli: “Joe told me, ‘You know, Rose, we were brought up in ignorance even if we did manage to have four kids. This Masters‐Johnson thing you're telling me about —I thought a wife would think her husband was a dirty old man if he kept trying to take her to bed when they old.” One woman who was going through menopause reported that her husband was greatly relieved to learn she could still function sexually. “Like most of us here, I never really talked about these things with my husband. When I finally got up the nerve to say something, found out he thought the change of life meant that a woman would find it difficult —physically difficult, that is —to have sex. I told him was looking forward to the change because it meant wouldn't have to worry about getting pregnant anymore. He said he'd never looked at it that way.” Many members of the group linked their sexual plight with the more general emptiness of middle‐aged women who have devoted their entire lives to their families. “My nights will take care of themselves if I have something to occupy my days,” said one. By De cember—the third month of the group sessions—most of the discussions centered around the need to find some sort of work. Ruth Levine, who had never worked outside her home, sur prised the rest of the group by becoming the first to take the plunge into the job mar ket. She applied for a job as a file clerk in a large adver tising agency and was hired with a warning from the per sonnel department that “most of the girls on your floor will be 25 years younger than you are.” Feminist opponents of job discrimination are correct in their assertion that file clerk ing is a thankless, dead‐end task reserved by large com panies for women. However, the upper‐middle‐class, col lege‐educated feminists often fail to realize that a woman with no training may look upon a mundane job as an op portunity rather than an in sult. For Ruth Levine, who had rarely left her neighbor hood for 25 years, the file clerk's job was an important step into a wider world. “Well, I know it's not much of a job in the eyes of any one else,” she reported to her group after she had been working for a month. “Even the secretaries look down on file clerks—especially a file clerk in her 40's. And I agree with some of the stuff I read in Ms. these days—a man, even a dumb one, would never have to take one of these jobs. But to me the job is something. Someone has to do this kind of work. I never went to college, I never worked before I was married, and I don't really have the training for anything more. What do I get out of the job? For one thing, I get to meet a lot of different people who give me new things to think “The young girls ask me, ‘Mrs. Levine, why are you working at your age when you have a husband and chil dren? We're just waiting to get married and out of this hole.’ I tell them I'm working because it's better than sit ting home and being a vege table, and that they should get themselves some more training or they'll be file clerks 20 years from now, whether they get married or not. I don't see any practical advice for girls like this in any of the magazines, includ ing Ms. and Cosmopolitan. Cosmo tells girls how to put rouge on their breasts and Ms. tells you how to start your own business, but no one tells file clerks that life will stretch into a big zero unless they improve their skills.” The other important thing Ruth gets out of her job is money: She brings home more than $90 a week after taxes and Social Security withhold ing. “It makes me feel both that I'm independent and that I'm contributing something to the household,” she said. Sarah, the wife of the ac cident‐prone police sergeant, broke in: “Whenever I talk about getting a job, my hus hand says I'm contributing something by staying home and taking care of the house.” “I know, I know, I've heard it ‘all,” Ruth replied. “My Hal said exactly the same thing. He said it made him feel like a second‐class man, that he couldn't take care of his fam ily by himself. I said, ‘Hal, our youngest kid is 16. What am I going to do with myself for the nod 20 years?’ I told him I'd feel like we were pulling together—the way we did when the kids were little—if I could bring in a little money to make our lives easier. “At first we agreed the money would go into a special account in my name, so it would be clear he was still paying for everything. Finally Hal saw the money was piling up and it was crazy not to use it. We put part of it into the regular budget and are saving the rest for a vaca tion.” Ruth reported that her hus band's attitude toward her job changed slowly but defi nitely. He became less con cerned about the fact that she was making money of her own and began to cut down on his own 14‐hour work days in his taxi. The most unex pected dividend was a signifi cant improvement in their sex life. “I can't believe it. We have a sex life again. For the first time in years Hal can go out with me once a week; he comes home at 7 o'clock in stead of midnight. That little bit of extra money makes a big difference to us. We go to bed together more than we did for the last 10 years. “Hal and I have never been much for talking about sex, but one night he turned to me in bed and said, ‘You know, Ruthie, I was just too beat to pay attention to you this way. I didn't realize it until you went to work and took some of the money pressure off me.’ I said, ‘You know, Hal, I didn't realize it either.’ “ RUTH is taking shorthand course so that she can move into a better‐paying secre tarial job next fall. After she took the first step, four other women in the group found jobs. Two returned to the secretarial work they had done before they were mar ried, one found an opening as a teacher aide in the Head Start program for preschool children, and another put her fluent Italian to work as an interpreter for older immi grants in their dealing with city agencies. Two women in the group decided they would go to college and were ac cepted in adult‐education pro grams leading toward a bache lor's degree. The women who plan to enter college are undergoing profound changes that have also made a deep impact on their husbands. “I don't think I could take file clerking,” an nounced Alice Martino one night, “but I'm not prepared for anything else. I always wanted to go to college, and I think that's just what I'm going to do.” Unlike many of the women, Alice has no serious financial problems. Her husband, Rick, earns more than $16,000 a year as a construction work er; they live rent‐and mort gage‐free in a house Alice's mother left them when she died. Their children are be tween ages 18 and 24, and are either currently attend ing college or have graduated. Alice is enrolling in the highly respected adult‐educa tion program at Brooklyn Col lege. After considering several possibilities, she decided on teaching as a career because she felt it offered the easiest entree for an older woman. She plans to make a specialty of speech and reading therapy because there is a shortage of trained personnel in those areas despite an over‐all teacher surplus. Contradicting the hard‐hat stereotype, Alice's husband turned out to be more favor ably disposed toward the feminist movement than the other women's husbands. In fact, he decided to follow his wife's example. “He con fessed he was jealous of my plans to go to college,” Alice said, “and then he decided he was being stupid because he could do it too. College was never a possibility for him when he was younger—he was the oldest son and his parents needed money very badly. He's thought about architectural engineering for years; he always said he knew more about putting up buildings than the engineers the “Anyway, he said he al ways assumed a man couldn't change his life in midstream but he figured if women were trying to do it, why not him. It won't be easy for him try ing to build a new career when he's over 40, but it won't be easy for me either. We have it planned. I'll be teaching before Rick gets his engineering degree, and he'll have a pension because he's been in the union since he was 18. We'll have plenty of money to get along on while he looks for an employer who doesn't think a man is a fossil when he gets to be 40. As far as my teaching goes, I'll be less of a fossil than the teachers.” One of the more conserva tive women in the group told Alice she sounded like starry‐eyed 18‐year‐old. “I feel like one,” she replied. “I haven't been this optimistic about life since I was 18.” Joan Loewenstein, who is also entering Brooklyn Col lege next fall, was equally optimistic. She hopes to be come a statistician or a com puter programer. “A lot of people have been telling me I'm out of my mind to be thinking about this big a change ‘at your age.’ Oh, they love to use that phrase—at your age’ But I've been lucky like Alice—my husband has been wonderful. His partner in the deli started this busi ness about my age, and he said, ‘What do you think she should do at her age, buy a cemetery plot?’ Abe is con vinced I have a talent for math because I've always helped him keep the books for the store, done our income tax return, that sort of thing. “You know, we had a joint checking account all of our lives, but Abe always gave me the household money every week. I never wrote a check for anything unless it was something like the mort gage payment. I would never have bought myself a new dress without checking with him first. Abe has been doing some thinking on his own about Women's Lib. He says it suddenly hits him how stupid it was for him to be doling out household money to me when I keep the books better than he does. “So the other night he tells me, ‘Joan, I'm not giving you money for the house anymore, you take what you need. Here I am, a man who's been let ting a woman keep his books for 20 years, and still telling her what to spend, each week. I know what I got out of it, but what ,did you get? I never really wanted to be cheap, it was just the way my parents did things’ “You know, I was surprised at all this from Abe. Then started thinking about that question—what did I get out of it. Well, I told Abe I was able to save some money from my allowance on the sly. He said, ‘So, now you'll save on the open’ I guess it was sort of comfortable, acting like a little girl about money. Any way, it sure won't do for a college girl—cops, woman—who wants to program com puters.” NOT all the wo men have had as much success in chang ing their own lives or the at titudes of their husbands. Judith Katz, who worked as a secretary before her mar riage 20 years ago, encoun tered stiff opposition when she went back to work in the counseling office of a Brook lyn junior high school. Her husband especially resents the fact that she wanted a job enough to take an opening in a ghetto school with a tough reputation. As an expression of his disapproval, he refuses to ride the subway with his wife in the morning. Another of the women, an account ant's wife who is already at classes College, speak to her husband for several weeks after he told her, “You're too feather‐brained to finish cleaning the house, much less four years of college.” In general, the East Flat bush men who disapprove of feminism express their reac tons more openly than the professional husbands of up per‐middle‐class women who are the most vocal and visible participants in the movement. College‐educated men are often reluctant to attack wo men's liberation in principle, but their practical behavior is another matter. Judging from the wide variety of male reac tions described by the Flat bush wives, Middle‐American men are no more or no less disturbed than other Ameri can men when the women in their lives try to break out of the traditional female pattern. The East Flatbush women have considerable difficulty identifying with the widely publicized leaders of the movement. Said one: “I con fess I don't feel much of a sense of sisterhood when see pictures of Gloria Steinem with her streaked hair and slinky figure. I feel somehow that these people don't know how it is to be getting older with very little money and education. They have it a lot better than we do—it's not true that we're all in the same boat.” Another woman disagreed: “Well, there's one thing we all have in common—we're all afraid of muggers and rapists when we walk down a dark street at night. And that's something we have in common with the colored wo men who live right here in East Flatbush, even though most of us are better off financially than they are.” The women do identify with the movement on a var iety of specific issues—child day‐care centers, equal pay for equal work, the right to abortion and contraceptive information, the need to edu cate young girls to think of themselves as individuals in their own right instead of viewing themselves only as future wives and mothers. Several of the women now spend considerable time try ing to introduce these reform 1st ideas into the conserva tive social environment of East Flatbush. One of their immediate goals is a health information service for girls and women of all ages; they feel that most East Flatbush women are unlikely to use the referral services now available in Manhattan. Rose Danielli had hoped to organ ize such a service through her church but ran head‐on into a clash with her priest over contraceptive informa tion. “My husband said, ‘Oh, Rose, don't get into a battle with Father—’ Then he said, ‘I give up. If you were willing to do battle with my mama you won't stop with the priest.’ “But Joe doesn't really mind the way I feel—in fact, I think he's kind of proud. This year our oldest girl gets her doctor's degree from Stan ford, our boy gets his mas ter's and our second youngest girl graduates from Hunter College. Joe told his parents the other night that sending all of his kids through college was the proudest accomplish ment of his life, and that he wouldn't have done it if hadn't insisted. “We had to fight our girls, too, until they were old enough to have some sense. They used to remind me that I got married when I was 19 and their dad and I were happy. I just told them their grandparents never finished high school and they were happy too, but it's not prog ress if the next generation lives the same way. To me, that's what Women's Lib is all about—progress. In small steps, maybe, but still prog ress.” Next fall, the East Flat bush group will take in five new women because several of the founding members will be too busy with jobs and college courses. All of the women call that progress."
SEOUL IS SUCCEEDING ON POPULATION CURB,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/17/archives/seoul-is-succeeding-on-population-curb.html,"SEOUL, South Korea, June 16—South Korea, a heavily populated country whose econ omy has long been burdened by high birth rates, is making significant gains in population control. A recent Government survey shows that annual population growth has been considerably slowed, to a figure estimated at 1.67 per cent, from 2.9 per cent a decade ago and an aver age of 1.92 per cent in the 1966‐70 period. Encouraged by the results of 10 years of a determined fam ily planning program initiated by the Government in 1962, of ficials are hopeful of reducing the annual rise to 1.5 per cent by the end of 1976 and to 1.3 per cent by 1981. The survey was conducted on a sample of 12,000 of the 6, 170,000 households. On this basis the Economic Planning Board estimated the population, in an area the size of New York State, at 32,848,000. The board attributed the fall ing birth rate to improved standards of living and educa tion and rising age at marriage in addition to family planning. In a new move to reduce births, a law allowing abor tions for health reasons was put into force last month. Private demographers dispute the results of Government sur veys. The Planned Parenthood Federation of Korea maintains that the average annual popu lation rise in the 1966.70 period was higher than the official, figure. Its figure for 1971 is 2.2 per cent.

MINORITY WOMEN ARE PLEDGED AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/18/archives/minority-women-are-pledged-aid-350-leaders-from-42-states-adopt.html,"PHILADELPHIA, June 17 —A group of 350 prominent wo men from 42 states pledged themselves today to more ex tensive efforts on behalf of minority women. The commitment came in the form of numerous resolutions on minority women at the final session of a three‐day confer ence of the Interstate Associa tion of Commissions on the Status of Women. These commissions are ap pointed by Governors and their memberships lean heavily to ward doctors, lawyers, busi nesswomen and other commu nity leaders of middle age and beyond. The interstate association nonetheless adopted many strongly feminist and liberal positions. Among them were resolu tions opposing a pending consti tutional amendment restricting abortions; endorsing the equal rights amendment to the Con stitution, which would bar sex discrimination by any govern ment; denouncing the cutbacks in federally financed social services and poverty programs, especially legal services; and supporting a uniform national minimum wage for household workers. The emphasis on the particu lar problems confronting min ority women was somewhat new for the association. An appeal to consider as in separable the effects of race and ‐sex ‐discrimination was made to the conference by Frankie M. Freeman, a black woman who is a member of the United States Civil Rights Com mission. She said that it was “not true” that the women's rights movement represented merely “a middle‐class white women's struggle to escape from house work and child‐rearing.” If the notion of any human inequality is sanctioned and institutionalized, then other human inequities “are not only predictable hut inevitable,” she said. “We cannot attack one prejudice while we ignore or condone the others.” The association, whose reso lutions are not binding, called on the state commissions to bring more minority, poor and elderly women into the govern mental processes that deal with their problems. Resolutions were passed en dorsing pending legislation that would bar discrimination against women in the granting of credit; calling for Federal funding for child‐care facilities, and criti cizing plans to base funding for local, Federal employment secu rity offices solely on the num ber of placements made. ‘Chill to Receptivity’ Other highlights of the meet ing included the following: ¶Ruth Bader Ginsberg, pro fessor at the Columbia Univer sity law school and coordinator of the Women's Rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that a recent Su preme Court decision had, changed the climate for litiga tion of women's rights suits “from chill to receptivity.” The suit was Frontiero v. Richard son, in which the Supreme Court invalidated a Government regulation requiring a woman in military service to prove that her husband was her dependent before she could get a housing allowance, when no similar re quirement was imposed on servicemen. Professor Ginsberg expressed a fear, on the other hand, that some ill‐considered women's rights cases might be brought following the Frontiero deci sion, that might cause the Su preme Court to turn back. She cited as an example a case testing the preference in employment that the Federal government gives to military veterans. She said that she be lieved such “veterans prefer ance” was unconstitutionally discriminatory, but that “the climate was wrong” to chal lenge it now, following the Vietnam war. ¶Jill Ruckelshaus, special as sistant to President Nixon, who also described herself as “the permanent wife of the tempo rary head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” urged the group to start a campaign now for the appointment of a wo man to the next Supreme Court vacancy. ¶Dr. Cynthia Cooke, a Phila delphia obstetrician and gyne cologist, in discussing the in nuendos that are often part of police questioning of rape vic tims, said that the police were not to blame. If they have asked questions about the previous sex life of the victim, she said, it was only because the courts have per mitted testimony on this point, while rigidly excluding testi mony about previous sex of fenses by the accused rapist. She said that some of the psychological damage often suf fered by rape victims resulted from society's attitude that the victim may herself have been to blame. ¶Elsie Denison, a staff mem ber of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, said that state laws barring from certain occupations women who have been convicted of crimes needed changing. Almost every state, she said, bars such women from working as beauty operators, and many bar them from food‐handling occupations as well. The association elected Mu nicipal Court Judge Mildred Norris of Hattiesburg, Miss. as its new first vice president. Marsha Donnan of South Da kota was elected secretary and Alberta J. Meyer of Missouri was elected treasurer. Joy Simonson of the District of Columbia and Geraldine Rickman of California continue as president and second vice president, respectively, under a system of staggered terms for officers."
A Growing Number of Israeli Women Are Now Pioneers for Sex Equality,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/18/archives/a-growing-number-of-isreali-women-are-now-pioneers-for-sex.html,"JERUSALEM, June 17 — Is there a need for women's liber ation in Israel, where women are drafted into the army, work in the fields alongside men and where a woman serves as Premier? Yes, say an increasing num ber of Israeli women, arguing that the much‐advertised no tion of sexual equality in Israel is more myth than reality. “We have been brainwashed by our own legends of pioneer ing equality,” says Shulamit Aloni, a writer, lawyer, former member of Parliament and feminist who is married and has three sons. “The equality that generally prevailed when the state was founded 25 years ago has been replaced by a bourgeois, middle‐class sexism.” Although it is still a fledgling movement here, women's libera tion is reflected in small groups that have sprung up recently in all of Israel's larger cities and towns. The women have staged demonstrations against the “Miss Israel” beauty con test, started letter‐writing cam paigns protesting discrimination in the mass media and have published booklets calling for abortion reform and revamping of the religious laws governing marriage and divorce. A Victory Over El Al One group, made up mostly, of English‐speaking immigrants, began holding consciousness raising sessions in Jerusalem three months ago. “We've been swamped by Israelis wanting to join,” said a representative of that group, Judy Goldman, a 30‐year‐old who is originally from Montreal. A militant group of steward esses recently took El Al, the national airline, to court and won the right to be considered for the rank of chief purser. Fifteen women will take up their new jobs in that capacity on July 1. In the ruling Labor party, headed by Premier Golda Meir, an angry group of women lead ers threatened earlier this month to boycott the fall elections unless women were given at least 25 per cent of the places on the party's list of candidates. The active feminists in Israel, probably no more than several hundred, have made other Is raelis, men and women, re consider the assumption that women have more equal rights here. The result has been a rash of newspaper and maga zine articles, television specials and university symposia on the status of women. Need Is Ridiculed No consensus has emerged. The Israeli men interviewed at random on a recent television special all ridiculed the need for a women's liberation movement —and most of the women on the program agreed. Only one or two suggested that there was room for improvement. The chief complaints of Is raeli feminists include the fol lowing: ¶The average full‐time yearly income of the Israeli woman, according to research by Shu lamit Aloni, the writer, is 42 to 67 per cent of the Israeli man's, depending on the field—despite a national law requiring equal pay for equal work. ¶Few women hold top jobs in the larger Israeli public cor porations or national utilities—most of those jobs, in fact, are filled by former generals. Even in the universities, women make up only an average of 12 per cent of the faculties, against about 20 per cent in the United States. ¶Other than Mrs. Meir, only seven women sit in the 120 member Knesset, or Parliament, and none are on its two most influential committees. No other women serve as ministers or deputy ministers. No woman ever has been elected a mayor or deputy mayor of any large town. ¶There is no civil marriage or divorce in Israel. All such mat ters are in the province of the rabbinical courts. A Woman may not appear as a witness in her own divorce proceeding, nor may she initiate the di vorce. It can be granted only with the consent of the hus band. The activists also say that after an initial period of equal ity in the nation's early days, the kibbutz women were increasingly relegated to the kitchen and to child care. The activists put the blame for this on the kibbutz women them selves, who, they say, cheer fully gave up the rugged life for an extra hour in the beauty parlor. A similar transformation has occurred in the army, the femi nists say. In the 1948 war for independence, women fought alongside men. “Today they are mostly in desk jobs,” said Daphne Sela, a member of one of the original women's libera tion groups. In the view of Mrs. Aloni, the erosion of the orig inal equality of the sexes in Israel is part of the general trend toward a more bourgeois style of life here. “We have re treated from the social revolu tion launched by the pioneers,” she said, “and replaced it with lip service to equality.” In her view, a more significant factor has been the expanding influence of the Orthodox reli gious elements that have played a key role in the last several coalition governments, thus managing to get their way in many social matters. “In the eyes of the religious,” she said, the woman's place is in the home raising children. “It's very patriotic in this coun try to have a lot of children,” she went on angrily. “Women with 10 get a bonus. But I'm sorry. I don't want to be thought of as a machine to breed children for the army. want to be treated as a human being, according to my work, ability and knowledge.”"

District Attorneys Study Alleged Vote‐Siphon Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/20/archives/district-attorneys-studyalleged-votesiphon-plan-liberal-candidates.html,"The New York and Albany County District Attorneys be gan their own inquiries yester day into a suspected Repub lican scheme to siphon votes from Democrats in Assembly elections. The moves came as politi cians noted the rarity of pros ecutions under the state's vague campaign filing laws, The office of District Attor ney Frank S. Hogan declined to comment, even on the ques tion of whether it had clear jurisdiction in the case, which was transferred from the of fice of Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz. It was understood from sources familiar with the case that if any laws were violated, they likely would be parts of I he election and penal law—all misdemeanors—relating to the proper filing of campaign :statements and identification of campaign groups. Liberal Candidates Aided The Attorney General's in quiry, which originated with complaint in the 1972 Assembly election, focused on the ques tion of whether Republican ‘campaign funds were used to help finance the campaigns of Liberal candidates so that the Democratic vote was weakened and the Republican majority control of the Assembly pre served. Enough evidence was gathered to require referring the matter to criminal prose cutors. The Albany District Attorney, Arnold W. Proskin, also de clined to comment on the At torney General's report. He ap parently has authority over the matter since his district in dudes the office of Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo, where candidates and committees are required to file campaign finan cial statements. The one observation Mr. Pros kin would make is that although his office had partial jurisdic tion ever the ‘bins of filed campaign statements, it had nowhere near the manpower to do an effective job in perusing the forms for violations and omissions. The office of Mr. Lefkowitz also has investigatory power over the campaign statements, but the Attorney General has insisted in the past that the current laws are too weak to permit an effective job. Bills Mr. Lefkowitz has sent previ ously to the Legislature, where they withered, point to some of the loopholes. One bill would give the At torney General power to go to court to compel the filing of a campaign statement where one had not been filed. A group of five oitizens has this power now, but observers note very few people are aware of this power. A second bill would require that local District Attorneys and the Attorney General be notified of the failure of candi dates and committees to file statements. Again, there is no such mandate and, according to the legislative memo, no state official or department will accept responsibility for insist ing on the filing. The third measure would specify clearly that funds re ceived or spent by politicians or groups in the full calendar year—and not just those used at campaign time—would have to be accounted for. Now, there is no such mandate. The attitude of many politi cians toward the filing require ment was summarized by a member of a prosecutor's staff: “So who files properly?” Past investigations have shown that numerous politicians and or ganizations routinely ignore the law, which carries a penalty that rarely has been enforced, according to the Attorney Gen eral's office. Republicans see some irony in the fact that they are bear ing the brunt of the inquiry in part because they bothered to file last year, and some of the leads in the investigation —several thousands of dollars spent to support “Liberal” pro grams — were gleaned from their statement. At the same time, the Demo crats have never filed a cam paign statement, which would appear to be a misdemeanor. The Attorney General's office has said it will get to that eventually. Thus the current controversy saw the state Democratic chairman, Joseph F. Crangle, scoring Republicans again yes terday even as he was promis ing that his own party's six month overdue statement would be filed “in a few days.” Republican critics also noted privately that Mr. Crangle, who holds a Democratic Assembly patronage job, was comment ing on an alleged scandal in which a Liberal politician Harold J. Relkin—is suspected of sending out anti‐Democratic literature in return for a Re publican Assembly patronage job. “I'm glad to hear Joe's be come a moralist,” the Assem bly Speaker, Perry B. Duryea Jr., Republican of Montauk, L.I., said last week in com menting on Mr. Crangle's state ments. Mr. Crangle noted another flaw in the law, which has been cited by others. This in volves limiting an individual candidate's committee spending to about 10 cents for each reg istered voter. But, politicians routinely set up multi‐candidate committees to circumvent the limit. A clerical employe of the Secretary of State's office re cently observed that there were two main purposes served by the campaign state ments that are filed. One is that newsmen occasionally poke around in them. The other is that politicians visit Albany and study the lists for what the clerk termed “sucker lists” of potential contributors for future campaigns. Shaw Accuses Rose In another development, J. Stanley Shaw, the Queens County Liberal leader, charged yesterday that the party strate gist, Alex Rose, and Governor Rockefeller knew about and tried to cover up the alleged G.O.P. funded vote siphoning scheme. “You got a big Watergate,” Mr. Shaw told newsmen. He is representing William Baird, an abortion advocate, in a com plaint about the suspected scheme. “I charge now that Rocke feller knew about it, should have known about it; that Rose knew about it; that the Liberal party knew about it and they had an input into it,” Mr. Shaw said at a news conference at the State Attorney General's office."
Defiant Judge Again Backs Right to Abortion Privacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/21/archives/defiant-judge-again-backs-right-to-abortion-privacy-acting-after.html,"State Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Spiegel defied a higher court and ruled for the second time that women receiving abortions should not have their names and addresses on fetal death certificates. “There is no compelling in terest, to invade the right of privacy by compelling disclo sure which is otherwise useless in this context,” Justice Spiegel wrote in an opinion handed down in Manhattan yesterday. “Rather, it would diminish the grant of privacy in respect of the woman's body and the right to be shielded from dis closure of her exercise of that right of privacy.” The action was unusual. The Appellate Division had heard the case on an appeal, filed last August, from the justice's earlier, and similar ruling. The Appellate Division reversed Jus tice Spiegel “on the law” and sent the case back to him for “reconsideration.” New Briefs Ordered The instructions from the ApPellate Division were that “upon reconsideration” the judge “shall permit all parties to file further and additional briefs, as they deem warranted, and shall make a determina tion anew in the light of the supplemental material.” Four appellate justices agreed to that. The fifth saw no reason to send back the case “for a playback of the contentions we already know.” And he, too, asked for a re versal of Justice Spiegel's ver dict. The case was instituted by Dr. Harold Schulman of the Bronx Municipal Hospital and a patient, referred to as Jane Doe. Both asked the setting aside of regulations requiring the patient's name and address on a fetal death certificate filed after an abortional oper ation. In his first decision, Justice Spiegel noted that no law or decision directed inclusion of the name and address of the patient on the certificate. The judge said he did not see sufficient weight in the argu ment of the Health and Hos pitals Corporation and the De partment of Health, against whom the suit was filed, that names and addresses on the fetal death certificate were needed “to compile statistical data of the possible adverse ef fect of multiple abortions upon the same woman.” Yesterday Harry Hollander, Health Department counsel, said he would recommend to the Corporation Counsel that Justice Spiegel's latest decision be appealed again. Was It a Reversal? Asked after his decision whether a State Supreme Court justice could, in effect, overule reversal by the Appellate Division, Justice Spiegel said he believed his current deci sion should stand because it was the most up to date in the case. Hyman W. Gamso, clerk of the Appellate Division, said that there was no question which decision should stand, because the appeals court did not actually reverse Justice Spiegel. However, appellate court pa pers appear to indicate that the justice was indeed rever sed. The appellate justices sent the case back to him for his reconsideration partly because during the period of their deli beration the United State Su preme Court had ruled in two abortion cases known as the Roe and Doe cases. The Appellate Division felt these cases might have some bearing on Justice Spiegel's opinion. The justice said yesterday that they did not and that he would “have the courage to stick by my convictions.” He repeated that an “abortion register” of women was moral ly and legally wrong."

Majority Opinions Specifically, the majority, speaking through Justice Bur ger, decided the following: ¶States may punish the print ing or sale of works “which ap peal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual con duct in a patently offensive way and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious lit erary, artistic, political or sci entific value.” ¶In judging whether a work is “prurient” a jury should ap ply the views of “the average persons, applying contemporary community standards,” rather than any hypothetical national definition of what is obscene. ¶States must define explicit ly in their laws the kinds of “sexual conduct” that will sub ject a publisher or distributor to prosecution if it is described offensively. ¶It will no longer be a de fense to a prosecution for ob scenity that the work involved had some “redeeming social value,” as it has been since 1966 Supreme Court decision. ¶Trials on charges of ob scenity may properly admit “expert affirmative evidence” as to the character of the pub lication, film or performance. States have the right to as sume, in the absence of clear proof, that there is a causal connection between pornoi graphic material and crime and other antisocial behavior. There is no constitutional doctrine of privacy that pro tects the display of obscene material in public places, and governmental limits on this sort of display do not involve “thought control.” The Voting Lineup Dissenting on all the cases were Justices William O. Doug las, William J. Brennan Jr., Pot ter Stewart and Thurgood Mar I shall. Other than Justice Burg er, the Justices appointed by Mr. Nixon who were in the majority were Harry A. Black mun, Lewis F. Powell Jr and William H. Rehnquist. Justice White, the fifth member of the majority, was appointed by President Kennedy. In a series of dissents, the minority justices objected to the new guidelines as imping ing on the free speech and freedom of the press, stressed, the vagueness of any defini tions based on local commun ity views and predicted that citizens would be unable in the future to know whether they were running a risk of violating the law. Chief Justice Burger empha sized in one of the two lead ing cases—a California prose cution for mailing an obscene advertisement for books and film—the virtues of having wide variety of definitions of obscenity all over the country. “It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound,” he said, “to read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept the public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas or New York City. “People in different states vary in their tastes and atti tudes,” the Chief Justice con tinued, “and this diversity is not to be strangled by the absolutism of imposed uni formity.” No National Guideline This ruling, taken at face value, threatens to make it dif ficult if not impossible for pro ducers and distributors of na tional magazines and motion pictures to have any advance assurance that their products will not subject them to crim inal penalties in one locality although they are unobjection able in another. Without attempting to dictate statutory language, Mr. Burger suggested that states could pro hibit, if they wished, patently offensive representations or de scriptions of “ultimate sexual acts,’ normal or perverted, ac tual or simulated’.and of “mas turbation, excretory functions and lewd exhibition of the genitals.” “Sex and nudity may not be exploited without limit by films or pictures exhibited or sold in places of public accommoda tion, any more than live sex and nudity can be exhibited or sold without limit in such pub lic places,” the Chief Justice said. As for possible restrictions on free speech implicit in to day's decision, Mr. Burger de clared, “To equate the free and robust exchange of ideas and political debate with commer cial exploitation of obscene material demeans the grand conception of the First Amend ment and its high purposes in the historic struggle for free dom.” In the second leading case, involving two Atlanta motion picture theatres, Mr. Burger said that states should not be deterred from passing obscen ity laws merely because there was “no conclusive evidence or empirical data” that pornog raphy leads to crime and vio lence. He maintained that there was “ample basis for legislators to conclude that a sensitive key relationship of human exist ence, central to family life, community welfare and the de velopment of human personal ity, can be debased and dis torted by crass commercial ex ploitation of sex.” Justice Douglas said in his dissent in the California case that obscenity issues “have no business being in the courts.” Instead, he suggested that they be handled by a censorship of fice created by constitutional amendment, if the people want some sort of control, so that some firm basis for criminal proceedings could be estab lished. “To send men to jail for vio lating standards they cannot understand, construe and apply is a monstrous thing to do in nation dedicated to fair trials and due process,” he said. In his dissent in the Georgia case, Justice Brennan concluded that the Constitution prohibits both the states and Federal Government from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their “alleged ‘obscene contents.” “Like the proscription of abortions,” he wrote, “the ef fort to suppress obscenity is predicated on unprovable, al though strongly held, assump tions about human behavior, morality, ‘sex and religion. “The existence of these as sumptions cannot validate statute that substantially un dermines the guarantees of the First Amendment, any more than the existence of similar assumptions on the issue of abortion can validate a statute that infringes on the constitu tionally protected privacy in terests of a pregnant woman,”"
House Passes Legal Aid Bill With Amendments That Backers Say Cripple It,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/22/archives/house-passes-legal-aid-bill-with-amendments-that-backers-say.html,"WASHINGTON, June 21 — A bleary‐eyed House voted late tonight to create an independ ent corporation to provide legal services for the poor. But as passed—by a vote of 276 to 95—the bill bore only a faint resemblance to the bi partisan compromise that had reached the floor 11 hours earlier. “What we've got now,” one dejected advocate of strong le gal services for the poor said later, “is little short of a dis aster.” The bill would bar legal serv ices lawyers from becoming in volved in some of the key social issues of the day, such as school desegregation and abor tion. Deluge of Amendments The lawyers would also be barred from engaging in poli tics, social advocacy activities or legislative lobbying on be half of their clients. And the new federally funded corporation would be prohibited from contracting for outside legal research or other assist ance by universities and other so‐called legal back‐up centers. As critics continued to pep per the bill with amendments, Representative Wayne L. Hays, Democrat of Ohio, rose and suggested that the entire bill be sent back to committee for further study. Despite the bellows of “Right on!” from some weary col leagues, the motion was defeat ed, 283 to 91, and the deluge of amendments continued. The bill now goes to the Senate, where efforts will be made to strip away many of the House restrictions. The bipartisan compromise, calling for the creation of an independent Legal Services Corporation, had been drafted over a period of months by the House Education and Labor Committee. President Nixon had first pro posed spinning off the legal services program from the Of fice of Economic Opportunity two years ago by creating an independent, federally funded corporation. The proposal was designed primarily to shield the program from its political critics, includ ing a number of Governors. Earlier Bill Vetoed Congress subsequently cre ated such a corporation in 1971 as part of a broad antipoverty bill. However, the bill was ve toed by the President, mostly because it restricted his au thority to appoint all members of the corporation board. In a major concession to the President, the compromise gave him full discretion in choosing members of the 11‐member board, subject only to Senate confirmation. In recent days, it had become clear that there was a deep division within the White House over what form of legis lation should be pushed. Leonard Garment, the new White House counsel, and Frank Carlucci, Under Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, had indicated that they were generally satisfied with the committee compromise. On the other side of the issue were Howard Phillips, who as antipoverty director had been placed in charge of terminating the agency this year, and Wil liam E. Timmons, the White House director of Congres sional relations. Both Mr. Phillips and Mr. Timmons had lobbied exten sively in recent days, urging the House to hold firm against anything except the President's own legal services proposal that had been rewritten by the bipartisan compromisers. President Nixon had sought many of the restrictions writ ten into the bill during to night's noisy marathon session. Many of the proposals were offered by Representative Al bert H. Quie, Republican of Minnesota, a ranking member of the House Education and Labor Committee who had earlier helped draft the corn promise. Others were proposed by Representative Edith Green, Democrat of Oregon, a long time critic of antipoverty pro grams. ‘Cutting Edge’ Opposed One Green amendment, bar ring outside legal research or tical activity and social ad other assistance, was described as particularly damaging by advocates of strong legal serv ices for the poor. In offering her amendment, Mrs. Green reminded colleagues that the legal back‐up center at Harvard University had aided the National Association for the Advancement of Col ored People in the suit to force bussing of school children in Detroit. “The time has come,” she said, “to prohibit use of Federal funds such as, this for the cut ting edge of social reform.” Among the additional restric tions written into the bill were the following: ¶Prohibiting the use of legal services funds in desegregation schools. ¶Prohibiting full‐time legal services lawyers from engaging in partisan or nonpartisan po litical activities, including voter registration drives. ¶Prohibiting legal services lawyers from engaging in out side law practice. ¶ Prohibiting use of the cor poration's funds or resources for any political activities. ¶ Allowing the courts to re quire the corporation to pay court costs and attorney fees for those who win cases brought against them by legal services lawyers. ¶ Prohibiting legal services lawyers from rioting or engag ing in any civil disturbances or illegal activities or inciting ther clients to do so. ¶ Prohibiting use of legal services lawyers to force hospi tals or doctors to perform non therapeutic abortions on clients. ¶Prohibiting use of legal services funds for defense of anyone who sought amnesty for refusing to service in the military."
HOUSE APPROVES $19‐B1111011 BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/23/archives/house-approves-19billion-bill-plan-includes-urban-funds-opposed-by.html,"WASHINGTON, June 22 —The House approved tonight $19‐billion appropriations bill that includes funds for urban renewal and Model Cities pro grams that the Nixon Admin istration had not sought. The bill was passed by a vote of 317 to 21 and now goes to the Senate. It calls for spending $453.5 million more than the Admin istration had wanted for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and for space, science and veterans pro grams in the fiscal year starting July I. However, the $19‐billion would still be $1.7‐billion below appropriations for the same pro grams in the current fiscal year. The debate was marked by an angry exchange over whether Congress had the “guts” to force the Administra tion to spend the money it appropriates. The exchange was touched off when an effort to write language into the bill requir ing the Administration to spend the funds for urban renewal, Model Cities and open space urban programs was ruled out of order on the ground that it was an attempt to add legisla tion to an appropriations bill. Democrat Is Critical Representative B. F. Sisk, Democrat of California, told the House, “Apparently we don't have the guts to mandate spending.” The House Rules Committee, of which he is a member, had sent to the House floor a few hours earlier a Democratic sponsored bill that would re strict the President's power to impound, or refuse to spend, funds appropriated by Con gress. Mr. Sisk, a co‐sponsor of the anti‐impoundment measure, said that the bill “obviously is going to be vetoed.” He added that when the House had chance to do something about mandating the spending on funds, as he felt it did in the bill passed today, “we run for cover.” With that, Representative George H. Mahon, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Appropriations Commit tee, marched to the well of the House, waved his arms guts to guit incurring such guts to quit incrring such huge deficits” there would be no problem about forcing the President to spend all the money. ‘Awful Position’ “It puts us in an awful posi tion, authorizing and appropri ating more and more and in creasing the debt more and more and not raising the rev enues,” Mr. Mahon said. The most controversial sec tions of the appropriations bill would provide $150‐million for Model Cities programs in the fiscal year starting July 1, $600 million for urban renewal, and $70‐million for the open space land program, which is designed to encourage the development of urban parks. The Administration had re quested no funds for Model Cities or the open space pro gram and only $137.5‐million for urban renewal because it wants to consolidate these and other programs into a special revenue sharing program. The Appropriations Commit tee recommended the extra funds on the ground that the programs should not be “halted precipitiously.” The House rejected, 241 to 106, an effort to increase the urban renewal funds to $1‐bil lion. It also turned back, 80 to 34, a move to cut the urban re newal funds to $322‐million. The House also shouted down an amendment by Representa tive Bella S. Abzug, Democrat of Manhattan, that would have cut $475‐million from the space program and barred funds for work on the space shuttle. Also rejected were efforts to reduce funds for the Selective Service System and to increase money for comprehensive plan ning grants that go to states and localities. The anti‐impoundment meas ure that was approved by the Rules Committee would re quire the President to notify Congress of each impoundment and permit either the House or Senate to veto the President's action in 60 days. The bill also would put a $267.1‐billion ceil ing on Federal spending in the fiscal year starting July 1. Water Bill Passed WASHINGTON, June 22 (UPI) — The Senate approved today a stringent clean‐water bill to require the states to establish minimum Federal drinking water standards. The measure, which was ap proved by voice vote, would authorize up to $165.3‐million over three years to help estab lish and implement such stand ards. It was estimated that the cost for implementing the measure completely over a five‐year period would be $334.3‐million. The bill was sent to the House, where officials declined to predict its prospects for pas sage. Under the bill, the Environ mental Protection Agency would provide grants to the states to finance the costs of water‐purification programs. Science Funds Approved WASHINGTON, June 22 (AP) —The House passed a $621.9 million National Science Foun dation bill today after a vote barring use of funds for re search on live human fetuses. The bill, authorizing funds or the fiscal year starting July 1, was passed by a vote of 364 to 61 and went to the Senate. The fetus amendment was approved 288 to 73 after emo ional cries for rejection of it."

AUSTRALIA EASES SOME SEX TABOOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/24/archives/australia-eases-some-sex-taboos-poll-on-premarital-sex-tolerance-of.html,"SYDNEY, Australia, June 23—A pair of high‐school lovers appeared on a television talk show here recently with Ger maine Greer, the Australian born feminist and writer. “What do you do together?” Miss Greer asked. “Everything,” the girl replied promptly, clasp ing the hand of her bearded boyfriend. The girl picked at random from the studio audience was perhaps less typical than the Australian girls who still refer to sex outside marriage as “a naughty.” But the incident il lustrates the emergence of a new permissiveness. “By the standards of New York and San Francisco today,” a Sydney magazine editor said recently, “Australia is still in the Dark Ages. But the new permissiveness is almost stag gering when compared with what went before.” A few years ago an inter nationally known conductor fell into disgrace when material deemed pornographic was found in his luggage at the Sydney airport. Until recently customs inspectors would look for for bidden copies of Playboy mag azine. Any color slides were held up to the light. Objectionable scenes were cut out of films. The musical “Oh! Calcutta!” was closed after one performance When permission was given to pre sent “Hair,” with its one fleet ing nude scene, it was con sidered daring. An Australian play whose dialogue included a single four‐letter word re sulted in prosecutions for “ob scenity.” All this has changed, at least in big cities like Sydney and Melbourne. There are still places, like the conservative mostly rural state of Queens land, in Northeastern Australia where the old standards pre vail. Poll on Premarital Sex Personal conduct is another matter. Four years ago in survey of hospital patients by three physicians in Melbourne seven out of ten women said that they had had sex before marriage. One in three “had no knowledge of contracep tion,” the physicians said and did not bother with precautions against pregnancy. According to Government figures one Australian baby in 12 is born out of wedlock. Some Australian historians have attributed loose sexual standards to the heritage of early colonial days, when the East, Coast was settled for the most part by convicts and prostitutes deported from the British Isles. Simulated sexual relations and complete nudity are toler ated on Australian stages. “Last Tango in Paris” is being shown uncut. Yet to be seen, except privately are hard‐core sex movies and “live sex” shows. One of the first acts of the Labor Government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam after its victory on Dec. 2 ended the 23‐year reign of the con servative coalition of the Lib eral and Country parties was to let in “Portnoy's Complaint.” Mr. Whitlam has supported a move for liberalized abortion laws, so far unsuccessful but clearly gaining. The 57‐year‐old Prime Minister has how ever stopped short of his out spoken wife's support for legal izing marijuana. A Supreme Court judge in Sydney dismissed charges of indecency against a stripper who stripped completely in a night club. Another judge turned loose a collection of paintings that the police had seized as obscene. The South Australian State Supreme Court ruled that “there is no moral question involved” in the use in books of four‐letter words. Tolerance of Homosexuals In a society that traditional ly exalts maleness, a writer who is a homosexual appeared recently on a popular televi sion show in an amicable dis cussion of life‐styles with a football superstar. Only six months ago, an em ploye of an Anglican church in Sydney lost his job after ac knowledging his homosexuality on television. Since then a Congregationalist pastor in Perth the Rev. Mario Shoen maker who officiated at wed ding ceremonies for male and female homosexual couples, has won public support from his congregation. The expulsion of a homosex ual from a residential college at Macquarie University in Syd ney this week brought an immediate boycott by a con struction union on work at the university. William Hayden, the Minister for Social Security in the Labor Government advocated liberal ization of sex laws on a televi sion interview program. “I've always believed that our attiudes on homosexual law reform, abortion law reform prostitution and generally on the social issues are quite wrong and too intrusive,” he declared. Earlier this year, a survey showed that an Australian tele vision soap opera whose story line offered a generous portion of nudity and sex was the most popular program with children aged 6 to 14 years. The Queens land Education Minister, Sir Alan Fletcher ordered an in vestigation. The producer con tended that most Australian children were “well ahead” of the script in sexual knowledge."

United Church of Christ Elects First Black Woman Moderator,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/24/archives/united-church-of-christ-elects-first-black-woman-moderator-warns.html,"ST. LOUIS, June 23 — Mar garet A. Haywood, an associate justice of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, was elected moderator of the United Church of Christ here today, becoming the first black woman to hold a position of top leadership in an American biracial denomination. The United Church of Christ, the 13th largest Protestant de nomination in the United States, with two million members, is holding its ninth biennial gen eral synod, or governing con gress, in St. Louisa The church was formed 16 years ago by joining the Congregational Christian Church and the Evan gelical and Reformed Church. As moderator, Judge Hay wood, elected to the unsalaried post for two years, will’ pre side over the remaining ses sions of the synod, which will continue through Tuesday. There are 728 delegates present. Mrs. Haywood came out of business school in 1930 at the height of the Depression, with no job and no money for col lege. She got married, but the marriage, she said, “was dis astrous,” and before long she was left to raise a daughter on her own. On $15 a Week “I wanted my daughter to have a good education, but was earning only $15 a week as a secretary,” she said. “That's when I began to think about going into law.” She was graduated from Ter rell Law School; an institution for black students that allowed them to work during the day and attend classes at night. For the first two years she was the only woman in her law school class, and during the last two years there were only two. Her law practice became what a fellow woman judge described as a “people's prac tice,” involving mostly juve nile cases, family relations, landlord and tenant disputes, accident cases and civil rights. Mrs. Haywood practiced law for 25 years before President Johnson appointed her to the part‐time post of District of Columbia Councilwoman. She said that, as a black of ficial in a predominantly white denomination, “I think I have helped to build bridges of un derstanding.” Warns Against Secrecy The Rev. Dr. Robert V. Moss of New York, president of the United Church of Christ, said in his keynote address to the synod yesterday that secrecy had no place in the church. He scolded a United Church of Christ agency, the Council for Christian Social Action, for dis missing its entire staff in closed door executive session some time ago. “There is no real place in our churches for a large de gree of secrecy,” Dr. Moss said. “There is nothing really wrong about washing our dirty linen in public. How else are we go ing to get really clean?” Today, Dr. Moss was re elected president of the church for a second four‐year term. He is a vice president of the National Council of Churches and a member of the council's governing board and chairman of its Commission on Emer gency Ministries Regarding the War. The synod, meeting at the Chase‐Park Plaza Hotel, has been holding hearings on many issues, including freedom of the press, amnesty for Vietnam draft evaders and deserters, Vietnam reconstruction, restor ing diplomatic relations with Cuba, abortion, racial prob lems in southern African coun tries, rights of terminally ill patients to refuse medical treatment, criminal justice and penal reform, farm workers’ rights, proposed Federal budget cuts and the roles of women in church and society. Ending ‘Sexist’ Terms As a result of efforts by study group, the synod will adopt changes in the consti tution of the church that elim inate what was called “sexist” language. For example, “chair men” will be changed to “chair persons,” and “he” to “he or she.” The church is the first major denomination to take this step. The late baseball player Rob erto Clemente was honored today with the Jackie Robinson Memorial Award, presented by the church's Commission on Racial Justice. The award, established after Mr. Robin son's death, is given in recog nition of humanitarian activ ities on behalf of blacks. Mr. Robinson had been active in the United Church of Christ. Peter Bridge, formerly a re porter for the defunct Newark News, who was jailed for re fusing to divulge confidential information to an Essex Coun ty, N.J., grand jury, will re ceive the Elijah Lovejoy Award of A.D., a magazine published jointly by the United Church of Christ and the United Pres byterian Church. Mr. Bridge is now a freelance writer and lec turer."
Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/24/archives/metropolitan-briefs-from-the-police-blotter-city-to-modernize.html,"Without New York's liberalized abortion law, there would be 24,000 additional children on the city's welfare rolls, according to a study of the impact of abortion reform released yesterday by the Health Services Administration. According to the study, the average number of children a welfare mother has declined from 2.77 in 1970, when the new law went into effect, to 2.54 in 1972, a much sharper decline than in states where abortion was not available. By the end of last year, when there were 634,000 chil dren on welfare in the city, 500,000 legal abortions had been performed here. Gordon Chase, the Health Services Administrator, said the study showed that abortion reform had allowed welfare mothers “greater freedom of choice in planning their families.” Pollution Charged at Lake Champlain A citizens group at Lake Champlain upstate charged the International Paper Company with discharging pollut ants into the lake in excess of levels permitted by law. The group, the Lake Champlain Committee, asked Henry L. Diamond, the state's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, to investigate discharge levels at the com pany's two‐year‐old mill on the southern end of the lake. The committee said that 48 of 104 readings taken since the mill opened had shown excess discharges. Area's Fuel Shortage Held Eased William E. Ozzard, president of the New Jersey Public Utility Commission, said that new sources for natural gas had eased the shortage in the Northeast, but that the Federal Power Commission continued to favor the Southwest in allocating restricted gas supplies. Mr. Ozzard charged that New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were being “short changed” by the Federal agency, but said he expected the agency to become “more realistic” next year. He made the remarks on “New Jersey Report” on WOR‐TV. Cemetery Union Chief Due in Court The striking cemetery workers and their union president, Sam Cimaglia, are due in State Supreme Court at 9:30 A.M. tomorrow to show why they should not be held in con tempt for ignoring a court order last week to go back to work. Justice Thomas C. Chimera signed the show‐cause order at the request of State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz.

City to Modernize Harlem Library The city's Municipal Services Administration will spend $879,479 to modernize and rehabilitate the Hamilton Grange Branch Library, a New York City landmark in Harlem. The four‐story library, at 503 West 145th Street, contains 33,000 books. From the Police Blotter The husband of the late blues singer, Billie Holliday, has been arrested and charged with the shooting of another man at a party in Roosevelt, L. I., early Monday morning. The Nassau County police in Mineola said the suspect, Louis McKay, 64 years old, of Mount Vernon, N. Y., sur rendered after having first fled the scene. The victim, Robert Taten, 42, was reported in fair condition with a chest wound in Nassau County Medical Center, East Mea dow... Two persons were killed and three injured when their Manhattan‐bound car crashed into an abutment on the lower level of the 59th Street Bridge at 3 A.M. The police said the car apparently was going too fast when it attempted to go through an exit... Twenty‐seven molotov cocktails found on the roof of a garage in Elmhurst, Queens, may have been intended for use in a fight between two street gangs in the area, according to the police. Two youths at the scene, 104‐18 Martense Avenue, were ar rested and charged with reckless endangerment and pos sesion of dangerous instruments."
A TV dynasty,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/24/archives/archie-and-maude-and-fred-and-norman-and-alan-a-tv-dynasty.html,"Spraying ashes from his dime cigar over the arms of his prized wing chair Now, you take Norman Lear. The skinny little guy who thought me up and started such a big insurruption in television—“All in the Family,” then “Sanford and Son” and then “Maude.” Jeez, him and his partner, Bud Yorkin, will be runnin’ the whole media, the rate they're goin'. Norman says I remind him of his father. Well, I don't know about that. Norman has blue eyes, I noticed, but he's one of the Chosen People. And a bleedin’ heart liberal, just like Mike Stivic, that Polack who married my daughter, Gloria. Only difference be tween ‘em is that Norman works. Really throws himself into it, too. One time he's watchin’ a re hearsal of the show where my wife's cousin Maude decides to have an abortion when she finds out she's pregnant at the age of 47. There's dreamy Norman in the corner, bawlin’ tears all over that funny white walrus mustache he's got—even though he wrote the script. He's a card‐carrying member of the American Civil.Liberties Union, but he spends hours on planes noddin’ sympatheti cally to drunks and hardhats—the kind who fly first‐class, mind you—while his wife is practically throwin’ up out the window. Later he tells her, “The guy's got something interesting to say.” Yorkin is maybe a little easier for me to under stand. He ain't always talkin’ about “reaching people” while sockin’ away $200,000 a year. He's more a man of action. Good background on the technical side of things, though he says he used to be afraid of being electrocuted if he touched the back of a television set. Sure, he wears one of them hippie Egyptian rings, but I'd hate to ask him to step outside the sound stage for a fight. Norman is one worried‐lookin’ 50‐year‐old man, but Bud is only three years younger and he could still pass for the president of some college frat house—I mean the college's top Jewish frat. I wish somebody would tell me how these two millionaire kings of television manage to work together. DISSOLVE All right, Mr. Bunker. Norman Lear and Alan (Bud) Yorkin share 50‐50 in the ownership of booming Tandem Productions, Inc., which produces “All in the Family” and “Maude” for C.B.S., and Norbud Productions, which stars Redd FOXX, the brilliant, black stand‐up comedian, in “Sanford and Son” on N.B.C. “We call ourselves Tandem,” Yorkin said in 1962, three years after the partner ship started, “because we think of ourselves as two guys on a bicycle, going uphill.” The bicycle is still going uphill, but in a much higher gear. These two bold independents are on the hottest streak for a small firm since Goodson‐Todman Productions bathed the black and white screens of the nineteen‐fifties in quiz and game shows. Their innovative, sophisticated, half‐hour situation come dies are ranked first, second and either fourth or fifth in the Nielsen ratings most weeks. Yorkin and Lear have become so important since “All in the Family” went on the air as a midseason replace ment in January, 1971, that Jerry Perenchio, the big‐time theatrical agent who promoted the mam moth Joe Frazier‐Muhammad Ali title fight, has been working for them since last January as presi dent of their company. The producers of some of TV's hottest proper ties — Norman Lear (left) and Alan Yorkin with two lapfuls of their fictional family of stars. Back row, from left: Maude's husband, Walter; Maude (Edith Bunker's cousin); Maude's daughter, Carol, and next‐door neighbor, Arthur. Front row: Maude's maid, Florida; Archie Bunker's daughter, Gloria; Gloria's husband, Mike; Archie's wife, Edith; Archie; Fred Sanford, the aging Los Angeles junk man, and his son, Lamont. Only three years ago, all the pragmatic Yorkin and the deeply emotional Lear asked was to direct one or two feature films a year. Their future ap peared to consist of more modestly successful, commercially‐minded screen comedies like Yorkin's “Inspector Clousot” and Lear's “The Night They Raided Minsky's.” Today a hurriedly hired corps of Tandem vice presidents tries to calculate sales projections on Archie Bunker T‐shirts and the paperback “Edith Bunker Cookbook” and to figure the value in 1978 of the Japanese television rights to this past season's “All in the Family,” with its topical jokes about President Nixon, swinging couples and the Jewish Defense League. Tandem Productions is awash with new, “socially con cerned” projects. Yorkin is filling in the outlines of a 1974 N.B.C. series to star Jane Alexander, co‐star of the play “The Great White Hope,” as the liberated magazine‐editor wife of an older gov ernment official. Lear talks of a drama anthology and of a daytime “comedy soap opera” about a blue‐collar neighborhood in Detroit. (“The kids pick their noses and the noses really run,” an aide comments.) Just as Lear triumphantly spun off “Maude” from a “Family” episode about Edith Bunker's brassy, liberal upstate cousin, he plans to develop Maude's gusty black maid; Florida, played by Esther Rolle, into what he calls “the first series about a real ghetto family—a comedy fraught with drama, the reverse of ‘A Raisin in the Sun,’ which was a drama fraught with comedy.” It may start next January on an undisclosed net work Amid all the Emmies, the black‐tie award dinners tendered by ethnic groups and the flurry of imita tions, it is easy to lose sight of the central fact that these two diverse partners haven't pedaled in tandem since 1965, the year Lear wrote an Oscar nominated screenplay for a film called “Divorce, American Style,” which Yorkin produced and di rected in their previously established pattern of operations. Since then, win or lose, Yorkin and Lear have worked almost totally apart on their own individual projects, funneling all profits (to be split equally) through their seldom‐visited executive offices on the Los Angeles street with the absurd name of Avenue of the Stars. Lear wanted to produce and direct, not just turn out scripts. Yorkin knew he was a talented enough director to work with other writers. And then, in the late nineteen‐sixties, their business manager, J. William Hayes, a lawyer whose other clients in clude Carol Burnett and Sandy Koufax, advised the oddly matched pair that their individual fees in a becalmed movie industry would not keep up their standard of living. “You have to put your energies where 80 per cent of the marketplace is,” he recalls telling them.That meant television. At that point Lear read a brief item in Variety describing the hit British Broadcasting Corporation series “Till Death Do Us Part,” created by John Speight and about a Cockney hatemonger, Alf Garnett, who argues social issues with his son‐in law. The idea instantly appealed to Lear, who, be sides a vivid memory of his relationship with his own father, has the frustrated, crusading spirit of an old‐line N.A.A.C.P. and A.C.L.U. liberal and commercial craftsman's eye for what will make TV audience laugh. That skill he sharpened as a top comedy writer in the nineteen‐fifties for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Martha Raye, George Gobel and Tennessee Ernie Ford. Lear wouldn't have begun adapting the B.B.C. program to American terms, however, if he had not seen money in it. Having nearly gone bank rupt after World War II trying to sell a novelty ashtray clipped to a saucer, he has no interest in repeating that early struggle to make a living. As it was, he gravitated to television in its early years and by the age of 27 found himself earning $100, 000 a year. He prides himself on his ability to craft humor. “My purpose is to entertain,” he says. “I had never done a half‐hour TV series, so this was a writing challenge.” But there was more than that: Lear felt certain he could succeed because he was drawing from his own life, an easy assign ment for any good writer and a rare experience for a television writer. “My father and I fought all those battles,” he says. “I thought: ‘My God, if could only get this kind of thing on American television.’“ To a large extent, “All in the Family” is college dropout Lear's penance for not having won more battles with his father, the late Herman Lear, luckless Hartford and New Haven salesman of everything from vacuum cleaners to garages, who spent his hours at home telling his wife to “stifle” herself when he wasn't casually denouncing schwartzers. “I never forgave him for being bigot,” declares his son,, who still reveals his New England origins in a pronunciation like “maaket,” “but I found there were other things to love him for. If I had been smarter, and not his kid, I could have reached him, affected him in those attitudes.” To use “All in the Family” as a humorous means of converting the world's Archie Bunkers while getting rich in the process, Lear had to battle his way onto television screens. A.B.C. first commis sioned two pilot episodes starring Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton and spent $250,000 before dropping the project as too risky. In 1970 Lear had given up and was directing “Cold Turkey,” movie farce about smoking, when a newly installed regime at C.B.S., headed by network president Robert Wood and programing chief Fred Silver man, asked to see the dusty pilots Yorkin and Lear had made for A.B.C. as possibly a quick way to trumpet their arrival. There was little sales resistance to Lear's concept of the Bunker family. However, months of argu ment were spent on the specifics of language and subject matter. Wood and Silverman delegated much of the responsibility for this to William Tan kersley, the Hollywood head of C.B.S.'s department of program practices, a censor's kind of word for chief censor. Tankersley gave every appearance of turning into a heavy weekly kibitzer should the show ever get on the air, and at the end he was still bothered by the openly sensual byplay between Mike and Gloria in the first episode (Lear wrote most of the first year's scripts). But Lear stood pat. Then the censor persuaded Lear to delete “smart‐ass” and “goddammit” from the dialogue of the first story. Even so, the unprecedented Archie was to be shown sputtering derogatory re marks about a Catholic nun and “black beauties.” As a last‐ditch effort, Tankersley wanted to open the series with the second episode, which he found less offensive. The night before air time, Lear won his point that the pilot did a better job of introduc ing the astounding characters. C.B.S. was prepared to have as many as 50 affiliated stations refuse to take further segments. A phalanx of extra telephone operators stood by on opening night to receive protest calls from the public. A nervously chuckling C.B.S. voice‐over disclaimer ran with the credits, terming the show “a humorous spotlight on our frailties, prejudices and concerns.” But reaction was slight—and mostly favor able, building over two months to a crescendo of praise and high ratings. Lear knew by March, 1971, that he had a hit and was home free. The voice‐over died, the cen sors relaxed and a good work ing relationship took root. There was a major flare‐up the following fall over the memorable story of Mike's temporary impotence. C.B.S. at first refused to run the tape but finally settled for a few seconds of clipping at the end which eliminated a shot of a rejuvenated Mike heading up stairs to the bedroom, arm in arm with his eager wife. Aside from that, disputes have been minor. Three Midwestern stations this season refused to broadcast the controversial “Maude” abortion decision, but C.B.S. let the controversy pass quietly. TODAY Lear is ex ecutive producer of “All in the Family” and “Maude,” while Yorkin is nominally executive pro ducer of “Sanford and Son,” another B.B.C. adaptation which camouflages its tra ditional situation‐comedy for mat with an occasional mili tant‐remark by Foxx, who plays the aging Los Angeles junkman. Lear still puts in an occasional word about “Family” scripts, but since the first season he has turned daily Bunker operations over to producer‐director John Rich. Now Lear concentrates his 16‐hour workdays at C.B.S. Television City on establishing the character of “Maude” alongside star Bea trice Arthur and producer Road Parker. Yorkin concedes that pro ducer‐writer Aaron Ruben really runs “Sanford and Son,” freeing him to go back to his real love, films, except for a visit to the Tuesday night audience taping. One Lear loyalist on Tandem's television side grumbles, “Bud's contribution is that he's off making feature films. He's the luckiest man alive.” This is not completely fair. Between postproduction edit ing chores on his breezily amoral Ryan O'Neal comedy, “The Thief Who Came to Din ner,” Yorkin put together Tandem's TV special tribute to Duke Ellington. When a “Maude” guest director fell ill not long ago, Yorkin stepped in to finish the day's work. But Yorkin and Lear hold few meetings with each other. They communicate largely through memos. About once a month they and their wives exchange home visits, bring ing along a relative from the East who wants to reminisce about poorer, early days. “My mother here, his sister there,” Lear puts it. In general the TV series are natural showcases for writers. Yorkin, a patient bit tough director with degrees in elec trical engineering from Car negie Tech and English litera ture from Columbia, is all but frozen out. He sees Lear get ting most of the credit for their success. When Yorkin appeared on TV talk shows recently to plug his new movie, there was a near‐revolt by Rich, Ruben and Parker, the three series producers. Yorkin inadvertently accepted plaudits for the Tandem pro grams without mentioning them. Now he is careful to lavish credit upon them. “In the beginning,” Yorkin says a shade wryly, “I was the one being written about.” In 1959, Yorkin, the beefy armed son of a Washington, Pa., dress‐shop owner, was the foremost director and pro ducer of prestige TV specials, showcasing stars like Fred Astaire and Jack Benny. Such specials were Tandem's initial stock in trade, although the team had so little clout at first that Marilyn Monroe made them wait four hours to see her about an idea for a TV musical and never showed up. Later their dreams of movie glory and Lear's protean television creations changed the nature of the relationship. These days Yorkin dismisses all the in evitable talk of disunity with bland comments like, “What ever is good for Norman is good for me, and vice versa.” He is content to leave tele vision pre‐eminence to Lear and live a more even life than his intense partner. Yorkin was a quiet McGov ern Democrat last year, but with his wife, Peg, a former actress, he has played host to Henry Kissinger at their sumptuous Spanish‐style man sion just off Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills. “I'm maybe a more pragmatic human being than Norman is,” Yor kin says. In proof of his re laxed attitude, a basketball hoop is nailed incongruously next to the mansion's elegant oaken front door. The Yorkins do more partying than Lear and his wife, Frances. Peg Yorkin is virtually queen of Hollywood society as presi dent of SHARE, Inc., a chari table group of wealthy wives who do chorus‐line high kicks at an annual party to benefit mentally retarded children. Yorkin has concerned himself more with Tandem's long range future than with wheth er a series does social good. At the moment he is inter ested in expansion into con cert promotion, pop records and movies for television. One employe comments: “Bud is interested in becom ing another Universal Studios. Norman is thinking about the next script.” With little talent for busi ness dealings, Lear has served brilliantly as Tandem's “crea tive end” in television. He takes “Maude” scripts home to his Persian‐carpeted Brent wood study on weekends for rewrites, but he also thinks up new series which will, it is hoped, occupy him for the next two seasons and post pone his own return to films, for Lear has become hooked on series television. Ironical ly, the maligned medium has done for him what his few superficial films never did—allowed him to insinuate his liberal outlook into his work. A deep admirer of the social commentary of Lenny Bruce, Lear knows he can't change the world through commercial scripts. “How much could expect to happen from my silly little half‐hour TV show,” he says, “when the entire Judeo‐Christian ethic for some 2,000 years hasn't budged race relations?” Lear tries, anyway. He is no different from an entire type‐cast army of Hollywood liberal writers who would do the same thing if they could. “I want to reach, to understand the Archie Bunkers,” Lear says, “because there are more areas of agree. ment between them and the likes of me than there are areas of disagreement. In communicating, anything can happen. I used to feel sorry that I no longer had time to make movies. Now I'm en joying the opportunity of reaching so many people at once. My film friends tell me constantly that I can be im mediate. If I feel something, I can work it into an episode and get instant feedback. It's not as if I'm stifled. There's nothing I could do in films that I can't do in television. Lear has found his own formula for using television, much as Neil Simon uses plays: to provide the laugh ter of recognition and an out let for his own overflowing hangups and emotions. “At 50,” says Lear, undoubtedly pained with a degree of guilt for living at life's top for the past 23 years on a production of pap and gags, “I don't want to deal with TV's old drivel about the wife burning the roast just before the boss to dinner. I want to en tertain, but I gravitate to sub jects that matter and people worth caring about.” Lear converses with bigots and bores because he constantly searches character for the Yiddish quality called tahm “the ability to be embraceable and human at your most vil lainous, like Anne Baxter in ‘All About Eve,'” he says. He cast Carroll O'Connor and Bea Arthur because he thinks they have tahm. Although his tanned face is unlined, friends, noting the whiteness of his mustache and his thinning hair, whisper that Lear seems to have aged 10 years since “All in the Fam ily” started. He wears his mustache drooped below his lips to hide the scars of a persistent mouth and lip disease called lichen planus. Because of it he is compelled to eat soft foods. His weight has dropped to 146 pounds. Some of his doctors think the problem is caused by the pres sures of his work. Lear, a dev otee of psychoanalysis, pre fers to quote the opinion of his current analyst that the cause is “viral.” JUST as “All in the Family” is derived in varying measure from Lear's relationship with his father, “Maude” represents Lear's attempts to sym pathize with his liberated wife of 16 years (it is Lear's second marriage, her third). Frances Lear, a sportswear buyer for Lord & Taylor when she met Lear in New York, has gone back to work by starting corporations to pro mote the five‐hour work day for mothers in industry, and the advancement of women to high‐level executive jobs. “A great deal of ‘Maude’ comes from my consciousness being raised by the movement,” Frances says, “and from Nor man's consciousness being raised mine.” Lear is a Southern Califor nia board member of the A.C.L.U. He keeps a filing cabinet full of his correspon dence with Pentagon generals on cosmic questions. He showers writer friends like Irving Wallace with copies of liberal newspaper columns on executive privilege and other pet subjects. “He's often sad and gloomy,” Frances reports. “A few weeks ago he made trip to New York to see all the new plays and discuss next season with C.B.S. He's fin ished, he's on holiday. But he gets up in the morning and says, ‘I couldn't sleep a wink.’ I asked him why and he said, ‘Because Nixon said he's going to bring back capital punish ment.’“ An independent outfit like Tandem has to expand to as sure future profits. It never knows when a network will cancel a series and limit the number of episodes which can be sold later to off‐network customers. Witness the recent bombshell cancellation by C.B.S. of Screen Gems’ high ly rated “Bridget Loves Bernie,” a show which in furiated many Jews. At” least Tandem begins its present ex pansion drive from an appar ently strong base. Thanks to use of speedy videotape methods rather than film, weekly production costs on “Family,” “Maude” and “Sanford” are so low that Tandem manages to make “appreciable” profits even from the fixed payments made by the networks. Filmed shows often lose money and go into deficit financing against the hope of profits in syndication to independent stations once network runs end. Other companies still use film either because it's traditional, has a classier image in the industry and thus earns higher weekly pay ments from the networks or because some series, like Westerns, rely on outdoor locations, where it is not con venient to shoot with video tape equipment. The Yorkin‐Lear shows fur ther streamline production by simultaneously using four cameras to shoot all possible angles of the action; tape edit ing is simple and fast after the session. Other techniques which have paid off in quality are the use of responsive live audiences instead of laugh machines and the hiring for the most part of Broadway trained actors who can cope with each grueling week's work. This entails constant script revisions right up to the moment of starting a nonstop, 30‐minute run‐through in the fashion of a one‐act play. “I love a theatrical experience,” says Lear, who spends spring and summer weeks between taping seasons watching the latest New York shows for potential talent. (Bill Macy, who plays Maude's husband, Walter, was hired partly on the strength of a performance in “Oh! Calcutta!”) Tandem also saves money by hiring devilishly hard‐working pro ducer‐writers such as Aaron Ruben of “Sanford,” who can tackle almost any job on a show. The expense of an “au dience warmup man” at tap ings is saved by having Nor man Lear do it. He loves it. Tandem's network earnings, combined with a percentage on the hawking of some con cededly schlock merchandise —Archie Bunker beer mugs, undershirts and the like—are yielding profits of nearly $2 million a year. Given the topi cal nature of the hit shows, syndication profits aren't likely to be as spectacular as those of a more generalized series like “Perry Mason” or “The Lucy Show,” but they will be substantial. And Tan dem is currently in a cash position to hire additional cre ative executives to relieve Yorkin and Lear of the need to dream up new projects. All in all, Tandem's future looks so bright that the company is being wooed for a merger by a half dozen ardent corporate suitors offering up to $15‐mil lion in cash and stock on the basis of Tandem's current earnings and perceived poten tial value. Columbia Pictures is the leading merger can didate. In addition Yorkin and Lear, who draw $200,000 each in yearly salaries, have long since placed some invest ment eggs outside the chancy entertainment industry. Both have tax shelters in real estate, oil and gas. Understandably, Yorkin is readier than Lear to accept a sellout and walk away from 14 years of active partnership which have led to no great satisfaction for him in tele vision. He could go off to work on films full‐time, per haps developing the promising streak of zany humor he re vealed in 1970's “Start the Revolution Without Me.” And he could forget his daily worries that the cornerstone of Tandem's empire will col lapse. Carroll O'Connor fre quently threatens to walk out of his five‐year contract. O'Connor tells friends he is tired of the weekly taping grind, tired above all of being stopped on the street and praised for bigoted remarks when he's really almost as liberal as, say, Norman Lear. The odds are that O'Connor will stay. But Yorkin and Lear can consider the gloomy pre cedent of James Arness who began as a hired hand on “Gunsmoke” and ended up owning the show. Despite the freedom he has carved out for himself, Lear recognizes that he has not freed television from all its old fears. He is furious at C.B.S. for canceling Joseph Papp's production of the anti war play “Sticks and Bones” on political grounds. “The networks try to limit new ideas,” he claims. “Probably dozens of guys have concepts just as new as ‘All in the Family,’ but the networks are not going along with them. They're stuck in a preview house, push‐button, audience sample mentality in picking new programing.” Accepting the International Radio and Television Society's “Broadcaster of the Year” award at the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel last month, Lear tried to buck up morale in the medium by viewing TV's traditional pusillanimity in the context of an entire so ciety which he feels is “psyched out” by stereotypes and mistrust. Supposedly artistic New Yorkers, he de clared, have been making Hol lywood TV producers like himself feel inferior for years, while both coasts gang up to intimidate the Midwest through the sophisticated guest patter on the Johnny Carson and Dick Cavett shows. “People everywhere feel inferior and the result is more fragmentation and mis trust,” Lear said. He men tioned “The Waltons” and “Kung Fu” as well as his own shows as proof that “you in the media do better than the psyching process ever leads you to believe.” “Some of the print media question whether we have the right to express social opinion in a situation‐comedy format,” he told his audience of 600 television production and ad vertising people. “I think we do. And I do not believe we are breaking precedent in doing so. Throughout the years Newton Minow was call ing television a wasteland, there were dozens of situation comedies on the tube. I re member the biggest problems those sitcom families faced. The boss is coming to dinner and the roast is ruined. Or daddy's about to take the car out of the garage and only Sis and Junior know that mom dented the fender that very afternoon. I'd like to suggest that there was a great deal of social opinion in that. America was being told that the biggest problem it faced was that the roast was ruined, which could only mean that there was no urban crisis there were no problems be tween the races, and Vietnam was a word made up by Walter Cronkite. “The so‐called adult themes that television is currently dealing in are themes for which the American people have always been ready. We in television simply weren't trusting the people of this country to accept or reject as they saw fit. The TV think tanks were telling us ‘that the Bible belt wouldn't accept this and the South wouldn't accept that and the Administration wouldn't accept anything. feel that we've reached a time in our national life where we must stop psyching each other out, We, especially in, the media, must start to trust the American public more. And to do that, we must begin to trust ourselves.” Lear is optimistic enough to be considering dusting off an ancient liberal, screenplay of his which never made it to a screen. It is “The John Henry Faulk Story,” a tale of blacklisting in the broadcast ing industry during the Mc Carthy era. “Maybe it can be a ‘Movie of the Week,” Lear says. “It would be exactly what I'm doing with ‘Maude’ and ‘All in the Family'—a very serious subject, the se riousness of which never es capes understanding, but is being tried in the comic genre.” Everything is cyclical in television, perhaps even the Yorkin‐Lear wave of fresh air, candor and laughs at bigotry. For the foreseeable future, anyway, the Tandem mark re mains impressed on a once cowardly and still copycat medium. “Yorkin and Lear have opened up new vistas,” competitor Harris Katleman, head of Metro‐Goldwyn‐Maye?? Television, says admiringly. “If it weren't for ‘All in the Family,’ we would never have received a network order for a pilot about a 40‐year‐old man who lives with his mother.”"
Third of A.M.A. Doctors Polled Would Boycott National System,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/25/archives/third-of-ama-doctors-polled-would-boycott-national-system.html,"A majority of American doc tors are disgruntled by Federal health programs and one‐third would boycott a nationalized health system if it were set up, according to a survey of al most 100,000 physicians that was made public yesterday. The American Medical As sociation's survey of its mem bers was made public during the opening day of the A.M.A.'s annual convention at the Amer icana Hotel. Three doctors out of five who responded said they were dissatisfied with the amounts of money they were being paid under the Medicare program. More than one‐quarter of those who were polled said they rarely if ever treated persons under this Federal program. More than 35 per cent of the doctors who responded said they would either refuse to practice in a nationalized health system, or would leave the practice of medicine altogether if such a system were created. An almost equal percentage of doctors remained uncom mitted. The issue may never arise because it has not been seriously proposed in Congress. Most proposals for a national health insurance system that have been advanced to Con gress would use a blend of private and government money to cover the expenses of health care. One variation, which does not include plans for a national health service such as is in operation in Britain, is a bill backed by organized labor. The sponsors are Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Democrat of Massachusetts, and Represent ative Martha W. Griffiths, Democrat of Michigan. The Kennedy‐Griffiths bill would provide Federal financ ing of medical care and would institute reforms within the health care system. In opening remarks yester day, Dr. Carl A. Hoffman, the A.M.A.'s president, said the bill was an “insidious threat” to the quality of medical care, and that its costs would be enormous. Additionally, he said, “the true objective of the Kennedy Griffiths bill is nationalized health care, the complete and total take‐over of the entire health care delivery system by the Government.” Dr. Hoffman said doctors should support Federal grants for education, research and con struction but should fight “the improper intrusion of govern ment into health care delivery.” During the convention, which ends Thursday, doctors will de bate such issues as Federal di rection of health programs, the unionization of doctors and streamlining the A.M.A. Several thousand research reports, scientific exhibits and educational films also are be ing presented at the Coliseum. As the meeting opened yes terday at the Americana, sev eral hundred pickets assembled outside the hotel to urge that the A.M.A. either support or op pose the concept of abortion on demand."
Suit Demands State Permit Abortions Under Medicaid,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/27/archives/suit-demands-state-permit-abortions-under-medicaid-no-claims.html,"The American Civil Liberties Union sought a restraining or der in Superior Court in Bridgeton yesterday to force the state to make Medi caid payments for nontherapeu tic abortions. The suit, brought on behalf of two pregnant women from Cumberland County, also seeks to force two area hospitals to perform abortions on demand. New Jersey's Department of Medical Assistance and Health Services has been using a set of guidelines on abortion drafted before the recent United States Supreme Court ruling that no state could pm hibit an abortion during the first three months of preg nancy. No Claims Refused “We will pay for anything that the Attorney General's of fice says is legal,” William J. Jones, the director of the medi cal assistance department, which handles Medicaid, said in a telephone interview. “We are in the process of drafting new guidelines on Medicaid and abortion, but until they are announced, we have to abide by the law. “We have not refused any claims for nontherapeutic abor tions, We are holding them un til we get a ruling.” Mr. Jones estimated that the state held about $28,000 in claims for elective abortions. According to Mr. Jones, the state has not ruled out payment for nontherapeutic abortions. “All we can do is wait for some guidance on what claims are legal for us to honor,” he said. “Until the state or the courts rule, we will have to hold the payments for claims that come into us marked elective abortions.’” Stephen M, Nagler, the ex ecutive director of the state A.C.L.U., said that the suit had been brought to prod the state into acting on the new guide lines. “We have to force the state to act on the new regulations,” Mr. Nagler said. “As it is now, the state's policy discriminates against those who could not afford abortions without Medic aid.” Two Named in Suit The suit, brought in the names of Jane Doe, who is eight weeks pregnant, and Mary Roe, who is in her lah week, alleges that the women are being denied abortions de spite the recent Supreme Court decision. “The combination of the only hospitals in their area refusing to perform abortions on de mand, and the state's refusal to pay Medicaid for the pro cedure, in effect, denies them the right to an abortion during their first three months of pregnancy,” Mr. Nagler con tended. “This we feel violates their rights as guaranteed by the recent decision of the Supreme Court.” The two hospitals mentioned in the suit are Newcomb Hos pital and Bridgeton Hospital Association."
Rabbinical Council Urges Ban on Sex and Nude Films,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/28/archives/rabbinical-council-urges-ban-on-sex-and-nude-films.html,"FALLSBURG, N. Y., June 27 —The Rabbinical Council of America called on Governor’ Rockefeller and Mayor Lindsay today to prohibit the showing of “sex and nudity” motion pic ture films, which, the council held, were undermining “the very moral fabric of our so ciety.” In a unanimously adopted re solution, the 1,000‐member Orthodox group urged Governor Rockefeller and Mayor Lindsay “to immediately exercise their authority under the new Su preme Court decision.” Last week the Supreme Court handed down a new set of guidelines on obscenity that will enable states to ban books, magazines, plays and motion pictures that are offensive t?? local standards, even if they might be acceptable elsewhere. The resolution was adopted at the council's 37th annua convention, at the Pine View Hotel. In hailing the Supreme Court decision, Rabbi Ephraim S. Ko latch of Long Beach, L. I. chairman of the convention charged that “TV drama and radio talk shows” were encour aging “infidelity, illegitimacy and abortion.”"
Judge Orders Hospitals To Perform 2 Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/28/archives/judge-orders-hospitals-to-perform-2-abortions-expansion-possible.html,"A New Jersey Superior Court judge yesterday ordered two Cumberland County hospitals to perform elective abortions on two women. The judge said he thought that his ruling was the first of its kind in the state. A hearing, scheduled for July 6, could expand the ruling to women seeking abortions in all nonsectarian, nonprofit hos pitals in the state. The judge, Philip A. Gruccio, also reserved decision on wheth er women seeking elective abortions should be entitled to state Medicaid payments. Expansion Possible “This case may or may not be expanded to include other women and hospitals,” said Judge Gruccio, who is an act ing Superior Court Judge in Bridgeton. “That is a decision that the assignment judge for this area will have to make when he hears the case on July 6.” “My ruling deals only with the two women and the two hospitals, because the doctors for the two women determined that there would be an im mediate danger to their health, safety and welfare if the abor tions were not performed,” Judge Gruccio continued. “Presently, the hospitals only perform abortions when the life of the mother is endang ered,” he said. The suit was brought on behalf of the two women by the American Civil Liberties Union. Named in the suit were the Bridgeton Hospital Associa tion and Newcomb Hospital in Vineland. The two are the only hospitals in Cumberland County that provide obstetrical serv ices. In making his ruling, Judge Gruccio cited the recent United States Supreme Court decision that no state could prohibit an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. The judge also ruled that anyone at the two hospitals who objects to the abortions on moral or religious grounds would not have to assist in the procedures. The suit was brought in the names of Jane Doe, who is eight weeks pregnant, and Mary Roe, who is in her tenth week. The doctors for the two women are affiliated with the two hospitals. Newcomb Hospital is a 235 bed hospital with 29 maternity ward beds. Bridgeton has 128 beds, 15 of which are in the maternity ward. New Action Sought According to the A.C.L.U., the suit was brought to force the state to act on a new set of regulations concerning abor tions. “The state and most of the hospitals are still using an old set of regulations which were drafted before the recent Su preme Court decision,” said Stephen M. Nagler, the execu tive director of the state A.C.L.U. “We are trying to make the state act in compli ance with the high court's rul ing.” “The two hospitals are the only ones in the area that pro vide obstetrical services and they won't provide abortions on demand. Add to that the fact that the state won't pay Medi caid payments for elective abortions and you get a policy that discriminates against the poor,” Mr. Nagler continued. A spokesman for the state said that under present guide lines, the state is not allowed to pay claims for elective abor tions. The state, however, has not rejected any of the claims for the nontherapeutic abor tions, but are holding them until they get a ruling from the state Attorney General's of fice. The hearing on July 6 will be before Herbert Horn, the As signment Judge for Salem, Cumberland, Atlantic and Cape May Counties."
Four Nixon Justices Vote as Bloc on 70% of Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/28/archives/four-nixon-justices-vote-as-bloc-on-70-of-cases-3-liberals-vote.html,"WASHINGTON, June 27—in their first full term on the bench together, the four Supreme Court Justices appointed by President Nixon have formed a cohesive and effective power bloc that voted as a unit on 70 per cent of the cases that the Court heard and decided in the last nine months. In all but one of the 107 cases in which all the partici pating Nixon justices voted to gether, they formed the nucleus of a majority. The sole excep tion was an antitrust case in which two of them disqualified themselves and the two others dissented. Transforming this Republican bloc into a majority of the nine‐member Court must fre quently was Associate Justice Byron R. White, who joined the Nixon Justices on 101 of their 107 joint decisions, or 94 per cent. Mr. White was named to the Court by President Kennedy in 1962. The Nixon appointees are Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who took office in 1969, and Associate Justices Harry A. Blackmun (1970), Lewis F. Po well Jr. (1972) and William H. Rehnquist (1972). The fifth Republican on the Court, Associate Justice Potter Stewart, an appointee of Pres ident Eisenhower, voted with the Nixon Justices on 75 per cent of their decisions, or 21 times fewer than Justice White. The unity among the Pres ident's nominees to the Court was even more impressive on subjects in which they ap peared to have a special in terest. The four Justices voted as a bloc on 100 per cent of the obscenity cases, 86 per cent of the tax cases, 83 per cent of the business cases and 80 per cent of the decisions involving criminal law. Figures compiled by The New York Times for the Court's 1972‐73 term, which opened last October and closed on Monday, showed that the Justices heard and decided 153 cases, about the same number as in recent years. Although comparable sta tistics for past years were not available, the record for the term indicated an unusually divided bench. Only 26 per cent of the decisions were unanimous; on another 13 per cent, only one Justice dissented; in 12 of those 20 rulings that were 8 to 1, the dissenter was Associate Justice William O. Douglas. 3 Liberals Vote Together The closest division possible, 5 to 4, occurred on 20 per cent of the decisions, and 26 per cent were decided with 3 dis senting votes, so that the ma jority achieved only the min imum deciding vote or the minimum plus one in 46. per cent of the cases. During the term, the three Democratic liberals on the court—Mr. Douglas and As sociate Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Mar shall — voted together almost exactly as often as the four Nixon appointees‐109 times, or on 70 per cent, of the cases. The difference was, however, that one ‐third of the joint Douglas ‐Brennan ‐Marshall votes wound up on the minor ity side. The high degree of unanimity among the four Nixon Justices and the frequency with‐which they were joined by Justice White confirmed statistically what many observers had con cluded before: that the Presi dent enjoys a working majority on the Court on a broad range of issues. These issues did not include, however, legalized abortion, to which the President is strong ly opposed but which the Court supported, and public aid to parochial schools, which Mr. Nixon favors but which the Court all but ruled out on Mon day. The Nixon bloc displayed far less unanimity on some sub jects than others. The four Jus tices voted together only half the time or less on cases in volving discrimination based on race or sex, on labor disputes and on education cases, which included school desegregation. Justice Powell disqualified himself from voting on 10 of the 153 cases, twice as many as his nearest competitors, Jus tices Stewart and Brennan. Three of Mr. Powell's with drawals led to 4‐4 votes au tomatically affirming a lower court in decisions upholding strict air pollution standards, validating a Denver bank merg er and blocking adoption of a merged city‐suburban school in tegration plan for Richmond, Va. Chief Justice Burger and As sociate Justices Douglas and Rehnquiit did not disqualify themselves on any cases. Or dinarily a Justice drops out of a case when he holds stock in a company or industry involved or when he is related profes sionally, socially or by blood to any of the parties or law yers. In 81 of its 153 decisions the Court reversed a ruling by a lower court. Of these reject ed rulings, 65 came from Fed eral courts and 16 from state courts."
Nation's Energy Coordinator John Arthur Love,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/30/archives/nations-energy-coordinator-left-of-center-a-family-joke.html,"John Arthur Love was a little‐known Colorado Springs lawyer in 1962 when he first ran for Governor of Colorado. One of his opponents then pointed to a campaign poster with the word “LOVE” printed on it and said, “how you going to get them to vote against that?” Now he is well into his third term, and, if his tenure has not been particularly innovative, he has provided the people of Colorado with a comfortable, solid and quiet administration without a hint of scandal. Man in the News The 56‐year‐old Republican was appointed by President Nixon yesterday to direct a new energy office that will be responsible for setting energy policy on the Presidential level. The appointment seems appropriate for man who has governed a state rich in oil shale, which could become one of the main sources of energy in the future. Left of Center The new “Energy Czar” has gained the reputation for avoiding political controversy, although he is considered left of center in the Republican party and might be called a liberal had not that term become a dirty word in some Republican circles. One of his most controversial actions, came in April, 1967, when he signed into law the most permissive abortion law in the nation's history, bringing cries from the bill's opponents that the state would become an “abortion mill” for the rest of the country. In 1964, at the Republican National Convention in San Francisco, he established himself as a moderate when he seconded the nomination of Gov. William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania before howling crowd that wanted to hear nothine but ballads of the approaching glorification of Senator Barry Goldwater. In 1968 he gave another example of low‐keyed independence when he endorsed Governor Rockefeller of New York for the Presidential nomination when 15 of the 18‐member delegation pledged to Richard M. Nixon. “I feel it is the right thing to do,” Governor Love said. His wife, Ann, whom he married on Oct. 23, 1942, when he was graduated from Navy pilot training school in Corpus Christi, Tex., remembers that the 1964 San Francisco convention was the only time she had ever had to listen to a large crowd boo her husband. They had met in Colorado Springs, where they both grew up. Mr. Love was born Nov. 29, 1916, on a Gibson City, Ill., farm. The family, the Governor recalls, drove across the country from Illinois in a Hudson, and he said, “It was the damnedest car trip you ever heard of.” The engine block cracked before they left Iowa and the family had to camp in a schoolyard for five days ‘ Mr. Love was graduated from Cheyenne Mountain High School in Colorado Springs and then went to Denver University and its law school. A classmate recalled that “he was not moneyed, but he was smart; he earned his way through school by various reputable pursuits” and that “he was an exceptionally well‐dressed fellow on a remarkably small wardrobe.” He passed the Colorado bar examinations in September, 1941, and by December of that year had enlisted in the Navy. He flew an amphibian used in pilot rescue work in the South Pacific and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for pulling a downed pilot out of the lagoon of a Japaneseheld island. The plane was riddled with machine‐gun bullets and shrapnel holes. “Nothing much to it,” is the response Mrs. Love said Mr. Love gave to his commanding officer on returning to base with the rescued pilot. A Family Joke And this has become part of an involved family joke with the Loves, who have three children. “We tell him he just wasn't awake and really didn't know what he'd done,” Mrs. Love said. “I used to think he, was mad at me in the mornings, until doctor friends told me it has something to do with blood sugar.” The Governor, once into his day, enjoys skiing, fishing, hunting for pheasants, ducks and geese and playing golf, although he says, “I'm the worst golfer in Colorado.” During his years as Governor, concentrating on economic development of the state, local government reform and environmental problems, Mr. Love has been popular, but friends report that he has said for some time that he felt “stale” in the Governor's office. His new career in Washington, however, begins almost immediately."
ABORTIONS FOR 2 BLOCKED BY JUDGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/30/archives/abortions-for-2blocked-by-judge-courts-order-sanctioning-operations.html,"Demonstrations against abortion, including a prayer of thanksgiving, were held outside two South Jersey hospitals yesterday after an appeals judge stayed a lower court ruling allowing abortions for two women at the institutions. Meanwhile, lawyers for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sought as “quickly as legally possible” to have a three‐judge panel hear arguments on the stay, which was signed in Brielle at 8 P.M. Thursday. The stay came 12 hours before Dr. Edward Milner Jr. of Bridgeton was scheduled to perform an aboi Lion on one of the unidentified women. When informed of the stay by Robert A. Mathews, judge of the Appellate Division of state Superior Court, Dr. Milner said that he advised his patient, who is 10 weeks pregnant, not to enter Bridgeton Hospital, one of two facilities affected by the ruling. Stephen Nagler, executive director of the state rights union, said in an interview that it was “really crucial” that a decision be rendered by the appeals court as soon as possible. “We hope they can assemble by Monday or Tuesday.” Mr. Nagler said, referring to Dr. Milner's patient and another unidentified woman set to have an abortion performed by Dr. Calvin Hahn at Newcomb Hospital in Vineland. Uncertain on Date A clerk for the appeals court in Trenton said that he was unsure when the three‐judge panel would meet to consider the case. Acting on a rights union suit last Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Phillip A. Gruccio in Bridgeton ordered that the operations be allowed for the two Cumberland women, “Jane Doe” and “Mary Doe.” The hospitals are the only ones in the county offering obstetrical services. They have said they would only perform abortions if the life of the pregnant mother were threatened. Twenty‐five demonstrators who appeared outside Burlington Hospital yesterday had intended to hold a memorial service for unborn babies, but upon learning of the stay held a thanksgiving service instead. Fifty women appeared outside Newcomb Hospital and were told by a hospital administrator, James Pepper, that the board would abide by its decision not to perform abortions unless the woman's life were endangered. Judge Gruccio also ordered the hospitals to show cause at a hearing Friday why they should not be halted from refusing to perform abortions at the request of women within the first three months of pregnancy, a limit set in a ruling by the United States Supreme Court. The hearing is scheduled before Superior Court Assignment Judge Herbert S. Horn in Atlantic City. In the first New Jersey guidelines issued on abortion, the state Health Department said Thursday that only a qualified physician should perform the operations and only in a hospital or an approved “!abortion facility.”"
2 Groups to Challenge Hospitals That Resist Ruling on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/02/archives/2-groups-to-challenge-hospitals-that-resist-ruling-on-abortion.html,"Already begun in nine states, lawsuits to compel public hospitals to perform abortions, are being planned for the rest of the country. The prime movers of this national campaign are the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws. At a news conference here last week, the organizations announced that in addition to broadening geographically, the drive would turn attention to private hospitals that refused requests for abortions. The campaign grows out of the Supreme Court decision of last Jan. 22 that overruled all state laws prohibiting or restricting a woman's right to obtain an abortion during her first three months of pregnancy. Abortion proponents have already won battles in Massachusetts and New Jersey. New Jersey Superior Court Judge Philip A. Gruccio ordered last Wednesday two public hospitals in Cumberland County to perform elective abortions on two women. “Doctors for the two women determined,” Judge Gruccio noted, “that there would be an immediate danger to their health, safety and welfare the abortions were not performed.” Prior to this ruling, the two institutions — the Bridgeton Hospital in Bridgeton and the Newcomb Hospital in Vineland —had performed abortions only when a woman's life was threatened. Another hearing will be held in New Jersey on July 6 before Judge Herbert Horn to determine whether the new ruling should apply to women seeking abortions in all nonsectarian, nonprofit hospitals in the state. Meanwhile, Judge Cruccio reserved decision on whether women receiving elective abortions are entitled to state Medicaid payments. Earlier, A.C.L.U. lawyers Avon a victory in Massachusetts. On June 6, a Federal court directed the Hale Hospital in Haverhill to permit abortions on two women, one of whom is a Roman Catholic. The hospital's trustees had voted 6 to 1 to allow abortions, but their action was thwarted by the Haverhill City Council. Lawsuits in progress or in preparation in other states include the following: TEXAS—A Federal Court suit has been filed in Beaumont against the Orange County Memorial Hospital, the only public hospital there, by a physician who had been performing abortions until the hospital recently banned them. And in Dallas, A.C.L.U. attorneys are preparing a similar action against Parkland Hospital. MINNESOTA—A class action by a number of doctors and women has been filed in Federal Court against the municipal hospital in Virginia, the only public hospital in the area. The plaintiffs include a non‐Catholic teacher at a Catholic school who lost her job because of her role in the action. MISSOURI—The St. Louis city attorney, a Roman Catholic, has threatened to arrest any doctor performing an abortion. The mayor, also a Catholic, has threatened to cut off funds from public hospitals where abortions are done. At both city hospitals, the medical staffs have expressed strong support of women's right to abortions, and by‐laws of the hospitals are being revised to reflect this. Lawsuits are being prepared for filing in Federal Court this week if the mayor maintains his position. FLORIDA—A suit is in preparation against the public hos‐ pital in Fort Myers. OHIO—Federal Court suits are in preparation against three public and two private hospitals in Dayton. WISCONSIN—With no public hospital in Green Bay, and the nearest public hospital miles away, Dr. Herbert Sandmire has brought suit against the Bellin Hospital, a Methodist institution, to allow him to perform abortions there. Dr. Sandmire won his case in Federal District Court, but the decision was reversed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. An appeal to the Supreme Court is under consideration. INDIANA — Supplemental pleadings are being filed in the case in which Indiana's old abortion law was struck down last March. These pleadings attack the new law's restrictions on public hospital abortions."
Supreme Court Divided But Still Unpredictable,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/03/archives/supreme-court-divided-but-still-unpredictable-supreme-court-is.html,"WASHINGTON, July 2—The Supreme Court's record for the term that closed last week reflected a bench divided ideologically and politically and moving over‐all toward a more conservative posture but with its members still unpredictably independent on some major social issues. Landmark decisions of the 1972‐73 term ranged from legalization of all but end‐of‐term abortions, shocking to many conservatives, to the imposition of tighter controls and local standards on obscenity, prompting a comparable protest from liberal critics. Such widely varying reactions by the Justices mirrored the fact that they range from Justice William 0. Douglas on the left, who dissented on nearly half the decisions, to Justice William H. Rehnquist on the right, a new acerbic voice for the “strict construction” views of President Nixon. On two major subjects, the Court displayed some consistency over the last nine months, upholding protection of the environment in a number of key cases and reshaping the criminal law bit by bit to strengthen the hand of law enforcement at the expense of the rights of the accused. The Court's shifting majorities ranged over the field of education, denying public assistance to parochial schools, upholding better school systems for richer communities and showing preliminary tendencies to be strict against remaining segregation in the North but more lenient in the South. In the first full term during which four Nixon appointees were on the bench, they formed one of three recognizable units on the Court, with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and his colleagues, Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Mr. Rehnquist voting together on 70 per cent of the cases heard and decided during the term, virtually always in the majority. Justice Douglas and two other liberal Democrats, William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, also voted together 70 per cent of the time, but, unlike the Nixon Justices, they were often dissenters rather than lawmakers. The “swing” justices were Byron R. White, a Democrat originally sponsored by President Kennedy, who joined the four Nixon men 94 per cent of the time that they voted together, and Potter Stewart, a Republican picked by President Eisenhower, whose comparable cooperation with the Burger bloc was 74 per cent. Justice Douglas cast the most dissenting votes by a wide margin, in 70 of the 153 cases. His fellow Democrats, Justices Brennan and Marshall, were his nearest rivals, with 49 and 46 dissenting votes respectively. The most frequent participants in the majority decisions were Justices Powell and Blackmun, who only dissented 11 times each. The most contentious Republicans were Justice Stewart with 34 votes against the majority and Justice Rehnquist with 33. The Chief Justice and Mr. White each dissented 19 times. Following is a summary of the Court's major rulings during the 1972‐73 term that closed on Monday: Abortion Striking down anti‐abortion laws in 46 states, the Court ruled, 7 to 2, that a woman may have her pregnancy medically terminated without any restriction during the first 13 weeks and under minimal state, health regulation for the next 16 weeks. Only during the final 10 weeks when the fetus is judged to be capable of surviving if born, may state laws prohibit abortion altogether. The majority rejected the theory that the fetus becomes a “person” upon conception and thereafter enjoys a “right to life” that is paramount to all other social concerns except the health of the mother. Rather, the Justices emphasized that a pregnant woman enjoys a constitutional right of privacy that extends to terminating the pregnancy. Despite President Nixon's public endorsement of strict anti‐abortion laws, expressed during his 1972 re‐election campaign, three of the four Nixon appointees on the bench voted in the majority. Dissenting were Justices Rehnquist and White. Obscenity With Chief Justice Burger writing for a 5‐to‐4 majority, the Court rewrote the Federal definition of obscenity to cover any ‘ works “which appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portrays sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, scientific value.” or The majority specifically rejected a 1966 ruling that a book, play or motion picture could not be judged obscene if it had some “redeeming social value.” Juries applying new state laws based on the Burger definition were instructed to base their decision of what is “prurient” or “patently offensive” on the local community viewpoint, rather than any theoretical national standard, a move that is likely to promote widely differing decisions in different parts of the country. Justice White joined the four Nixon appointees to constitute the majority. Dissenting with the three other Democrats was Justice Stewart. Education By a 6 to 3 vote, the Court invalidated a group of New York and Pennsylvania laws that were designed to provide direct or indirect financial assistance to hard‐pressed private and parochial schools, notably those of the Roman Catholic church. The majority said the laws clearly violated the constitutional barrier between church and state. Dissenting were Chief Justice Burger and Justices White and Rehnquist. Earlier in the term, the Court ruled that a system of school finance based in part on property taxes was not unconstitutional because it resulted in wealthier suburban communities providing a better education for their pupils than innercity districts could afford to. Had the 5‐to‐4 decision gone the other way, most states would have been forced to rewrite their education laws extensively and tax areas, with high property value more heavily to raise school standards elsewhere. Here the majority votes were cast by Republicans and the minority votes by Democrats. School Desegregation Without setting a precedent for future cases, the Court divided 4 to 4 over the issue of whether Richmond should be required to integrate its black city school system with two adjacent white suburban counties. The tie vote had the effect of affirming the lower court, which had thrown out the proposed metropolitan, merger. The Court will have a second opportunity to resolve that issue early in its next term when a similar desegregation plan centered on Detroit comes up for review. Then Justice Powell, who disqualified himself in the Richmond case as a former state and city school board member, will presumably cast the tie‐breaking vote. In their first look at school integration in a major Northern city, Denver, the Justices ruled 7 to 1 that a substantial pocket of segregation in a city district will make it unconstitutionally discriminatory, even though the racial pattern resulted from social and economic pressure rather than from the kind of segregation law formerly in effect in the South. With Justice Rehnquist dissenting, the Court sent the Denver case back for further lower court examination of the facts, but the tenor of the decision indicated that the Justices would be at least as strict in their attitude toward Northern city school systems now as they had been toward the South in the past. Environment In the field of water pollution, the Court upheld, 6 to 3, an 1899 Federal law that has formed the basis for a number of industrial prosecutions, and it voted unanimously in support of a tough Florida law aimed at coastal oil spills. By another 4‐to‐4 vote, the Justices affirmed a lower court decision that prohibited the states from allowing air quality to deteriorate from present levels anywhere, even if Federal standards might permit such deterioration. And in a case involving railroad freight rates for recyclable material, a 5‐to‐3 majority held that citizens concerned about the environment had legal standing to challenge an increase in such rates. Criminal Law The Court decided 36 criminal cases, all but seven of them by divided votes. Some evidence of the extent to which the rulings formed a pattern in favor of stricter law enforcement can be gained from the fact that almost two‐thirds, 23 of 36, sustained the position of the prosecution on the issue involved. Among the decisions were those holding that government attempts to lure a suspect into committing a crime may not give him a defense in court if he was “predisposed” toward such action, that incriminating fingernail scrapings may be taken from a suspect without a warrant and against his will, that it is permissible to search without a warrant a car abandoned by a drunken driver and that the government need not prove that the subject of a voluntary search conducted without a warrant knew he could refuse to allow it. Reapportionment In. February, the Court ruled, 5 to 3, that apportionment plans for state legislatures need notn follow the. “one‐man, onevote” rule as strictly as those for Congressional districts and approved a Virginia “plan that had a population discrepancy of 16.4 per cent between its largest and smallest House districts. Later the Justices reinstated legislative districting plans for Connecticut and Texas that had been struck down by intermediate Federal courts as allowing too much variation between districts. The Justices returned to the lower courts cases from Idaho, Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina for decisions based on its new, relaxed policy."

New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/04/archives/new-jersey-briefs-new-jersey-briefs-hospital-abortion-ruling.html,"A three‐judge panel of the Appellate Division Superior Court reversed yesterday a lower court decision ordering two Cumberland County hospitals to perform elective abortions on two women. The appeals court ruled that the two women would not suffer harm by being denied abortions because there were other hospitals in the area that performed abortions for convenience. The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit for the two women, said it would immediately appeal the decision to the State Supreme Court. State Plans Hunt to Kill Excess Deer The State Department of Environmental Protection has proposed a special five‐day hunt in the Great Swamp in Morris County to reduce deer over‐population. The department said the recommendation for “a controlled harvest of 250 deer” from the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge had been recommended by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It would take place Dec. 11 through Dec. 15. The state agency said that overpopulation was causing malnutrition among the deer and had forced them to forage on private property for food. The deer have damaged flowers, shrubs and trees in their search for food, the department said. A public hearing on the proposed hunt will be held Aug. 14. 2 Murderers to Be Paroled Wayne Godfrey, who was sentenced in 1959 to life in prison for the murder of a Camden toy store owner, will freed this month, the State Parole Board said. The board also said that it would parole Charles Trailor, who has been in prison since 1951 serving a life term for murder. However, Trailor will be turned over to authorities in Georgia, where he is wanted for, escaping from a chain gang. Trailor, 46 years old, was convicted of killing a man in New Jersey during a holdup in 1951. Godfrey, 42, was convicted with two others, Sylvester Johnson and Stanley Cassidy, in the 1958 murder of Edward J. Davis, 55‐year‐old toy store proprietor. Cassidy was paroled a year ago and Johnson was freed in May. Banks Accused of Discrimination Charges of illegal discrimination in credit and employment practices have been leveled against the state banking industry by the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit student organization affiliated with Ralph Nader. The findings, based on a five‐month survey of students at Rutgers and Douglass Colleges, alleged that women and racial minority groups were significantly underrepresented in managerial positions and had difficulty entering banking careers. The report recommended that banks be required to keep records of credit and employment requests, whether by phone or in person, and that reasons for rejection and noted; that the Department of Banking monitor records and investigate possible abuses; that banks assure that personnel and credit officers be made aware of laws protecting individual employment and economic rights, and that the Division on Civil Rights enforce existing regulations in these areas. Rent‐Security Measure Signed Governor Cahill signed legislation to insure that landlords deposit security payments from tenants in interestbearing bank accounts. Attending the bill‐signing ceremony in Mr. Cahill's office was Mrs. Martin Aranow, wife of the founder of the New Jersey Tenants Association. Mr. Aranow died June 13 of cancer at the age of 37. Mr. Cahill told Mrs. Aranow that he and her husband once were antagonists, but had developed “mutual affection” stemming from Mr. Aranow's efforts in behalf of legislation broadening the rights of tenants. The measure requires a landlord to notify the tenant of the bank in which his security is deposited within 30 days after receiving the security payment. If this is not done the tenant is permitted to use the money towards his rent. Death of Widow, 80, Ruled Murder The Cumberland County Medical Examiner said that an 80‐year‐old widow found dead in her small bungalow in Maurice River Township apparently had been slain with both a hammer and a hatchet and that her married son, whose body was found next to hers, had died of heart failure. The state police have ruled out robbery as a motive and said there had been no forced entry to the bungalow. The dead are Mrs. Mamie Chapman and George Chapman, 50, a hospital chemist. They lived in separate homes on the same one‐acre property."
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/07/archives/new-jersey-briefs-court-refuses-abortion-order-cahill-to-appeal.html,"The New Jersey Supreme Court yesterday refused to order two Cumberland County hospitals to provide abortions for two women who said they would have to outside the county if the hospitals refused to help them. The Supreme Court issued a one‐sentence opinion that upheld a ruling Tuesday by the Appellate Division of Superior Court, the state's second highest court. In a separate and sharply divided opinion, the Supreme Court upheld its own controversial rule that grants victims of negligence the right to collect 6 per cent interest on their claims before they are settled in court. In a 5‐to‐2 decision, the dissenting judges attacked the majority for infringing on the responsibilities of the State Legislature. The Cahill administration announced it would appeal to the United States Supreme Court next week to reinstate New Jersey's $19.5‐million program of state aid to private and parochial schools. Meanwhile, the State Department of Education notified all school boards that the state was forbidden to distribute any further aid under the program. With the playing of “Nearer My God to Thee,” the controversial radio station of the Rev. Carl McIntire, the fundamentalist minister, fell silent at midnight. The station, WXUR, was under a Federal Communications Commission order to cease broadcasting at midnight Thursday for misrepresentation. Mr. McIntire has vowed that if WXUR went off the air, he would begin broadcasting from pirate radio ship three miles off Cape May. More than 200 firemen battled for four hours to control a fire in a Paterson chemical plant that set off explosions and unleashed chlorine and ammonia fumes. The assistant Paterson fire chief, Wilbert Mariani, said that least seven firemen were taken to hospitals for examination after having inhaled fumes, but that all were released after treatment. He said the general‐alarm fire destroyed the manufacturing section of the Wollen Chemical and Supply Company in the Bunker Hill industrial park, but was stopped before it completely wrecked a storage section. Some 250 Port Authority policemen voted unanimously to delay a threatened job action at the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels after their leaders worked out an agreement with Authority officials to discuss withdrawing civilians who had been placed in police posts. The ranking and‐file members of the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association had demanded that their leaders set a deadline of July 18 for an agreement to be worked out on the civilian issue or they would take job action."
"Presbyterians Schism, But No Bitterness",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/08/archives/schism-but-no-bitterness-presbyterians.html,"The big American Protestant churches are like the major political parties: They are loose confederations in which internal divisions between liberals and conservatives often tend to be more severe than differences between competing groups as a whole. Religion Churchmen have frequently dreamed of having denominations that were ideologically coherent. In one major church, the 950,000‐member Presbyterian Church in the United States (Southern), an effort to produce such a situation has now taken the form of schism. In mid‐May, delegates from 255 Presbyterian churches, out of the denomination's 4,200 local congregations, met in Atlanta and announced plans for a break‐away Continuing Presbyterian Church that would be conservative in its theology and social attitudes, The move was a striking one, since the general trend in churches in recent years has been to heal old divisions through mergers rather than to create new schisms. Already, 86 churches have pulled out of the denomination with plans to join the Continuing Church. Leaders of the schism have scheduled a founding assembly for December and hope to line up as many as 300 or 400 local congregations. They hope that these bodies will then become the nucleus for a more comprehensive conservative church that would draw individual congregations out of the Northern Presbyterian and other Calvinist denominations. “If we become just another splinter group with a Southern orientation I will be sorely disappointed,” says the Rev. G. Aiken Taylor, editor of the weekly Presbyterian Journal and a leader of the schismatic movement. Last month, however, as the denomination held its 113th General Assembly, It was doubtful whether they could become much more than splinter group. In religion as well as in politics, it seems that Americans are suspicious of the promise of ideological purity. The dissidents have been more or less successful in one important area: retention of church property. The General Assembly, clearly in a mood to avoid as much bitterness as possible, in effect affirmed a policy of allowing congregations to leave with their buildings when the decision to, join the schism is unanimous. It added, however, that the resources of the denomination would be used to aid loyalist minorities who wish to keep a church affiliated with the denomination, and several court tests are already under way. On the other hand, It was evident that the dissidents have failed to win the backing of the church's most influential conservatives, men who by and large share their opposition to recent liberal trends in the church. The Rev. Robert Strong, a Montgomery, Ala., pastor whose congregation, the biggest Presbyterian one in Alabama, is badly, divided over the issue, spoke for many when he declared that he could not in conscience leave until the denomination became “so degenerated as to become apparently no church of Christ.” The Rev. L. Nelson Bell, the outgoing moderator and father‐in‐law of evangelist Billy Graham, said: “I see my obligation as one of staying within the organization and bearing witness to what I believe about the gospel. You don't have to win your ecclesiastical battles to be influential. You bear your witness and let the Lord take care of the rest.” The Presbyterian Church in the United States came into being in 1861 when the Civil War forced Presbyterians into two separate churches. It is now the only large American denomination that remains an essentially regional church. Membership almost entirely in 15 Southern states. The deep theological conservatism of the Bible Belt, including belief in the inerrancy of the Scriptures, is strong force in the church. Southern Presbyterians share the suspicion of centralized authority that marks the region's states' rights politics, and many members resent any effort to involve the church in social issued. At the same time, Southern Presbyterians have also had one foot solidly in the mainstream of Protestant liberalism. Like their Northern counterparts, the United Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A., they have insisted on a well‐educated clergy and thus have been affected by the social gospel, Biblical criticism and other modern intellectural trends. Unlike Southern Baptists, most of their churches are in urban areas; and since the basic governing unit is the Presbytery (diocese) rather than the individual congregation, there has been a check on isolationist tendencies. The denomination is a member of both the National and the World Councils of Churches. For several decades the conflict between these two elements — the provincial and the national — has been building. Separatist leaders day that the basic issue for the schism is theological: that the church has strayed from its pure Calvinist heritage and undermined the authority of the Bible by tolerating such teachings as evolution and the possibility of salvation for non‐Christians. They also criticize nontraditional stances on divorce, abortion, ecumenism and the ordination of women. In one sense, the schism is simply an extreme example of the conservative‐liberal divisions that beset all large churches, usually over social issues. In another, it is simply a delayed case of a scenario that has already been played out in other churches. The Northern Presbyterians, for instance, went through a small schism over virtually identical issues in the 1930's. To some, however, the eXplanation lies in the regional roots of the church and a grasping for security in at least one area of life in the face of the industrialization and social changes that have swept through the South in the last two decades. “The basic issues are psychological, not theological,” said the Rev .Ben Lacy Rose, a former church moderator. “Some people aren't prepared to move forward. They are desperately trying to cling to old forms and customs.”"
State Adopts Abortion Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/08/archives/state-adopts-abortion-rules-7page-rules-booklet.html,"TRENTON — The state's Health Department has adopted guidelines to regulate hygiene and safety in the performing of abortions. The rules, which cover the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, are not mandatory and they avoid the sensitive questions of Medicaid support for abortions and whether hospitals can be required to provide the service. But one of the major purposes of the voluntary guidelines is to help protect physicians and clinics against malpractice suits. “These regulations are just what we've been waiting for,” a spokesman for one hospital in the Trenton area said. “It will make it very difficult to refuse abortion requests.” “These guidelines provide that abortions be performed by qualified physicians operating, when necessary, in their private offices but preferably in licensed health‐care facilities, where aseptic procedures are provided,” the Health Department said in a statement. It also recommended that there be equipment and supplies on hand to handle such medical emergencies as shock, cardiac arrest and hemorrhaging. The United States Supreme Court ruled in January that an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy was a matter to be decided by the physician and patient. During the second 12‐week period, the Court gave the states the right to regulate abortion procedures to protect the public health. A number of hospitals throughout New Jersey have agreed to perform abortions during the initial 12 weeks of pregnancy. But the New Jersey Medical Society has been opposed to licensing clinics to perform the operations. Nevertheless, the society helped the Health Department draft its guidelines, which specify safeguards for the patient's well‐being. In its seven‐page guideline booklet, the Health De partment said that hospital personnel opposed to abortions for religious or other reasons should not be required to assist in such operations. In addition to recommending an adequate number of recovery beds for women, the guidelines proposed that patients having abortions, and released the same day, should be observed for at least three hours to insure there are no complications. If there are any signs of problems, the patient should be observed for at least six hours, the department said. Also, it proposed that abortion clinics or private physicians performing the operations be within 10 minutes of a hospital, in case emergency care is needed. And it recommended that patients be re‐examined within two to six weeks after the operation. The Health Department urged also that at least two days elapse between a physician's initial examination and the performance of the abortion. Finally, it called for counseling services."
"Sabotaging the G.O.P.'s Rivals: Story of a $100,000 Operation",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/09/archives/sabotaging-the-g-ops-rivals-story-of-a-100000-operation-scope-of.html,"The Republican party's effort to sabotage Democratic Presidential candidates in 1972 was a two‐pronged operation approved by some of President Nixon's most influential aides, directed in part by White House officials, and financed with more than $100,000 in unreported contributions to the Nixon campaign. That is the picture painted by informed sources in an extensive inquiry by. The New York Times seeking to pull together the elements of the sabotage program. The inquiry included a number of interviews with sources familiar with the program, public and private testimony by principals in the case, and information gathered by Government investigators. The sources said that one branch of the broad program of spying and sabotage—the one involving Donald H. Segretti, a lawyer—was conceived in early 1971 and approved in ad vance by H.R. Haldeman, then chief of the White House utaff. A separate sabotage campaign was managed by Jeb Stuart Magruder, deputy director of the Committee for the Re‐election of the President, and received some direction from Charles W. Colson, then special counsel to the President, the sources said. The secret operations at their height embraced a widely scattered and sometimes disorganized network of amateurs who engaged in political pranks as well as more serious, and even violent, activities. The extent to which the sabotage effort achieved its aim of demoralizing and weaken ing the President's Democratic opponents is not fully known, and may never be, although it will become the subject of the Senate's Watergate hearings later this year. However, sources said a number of the same individuals who allegedly planned or helped to cover up the Watergate bugging were, to varying degrees, associated with the sabotage operation, and more has recently been learned of the true scope of its activity and of the precise authority on which it was undertaken. Many who worked in the undercover campaign, which was characterized by such spy‐novel fillips as code names and secret mail drops, would not talk about their activities for fear of legal repercussions, and few of those who did speak would allow their names to be used. As a result, much of what took place remains unknown, and accounts of other events are necessarily one‐sided. But inquiry by The New York Times has provided an extraordinary account of an attempt by the political party in power to confuse and subvert its opposition through covert at tacks. Among the major points that have emerged from these sources are the following: ¶Mr. Haldeman, while chief of the White House staff, approved a plan for “covert activities and intelligence” conceived by two other Presidential aides, Dwight L. Chapin and Gordon C. Strachan, and headed by the young California lawyer, Mr. Segretti. ¶Mr. Chapin, who has recently been denying knowledge of Mr. Segretti's specific activities, in fact told the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year that he was aware that Mr. Segretti had published “false scheduling information” relating to the campaign of Senator Edmund S. Muskie, a possible violation of Federal law. ¶Mr. Colson allegedly provided some direction for the second sabotage effort, the one supervised by Mr. Magruder. This operation, on one occasion, hired a group of men, including two of the Watergate burglars, to conduct a demonstration against Dr. Daniel Ellsberg at an antiwar rally. At one point the men physically attacked Dr. Ellsberg. Mr. Colson emphatically denied that he had been involved in the incident. ¶Between June of 1971 and August of last year, when the re‐election committee's operation was abandoned as “too costly,” the two distinct but sometimes overlapping sabotage efforts employed more than score of operatives working jn at least seven major primary states: New Hampshire, Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois and California. ¶When Mr. Segretti's cover was blown by news reports of his activities last October, White House officials, fearing repercussions in the Presidential election less than a month away, began a cover‐up of the sabotage operation that, by the account of one participant, included possible perjury and obstruction of justice by high Nixon Administration officials. One key participant, who said that the planning of the sabotage effort dated from February of 1971, speculated that it was conceived by White House aides in response to the Republican party's discouraging performance in November, 1970, when, despite intensive campaigning by President Nixon, it lost 11 seats in the House of Representatives and failed to substantialy reduce the Democratic majority in the Senate. “I think they just decided, ‘Next time it's the President—and our jobs,'” the participant said. Such participants, others knowledgeable persons, documents and other sources of information provided the ac‐I counts of the various operations Vat follow. The first White House officials to broach the need for a Republican sabotage operation were Mr. Chapin, 32 years old, a former junior advertising executive who served until February as the President's appointments secretary, and Mr. Strachan, 29, a classmate of Mr. Chapin's at the University of Southern California and a former assistant to Mr. Haldeman. According to a memorandum written last fall by Richard A. Moore, a special counsel to President Nixon, the objective Mr. Chapin and Mr. Strachan had in mind was “to create such confusion among the primary candidates that it would be difficult for the Democratic party to come back together after the convention.” During the secret session of the Watergate grand jury on April 11, according to published’ excerpts of the testimony, both men took full responsibility for hiring Mr. Segretti, a mutual, ‘friend since college days, and, Mr. Chapin said that he himself had authorized Herbert W. Kalmbach, then the President's personal lawyer, to pay Segretti. Timing of Approval According lo the Strachan’ testimony, Mr. Halcleinan's up proyal of the Segretti operation was sought and obtained omy after lie and Mr. Chapin Lad already set it in motion. Both men also maintained that they had not given Mr. Segretti, who has been indicted for some of his activities, any specific instructions. “We wanted to set him up and get him started and not have to worry about him later,” Mr. Strachan testified, However, the White House memorandum, provided to the Watergate committee by the former Presidential counsel, John W. Dean 3d, asserts that an individual referred to as “W,” whom Senate sources have identified as Mr. Haldeman, gave both men permission in advance to “go ahead and implement” their proposal. Mr. Dean went further in his testimony before the commit. tee, saying that Mr. Haldeman, contrary to Mr. Chapin's assertion, had also approved the financing for the operation. Mr. Kalmbach has told the P.B.I. that he provided Mr. Segretti with $30,000 to $40,000 in funds collected from anony mous Republican campaign contributors. Besides being the earliest, the Segretti operation was the more ambitious, and at times the less professional, of the two sabotage efforts. Its origins can be traced to June of 1971, when Capt. D. H. Segretti, then an Army lawyer still two months from discharge and described by one friend as “enamored of power brokers, the wheels within wheels that turn events,” first asked ‘Mr. Strachan about the possibility of a job in the President's re‐election campaign. Both Mr. Strachan, then the 1Haldeman liaison to the reelection committee, and Mr. Chapin, who considered Mr. Segretti an “imaginative person” capable of dreaming up ideas of his own, thought him perfect to head the “black advance” program of spying and sabotage they had conceived. Mr. Chapin's association with Mr. Segretti already reached back more than 10 years to the early nineteen‐sixties, when he had headed an insurgent political group at the University of Southern California that had put Mr. Segretti forward as a candidate for the student senate. Mr. Chapin invited his old friend to a meeting in Washington with the two men later that June at which he was offered the job of spymaster. Two weeks later he accepted it, and set out almost immediately to recruit his group of amateur political saboteurs. Mr. Segretti turned first to other lawyers who had served with him in the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Vietnam, and at Fort Ord, Calif., where he had earned the reputation of a mildly antiwar liberal, with a “Free Huey” poster on, his wall and peace symbols on his checks. ‘ He asked one friend, Capt. Thomas Wallace, a military ‘judge from Mississippi, if he was interested in “infiltrating” the campaign of Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama. He was ‘not, nor were any of the other half‐dozen lawyers Mr. Segretti approached, even though he assured them that the reason he preferred lawyers for such work was that he did not want to do anything illegal. It was through one of these contacts that members of Senator Muskie's campaign staff first learned of the Segretti operation—in the summer of 1971, more than a year before the details were made public. Alex B. Shipley, one of the Army lawyers Mr. Segretti approached, mentioned casually to a friend in Mr. Muskie's Senate office that one of his Army buddies appeared to be setting up some sort of undercover apparatus directed against the Democratic candidates. James Hall, the Muskie aide recalled asking Mr. Shipley to “lead Segretti on and find out what he was up to.” Mr. Shipley did this, Mr. Hall said, until) ‘taking a job as an assistant state attorney general in Tennessee after his discharge from the Army. But Mr. Hall said that, when things later began to go wrong during Mr. Muskie's campaign, “it just never occurred to us” that Mr. Segretti might be reIsponsible. The former law school classmates and other friends, including some old girl friends, whom Mr. Segretti asked to work in the sabotage operation also turned him down, It was not until, perhaps in desperation, he began to seek out young conservatives from local Republican groups around the country, explaining to them the “fun” that could be had in a “negative campaign,” that he finally began to weave together the threads that would form his network of agents. During the time he was criss‐crossing the country in search of spies, Mr. Segretti was also meeting with Mr. Chapin to discuss the strategy and tactics of his operation. One such meeting took place On Sept. 23 in Portland, Ore., where Mr. Chapin had accompsnied the President on the way to a meeting in Alaska with Emperor Hirohito of Japan. According to the White House summary prepared by Mr. Moore, hostile demonstrations against the President were espected during his stopover in Portland, and Mr. Chapin had invited his protégé, who obtained a room at the Benson Hotel where the Presidential party was quartered, to see first‐hand how logistical and crowd‐control problems were handled. I At other meetings in California and Washington, D.C., Mr. Chapin urged his friend to begin by studying the Democratic candidates through “legitimate” surveillance, and suggested to him examples of irassment that could be used against them. By November of 1971, when Mr. Segretti, his recruiting drive well under way, was traveling to New Hampshire in anticipation of the coming primary election there, a second sabotage operation was being fashioned at the Pennsylvania Avenue headquarters of the Committee for the Re‐election of the President. The second operation was under the authority of Mr. Magruder, the deputy director of the Nixon campaign, who has described it as an attempt to gather “as much information [as possible] through sources in the opposition's committee.” Mr. Magruder assigned to Herbert L. Porter, the Nixon campaign's scheduing director, who aiso knew Mr. Segretti at the university, the responsibility for recruiting intelligence operatives and for doling out cash for projects suggested from the White House across the street. The F.B.I. is investigating the possibility that either Mr. Magruder of Mr. Porter may have violated a Federal law prohibiting the distribution of unsigned or falsely attributed campaign literature in the course of their activities. The suggestions, according to one re‐election committee official, came mainly from Mr. Colson, and they annoyed Mr. Magruder, who preferred to concentrate on the intelligencegathering aspects of the operation, Mr. Magruder, the official recalled, “would always say, ‘That goddamn Colson, he just sits over there and dreams up this crap.’ “ The projects dreamed up by Mr. Colson, the official said, included having Mr. Porter pay $8,000 to Richard Howard, a to Richard Howard, a Colson aide, to buy 1,000 copies of “The News Twisters” a book endorsing the Administration's assertion of bias in television news reporting, in hopes of boosting it onto the best‐seller lists. Mr. Colson confirmed that he had authorized the purchase, but a spokesman for him said that it had been done “at Mr. Haldeman's insistence.” The same official alleged that ‘Mr. Magruder had told him that Mr. Colson also authorized the payment of. some $3,300 in reelection committee funds to G. Gordon Liddy, a convicted Watergate conspirator, that was used to hire a group of men in Miami in May, 1972, against Dr. Ellsberg. At one and fly them to Washington for a counter‐demonstration point the men physically attacked Dr. Ellsberg while he was addressing an antiwar rally on the Capitol steps. Dr. Ellsberg, who was then under indictment in connection with the release of the Pentagon papers, was not seriously hurt. The nine men were recruited and led by Bernard L. Barker and included Eugenio R. Martinez. Both pleaded guilty in the Watercase bugging case. Another member of the group later told friends in Miami that, although the men were arrested on the spot by Capitol police, they were freed moments later when the officers were given a signal by a mysterious have been unable to find any stranger in a trench coat standing nearby. The Capitol police record of the arrests. Mr. Colson categorically denied that he had been involved in the incident in any way, and added that he was “sick and ‘tired of smear reports from unidentified sources.” “The source of the report and The New York Times had better be prepared to match up the allegations against the sworn affidavit denials that I intend to deliver to Mr. Cox [Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor] and to the Senate select committee,” he said. The re‐election committee official maintained, however, that “I know Colson inspired that [the Ellsberg] operation” and that Mr. Magruder had told him so. “Colson was a great one for counter‐demonstrations — you know, ‘have four million [people] somewhere in 30 minutes,” he said. “One of Colson's responsibilities [at the White ‘House] was that he was the dirty‐trick expert, the counterdemonstration guy.” The same man recalled another incident, this time directed at a Republican candidate, in which he said Mr. Colson and the Nixon campaign cornmittee had also been involved, but which Mr. Colson denies having played any part in. Shortly before the New Hampshire primary in March, 1972, this source said, he was told by Mr. Magruder that Mr. Colson wanted the re‐election committee to send someone to that state to contribute $200 to the campaign of Representative Paul N. McCloskey Jr., Republican of California, a liberal Nixon opponent. According to the official, the contribution was to be made in the name of the Gay Liberation Front, a militant homosexual organization, and a receipt for the money was to be forwarded to William Loeb, the publisher of the pro‐Nixon Manchester, N. H., UnionLeader. Mr. Porter dispatched Roger Stone, a young aide, to New Hampshire with the money, the official said, but when the McCloskey headquarters he balked at identifying himself young man walked into the as a homosexual, and said in stead that he was from the Young Socialist Alliance, a Marxist‐ organization. and obtained a receipt, which Stone made the contribution The official said that Mr. Mr. Colson reportedly had directed. But the Nixon campaign was forwarded to Mr. Loeb, as official said he could not recall whether Mr. Loeb had ever published an article about it. In all, Mr. Porter told the Senate Watergate committee he had disbursed nearly $70,000 in cash at Mr. Magruder's request, including an additional $31,000 to Liddy for unspecified “dirty tricks” and $4,400 for another Colson project—the purchase of a full‐page advertisement in The New York Times that purported to represent grassroots support for the mining of Haiphong Harbor. In fact, the advertisement, part of which Mr. Colson admits he wrote, was placed not by the individuals who signed it but by the November Group, the Nixon campaign's advertising agency. Mr. Porter Made other payments as well—$350 for the printing of an anti‐Muskie pamphlet that one Republican official said had been prepared Mr. by Colson's “shop.’ Mr. Colson denies any knowledge of it. Mr. Porter also paid $300 for pickets to harass Mr. Muskie at campaign stops (“strictly a media thing,” the source said) and “$50 or $60” for a small viewing machine. Mr. Porter said in his testimolly that the viewer had been used to display the 35‐millimeter slides that were regularly delivered to him by Kenneth Rietz, the Nixon campaign's youth director. They contained photographs of the Muskie campaign's internal correspondence, taken by a taxi driver employed as a courier between the candidate's Senate office and his campaign headquarters. The driver reportedly was paid with $3,000 that Mr. Porter gave to Mr. Rietz. On one occasion, Mr. Rietz delivered a copy of a memorandum by Anna Navarro, Mr. Muskie's polling expert, recommending that the Senator, as chairman of the Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee, hold property‐tax hearings in Los Angeles as a publicity device before officially declaring his candidacy. That way, the document suggested, Mr. Muskie could “take advantage of free TV time before it is too late.” Mr. Magruder quickly ordered the memorandum retyped and mailed off to Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, the syndicated columnists, who reprinted what one Muskie aide conceded was a “very damaging document.” At Mr. Magruder's urging, Mr. Porter also recruited undercover agents for the re‐election committee's operation, which was dubbed “Sedan Chair,” a name Mr. Porter remembered from a Marine Corps exercise in which he had once taken part. He found “Sedan Chair I,” a young man from Los Angeles named Roger Greaves, through a mutual friend on the Nixon campaign staff. Mr. Greaves worked first in California, where one of his responsibilities was to recruit hostile pickets to confront Democratic candidates at speeches and rallies, and he once arranged for a dozen or so to greet Senator Muskie at a November, 1971, speech at California's Whittier College. Unknown to Mr. Greaves, however, Mr. Segretti had chosen to attend the same rally, and he may have brushed by the “Sedan Chair” pickets as he passed through the crowd, handing out leaflets describing Mr. Muskie's position on aborLion, which he believed would he unpopular with the students there. In response to a question possibly provoked by the leaflet, Senator Muskie conceded to his young audience that day that he was “not for abortion as a birth‐control device.” After working for a short time in New Hampshire and Florida, Mr. Greaves decided that the work was “very boring and tedious,” and, after having earned some $3,800, he quit. “Sedan Chair” lapsed for few weeks until Mr. Magruder ordered it revived in March, 1972, and Mr. Stone was sent to find a new operative. Using the code name “Jason,” Mr. Stone found in Louisville, Ky., Michael McMinoway, who reportedly had cone similar work in the 1967 campaign of Kentucky Gov. Louis B. Nunn and was eager to use his skills in a Presidential campaign. As “Sedan Chair II,” Mr. McMinoway, whom Mr. Magruder has inaccurately described as a “disgruntled” Humphrey worker, infiltrated the campaign organizations of Senators Muskie and Hubert H. Humphrey during the Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and California primaries, and worked his way into a security job at the Miami Beach headquarters of Senator George McGovern during the Democratic National Convention. According to both Mr. Porter and John D. Ehrlichman, until recently Mr. Nixon's top domestic affairs adviser, the reports Mr. McMinoway filed found their way to Mr. Strachan in his role as a White House liaison with the campaign committee. Mr. Porter said in testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee that he had paid Mr. McMinoway $6,000 for three months’ work. In retrospect, one bizarre as pect of the Republican sabotage campaign was that officials at the re‐election committee were unaware until February of 1972, that there existed a second sabotage effort aimed at achieving’ essentially the same results. A few weeks earlier Mr. Se gretti, using the name “Don Simmons,” walked into the of Tice of Allan Walker, a Nixon campaign, official in New Hampshire, and offered his help in running a “negative campaign.”’ Upon checking with the reelection committee in Washington, Mr. Walker was told that no one there had ever heard of Don Simmons. Nothing happened for another month, when Mr. Magruder received a second ;call, this time from a Nixon worker in Wisconsin who had been approached by Mr. Simmons with the Same offer. Disturbed, Mr. Magruder called Liddy, at that time counsel to the Nixon finance committee, and asked who Don Simmons was. Liddy, who had never heard of him either, called Mr. Strachan at the White House, and was promptly provided with Mr. Segretti's name and telephone number. Mr. Strachan then telephoned his friend and, according to his grand jury testimony, “told him to expect a call from Gordon Liddy” and to “answer his questions.” Mr. Segretti did receive a call, not from Liddy but from a stranger who gave his name as Ed Warren, and who said he was aware of the young man's interest in politics. The two men met or talked, by telephone several times during the next five months, with Mr. Warren sometimes providing suggestions for political activities he might undertake, or discussing the arrangement of pro‐Nixon demonstrations at. the Republican National Convention. When Mr. Segretti inquired of the pipe‐smoking stranger. hom he was and for whom he worked, he was told not to asksuch questions. Mr. Warren, he later admitted, had “scared” him a bit. It was not until a week or so after the June 17 break‐in at the Watergate that Mr. Segretti, leafing, through a news magazine, was stopped short by a picture of “Ed Warren.” The caption identified the man as E. Howard Hunt Jr., the former White House consultant whose name had been found in an address book belonging to one of the men arrested inside the Democratic national headquarters. “If I'd known what was going on,” he later told a friend in a reference to Hunt's role in the Watergate bugging, “I wouldn't have touched that stuff with a 120‐foot pole.” But Watergate was nearly a year off when Mr. Segretti, armed with his instructions !from Mr. Chapin and Mr. Strachan to throw the Democratic !party into utter confusion, set off in September, 1971, to enlist soldiers in his campaign of black advance.” Tomorrow: a detailed look at how the Republican sabotage operation worked, and at the White House attempt to cover it up once it was discovered."

Knight, a former Air Force major, has told the Senate Armed Services Committee that in early 1970 he participated in widespread falsification of records to hide the factilthat United States B‐52's were bombing Cambodia, Senate sources said. The sources said that Mr. Knight, now a graduate student in Memphis, has been summoned to testify in an extraordinary public session of the committee tomorrow morning. [Page 1, Column 1.] Laos has essentially liquidated her share of the Indochina war, despite the absence of any formal settlement between the warring sides during the last five months of negotiations. “Laos has shown the way,” a Western diplomat said. “If only Cambodia and Vietnam would now copy the Laotian model, there would be peace,” he said. “All it takes is the will to stop killing.” [1:2‐3.] The most important Argentine labor leader pledged trade‐union support for the return to power of former President Juan D. Per6n. “We proclaim here and now and irrevocably the candidacy of Gen. Juan Domingo Per6n for the Presidency of Argentina,” the labor chief, Jose Rucci, said in national television broadcast. He is general secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, which controls most organized workers in the country. [1:4.] Saddam Hussein, the leading political figure of Iraq's left‐wing Government, said that the security of America's oil supplies from the Middle East would be better served by developing friendly relations with Arab producers than by arming Israel and Iran. In an interview with three Western correspondents, Mr. Hussein said Iraq would welcome moves by the United States and Britain that would lead to normalization of relations with Iraq, which has severed diplomatic relations with both countries. [1:2‐33] National President Nixon and Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. are planning to use each other's past statements as legal weapons at their forthcoming confrontation over the issue of the President's cooperation with the Watergate inquiry., Mr. Nixon has indicated to the Senator, an,acknowledged authority on constitutional law, that he plans to argue his case for the privilege of the President to remain silent by citing some Ervin pronouncements as precedent. [1:5‐7.] President Nixon was reported to have made a “very slight improvement” in his bout with viral pneumonia. Dr. Walter Tkach, the President's personal physician, said at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Md., that Mr. Nixon's temperature had fallen to 100 from 102 degrees, that he had slept for six‐and‐a‐half‐hours, as against four the night before, and that his chest pains were less severe. “But the President is still a sick man,” the doctor said. [1:73] Government investigators say that they are finding a pattern of high‐pressure solicitation for very large contributions to President Nixon's 1972 re‐election campaign among executives in the country's most powerful corporations. Following the footsteps of Maurice H. Stans and Herbert M. Kalmbach, Mr. Nixon's principal fund QUOTATION OF THE DAY: “I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that unless comprehensive action is taken at the forthcoming special session, it is difficult to see how a disastrous situation can be avoided in mass transportation throughout the state in the coming year.” —Governor Rockefeller.

Federal election law. [36:3‐5.] For th6 first time since Henry Ford began mass‐producing Model T's in 1908, the automobile‐based way of life is being directly challenged by official action. With the expressed aim of reducing air pollution, the Federal Government has proposed to restrict automobile traffic in some metropolitan areas across the country. Many Americans are viewing this prospect with, at the least, considerable skepticism, and at the most outright defiance. [1:6‐83] Metropolitan Governor Rockefeller said that there was a fast‐approaching “cash crisis” in the city's subways and growing transit deficits throughout the state, and that a combined transportation subsidy and bond plan should be taken up at the special session of the Legislature this month. The pressing tone of the Governor's statement indicated that the issue was all but set for the Albany session. 11:8.1 Urgent pleas of Mayor Lindsay and Governor Rockefeller have failed to persuade the Nixon Administration to provide Federal subsidies to alleviate the $300million subway deficit and the $46.5‐million deficit of the state's commuter railroads.

ABORTION CLINICS WIN LEGAL POINT,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/15/archives/abortion-clinics-win-legal-point-law-in-question-court-nullifies-a.html,"The state's highest court has found unconstitutional a provt sion of the Public Health Law that the state had used to close down a number of abortion clinics in the three years since abortion became legal here. In a 5‐to‐2 decision earlier. this month, the Court of Appeals affirmed an earlier decision of the Appellate Division that Section 2801 of the Public Health Law is “entirely too’ broad” and so vague as to be unconstitutional. The section prohibits any hospital in the state from operating without written approval from the Public Health Council. It defines “hospital” as “a facility or institution engaged principally in providing services by or under the supervision of a physician,” a definition that the court said could be taken to be “inclusive of many kinds of individual, partnership and group medical practice, which concededly are not subject to or intended to be subject to licensing.” Operating under this law, the State Attorney General's office had closed down several abortion clinics on the ground that they were actually unlicensed hospitals. Last year, the state attempted to apply the law to the Dobbs Ferry Medical Pavilion in Westchester County, where three doctors had been performing 1,000 abortions a month. The doctors fought the state through the courts, maintaining that they were simply engaged in the private practice of medicine and did not need a hospital license any more than did other doctors practicing in partnership. The doctors lost in State Supreme Court in White Plains. However, but they won last January in the Appellate Division for the Second Department, which found that “the word ‘clinic’ is unclear and often interchangeable with ‘group practice,’ and any purported distinction between the two is either blurred or even nonexistent.” Law in Question Outside the courts, the distinction has become the focus of a growing controversy within the medical profession as group medical practices have become increasingly elaborate and numerous. The State Court of Appeals’ decision striking down the law appears to have left the state, temporarily at least, without any statutory authority to license hospitals. Dr. Robert Whalen; deputy commissioner of the State Health Department, said last week that the department's lawyers were studying the decision to see how broad its implications really are and to recommend new legislation that would meet the court's requirement of specificity. The Public Health Council, the state body responsible for approving all medical facilities. will meet here on Friday to consider changing its rules to sharpen the definition of “hospital.” The state has not brought any action against abortion clinics for the last year. A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said that the United States Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion earlier this year had taken the profit out of abortion clinics, which catered largely to outof‐state women, and that further prosecutions would have been unlikely even without the court decision. The Dobbs Ferry doctors were represented by Ephraim S. London and Franklin Bonem of the firm of London, Buttenwieser and Chalif."

How George McGovern won and lost it,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/15/archives/right-from-the-start-how-george-mcgovern-won-and-lost-it.html,"Thinking about the McGovern Presidential campaign now is like standing in an amusement park room of funny mirrors. Events that seemed small then are now enlarged, sometimes grotesquely so; matters that seemed of major proportion then are now miniaturized. Aside from the attempts, to put it as politely as possible, to tinker with the Democratic party's nominating process and the election, by the Nixon White House, consider some of the other truisms of not long ago about the 1972 election: McGovern, unlike Nixon, did not appear competent, organized, in command of his staff, and this was un‐Presidential. McGovern, unlike it was never clear exactly who, “acted like a politician” when he dumped Eagleton. McGovern was inconsistent: he changed his mind Now a new set of truisms is beginning to sprou't: McGovern was not the rightful nominee of the Democratic party. His catastrophic loss of the election, it follows, lay not so much in himself as in the stars. Perhaps we did not have an election at all, but an elaborate illusion produced by the Administration, in which the Democrats were hapless bit players. Yet it is arguable that if no one in the White House had put hand to monkey wrench, the Presidential election of 1972 would not have been very different. It is possible to read both too little, and too much, into Presidential elections. The way in which we bestow the extraordinary powers of the Presidency is more of a crap game than we care to admit. But McGovern did win the nomination against some highly professional and well financed political opponents. He did lose the election by a rather substantial margin. It is worth putting Watergate aside to ponder how ‘that happened. Gary Hart's book “Right From the Start” provides a useful starting point. Hart, McGovern's campaign director from the beginning, has written an absorbing and informative book. Most of it consists of Hart's revealing account of the method by which McGovern secuted the nomination. He does not deal with the failure of the post‐nomination camand have Elizabeth Drew is a political writer and television commentator based in Washington. already learned elsewhere most of what he tells us about the Eagleton matter. He lets us know about internal squabbles among the staff, and settles some of his own scores. Hart raises one of the central questions about Presidential politics: What are the relationships between winning the party nomination, getting elected, and governing? As Hart describes it, McGovern's nomination was the result of “insurgency politics.” While not so “revolutionary” as Hart would have us think, it was a sophisticated, contemporary method of organization, carried out, like the Goldwater effort of 1964, by the most committed wing of the party. It is the true believers who are most likely to do the dreary work of canvassing and getting out the vote and packing the state conventions. They can skew the primaries in a direction that is not necessarily, as we have seen, the most representative of either their party or the nation. Conversely, it is also often true that the wider the base of a politician's support, the less is the intensity behind it. The centrist politician risks compromising his position Translated into governing, centrist politics can be a formula for paralysis, or doing inadequate things too late. But the committed, on the other hand, usually call for more change than the country can tolerate. The tension between the need for clarity, definition of where one stands, as opposed to the need for sufficient ambiguity to get elected, and hold the country together, presents one of the central dilemmas of American politics. Only few politicians are able to survive it. Edmund Muskie, the choice in 1972 of many established politicians and much of the press, lacked the believers. Muskie, one of his aides remarked after the primaries, had approached the contest as if he already were the President. He fuzzed the issu'es. He disdained the primary process. It can therefore be argued that Muskie would not have been nominated even if he had not shed a tear in New Hampshire. (Which is more worrisome: a man who blows up on occasion, or one whose political autobiography consists of stories of his struggles for self control?) The primary victor nominated in the way McGovern was risks the fate that can befall “cause” politicians. They can become captive of their enthusiastic constituency. The more successful the politicians, the more their idealistic followers, accustomed perhaps to losing, question their orthodoxy. They must be mollified because they are needed for election work, and because their opposition can be devastating. But the candidate must also detach himself sufficiently to attract broader support. McGovern's fate was particularly severe because his candidacy coincided with the emergence of a new set of issues of values and life styles, and because his opponent in the final election was particularly adept at exploiting the tensions and divisions that those issues caused. Thus the Republican convention scheduled every sneeze, and the Democratic convention was a happening. Unmanaged meetings give the advantage to those with the greatest sense of theater. And television is there, enlarging the image. Which brings up the point raised by Hart that we still have not come to terms with the degree to which television has turned politics into show business. Nixon stayed virtually hidden from sight, appearing on television when he chose, as “The President.” McGovern and Shriver rushed from media event to media event, into supermarkets and down mine shafts, milking cows and speaking before crowds manufactured by desperate advance men—what do you do the sixth time the candidate comes to Pittsburgh? — pit in pursuit of and demeans the candidate, turning a man who might govern us into a robot gone amok. The mutual utilization of candidates and media is one of the more fascinating of modern developments. Hart has a nice vignette about the “charade” of interviews given to television floor reporters at conventions. There is also the business of creating impressions: of “winning” a primary one has lost, as McGovern did in New Hampshire, of a “surge” or “momentum” or what ‐ have ‐ you behind one's candidacy. One former campaign worker once told me that the most important thing to do in a primary campaign is to convice the press that the effort is well run. And there is the closely related question of how we can find out more about what a potential President would do with power if he got it. McGovern had trouble explaining his program, but at least he tried. And of the Vice Presidency: Will the man second in line for the Presidency continue to be chosen by an exhausted nominee on the basis of the perceived electoral vote exigencies of the moment? Why shouldn't Presidential candi dates be required to tell us in advance their possible choices? Hart maintains that Senator Thomas Eagleton's history of mental illness, covered up in Missouri for 12 years would not have been discovered by the McGovern staff even with a little more time. This is not reassuring. It is becoming fashionable to dismiss the McGovern candidacy as an aberration, with or without Watergate, to assert that the Democratic party has taken self‐corrective measures, that the left does not have a candidate now, that never again will the issues be acid and abortion and quotas and gays. I think that is missing the point of 1972. McGovern's nomination was, as are most candidates', partially the product of other politicians’ failures, and the ineffectiveness of his Presidential campaign to a great degree a product of his own. His nomination was nonetheless a remarkable precedent. His candidacy was also the vehicle of reforming forces in American politics that I believe Hart is correct in saying are not going to disappear. Nor are the questions of life styles and values. Nor are some of the more worrisome questions, dramatized in 1972, about how we pick our Presidents."
CRIME CODE BILL STUMPS CONGRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/16/archives/crime-code-bill-stumps-congress-long-complicated-revision-may-never.html,"WASHINGTON, July 15—Congress, caught between multiplying problems and declining efficiency, may have reached a legislative absolute the unpassable bill. Attempting to rewrite the entire Federal criminal code in one package, the lawmakers now face the possibility that a bill can be so long, so complex and so controversial that it cannot be processed with the two‐year life span to which 2ach Congress is limited. All legislation that has not been passed by both houses in identical form and sent to the President for signature dies automatically when a Congress adjourns at the end of its second year. Then a new set of Representatives, elected the previous November, and a Senate with a third of its members newly elected can, if they wish, resurrect such bills and begin processing them all over again. Outlook Called Dim Sponsors of the criminal code bill have privately conceded that there is no prospect of completing Congressional action on the project before the end of 1974 and that there is considerable doubt that any succeeding two‐year period will be long enough for the job. Among the problems that have brought action on a revised code to a virtual standstill are the following: ¶Size. The version drafted by the Senate Criminal Law Subcommittee is 538 pages long; the Nixon Administration's alternative runs 336 pages. The line‐by‐line examination and amendment of a bill that is standard Congressional procedure would take the most industrious committee many months. ¶Controversy. Issues directly Involved in rewriting and harmonizing the various elements of the code range from establishing new penalties for disclosing “national defense information” to abolishing insanity as a defense in criminal cases. Other provisions deal with such socially sensitive matters as capital punishment, abortion, obscenity and gun control. ¶Professional interest. Lawyers make up to 54 per cent of the current Congress and 100 per cent of the two Judiciary Committees that have jurisdiction over the criminal code, and they take particular interest in carefully scrutinizing changes in the rules of their profession. ¶Politics. A Democratic Congress would not appear eager to present the kind of tough, law‐and‐order crime bill currently under discussion to President Nixon at any point in his second term, particularly with the White House currently on the defensive on the Watergate issue. Tax Bills a Problem And Mr. Nixon's successor after 1976, whether he is a Democrat or a Republican, will almost certainly want his Attorney General to take a long look at a significant project like criminal code revisions, making it unlikely that Congress could then complete action before 1980. Generally, tax bills are the longest and most complicated measures with which Congress deals, but the lawmakers have always managed to push them through adjournment, completing action in less than two years. Senator John L. McClellan, chairman of the Criminal Laws Subcommittee, began the code revision project just after the 93d Congress opened in January, but hearings on the nomination of L. Patrick Gray 3d as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Elliot L. Richardson as Attorney General delayed subcommittee action. The McClellan bill is a considerably toughened version of recommendations made two years earlier by the National Commission of Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, headed by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California, after a five‐year study. About three months after the bill was introduced, the Justice Department offered its own revised code, prepared at the President's request. The Administration measure touched off a barrage of protest over its provisions limiting access to both classified and unclassified Government records. One provision would have barred a person accused of making public a classified document from defending himself with the argument that the document was improperly classified in the first place. Hearing to Be Held Under the present schedule, the McClellan subcommittee will continue holding hearings on the code through the summer and fall and will try to complete a final draft for full committee and Senate floor action in early 1974. But no one now expects that the House can complete the same process in the remaining nine or 10 months of the year. A bill that dies at the end of one Congress can be revived in the next with fewer time‐consuming preliminaries as long as the leadership and members of the committees involved and the political situation have not matcriallt,t changed."
Health Agency Report Proposes Limits on Fetal Experiments,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/16/archives/health-agency-report-proposes-limits-on-fetal-experiments-rights.html,"WASHINGTON, July 15 A recently completed report by staff members of the National Institutes of Health recommends prohibit:n,g any experiments that would prolong the life of an aborted fetus once its ultimate survival was judged to be impossible. The same staff paper also advised prohibiting any experiments involving a woman who was about to have an abortion if these experiments might1 harm the fetus. It called for a ban on implanting in women human egg cells fertilized in the test tube. Both types of fetal research have been done abroad by teams that included American scientists. Attempts to implant fertilized eggs in woten have not yet been reported; but there have been numerous predictions that this might be tried soon. The proposed prohibitions would apply both here and abroad to any American scientists receiving funds from the N.I.H. Such policies would be strongly influential on all American medical research whether supported by Federal funds or not. Rights Paramount The unpublished staff report does not yet constitute government, or even the health agency, policy. It does Indicate the thinking of the staff scientists involved in proposing new ethical guidelines for researchc involving pregnant women, children and the humant fetus. The clear trend of thist thinking is to consider paramount the rights and needs of the individuals who are the: subjects of research. The aborted fetus is accorded human rights of its own whether the mother is concerned over its post‐abortion fate or not. The staff paper suggests that “protection” cornmittees be set up at research institutions to take the side of either child or fetus in determining whether or not a specific research study should be done. A similar added safeguard for the person subjected to a. medical experiment is called for In another staff paper concerning research involving prisoners. This draft report goes substantially beyond current requirements in protecting prisoners from coercion to take part in medical research and from participation in inherently dangerous studies. Both staff papers are part of a review, in progress since last November at the agency, of ethical guidlines for research involving humans. The review was called for by Dr. Robert Q. Marston, former director of the Institutes. The subject of the ethics of medical research has been much disputed in recent months. The N.I.H. review is intended to bring its policies up to date. The Review has been under the direction of Dr. Ronald W. Lamont‐Havers, an associate director of the Institute. Independent of Administration The preliminary staff paper on prisoners calls for establishing prison review committees to pass on the acceptability of research proposals involving the use of prisoners for any type of medical research. Each committee would represent the interests of the inmates at institutions where research was contemplated, but would be independent of the prison admin. istration and the medical group that wanted to do the study. The draft report leaves off the question of whether the’ committee membership would include one or more prisoners, or whether their representatives should be from the outside. The draft paper on research involving children and fetuses advised that no research be permissible without consent of, both of the parents and the child, if he were over the age of 7. The report suggested setting up an ethics committee at the agency to review all grant applications; and “protection committees” at all hospitals and other research institutions to safeguard the interests of the persons who were asked to become experimental subjects. The staff paper said that research to improve the survival rate for premature infants should be done. But it suggested such research on very early births should be done first on animals, ond only on humans when other possibilities had been exhausted. It suggested artificial life support techniques may be used to keep a fetus alive outside the womb, but not after the point at which the doctor in charge is convinced the fetus cannot survive. The staff paper said it would be improper to do any research on a fetus outside the womb that would hasten the death of that fetus even if doctors had de,.ermined that the fetus cOuld not survive. Staff papers have been written on many issues, but are unpublished pending approval by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the parent organization of the Institutes. When the individual reports are officially released, they will still not constitute Government policy. They are to serve as a basis for comment by interested groups and individuals. Only after the comments have been received and discussed will final policies be promulgated. Last week, Dr. Henry E. Simmons, deputy assistant secretary for health and scientific affairs in H.E.W. predicted that the final review would be completed by April."
Pilot Program Set In Sex Education At 15 High Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/19/archives/pilot-program-set-in-sex-education-at-15-high-schools.html,"A new after‐school family living and sex education pilot program, using students and parents as “peer group lead ers,” will begin this fall in 15 city high schools. The resolution was passed at the regular monthly meeting of the Board of Education at 110 Livingston Street, Brooklyn. The board also approved an expense budget for 1973‐74 of $2.27‐billion, an increase of $350‐million over the current fiscal year. The sex education pilot pro gram will include student “rap sessions,” under the supervision of teachers trained in the field, a parents workshop, and an in formation service using audio visual aids. The project will be directed by a coordinator who will be selected by a screening com mitee of representatives of the board, students and the Ford Foundation, which is providing $174,525 for the program. The criteria for selecting the 15 schools will be based on statistics for drop‐out rates due to problem pregnancies, report ed abortions, disruptions caused by heterosexual or homosexual problems, and other problems which cannot be dealt with in the classroom. The new expense budget in cludes anticipated expenditures of $254.8‐million for Federal and state reimbursement pro grams, and $2‐billion in city ?? levies and state aid funds for board of education managed programs."
CHASE IS LEAVING HEALTH SERVICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/28/archives/chase-is-leaving-health-services-says-he-will-quit-oct-1-and-start.html,"Gordon Chase, the first non physician to head the city's Health Services Administration, announced yesterday that he would resign Oct. 1 after nearly four years in the post.  Mr. Chase said he would spend the next year writing a book on urban health problems under a fellowship from the Edna McConnell Clark Founda tion. The grant reportedly ex ceeds his city salary of $43,255. Mayor Lindsay accepted the resignation “with special re gret” in a “Dear Gordon” letter praising Mr. Chase's “truly bril liant” achievements as chief of the health superagency. There was no formal an nouncement yesterday as to who would be named “care taker” administrator of agency for the remaining months of the Lindsay administration. It appeared likely, though, that this responsibility would be shared by Gerald Frug, the lawyer who serves as Mr. Chase's top deputy, and Dr. Joseph A. Cimino, commission er of the Health Department, one of the agencies under the H.S.A. umbrella. In addition to the Health De partment, that umbrella covers the Mental Health Department, the Addiction Services Agency, the Comprehensive Health Plan ning Agency, the prison health program and the Medical Exam iner's Office. Looking back on his turbulent term at a news conference yes terday, Mr. Chase said: “It's been agonizing, infuriat ing — and very, very exciting. I've loved every minute of it.” Mr. Chase had been embroiled in controversy from the moment his appointment was announced by Mayor Lindsay in November, 1969. Virtually the entire medical establishment was up in arms, insisting that the appointment should have gone to a physician, like Mr. Chase's two predeces sors. The New York Academy of Medicine declared Mr. Chase “professionally unqualified.” That opposition began to evaporate soon alter Mr. Chase took office in January, 1970, and it was not long before prominent figures in the field swung around to the Mayor's view that the job called for a man skilled in management rather than medicine. Reviewing the accomplish ments of his administration, Mr. Chase said yesterday that he was particularly proud of his progress in the war on drug additcion, of the way in which both the public and private medical sectors coped with the demand for abortions when they became legal here July 1, 1970, and of the improved standards of health care in city prisons. He also cited programs deal ing with alcoholism, lead poi soning, hypertension, venereal disease and a major strengthen ing and reorganization of the Health Department's restaurant inspection system. Mr. Chase, who is 40 years old, was named to the health post after serving a year as No. 2 man in another city super agency, the Human Resources Administration."
"Sterilization of Black Mother of 3 Stirs Aiken, S.C.",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/01/archives/sterilization-of-black-mother-of-3-stirs-aiken-sc-residents-angered.html,"AIKEN, S. C.,—Marietta Williams is 20 years old and sterile. She wasn't always sterile. Last month she gave birth to a baby boy—her third child—and the next day her Fallopian tubes were snipped and tied. The operation was performed by the one doctor in town who is willing to deliver babies for women such as Mrs. Williams who are on welfare. Dr. Clovis H. Pierce does so under one condition — that mothers of three children receiving Medicaid agree to be sterilized to receive his help. He is doing so, he has said, to help reduce the welfare rolls. Mrs. Williams said he threatened to take her to court if she did not sign the surgical consent form before delivery, so she did. Hers is not the only case in Aiken; it's not the only one in the South. In fact, it is the third situation to be disclosed in recent months in which involuntary sterilization was systematically performed on poor black women. The disclosures are causing widespread outrage and have prompted the filing of lawsuits and the issuance by Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, of new guidelines on involuntary sterilization. Baby Still Hospitalized MI of this will not help Mrs. Williams, however. Her new baby has been sick since birth and is still hospitalized, dehydrated with an intestinal disorder that keeps him from retaining any oral nourishment. She is wondering about his future and her own. “I wouldn't marry again. Who would want me, knowing I cannot have any children?” she said the other day, repeating a sentiment expressed over and over again in this part of the country, where a woman's greatest gift is still thought to be her fertility. Several weeks ago, Mrs. Carol Brown, a white welfare mother of four, publicly complained that Dr. Pierce had refused to deliver her fifth baby unless she agreed to be sterilized or pay a $100 down payment on his $250 fee. Her complaint brought to light a personally imposed policy that some Aiken officials think has been going on for two years. Mrs. Brown became a welfare recipient in February when her husband, Robert, began serving an 18‐month prison term for grand larceny. He should be paroled within a few weeks, Mrs. Brown said. And her baby will be delivered now by a doctor in Augusta, Ga., about 20 miles from Aiken. Defended Policy Immediately after the complaint was made public, Dr. Pierce defended his policy in the local press and said that he did require welfare mothers with three children to be sterilized to receive care. He said he was doing so because of the heavy tax burden welfare was causing. He said that Aiken's other, obstetricians supported the policy. Since then he has refused to make any public comment. Aiken County Hospital records show that 18 of 34 deliveries paid for by Medicaid last year included sterilization. Sixteen of the 18 involved black women. All were performed by Dr. Pierce, the records show. Medical payments to Dr. Pierce, according to the records, have totaled $60,000 in the last 18 months. The disclosure of the sterilize tions here, following that of the sterilization of two young black girls in Alabama earlier, has rocked Aiken, a quiet town best known as a genteel retreat for the rich to train and breed thoroughbred horses. Just after the Alabama case, which led to a lawsuit by the father of the girls, a less publicized suit was filed in North Carolina in behalf of Nial Ruth Cox, who was sterilized seven years ago. She said she was told it was a “temporary fiveyear operation” that would “wear off.” Residents Angered So that when the Aiken situation broke, television crews and reporters swarmed into town. This influx has angered residents, many of whom are supporting Dr. Pierce in letters to newspapers and to Mrs. Brown. “I didn't mean to drop bomb,” Mrs. Brown said with a chuckle in her living room in New Ellenton, ‘about 10 miles south of Aiken, “I just wanted to have my baby.” Five investigations are under way, including one by the Justice Department. Other investigations are being conducted by the State Attorney General, the State Department of Social Services, the South Carolina Medical Association and the South Carolina Council for Human Rights, a privately sponsored watchdog group. Dr. R. Archie Ellis, Commissioner of Social Services for South Carolina, said his investigation would include a review of all hysterectomies performed in Aiken Cqunty Hospital to determine if any were performed for nonmedical reasons, presumably as a means of sterilizing women. Specialists in medical ethics have expressed outrage over the increasing disclosures that sterilization is being imposed on poor Southern blacks for social rather than medical reasons. “We must face the fact there are many whites who, consciously or not, see birth control as a way to save the white race from being overwhelmed,” said Bruce Hilton, director of the National Center for Bioethics in Ridgefield, N.J. “Many laymen still hold the mistaken belief that it is America's minority groups that contribute most to this country's growing population — contrary to figures.” And many black Americans, who consider abortion and sterilization forms of black genocide, are nodding their heads knowingly. Last year, Dr. William A. Darity of the University of Massachusetts studied the opinions on birth control of 1,800 blacks, randomly selected by computer. More than 80 per cent of the men interviewed were against sterilization, 50 per cent believing the practice was a plot against blacks. Fears Reaction John Robbins, director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, on whose board Dr. Darity sits, said he was concerned by what these disclosures would do to the population control movement. “Whenever something good happens, we get positive vibes,” he said. “Whenever something bad happens, we get negative vibes. These stories are sending shudders through many programs.” Meanwhile, in Aiken, Dr. Pierce has remained silent. The 40‐year‐old former Army doctor arrived at his office one day recently in a small black and white car and sped around the building to the back. He rushed to the door, unlocked it and disappeared inside without answering any questions. In recent days, other principals had left town and were unavailable to clarify questions that have been raised. No Investigation One of them is Richard Poore, Aiken's director of social services. Three women said they had reported the doctor's ultimatum—to be sterilized or find another doctor—but that no investigation had been made. J. Sam Nesbit, the administrator of Aiken County Hospital, was not available to comment on his earlier statement that he saw nothing wrong with Dr. Pierce's practice. One person who is highly critical of Dr. Pierce's methods is Mrs. Margaret J. Weston, black registered nurse who is director of the local Planned Parenthood program. Her husband, a surgeon, serves as the program's medical director. “Forced sterilization? I don't believe in that—no, honey. I am personally enraged at what happened in Aiken. It's a disgrace and a shame,” she said. She said her clinic had served about 1,200 women, none of whom have been referred for sterilization. The vasectomy clinic for men has had about 15 customers for the $75 procedure, not one of whom was on welfare or was black. These figures would support the growing popularity of voluntary sterilization among the middle class, but not the poor. The answer to family planning is educating the public, Mrs. Weston said, not sterilizing. People really don't understand, she said, explaining her reluctance to encourage sterilization. “If a woman wants 10 children, it's her business,” she said. “But I know she will want to voluntarily limit the size of her family once she understands all the responsibilities involved in raising children and providing for them.” Then she told a story about a mother whose children were the third generation born out of wedlock. One nurse asked her why she didn't marry. “What difference does it make?” Mrs. Weston said the young woman, wanted to know. At that point the nurse explained how society feels about illegitimate children. “Oh,” the girl replied. When she came back to the center in three months, she was married, Mrs. Weston said.

PHYSICIAN SCORES STATE ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/02/archives/physician-scores-state-on-abortion-calls-delaying-of-approval-for.html,"New Jersey has decided to put off approval of any abortion clinics until the fall, and at least one physician awaiting permission to open a clinic maintains that the delay is unreasonable. Last week the State Health Council refused to issue certificates of need to any of the five groups that had applied for permission to establish abortion clinics. Instead, the council voted to delay further consideration of the requests until the end of September. A certificate of need is required in New Jersey before health facility can be opened to the public. Dr. Steven Jaffe, who along with his colleague, Dr. Robert Livingston, is seeking permission to open an abortion clinic in Englewood Cliffs, told The Associated press yesterday that the council's refusal to act meant that his abortion practice would remain confined to a general office. “At present, Dr. Livingston and I are offering women the usual variety of gynecological services, including abortion,” he said. “We perform about five to seven abortions per day.” If permission to open a clinic is granted, Dr. Jaffe said, a separate facility for abortion services would be constructed. This will make the service available to more women, the doctor said, although he declined to estimate the number of patients the proposed facility would handle. Dr. Jaffe charged that the council ignored the obvious demand for abortions in refusing to approve his request for a certificate of need. “Many women from the Bergen County area are still going to New York for abortions because the facilities here are inadequate,” he asserted. Joseph Kale, director of the State Comprehensive Health Planning Agency, which oversees the council, defended the two‐month delay on the ground that the applicant had failed to provides sufficient data on which the council could act. “We have asked the applicants to give us more information on the availability of backup services and the relationships the clinics would have with area hospitals,” Mr. Kale said. “Since the approval process is based on need, we have to first establish that there is need.” Mr. Kale said that each prospective clinic had to demonstrate that it had sufficient backup services to provide abortion patients with emergency treatments in the event of complications. It also must show that area hospitals did not have the facilities to handle the abortions. Mr. Kale dented that the delay was a result of a negative attitude toward abortion on the part of some of the 35 council members, the majority of whom are citizens whose livelihood is earned outside the medical field. He said that if any of the council members had strong opinions on abortion, “I would hope they would keep them to themselves.” Meanwhile, the acting State Health Commissioner, Dr. Watson E. Neiman, noted that most hospitals around the state were offering abortion services. “There are 98 hospitals in New Jersey that are open to the general public,” he said. “Of these, 81 offer gynecological services, and the vast majority of those are performing abortions.” Dr. Neiman said he had no idea how many abortions had been performed in New Jersey since Jan. 22, when the United States Supreme Court removed virtually all restrictions on abortions performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. He explained that the state did not require physicians to maintain or submit records on abortions. Dr. Neiman identified the five groups awaiting certificates of need for prospective abortion clinics as the Pilgrim Medical Group of Rahway, the Pilgrim Medical Group of Cedar Grove, the Planned Parenthood Center of Jersey City, the Englewood Medi‐Center and the Palisades Medical Group in Englewood Cliffs. Dr. Jaffe and Dm Livingston are affiliated with the Palisades group. Dr. Livingston attracted publicity last year when he announced that he was performing abortions at his Englewood Cliffs office and invited authorities to arrest him. He said he was challenging New Jersey's abortion law, which had been declared unconstitutional a short time earlier. Dr. Livingston ultimately was indicted for performing an abortion a 33‐year‐old welfare the charge was dropped following the Supreme Court ruling."
"Decision, Decision",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/06/archives/decision-decision.html,"It has been my trying lot of late to explain to well‐meaning liberal friends why a feminist finds much to applaud in the Burger Court's obscenity opinion, and why far from thinking it a regressive action, I find it wholly consistent with the landmark abortion decision and other rulings on women's rights. There is a dangerous assumption in the land that if one has chosen to speak frankly and not wear a bra one has pitched out an entire wardrobe of faintly out‐of‐style values — dignity, privacy and morality being chief among them. Now that women have begun to talk in plain language on subjects such as abortion, lesbianism, prostitution, masturbation and rape, we are presumed to be allies of the new pornographer as well. This fallacy assumes that pornography is first of all a valid extension of what is vaguely titled sexual liberation, and more to the point, that it contains a commonality of interest to male and female alike. Assuredly this is not the case. No single word in the Englisth language is obstene or prurient unto itself. The old, familiar Saxonisms are useful concepts all, but when they are strung together with hostile intent and “deliberately flung in our direction there is no mistaking that we are on the receiving end of a duly phrased obscenity that was meant to degrade and offend. This is the manifest purpose of hard‐core porn. If I may argue with Justice Burger's choice of words, the offense is not that the material is “sexually explicit,” for sexual explicitness is sorely needed in a culture in which misinformation abounds, but that pornography by its very intent seeks to degrade the female body and sexual role for an audience of men. Words and pictures to fantasize by will remain a baktion Of masculine preoccupation as long as the female has a price tag attached to her private parts. One has to be hopelessly masochistic or strongly male‐Identified to get an electric charge from hard‐core porn if one is a woman. Someone I know has been going around town trying to devise a pro‐female pornographic idiom by reducing the male to his sexual parts, and while I wish her well from a philosophic distance I believe her quest is wildly quixotic. Her drawings can be devilishly funny in the way that any switcheroo can cause our unexpected laughter, but when it, comes to prurience they woefully fail to do the job, and not because the sight of a naked man cannot be stimulating. Without the realistic possibility of a power trip by conquest or purchase there is simply no way, to generate a prurient jolt. To admit in this sophisticated city that one is deeply disturbed by commercial exploitation of one's sexual essence is to leave oneself open to an accusation of Victorian repression. To register immoderate glee when a smut mill is raided is to stand accused of a poor understanding of constitutional liberties and freedom of speech. “No one is being compelled to look or to listen,” Justice Douglas wrote in his minority dissent, But this of course is the heart of the problem. I do not mind what others see and hear as long as they do not infringe upon my own constitutional guarantees of privacy. The movie marquee and the corner newsstand offend my dignity afresh each day, and try as I might, I cannot inure myself to the gathering assault. In celebration of the new permissiveness (whose permissiveness—surely not mine?) a recent Newsweek cover photo took its cue from last year's Playboy; this month's Playboy steals a march on next week's Screw. The blue‐Jeaned editor of the radical press lovingly runs his beaver one column over from his furious tirade against “the system”; and the wouldbe auteur grinds out skin flicks to finance the feature film of his dreams, a tender story of a sensitive yourig man's search for the meaning of life. Creeping porn in the name of freedom, liberty and pursuit of the quick buck is symptomatic of disease within a body politic, that has yet to come to terms with women. In new respect for Mrs. Grundy I'm frankly overjoyed that the Court has chosen to give relief. What if the locale which chooses to ban “Deep Throat” decides to extend its protective vigilance to “Our Bodies, Ourselves” and other works of explicit sex and positive merit? I grant that this is a genuine concern. To avoid a tragic misuse of censorship it is imperative that “the average person applying contemporary community standards” to works in question must not be personified by or limited to the respectable businessman of local repute who has been the traditional guardian of public morals. For who else but he has fostered the hypocritical double standard that has led to our present state of confusion? Susan Brownmiller is a fellow of the Alicia Patterson Foundation."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/08/archives/tracing-theabortion-revolution-books-of-the-times-some-pressure.html,"There are many theories as to how social changes are wrought. Revolution, evolution, direct confrontation, passive resistance, civil disobedience—all have been tried at different times and with varying degrees of success. In an age when radical activism seems the most popular route to social reform, it is surprising to find that radicalism played such a minor part in the most successful social change in recent years—the abortion revolution. In his fascinating and well‐documented chronicle of the abortion movement, Lawrence Lader—reformer, historian and journalist of the participant‐observer school—relates how a series of forces, each representing a different approach to social change, acted together to take abortion out of the back alley and bring it into the mainstream of medicine. While the movement certainly had its radical activists—for one, William Baird, who from the late nineteen‐sixties on blatantly defied laws on birth control and abortion and challenged legal authorities to stop him (which they occasionally did by throwing him in jail)—most of its rams came from much more subtle pressures. Some Pressure From Legislators Some of the pressure came from legislators who, year after year, introduced liberalized abortion bills, often risking their political futures. Then there were court challenges resulting in the invalidation of abortion laws in some states. Another significant force was the rising tide of feminism, with its emphasis on woman's right to control her own body. A major source of the pressure was the organization developed by the Rev. Howard Moody, pastor of Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village and, as Mr. Lader describes him, “a hefty, 6‐foot‐tall, 46‐year‐old, Baptist minister with crew‐cut hair, known for having tackled such inflammatory problems as the Tammany Hall boss system.” On May 27, 1967, at a time when abortion was generally considered an illegal and immoral act, Mr. Moody announced in a story that appeared on the front page of The New York Times, that he and 21 ministers and rabbis had opened the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion to help women with “problem pregnancies.” In more than 90 per cent of cases, this help meant referring the women to abortionists here and abroad who the service felt were medically competent and considerate of the women's feelings and pocketbooks. From this initial act of civil disobedience, Mr. Moody and Arlene Carmen, administrator of Judson Church, built a national network of clergy referral services that eventually extended to some 40 states and included 3,000 clergymen and women counselors, including a few Roman Catholic priests and one nun. These courageous clergymen (a few were brought up on charges and the others were at all times at risk of the same) probably did more than any group to make abortion —as a word and an act—acceptable, if not respectable. At the same time, they helped countless thousands of women escape from the dark and terrifying shadows of botched criminal abortions and gave them a friend in a time of desperate need. The story of the Clergy Service is well told by Miss Carmen and Mr. Moody in their paperback, “Abortion Counseling and Social Change,” which, in addition to history, provides a few lessons for social revolutionaries. One, learned by the clergy movement, was “not to clobber the opposition” (“many a reform fight and effort for social change has gone down the drain because it is more dramatic and exciting to fight in public real or mistaken enemies than it is to do drudge work as servants of a cause”). Another lesson was that theorizing and theologizing are not substitutes for “immersion and personal involvement in the issue.” The Difficult Struggle’ But the most telling lesson was that a change in the law (as finally happened in New York in 1970) does not guarantee a change in practice. As the authors note, no wars are won when laws are passed—“the difficult struggle is in changing minds and reshaping institutions to accommodate new possibilities.” There is a telling absence in Mr. Lader's book—the absence of mainstream American medicine, which failed to do anything to help change a practice that intimately affects the health and lives of millions of patients. Aside from a few courageous and defiant physicians who willingly put their careers on the line to challenge laws they considered outmoded and oppressive, most of medicine continued to pretend that abortion was not a medical issue (until, that is, all the work was done and they could then make a fortune doing legal abortions). Now that the Supreme Court has decreed that abortion in the early months of pregnancy is a matter not for the law but for the woman to decide, a vast educational job needs to be done. So many myths and half‐truths hang over from back‐alley abortion days that women need a lot of guidance in knowing when and how to seek an abortion and what to expect should they decide to get one. Toward this end, “Abortion: AA Woman's Guide,” is a straightforward, simple and sensitive handbook. In writing it for Planned Parenthood, Beth Richardson Gutcheon rightly focused on the emotional quandaries a woman contemplating an abortion is likely to face. She also explains clearly medical aspects of the procedures. The only regrettable aspect of this book is its price—$5.95 is too much to expect the women who most need such a book to be willing or able to spend. A $1 paperback would be much more appropriate."
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/09/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"A Federal Court of Appeals overturned a lower‐court order to stop the American bombing of Cambodia and cleared the way for the bombing to continue legally until Aug. 15, the cutoff date established by Congress. The appeals court, sitting in New York, voted 2 to 1 in overturning the order issued by Judge Orin G. Judd on July 25. That order had been stayed pending an appeal by the Government. [Page 1, Column 1.] Three veterans of the Vietnam war told the Senate Armed Services Committee that they participated either in the designation of Vietcong and North Vietnamese hospitals as bombing targets or in their destruction. One of the veterans said that hospitals sites were considered a third‐level priority for air strikes, ranking below the bombing of enemy fortifications and troop concentrations [1:2.] A tour of Neak Luong, the Cambodian town accidentally bombed by United States planes, revealed extensive destruction. Official American reports had said that damage was “minimal.” Big chunks in the center of town, including reinforced concrete buildings, were demolished and large clusters of huts were obliterated, leaving empty fields strewn with rubble. [1:3–4.] Zhores A. Medvedev, a well‐known Soviet geneticist and dissident writer, has been deprived of his citizenship and told not to return to his homeland when he completes a year of research in England. A Soviet spokesman in London said the action was taken against Mr. Medvedev because “his actions were incompatible with those of a Soviet citizen.” The spokesman did not explain what those actions were. [2:4–8.] National Vice President Agnew denounced reports he took kickbacks from government contractors in Maryland as “damned lies.” Mr. Agnew is under investigation on possible bribery, tax fraud, extortion and conspiracy charges, which he dismissed as “false, scurrilious and malicious.” The Vice President told a televised news conference that he had “no expectation of being indicted,” and that he had no intention of resigning. He said that whether or not he would cooperate with the Federal prosecutor would be up to his lawyers. 11:8; Text, Page 20.] Phase 1 of the Senate Watergate hearings is over and weary committee members have started for home. But staff investigators have work cut out for them during the month‐long recess. They will be pouring over the 7,573 pages of testimony looking for possible perjury violations that could eventually be prosecuted. [22:4.6.] The Watergate investigation has focused new interest on an old topic: Congressional drinking. Brought up at the hearings by John D. Ehrlichman, charges of Congressional drunkeness angered some Congressmen, embarrassed others and revived the question of Congressional drinking habits. The answer seems to be that most drink, some drink too much and a few not at all. [23:1–8.] Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson said that Justice Department employes would be required to report any conversation about department matters with outsiders—including members of Congress and other Government officials. Mr. Richardson told members of the American Bar Association that the system would “discourage approaches” by persons with improper motives. [1:6–7.] This week's increases in bread prices—the first since the price freeze ended last month —are apparently just the beginning. The new prices, from 1 to 4 cents higher for a loaf of bread, do not reflect the recent skyrocketing price of wheat, the basic ingredient of bread, since flour is generally bought 30 to 120 days in advance. Along with the prospect of still higher bread prices, consumers have another development to worry about: reports of shortages of some ingredients of the staple. [1:5.]. The Skylab 2 astronauts took pictures of part of the United States and South America, conducted medical tests and focused telescopic cameras on the sun as they spent the 12th day of their planned 59‐day mission in their space laboratory. 113:1–4.] Ittetropolitan A Brooklyn grand jury empaneled by the special state presecutor, Maurice H.

‘Maude’ Sponsorship Decline Laid to Abortion Foes,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/10/archives/maude-sponsorship-decline-laid-to-abortion-foes-network-stands-firm.html,"Norman Lear, executive producer of the Columbia Broadcasting System television show “Maude,” charged yesterday that “apparent pressure from anti‐abortion forces” had driven away most of the potential commercial sponsorship for reruns of two episodes that deal with abortion. Mr. Lear, reached by telephone in Los Angeles, said: “This proves there's a certain degree of cowardice in the American business community. A few letter s from pressure groups can make advertisers panic.” Mr. Lear, a partner in Tandem Productions, which supplies the program to C.B.S., said that all of the “Maude” reruns had been sold out so far this summer and for the rest of the season, except for the next two Tuesdays, when the reruns of the abortion episodes are scheduled. But advertising time bought for the two abortion reruns amounts to only 30 seconds of the three minutes available, Mr. Lear said. “This obviously isn't a mere coincidence,” he added. A spokesman tor C.B.S., when asked to confirm that only one of six 30‐minute spots had been sold for each of the reruns, said “no comment.” It was also said that 13 of the netwoork's affiliates planned not to show the two segments. Network Stands Firm C. B. S. has announced that the episodes concerning abortion, which encountered widespread protests from anti‐abortion groups and some officials of the Roman Catholic Church when first shown last winter, would definitely be seen the next two weeks. Bishop James S. Rausch, general secretary of the United States Catholic Conference, called C. B. S.'s intention to repeat the two segments “a breach of good faith on the part of the network” He said the two programs “advocate abortion,” and that although “advocacy may not have been the intention of the producers, it is certainly the result.” He added that “advocacy of abortion is unacceptable in a situation‐comedy format aired at prime viewing hours when children are a large part of the audience.” Bishop Rausch said that last November, Robert D. Wood, president of the C. B. S.‐TV network, met privately with Catholic Conference officials and gave them “reason to believe that the error would not be repeated.” Mr. Wood is on vacation in Europe, and could not be reached for comment yesterday. But a spokesman for the network said that Mr. Wood had made it clear to the Catholic Conference some time ago that he did not intend to keep the two episodes off the rerun schedule."
25 C.B.S. Affiliates Won't Show ‘Maude’ Episodes on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/14/archives/25-cbs-a-affiliates-wont-show-maude-episodes-on-abortion.html,"More than 25 C.B.S. affiliate stations have declined to carry reruns of two episodes of “Maude” dealing with abortion, the first of which is scheduled on the Columbia Broadcasting System television network tonight. The station defections from the normal “Maude” line‐up of 198, plus the network's reported inability to sell more than one of the 12 half‐minute commercial spoti on the two shows, apparently resulted in part from an intensive campaign directed by the United States Catholic Conference. The conference recently sent out statements to 160 Roman Catholic dioceses and 20,000 priests to exert pressure on local C.B.S. affiliates, urging them not to carry the two “Maude” episodes, which the ‘conference said “advocate abortion.” Those who have so far refused to remove the episodes from their schedules, however, include C.B.S. affiliate stations in Scranton, Pa., and in Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga and Johnson City, Tenn., even though urged to do so by local bishops. But, according to officials of the Catholic Conference and other sources, the two “Maude” episodes will not be carried by C. B. S. affiliate stations in Boston, Albany, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Rochester, Indianapolis, South Bend, Salt Lake City, Omaha,. and Seattle, among larger cities: The C. B. S. affiliate station in New Orleans, WWL, is owned by Loyola University of the South, a Jesuit institution. The stations in Salt Lake City (KSL) and in Seattle (KIRO) are controlled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints (Mormon). Other cities in which the shows will not be seen include Peoria, Champaign‐Urbana and Quincy, Ill.; Wichita Falls, Tyler, and Sherman‐Denison, Tex.; Baton Rouge and Lafayette, La.; La Crosse and Green Bay, Wis.; Fargo, Dickinson, Bisitarck, Minot, and Williston, N. D.; Erie, Pa.; Evansville, Ind.., and Roanoke, Va. The shows will be seen in New York and the four other cities where C. B. S. owns stations. According. to Norman Lear, executive producer of “Maude” and a partner in Tandem Productions, which packages the highly rated show for C. B. S., only one sponsor of a possible 12 is still set for the programs, and he's wavering.” Mr. Lear, reached by telephone yesterday in Los Angees, identified Pepsi‐Cola and the J. B. Williams Company as two sponsors who “defected” from the show allegedly because of pressure from antiabortion and “pro‐life” forces. In Milwaukee yesterday, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights appealed to the country's 48 million Catholics “to boycott C.B.S.‐TV programs all day on Aug. 14 and Aug. 21 when the ‘Maude’ abortion episodes will be shown.” Stuart D. Hubbell, the league's executive director, said that the two‐day boycott was “a practical way the average viewer can respond to C.B.S.'s arrogant abuse of a public trust.” “C.B.S. may think little of low their viewers feel but we think the network's sponsors may view the matter otherwise,” he added. A broadside against C.B.S. was also fired by a spokesman for the Catholic Communications Foundation, who said that the network's decision to rerun the episodes was “a willful insult to the American televiewer.” The New York‐based foundation, which is supported by several Catholic laymen's organizations, said the decision “called into question the basic integrity of the network's programing practices as well as its sensitivity to the cherished beliefs of a significant’ portion of the public it purports to serve.” Although there was widespread opposition to the two “Maude” episodes when they had their original runs on C. B. S. last November, only two stations — those in Peoria and Champaign‐Urbana, Ill. did not carry them. When asked why the Catholic Conference had embarked on a concerted campaign to keep the reruns off the air, a spokesman said: “We had a chance to see the programs and to observe how many Americans were offended by them.” C. B. S. officials, while standing by their decision to repeat the programs, said yesterday that as a gesture to those who may be offended by them, printed and spoken “warning” will be included. It will say: “Tonight's episode of ‘Maude’ was originally broadcast in November of 1972. Since it deals with ‘Maude's Dilemma’ as she contemplates the possibility of abortion, you may wish to refrain from watching it, if you believe the broadcast may disturb you or others in your family1” In another development ir the controversy yesterday, the Most. Rev. John F. Whealon. Archbishop of Hartford, re signed from station WTIC': program advisory committer because of the station's refusa to cancel the “Maude” epi sod es. “I see this action.. as use of TV to advance the doe trine that abortion is an accep table solution to an inconven ient pregnancy,” he set."
Censoring ‘Maude’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/15/archives/censoring-maude.html,"A spokesman for the Catholic Communications Foundation has called the decision of the Columbia Broadcasting System to rerun two episodes of the situation comedy “Maude” dealing with abortion “a willful insult to the American televiewer.” To the contrary, C.B.S. showed a commendable respect for the rights and maturity of its viewers and for its own obligations as a vehicle for free speech in refusing to be cowed into cutting these two episodes out of its summer‐long series of reruns. Those who did insult the public were the 36 C.B.S. affiliates which bowed pressure from the anti‐abortion forces and denied their viewers the right to reach their own judgment on whether to watch or not watch the first of the disputed programs last night. Also frightened into retreat were most of the program's commercial sponsors. The merits of “Maude,” the taste of the abortion episodes and the morality of abortion itself are all legitimate issues for vigorous public debate. What is totally alien to the American concept of free speech is a concerted attempt by any group to suppress a view of which it disapproves."
Husband's Consent Ruled Not Needed for Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/16/archives/husbands-consent-ruled-not-needed-for-abortion.html,"MIAMI, Aug. 15 (AP)—A three‐judge Federal court has ruled that a woman does not need her husband's or parents’ consent to obtain a legal abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ruling struck down the only remaining portion of the Florida abortion law still at issue after an earlier Supreme Court decision ruled the bulk of it unconstitutional. United States Appeals Judge David Dyer and United States District Judges Joe Eaton and William Mehrtens cited the Supreme Court decision in their ruling. They said that the nation's highest court had held a state had no authority to interfere with a woman's right of privacy in the first three months of pregnancy. They also said that regarding an abortion, a woman under 18 had the same rights as an older woman."
Blumenthal Ads to Mark Tactical Shift,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/16/archives/blumenthal-ads-to-mark-tactical-shift-5-ads-5-issues.html,"Assemblyman Albert H. Blu menthal of Manhattan, the Liberal candidate for Mayor, will begin a modest radio and news paper advertising campaign next week that will herald a shift from Mr. Blumenthal's strategy in the Democratic mayoral mary. The radio campaign—the first of any candidate in the fall election campaign—is also de signed to convinced contributors and workers that Mr. Blumenthal will mount a serious effort despite a $100,000 debt from the primary and the forecast of many politicians that he has little chance of upsetting Controller Abraham D. Beame, the Democratic mayoral contender and the acknowledged front‐runner in the race. 5 Ads, 5 Issues “I have a commitment to run, and considering all the circumstances, we're alive and well,” said Mr. Blumenthal, who ran last in the Democratic primary but remained a candidate because of the Liberal party's endorsement. The radio commercials will be unusual five‐minute spots devoted to one Issue each. At least five will be produced, dealing with transportation, criminal justice, housing, good government and abortion. Michael del Guidice, Mr. Blumenthal's campaign manager, conceded that the em,phasis on issues — particularly on such a nonmunicipal issue las abortion — would serve to emphasize Mr. Blumenthal's which the candidate campaign:hadplayed down in the Democratic primary in an effort to attract middle‐class votes. Mr. Blumenthal's only chance of winning in November, many politicians believe, is to run as the liberal alternative of three middle ‐of ‐the ‐road or conservative opponents, which is what Mayor Lindsay did four years ago. However, Mr. Blumenthal does not have the power and prestige of City Hall behind him and he has failed so far to win the endorsements of liberal Democrats years ago against the Democratic candidate, Mario Procaccino. who backed the Mayor four “Endorsements are not part of our strategy,” Mr. del Guidice said, in effect conceding that major endorsements were not expected. Badillo a Factor The “liberal standardbearer” strategy could also be badly undercut if Representa tive Herman Badillo of the Bronx, who had taken the most liberal stance of the candidates in the Democratic primary, decides to run as an independent candidate for Mayor. Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Badillo presumably would divide the liberal vote. Mr. Badillo's decision will be made in the next two weeks. To display his status as an active campaigner, Mr. Blumenthal called a news conference yesterday to link the end of the bombing in Cambodia with the asserted need for Federal funds to “finally end the war in our cities.” He spoke beside a boardedup five‐story tenement at 10th Street and Avenue A to dramatize his argument that money spent on the Indochina war could have prevented deterioration of the city. ?? ?? the city. The Blumenthal advertising effort will involve only two or three radio spots a week plus newspaper ads announcing the radio commercials for the next month. The effort will cost only $5,000 for the month. Mr. Blumenthal can afford no more. He conceded that he still owed $100,000 from the primary and is operating his campaign on $2,000 a week, largely rent for campaign headquarters and salaries for six workers. Mr. del Guidice has received no salary except for the $1,000 he was paid as a legislative aide to Mr. Blumenthal during the week‐long special session of the Legislature last month. Mr. Blumenthal said the Liberal party would help pay for the advertising."
British Researchers Develop an Experimental Vaccine Against a Major Cause of Mental Retardation,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/17/archives/british-researchers-develop-an-experimental-vaccine-against-a-major.html,"LONDON, Aug. 16 — Two British researchers have de veloped an experimental vac tine against a common vira disease that is considered ar important cause of mental re tardation throughout the world The vaccine now needs con firmation from injections intc a larger trial group before can be licensed for routine use in this country, the Unitec States and elsewhere. In experiments involving medical students the vaccine proved both safe — no more than a minor muscle ache occurred at the injection site and effective because it stimu lated the body's immunologic system to produce the desired protective substances. Dr. Stephen D. Elek and Dr Harold Stern, who developec the vaccine at St. George's Hospital here, said in an inter. view that they hoped the British Government's Medical Research Council, which funded a major portion of, the research, would begin the larger trial within year. Comparative studies on large number of adolescent girls, some of whom receive the vaccine and others whc get a dummy, should provide conclusive proof of the vaccine's protective benefits, the doctors said. No Therapy Known The disease, called cytomegalo virus infection or cytomegalic inclusion disease, is one for which no specific therapy exists. Cytomegalo virus probably has inflicted damage on humans for hundreds of years, but it was only at the beginning of this century that pathologists first described the disease. Cytomegalo virus particles, called inclusions, are produced in the nuclei of the cells that swell as a result of the infection in many of the body's organs. In the 17 years since American scientists discovered the causative virus, doctors have learned that cytomegalo virus produces its greatest damage during pregnancy when mothers pass the virus to the fetus in the womb. In its most severe form, the virus causes natural abortions and kills newborns from brain and liver damage. Retardation Can Result About one baby in 200 horn with congenital cytomegalo virus infection. Some slum a minor illness at birth. But the great majority of the babies with congenital cytomegalo vi rus infection “appear to suffer no obvious ill effect and make normal physical and menta progress,” Dr. Stern said. “The important thing is that a proportion of these babies including some who have nc symptoms and appear perfect ly healthy at birth, will become mentally retarded,” he said. In such cases, the effects of yiral damage on the brain become apparent only years later, in infancy or childhood, when the victim's intellectual capacities do not measure up to those of the child's peers. The researchers said that the exact incidence of mental retardation among babies with congenital cytomegalo virus infection was not known. But they estimated that it’ was at least 10 per cent of children with such congenital infections, in 2,000 new born The 10 per cent estimate may be low, Dr. Elek acknowledged, because “we are not certain at this stage whether the yirus might cause minimal brain damage.” The researchers pointed out that because societies pay for custodial care for decades for many such victims, the disease has a tremendous economic and psychologic impact around the world. While doctors know that the virus can pass through the placenta to affect the fetus and that infected babies can excrete the virus for years in the urine and saliva, they are not certain about precisely how the virus spreads among adults. Peak in Young Adults The virus affects more older people than infants. The peak incidence of cytomegald virus infection is between the ages of 15 and 30. By 35, cytomegalo virus has left its “fingerprints” in the blood of most adults. Such infections in adults generally do not produce specific symptoms or cause permanent damage. “But the situation between birth and adolescence is not so clear,” Dr. Elek said. Mental retardation is not one disease, but a phrase used to describe the damage that affects about two in every 100 newborns. Such damage results from a wide variety of disorders caused by genetic abnormalities like Down's syndrome (mongolism) and other viruses.like rubella (German measles). “Mental retardation is one of the biggest problems in medicine,” Dr. Elek said. And, he observed, “Cytomegalo virus is probably the most common viral condition” among the scores of causes of mental retardation. The virus that causes cytomegalo virus infection in man does not affect animals. Conversely, animal cytomegalo viruses no not produce disease in humans. So, the researchers were unable to rely on experiments in animals, a method that has paved the way to the development of several other human vaccines. Accordingly, the British researchers were forced to find human volunteers. They also had to be cautious in deciding when to test the strain of cytomegalo virus that they attentuated — that is tamed to the point where it ‘would stimulate the body to make protective antibodies but not cause illness. When the research had reached the point two years ago at which it could move from the laboratory to the clinical testing,stage, the researchers explained the over‐all problem‐and asked for volunteers among. St. George's medical students.. About one‐third of the students volunteered, but some dropped out after further explanation, First Method Abandoned To date the vaccine trials, which the researchers are preparing to describe in a medical journal, have inVolved “more than 50” medical students. The first volunteers swallowed an oral vaccine, which for technical reasons did not measure up to the researchers’ standards. “So we switched to subcutaneous injections,” or those beneath the skin layer, Dr. Elek said. Once they determined from studies on the first group of medical students the smallest dose required to stimulate the body to produce antibodies, the researchers injected it into 26 other volunteers. All but one of these medical personnel produced antibodies that tests have shown persist for one year, the longest period so far measured. The British researchers said that they had continually strived to develop a vaccine since the late nineteen‐fifties when Dr. Stern returned to St. George's from Boston after working with Dr. Thomas Weller at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Weller's team is credited as one of three to have first discovered Cytomegalo virus."
‘Maude’ Sponsors Who Backed Out Now Face Boycott,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/18/archives/maude-sponsors-who-backed-out-now-face-boycott.html,"A consumer boycott was urged by pro‐abortion groups yesterday against seven companies that declined to sponsor reruns of two “Maude” television shows about abortion. Representatives of the.National Organization of Women, the Population Institute and several other organizations announced the boycott as a score of pickets marched outside the offices of one of the withdrawing sponsors, American Home Products. Other companies involved in the boycott are Pepsico, Alberto‐Culver, General Mills, J. B. Williams, the Pharmacraft Division of the Pennwalt Corporation and the Mennen Company. One rerun of the Columbia Broadcasting System series, shown without sponsorship last Tuesday, finds Maude pregnant; the second, next Tuesday is about Maude's decision to have an abortion. Thirty‐nine C.B.S. affiliates did not carry the Tuesday show. Last fall, only two of the 159 affiliates did not. American Home, declined to discuss its reasons for withdrawing sponsorship. But an official of Pepsico, makers of Pepsi‐Cola, said, “we started getting a lot of protest calls.. and... we decided it'd prob. ably be best to pull our com mercial out.” Alberto ‐Culver, said the company had directed its ad, vertising agencies not to buy time on shows on which “drill addiction, deviate sex practices and abortion are treated facet'. ously or as material for com edy.” General Mills of Mineapolh and Pharmacraft said cancel lation of the “Maude” ads resulted from “a corporate de cision,” not from pressure. J. B. Williams said it pulled out because “we found out.. we would be the only sponsor o the’ show.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/19/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-presidents-response-on-watergate.html,"To the Editor: If an innocent man proclaims: his innocence over and over again, is it fair for The Times, most of the press and many of the public to complain that he only “repeated his now familiar denials""? If he offered a new denial, would he then be condemned for changing his story? What the public and presumably even The Times really wants is a simple, step‐by‐step explanation of the “truth” of the whole complex Watergate affair and associated “horrors” and they want it now, not in the courts. If the President offered such an explanation, then that would be seen as a self‐serving document. What else could it be? If one believes the President's denials to date, then how could any reasonable man or newspaper expect him to know for fact the disputed activities and motives of Haldeman, Mitchell, Magruder, Dean or Liddy? Do The Times and the American people want Richard Nixon to pass judgment rather than the courts? To complain of “no new. information” in the President's speech of Aug. 15 is to reveal a bias toward a pretrial verdict of guilty on all counts. Such a bias is unworthy of The Times. The President apparently has chosen to take the high road above the mire, not even to let anyone peek into the tapes of his Oval Office conversations which he says would corroborate him. Without doubt, this is poor public relations. The public wants its curiosity satisfied. I would too. But as in most public events which become part of our nation's history, only to be revised and disputed, there never will be a simple explanation for Watergate—except by that old military code word: SNAFU. ALVIN Moscow Stamford, Conn., Aug. 16, 1973 To the Editor: Unfortunately, the President's efforts of Aug. 15 to clarify the murky political situation surrounding the Watergate affair has not‐achieved its objectives. The long‐awaited response to the charges leveled at his Administration has failed to erase the doubts and clouds of suspicion which hover over the White House. In short, the credibility gap remains; it continues to exist, not because the American people enjoy holding their national leaders in low regard, but because of the failure of this Administration to furnish concrete answers to specific charges. This invariably leaves the populace no other alternative but skepticism and cynicism. Mr. Nixon's attempt to draw parellel between the civil disobedience perpetrated by those who sincerely felt our involvement in Southeast Asia was immoral and illegal and those “overzealous” members of his Administration who authorized and covered up the burglary of the Watergate and other “White House horrors” solely for partisan political gain is devoid of any rational similarities. Those dissenters who defied authority did so in the hopes of terminating what they considered to be a totally unjust war. Yet, men like the Berrigan brothers willingly accepted responsibility for the acts which they felt morally compelled to perform. Contrary to the willingness exhibited by many of the protesters of the nineteen‐sixties to accept the punishment society meted out, those involved in the Watergate scandal sought to devise every conceivable method to obfuscate the connections between themselves and their actions. Their plans were conceived in secrecy, and once uncovered, those higher officials strenuously attempted to sever any connections between their names and activities that they had either inspired or approved. In short, they were unwilling to accept the consequences of their covert actions. President Nixon has once again appealed to the people to step out from the shadows of Watergate and “get the country moving again.” But the only statement he can deliver which will result in a propitious response must be filled with complete honesty and candor: Tonight's statement was devoid of these elements and the cloud of Watergate is as ominous as ever. CHERYL WEXELMAN NORMAN GERTNER Brooklyn, Aug. 15, 1973 An editorial on this subject appears today. Undiminished Role in Southeast Asia To the Editor: A Reuters dispatch from Seoul carried in The Times of Aug. 8, states that “South Korea plans to invest total of $737 million worth of foreign and domestic capital by 1980 to build nine large shipyards on its South Coast. “In the next stage of developing the shipbuilding industry, due for completion by 1985, fourteen more shipyards will be built in the Ulsan and Kohung areas, both along the South Coast.” Where this South Korean “domestic” investment will come from is not quite clear. This four‐inch news item from Seoul is matched by an equally brief news item from Saigon carried in The Times of several weeks ago to the effect that a consortium of formidable American and other oil‐exploration companies have submitted their bids to explore oil in the Southeast Indochina seas. These reports indicate quite sharply that the industrial‐military complex is by no means moribund. The United States role in Southeast Asia, in spite of our withdrawal of armed forces from Vietnam, is in no way being diminished. President Nixon's warning to Congress that “our termination of air support to Cambodia will be construed as the abandonment by the United States of a friend in distress” is superfluous. Clearly, the President does not want our termination of air support to be interpreted as a notice that our action constitutes an abandonment of military bases in that part of the world. It is submitted that in the past nation's economic stakes abroad were followed inevitably by military commitments. This policy must be brought to an end. It would seem that only a complete withdrawal of all military bases from Southeast Asia, where we are still acting as a “policeman,” has become mandatory. Our failure to do so may well condemn our maturing generation to serve as guardians of our economic stakes abroad or, what is more ominous, bring down upon us the nuclear holocaust. WILLIAM L, STANDARD New Milford, Conn., Aug. 12, 1973 Subsidize Use of Land To Ease Shortages To the Editor: In an era when we face the contradiction of growing food shortages and the simultaneous subsidization of farmers for not producing food, it seems appropriate to make some changes. We are told that beef is scarce and beef prices are high because the food consumed by the cattle is scarce and overly expensive. Why can't the farmer's subsidy be based on his use of land to grow food for cattle instead of on the present basis—his nonuse of the land? Under such a plan, the farmer would still get his subsidy, the cattle raiser would get his feed and the taxpayer would hopefully get some return on his tax dollar in the form of more available beef at a lower price. A fringe benefit may also be realized: these landowners who have no intention of farming and yet collect government subsidies for not farming could be stricken from the subsidy roles for failure to use their farm land. Of course, that may be precisely where the canker gnaws. F. X. HASSELBERGER Research Associate, Lehigh University Bethlehem, Pa., Aug, 9, 1973 Abuses in Jerusalem To the Editor: I am in agreement with Evan M. Wilson's letter of July 27 about the need for restraints on building activity in Jerusalem, as suggested by the city's Municipal Planning Commission. To the best of my knowledge, however, the writer, who was U.S. Minister to Jerusalem from 1964 to 1967, did not protest the bulldozing of the Mount of Olives and the construction on Jerusalem's most beautiful hill of the International Hotel by the Jordanian Government, and certainly he made no mention of it in his letter. Anyone who remained silent in the face of this flagrant violation of the landscape during the Jordanian occupation has no moral right to protest now. This double standard applied to Israelis and Jordanians with regard to their administrations of Jerusalem is characteristic of protests by members of the diplomatic and church establishments who ignored, during two decades of Jordanian rule, human and religious as well as architectural, abuses in the Old City. ZIVIA S. WURTELE Santa Monica, Calif., July 28, 1973 To Correct Abuses in Campaign Financing To the Editor: I fully concur with your conclusion in your Aug. 10 editorial “Money and Politics” that “the endless complexities of campaign finance legislation point more and more decisively to some form of public financing.” Mere tinkering with campaign financing reform is not enough to correct the serious abuses exposed by Watergate. To eliminate the insidious influence of big money contributions we must, at the very least, impose absolute limits on the amount of money an individual may contribute to a campaign. But to elicit the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of small, voluntary contributions it would take to amass the millions of dollars needed these days to run for the Senate or the Presidency would necessitate a massive—and massively successful—fund‐raising campaign. This may or may not prove practicable for every candidate, especially for a challenger. To make things worse, such a fundraising campaign itself would call for heavy outlays of money. The only workable answer, I believe, is a broad system of public financing to complement—and stimulate—small contributions by large numbers of people. I plan to introduce a comprehensive bill that would match with Federal funds small individual private contributions in both primary and general ,Federal elections. To qualify for Federal funds a candidate for the House of Representatives would first have to raise at least $2,500 privately. A Senatorial candidate would have to raise $10,000; Presidential candidate, $100,000. These are not formidable amounts, but they are high enough to keep out nonserious candidates who have no real base of popular support. Candidates who raise this “qualifying” money from private sources would then become eligible for Federal matching funds: two‐to‐one matching in the primary and four‐toone matching in the general. However: a. Only private contributions of $50 or less would be eligible for Federal matching, and b. Under no condition could any single private contribution exceed $250. Moreover, there would be rigid limits on how much money—public and private—could be spent in a campaign: 10 cents per person of voting age per state in a Presidential primary and 15 cents per person in the general election, for example. And all private and public contributions would be deposited in a single trust account to be expended under the supervision of a court‐appointed bank officer. I estimate that my proposal would cost the individual taxpayer about $1 to $2 a year—a bargain price to pay to get the curse of big money out of the political system and get the political system back into the hands of the people, where it belongs. ALAN CRANSTON United States Senator, California Washington, Aug. 13, 1973 Power of Judicial Review To the Editor: Your editorial of Aug. 5, “Folly Compounded,” incorrectly finds “constitutional question” in the decision of the House and Senate to exempt the Trans‐Alaska pipeline from the judicial review provision of the National Environmental Policy Act. There is a significant difference between the power of judicial review where that power is created by a Congressional statute, such as NEPA, and the power of judicial review where that power derives from the Constitution. Specifically, the power of judicial review to decide the constitutionality of statutes (as, for example, in the abortion and obscenity cases) is power of the Federal courts said to be based upon the grant of judicial power to the Federal courts in Article III of the Constitution. For Congress to attempt to limit this power would indeed raise a constitutional question relative to separation of powers. However, the power of the Federal courts to review whether an administrative decision (in this case, the decision of the Interior Department to approve the pipeline) has complied with the requirements of NEPA is not a constitutional power, but rather a power created by the statute itself. Thus, it is modifiable by a later act of Congress. Therefore, if the concern is whether the actions of the House and Senate could be used as precedent for attempts to limit judicial review in more general context, that concern appears to be without merit. Although the passage of this bill by the House and Senate is damaging to the cause of environmental protection, it is nevertheless an overstatement to say that it creates “... untold consequences to the principle of separation of powers. BERNARD J, DUSHMAN Hartsdale, N. Y., Aug. 5, 1973"
TV: Pressure Tactics Testing Networks',https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/21/archives/tv-pressure-tactics-testing-networks-mettle.html,"The networks can't be all bad. In the face of several recent incidents in which they were accused of bias by some special interests, hounded‐by various pressure groups and rebuffed by a group of advertisers, they are almost beginning to look heroic. In a compromise arrangenient designed to assuage American Medical Association objections to a documentary, called “What *ice Health?,” the National Broadcasting Company devoted a hefty ‘portion of yesterday morning's “Today” show to an interview with.Dr. Russell B. Roth, president of the A.M.A He delivered the orgainization's views on such controversial issues as malpractice suits, medical injuries and spiraling health‐care costs. Dr. Roth, however, was rot nearly as convincing as the documentary. His comments tended to dissipate in vague generalities. For instance, when told by Frank McGee that a Government repOrt estimated medical injuries at between $1‐million and $2‐million yearly, he noted that “these statistical games we play can be misleading.” Meanwhile, N.B.C. had performed its ostensible duty. Not to be outdone in the Department of Assuaging, the Columbia Broadcasting System's Morning News featured a studio interview with Robert Beusse, a spokesman for the United States Catholic Conference, an organitation in the forefront’ of a’ campaign to keep two. episodes of “Maude” from being rerun. In the first, Maude gets pregnant. In the second, which can be seen on the more “courageous” C.B.S. affiliates this evening, Maude decides to get an abortion. Mr. Beusse's main point was that the two programs, masquerading as entertainment, were “propagandizing” for abortion. He was bal‐anced in the interview, though, with Alan Reitman, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued that the anti‐abortion forces were perhaps justified in recommending a “primary” viewer boycott of the offending episodes but not, as they are doing, a “continuing or secondary” boycott of all “Maude” episodes, participating advertisers or even all C.B.S. programing. In any case, the anti‐abortion campaigners have succeeded in getting advertisers to withdraw from the two episodes and in convincing nearly 40 C.B.S. affiliates not to carry the rerun's. Yet, in a gesture that almost makes up for the network's failing to pick up the renewal option on “Bridget Loves Bernie,” a popular series strongly attacked by some Jewish groups, C.B.S. is not backing down. Why? Robert D. Wood, president of C.B.S., offers two reasons: not to rerun them would “suggest we made a mistake the first time around,” and “if you start collapsing to one [pressure group], you're quickly going to have a long line of others outside your door.” Some industry students speculate on another reason: the possibility that producers Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin, the most successful team currently working in television, would tear up their contracts and skip to another network. The fact is that the two “Maude” episodes are not “propagandizing” for abortion. They are not suggesting, as hail been charged, that the taking of life is “a funny matter.” The humor revolves around the absurd aspects of the well‐established, predictably wise‐cracking character of Maude's getting pregnant at the age of 47. Maude and Walter decide, after serious discussion, that “for other people it might be fine, but for us it would be ridiculous” to have a child. The decision is carefully limited to the specific situation. Maude is troubled and questioning right through to the end of tonight's program, when Walter has to assure her that “for you, Maude, for me, in the privacy of our own lives, you're doing the right thing.” Granted, the potential of television to offend segments of audiences is enormous and the issue is complex. But the solution would hardly seem to be in watchdog censorship. The viewer can always switch to another channel. Or the offended parties might be provided with a platform of their own. The thrust has to be toward more, however controversial, not less. When C.B.S. finally gotc around to showing “Sticks and Bones” last Friday, without advertiser support and several dozen affiliate acceptances, the Republic did not fall. WCBS‐TV in New York did receive between 500 and 600 telephone calls after the broadcast, and the pro comments outweighed the con. But, again and despite unprecedented resistance, the network did follow through on its commitment. When the drama was pulled off the schedule last March, Mr. Wood said it was being postponed because the content might prove, unnecessarily abrasive when P.O.W.'s were returning from Vietnam. Some industry observers, inveterate doomsayers, railed about censorship and copouts. Then when the program was rescheduled for last Friday at 9 P.M., a few noted darkly that the time slot was not the best on the week's calendar, apparently forgetting that the original slot was a Friday at 9 P.M."
“As for prurient interest — whose?”; The Average Person,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/21/archives/the-average-person-as-for-prurient-interest-whose.html,"Who is the average person? The U.S. Supreme Court, in its recent rulings on pornography, has commissioned that person to decide for the rest of us that a work (a) “taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest,” (b) “in a patently offensive way,” and (c) “lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.” Susan BrownmiIler (Op‐Ed page, Aug. 6) applauds the decision. While approval of abortion and less bianism goes along with women's new freedom, pornography is nasty because it is enjoyed mainly by men who degrade the female as a sex object in their pleasure. And the ‘premise continues. This depraved enjoyment leads next to prostitution. Was it pornography that led to the development of the world's oldest profession? Before we take the pornographer to court to advance the cause of women's liberation—or for any other worthy purpose—we had better identify that “average person” who is to sit at the elbow of justice. Are we looking, to start with, for a “he” or for a “she""? Does he or she live in a small town or a big city; on the East or on the West Coast, in the secure Middle West or on the wintery frontier of Alaska? Is he 20 or is she 80? May Hugh Hefner publish Playboy from Chicago, where Mr. or Ms. Average finds no objection, and sell,it in Indianapolis where Ms. or Mr. Average may tomorrow say it is porno? If 300,000 New Yorkers pay their $5 to see “Deep Throat,” can we be sure there is not among them the average person who will hold that this movie comes within “acceptable community standards?” Or did all of the 300;000 offend those standards? In American society, Dr. Alfred Kinsey found quite different sexual mores prevailing in different ethnic, educational and income groups. Lower‐;ncome citizens had in general a less inhibited experience of sex; they represent a correspondingly less promise ing market for the vendors of pornography. It is members of the middle class who gave us our Comstock laws and are first to espouse obscenity laws. They have hang‐ups, acquired in the nursery that give them at once their thirst for the unsanctioned, much as Eve in the Garden, and their propensity to proscribe the pleasures of naughtiness for others. With the average person nominated, seconded and at last elected, the murky task is again, upon us. The criterion of patently offensive asks the question not only “to whom” but “under what circumstances.” Literary and other merit may have instability in time as well as space. Would Mr. Nixon's Justices affirm the 1973 counterpart of the rulings of Judge Woolsey in “Ulysses” and Judge Bryan concerning Lady Chatterly? Moreover, do we know today what such counterparts are or what the crystal ball will decree the “literature” of tomorrow? As for prurient interest—whose? Our society is learning to extend its tolerance to the Lesbian and the Gay. Can withhold from the lonely fantast the four‐color center spread that sustains the only fulfillment he or she knows? The guidelines of the Burger decision give us no objective rule for pre, dieting what present or future courts will say is legal in the exposition of ideas, fact or fiction, book or movie. No writer, publisher, or exhibitor can know whether his action is criminal until the verdict is in. That means prior censorship above or, more likely, below the table. It’ invites the bribe and the paY‐off to the authorities and the hoodlum alike. Pornography and the censorship it excites both spring from the same double‐standard culture that demeans men as well as ‐women. Tice newly fought‐for liberation of women means more freedom for both women and men. Such freedom rules out censorship of pornography as blatant paternalism. It is exercised in the name of a nonperson qualified only by the dubious adjective “average” to tell, us what we should’ look at, read or know. That is what I call invasion of my dignity and privacy. With our freedom to know rightly asserted, we may hope that the criterion of taste, expressed to the media in the marketplace, will achieve what some people want to decree by law."

Abortion Advocate Is Named to Advise City Veterans Unit,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/22/archives/abortion-advocate-is-named-to-advise-city-veterans-unit.html,"William R. Baird, the abortion advocate, has been named as an unpaid consultant to Mayor Lindsay's Office for Veterans Action. Mr. Baird, who disclosed the appointment, said he planned to establish an educational program on birth control and abortion that he hoped would become a model for veterans programs throughout the country. Maj. Carl M. A, McCarden, the Commissioner for Veterans Action, confirmed the appointment, but expressed dismay that Mr. Baird, a controversial figure who had evoked bitter opposition from the Catholic Church, had “gone to the newspapers.” “Why would he do a thing like that?” asked Major McCarden, who said the disclosure had caused him to “wonder about” Mr. Baird's motives, “Is he sincerely interested in helping veterans or getting publicity for himself?” Both, according to Mr. Baird, who cited the following reasons for releasing a letter from the veterans’ agency confirming his appointment: to publicize the need for birth control and abortion services for veterans and other citizens, to alert veterans that the services would now be available through Veterans Action and “because it's the first time, after giving 10 years of my life to this cause, that anybody has honored me this way and I'm proud of it.” Major McCarden, who said he feared the disclosure would make it appear that the Mayor's office advocated abortiog as opposed to the right to abortion and abortion counseling, reaffirmed his determination to offer Mr. Baird's services to veterans, “who have a real need for it.” Mr. Baird, who lives in Hempstead, L. I., ‘where, he directs the Parents Aid Society, an abortion ‐birth control clinic, has been jailed eight times during his fight to liberalize abrotion and birth‐control laws."
Abortion Advocate to Question Mayor on Job Held for a Day,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/23/archives/abortion-advocate-to-question-mayor-on-job-held-for-a-day.html,"William R. Baird, the abortion advocate, plans a City Hall news conference this morning to ask Mayor Lindsay why he lost his day‐old job as consultant to the Mayor's Office for Veterans Action. Mr. Baird, who on Tuesday disclosed his appointment in letter signed by Maj. Carl M. A. McCarden, the Commissioner for Veterans Action, said yesterday that he had learned that his appointment to the non‐salaried advisory position had been canceled. “I plan to attempt to see the Mayor at 11 A.M. and demand an apology,” Mr. Baird said last night. He charged that he lost the job because of “some be hind‐the‐scenes skullduggery by the Roman Catholic Church and the Mayor's office.” However, according to H. William Tackmann, a spokesman for the Division of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Baird's advice on abortion had been sought on an unofficial basis, and that Major McCarden “in no way wished to involve the agency in a religious controversy.” He said there was no intention “to give any particular status or to establish a formal relationship” with Mr. Baird and that Major McCarden planned to send him a letter to that effect. Mr. Baird, who lives in Hempstead, L. I., where he directs the Parents Aid Society he formed 10 years ago, said he attempted to reach Major McCarden yesterday to clarify the matter, but “suddenly, no one in his office would talk to me.” Major McCarden said early this morning that Mr. Baird was “never fired, because he was never hired.” He said that Mr. Baird had offered his clinic's services to provide free, education in family planning, and “we accepted his offer just as we would any offer of aid to veterans from the Archdiocese diocese of New York or any other qualified group offering free help.” “I still appreciate Mr. Baird's offer of assistance,” he said."
Learning About Hillbillies First Hand,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/23/archives/learning-about-hillbillies-first-hand-high-on-speed.html,"In the confession magazines, she is often called Edna June, and she is a thin‐lipped barefoot girl in a feedsack dress who spends most of her time on the front porch of her parents’ tumbledown Appalachian shack, pining about her unrequited love. To other Americans, she Is a Mammy Yokum type, a lamebrain toothless granny who smokes a corncob pipe. Or a Daisy Mae, a sexpot in a polka‐dotted midriff blouse and a tattered skirt. It was stereotypes such as these that helped prompt Kathy Kahn, 28 years old, to write a book called “Hillbilly Women,” which she thinks gives a more accurate portrayal of the 3 million poor white women who live, love and labor in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The $7.95 book will be published tomorrow by Doubleday. Although she was born just outside of Seattle (to working class parents), Mrs. Kahn is by no means a carpetbagger gone South in search of a quick rip‐off. For the last eight years she has worked as a community organizer in various Appalachian mountain communities. She is also a country singer with an LP album to her credit (“The Working Girl: Women's Songs of Mountains, Mines and Mills,” on the Voyager label), and she picks a mean left‐handed banjo. Her last address was Mineral Bluff, Ga., population 129. “Hillbilly women are angry,” Mrs. Kahn said the other day as she sat on her bed in the Chelsea Hotel, dressed in a plaid cotton shirt and blue jeans, her banjo at her side. “And if they're not outwardly angry, they're extremely dissatisfied with their lives. You can tell that just by standing outside a textile mill and watching their faces as they walk out. hope the book will help expose their problems and feelings.” Indeed, most of the 19 hillbilly women profiled in the book are miserably unhappy. They are coal miners’ widows living on welfare, persecuted union organizers, and textile workers suffering from “brown lung” disease. Several found despair by fleeing to the big city. One grew up an outcast because she was illegitimate. Another pops pills to help her make it through the day at a Georgia textile mill. ‘High on Speed’ “Drug use Is pretty common in Southern textile mills,” Mrs. Kahn asserted. “These women do their best production while they're high on speed. I've seen women just violently sick when they're coming down from the stuff. One took L.S.D. by mistake and began seeing monsters. There is a lot of speculation where the drugs come from, and some people think that certain companies are condoning it.” Mrs. Kahn, a 5‐foot blonde who weighs only 80 pounds, said that two things set hillbilly women apart from other working class women in the United States. “The first is their cultural heritage, the things that have been passed on from family to family because of the isolation of the mountains,” she said. “The other is the struggle that has marked the major part of their lives. Wherever they live, it's like a colony for the big coal or textile corporations.” Among the major ingredients of a hillbilly woman's cultural heritage, she said, are a close kinship (“Feuds still exist, but they're not all‐out wars”), religion (usually Baptist or Pentecostal), and a deep love for country music. “The music is really in the soul of country people” she said, silently ranning her fingers over her banjo strings. “It's like black people with their music. Country music is based around people and their struggles. Whenever you visit a hillbilly family, the radio is constantly on to the country music station. “The women singers, especially Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette, are the most popular now in the mountains,” she added. “Maybe it's because they're a little more aware... women tend to sing more about the problems and struggles of life. And women singers just have more guts.” Mrs. Kahn has had enough trouble and misery in her own life to provide material for a dozen country songs. Unable to afford college, she supported herself for several years as a laundromat attendant, a hair sweeper in a beauty salon, a factory worker, and a necktie saleswoman. While working as a community organizer in Georgia in the mid‐60's, she had several run‐ins with the Ku Klux Klan. She said a cross was burned on her front lawn and, later, the house in which she was staying was burned to the ground. But her worst moment, she recalled, came when a man who called her a “flaming radical” pressed a 38‐revolver to her head. She said the gun was knocked from the man's hand before he could pull the trigger. Mrs. Kahn is currently separated from her second husband, Simon Kahn, a Pennsylvania rabbi's son and Harvard graduate who also works as a community organizer, in the north Georgia mountains. They have a son, Jesse, 3. Mrs. Kahn also has a 5‐year‐old son, Simon, from her previous marriage to a New York actor, which lasted only five days. Mrs. Kahn, whose heroes are Cesar Chavez and Saul Alinsky, the late poverty organizer, was especially critical of the portrayal of hillbillies on the TV series, “The Beverly Hillbillies,” and also in two recent movies: “See How They Live,” a pornographic film; and “Deliverance,” one of last year's most popular movies. “The ads for ‘See How They Live’ showed hillbilly women standing in a hog pen and leaning against a rundown outhouse,” she said, angrily. “They wore polka‐dotted blouses and ragtorn skirts. You just don't find women like these in the mountains! In ‘Deliverance,’ hillbillies were portrayed as inbred, dirty, perverted people, totally uneducated. Not one of them could hold a decent conversation.” Turning to hillbilly family life, Mrs. Kahn, who spent two years researching her book, said she thought courtship was probably more traditional among hillbilly families than it was in other parts of the country. A father has to approve of any male suitor, she said, and the suitor, in turn, is careful to try to gain the respect of a girl's parents. Abortions Increasing “Sex is a very private thing among young couples,” she said. “It happens, but it's not really discussed — especially with parents.” The Pill, Mrs. Kahn said, is fast becoming the most popular form of contraception, and abortion, although it is still “a real, real controversy” among hillbilly women, is on the rise. Women's liberation? In the past, it has not held much appeal for hillbilly women, Mrs. Kahn said. Instead, their credo has been pretty much in accord with Tammy Wynette's hit country song, “Stand By Your Man, which urges women to “give him two arms to cling to, and something warm to come to, when nights are cold and lonely....” “I'm seeing some beginnings of interest in the women's movement,” Mrs. Kahn said, puffing on a cigarette. “Some mountain women are saying, ‘Okay, I'm not going to put up with this kind of treatment just because I'm a woman.’ “But these women really have a deep respect for family life,” she added, “and they're not angry or ashamed of their role as wife, mother or housekeeper. That's just a part of life for the working class woman. She really doesn't have much to look forward to in the future.”"
Metropolitan Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/24/archives/metropolitan-briefs-baird-rebuffed-at-city-hall-from-the-police.html,"William R. Baird, the birth‐control advocate, attempted unsuccessfully yesterday to see Mayor Lindsay at City Hall for an explanation of the “shortest political career in history.” Mr.’ Baird, who said he had been appointed on Tuesday as a consultant on abortion and birth control the Mayor's Office for Veterans Action, found he had been let go from the nonsalaried advisory position the next day. Mr. Baird charged at an informal news conference on the steps of City Hall that he had lost the job because of pressures from the Roman Catholic Church. A spokesman for the Mayor said the charge was “totally false and is a deplorable and offensive fabrication.” From the Police Blotter A prisoner charged with arson, resisting arrest and assault escaped from police custody in Elmhurst General Hospital in Queens through a bathroom window. The prisoner, Solomon Kennedy, 28 years old, had apparently obtained street clothes... Egon Hofbauer, 64, who ran company called Eiger Overseas Pharmaceuticals from his home at 109.20 71st Road, Forest Hills, Queens, was arrested after he allegedly sold mail‐order amphetamines and barbiturates to undercover agents on six occasions. Rockaways Get Shark Warning A shark warning was issued in the Rockaways after about eight sharks were reportedly sighted oft the beaches in the vicinity of 84th and 116th Streets. Because of the cooler weather, there were fewer bathers at the time the sighting, about noontime, and theye were ordered the beach by the lifeguards. The bathing ban was lifted half an hour later when the sharks apparently had disappeared. Speed for Birth Certificates Under a new Health Department policy, a native New Yorker may get a copy of his birth certificate in one day provided that he shows a need for fast service—a subpoena to appear in court, an appointment for a job interview or a flight ticket requiring a passport—where the deadline for submission of the birth certificate is less than seven days away. IRT Car Derailed Under River One subway car of a West Side IRT train jumped the track under the East River shortly after noon, blocking the tube and causing some afternoon passengers to rerouted to the Lexington Avenue IRT line. The Transit Authority reported only minor delays. The ninth car the 10‐car northbound train left the rails between the Clark Street and Wall Street stations. The last two cars were uncoupled and left in the subway tube, while the first eight cars evacuated the passengers to the Wall Street station. One woman passenger who was reported to have slipped and fallen durin gthe derailment was taken to the Beekman‐Downtown Hospital. She was treated for sprained left knee and released. She was identified by the hospital as Mrs.. Marzzonnie Lewis of 175 Rogers Avenue, Brooklyn."
Program Pressure,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/24/archives/program-pressure.html,"Even in the usual sleepy season of summer reruns and tryouts, the television networks and stations are finding that the pressure groups never rest. C.B.S. has had more than its share this year of boycott campaigns started by would‐be censors among its viewers. The situation comedy, “Maude,” was picketed for two episodes dealing with abortion. The drama, “Sticks ana Bones,” about an embittered Vietnam veteran, was kept off many affiliated stations for fear of adverse audience reaction. When the summer re‐run season ends two weeks hence, yet another program will disappear— though the network denies that it is as a result of organized external pressure. It is the situation comedy, “Bridget Loves Bernie,” which rabbinical groups objected to on the ground that it encouraged intermarriage and, in their view, mocked the teachings of Judaism. “Abie's Irish Rose,” a forerunner on a similar theme that made Broadway audiences laugh and cry fifty years ago, probably couldn't make the 1973.74 fall schedule either. The public has a choice of liking or disliking these or any other shows, from dramas to documentaries. But if the networks must bow to every offended organization or worry about offering response time for every adult theme, blandness will become even more totally the norm than it already is in a medium governed by the tyranny of ratings. The right to watch, to hear and to read cannot be defined and delimited by pressure groups in a mature society."
‘Women Power’ Protests ‘Male Domination’ of Wall St.,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/24/archives/-women-power-protests-male-domination-of-wall-st-st.html,"A banner with the words “women power” was raised over the public gallery of the American Stock Exchange yesterday by a dozen members of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women. They said they were protesting “male domination of the. Wall Street empire.” The chapter's image‐of‐wornen committee announced “Keep Her in Her Place” awards to —among other recipients—“Last Tango in Paris,” the Winchester cigar advertisements “featuring Mr. Machismo”; the Dean Martin Show on NBC‐TV for its “male's‐eye view of women as trivial” and Radio Station WINS, also for “trivializing women.” “Horrible Mentions” included those to Ma Griffe perfume advertising, for claiming to have “unliberated the liberated woman,” and to two books: “The New Chastity and Other Arguments Against Women's Liberation,” by Midge Decter, and “The Manipulated Man,” by Esther Vilar. A “Hypocrite's Award” went to New York magazine “for its many sexist covers and backlash articles against the women's movement.” Today in Rockefeller Center the statue of Atlas supporting the globe is to wear a banner saying, “Atlas, you held us up too long!” as three street‐theater skits attack “oppression based on male definitions of female sexuality” in religion, psychology and medicine. Stock‐exchange officials said trading on the floor was not stopped by yesterday's visit of the employment committee of the National Organization for Women. There were cheers as well as boos from men on the floor before security guards tore down the banner and ejected the women from the gallery. The “zap actions” are part of a week of protest and “consciousness‐raising” aimed at institutions and political figures before Aug. 26, the 53d anniversary of the 19th Amendment (women's suffrage) to the Constitution. Earlier targets included the Manhattan office of Senator James L. Buckley—where a a mock funeral was held “in memory of the unknown women who departed this life by the horrors of illegal abortion.” The women protested the Senator's co‐introduction of a constitution amendment reinstating restrictions on abortion that were outlawed by the Supreme Court. A demonstration against Governor Rockefeller's New York office demanded changes in state law to require employers to cover pregnancy‐related illnesses in their disability insurance programs. For the first year since 1970, when the feminist mvement began celebrating Aug. 26 as Equal Rights Day, the observance will be without a “women's liberation” march on Fifth Avenue. Instead a picnic, rally and “feminist fair” will be held in Battery Park tomorrow at P.M. Wilma Scott Heide, president of the National Organization for Women, will speak. Mending splits that widened luring preparations for last year's “march for equality,” some 18 feminist organizations here will take part in the “wolien's liberty action” within sight of the Statue of Liberty. Some activists predicted that another “women power” banner would fly from the statue before the day was over. Mrs. Heide is expected to link the plight of the poor and the aged—“the majority of whom are women”—during the food‐price crisis to the current feminist campaign for the 27th Amendment (equal rights). The measure still must carry eight states out of 21 that have not yet ratified it. The national board of the National Organization for Women has designated as its “top priorities” this year the amendment and the issue of “women in poverty.” The latter will also be the subject of a speech at the rally by Carolyn Reed, president of the Household Technicians of Greater New York, an organization of domestic workers. An outreach to poor women and “third‐world” women has been one milepost of the last year in the local feminist movement. Another has been the start of a “feminist‐community” coalition or alliance, partly to resolve antagonisms and increase empathy between heterosexual women and the more militant of the lesbian groups. Its purpose is communication and political mobilization rather than unanimity of goals. The Lesbian Feminist Liberation recently split off from the Gay Activists Alliance in favor of closer identification with other feminists. Many debates continue. “We would have preferred a march again this year instead of a carnival, because it's more political,” said a member of the Radical Feminists. Another dissenter, writing in Majority Report, a monthly newspaper, pooh‐poohed the “big park bazaar” and asked. “Next year will you organize a feminist ice‐cream social?” The Queens branch of the National Organization of Women will stage its own action; today and hold a party tonight A “continuous hayride” around Staten Island is planned for Saturday by feminists there, and the Long Island Feminist Coalition has scheduled a demonstration Monday. In the states where the Equal Rights Amendment is still unratified, the week's activities are centered on calling the attention of voters and state legislators to the measure. In upstate Seneca Falls, where the first women's rights convention was held in 1848, the new Women's Hall of Fame will announce Sunday its first list of 20 outstanding American women—four of them living."

The refugees say the fighting was initiated by the Cambodian Communists after a conflict over scarce rice supplies and territorial control and has resulted in hundreds of casualties for the North Vietnamese and Cambodians.

BAPTISTS IN TEXAS TAKE TO LOBBYING,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/26/archives/baptists-in-texas-take-to-lobbying-keeping-tab-brewers-and.html,"DALLAS, Aug. 25—The social activism of the Southern Baptists in Texas during the recent session of the Legislature prompted former Presidential aide Bill O. Moyers to call it “the most effective voice in Texas on concerns of the Christian faith.” Mr. Moyers, once an ordained Texas Baptist minister, said he recently overheard an oil executive in Austin remark, “I'd rather have been Jacob wrestling with the angel than to see James Dunn walk in the door of my office.” Mr. Dunn is the secretary for the Christian Life Commission, the social action arm of the Baptist General Convention of Texas that works to insure passage of legislation it supports. This year, for the first time in its 10‐year history, the commission registered in Austin as an official legislative lobbyist. Backed by an army of 1.9 million letter‐writing Texas Baptists, the commission teamed up with unlikely forces to apply pressure for what Mr. Dunn calls “people‐helping legislation.” Brewers and Methodists After losing its bid to strike a drinking clause from the rights bill for 18‐year‐olds, the commission joined the brewers’ lobby to successfully press for passage of traffic safety laws and family code revisions. With Common Cause, it battled for legislative reform. While the bill was battered before passage, Mr. Dunn's associate, Phil Strickland, a lawyer, conceded that it was “basically sound and better than we had.” The Baptists were joined by Methodists and the Texas Bar Association in successfully pressing for juvenile court reform and revision of adoption processes. And they teamed up with Roman Catholics to persuade legislators to pass bilingual education bills. They opposed aid to parochial schools and a bill to pave the way for lotteries sand race track gambling. Both measures were killed in committee. When bills concerned with drunken driving, abortion reform and school financing were dodged by the Legislature, Mr. Dunn and Mr. Stickland vowed to apply pressure to have them introduced again during the new session. Keeping Tab For several years, the Baptist advocacy for social and moral reform in Texas has kept tab on all legislators and pending bills. “We can tell a lot about a person,” Mr. Dunn said, “by finding out who serves as his campaign manager, how he feel about minorities, who is his brother‐in‐law, if he is a swinger...” With this information, commission members appraise legislative proposals to match them with potential voting power. “In a three‐man subcommittee,” Mr. Dunn said, “one vote can make the difference. If we are one vote shy on an important bill, we consult a legislator who appears to be on the fence and attempt to influence his position.” Legislative briefings are a vital link to the commission's effectiveness. Key laymen, lawyers and judges are drawn into these meetings held throughout the state. “We give them a rundown on personalities, issues and processes,” Mr. Dunn said, “and then trust them to be good contact persons for shared interests.” Diligence Praised The Baptists are the only denomination in the state known to support an official lobby, and their diligence in speaking to moral and social issues is praised by other churchmen and legislators. “This is one of the few groups in America that speaks to major moral and social issues that affect people,” said Dr. Zan Holmes, Methodist superintendent and former legislator. Joe Gordesky of the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith cited the commission for “maintaining a careful, watchful eye as it promotes legislation for the people of Texas in a responsible way.” Praising its progressive approach to social issues, Representative Jim Mattox of Dallas said the commission “is extremely effective as a lobby, sometimes swaying just enough votes. It operates on a one‐toone basis by knowing a Representative and his supporters."""
WORN HERE HAIL DATE OF SUFFRAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/26/archives/women-here-hail-date-of-suffrage-19th-amendments-passage-noted-by.html,"With parades, rallies, religious services and rounds of speeches, tens of thousands of women here and across the country yesterday observed the 53d anniversary of the enactment of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. Actually, the anniversary is today. But representatives of women's groups started their activities yesterday because, as Anita Murray of the National Organization for Women put it, “There's so much we have to fight for and a one‐day anniversary simply isn't enough.” The women's groups were joined by politicians, too. President Nixon declared today as Women's Equality Day, an observance that received Congressional approval through a bill sponsored by Representative Bella S. Abzug of New York. Mayor Lindsay proclaimed today as Women's Rights Day here. Governor Rockefeller noted that it was in New York State, 125 years ago, that the women's suffrage movement really started. And in Bismark, N.D., Gov. Arthur Link hailed the women who are fighting to get the State Legislature to ratify the equal‐rights amendment. Miss Murray's organization, which claims a national membership of 30,000, held a rally at Battery Park, where speaker after speaker hammered on the theme of illegal abortions. Delivering an eulogy for the women who have died of such abortions, Miss Murray, who coordinated the rally, told a crowd of nearly 800: “You were the victims of the most barbaric laws that ever existed. You died alone and unknown, in back alleys and on kitchen tables tortured with coat hangers and knitting needles. “The dreaded laws are changed for us now but that won't bring you back. Farewell dear sisters, we mourn and weep for you.” The eulogy was followed by a kaddish, a prayer said in Hebrew by Audrey Gellis, a columnist with The Copley News Service. “Our poor dead sisters,” Miss Gellis intoned, “must be the last, women ever to die from illegal abortions.” Earlier yesterday, about 100 representatives of the organization gathered in front of Senator James L. Buckley's office at Lexington Avenue and 45th Street and held a “funeral service.” The action was to protest Senator Buckley's proposal that the Constitution be amended to make abortions illegal. That proposal, the women demonstrators said, would “negate” a Supreme Court decision of last January under which a woman can obtain an abortion if she wants. The National Organization for Women, which has 600 chapters around the country, organized large rallies in many other cities, including St. Louis and Los Angeles. At these rallies, according to Dian Terry, a spokesman for the group, the theme, too, was illegal abortions—and economic inequality. In Washington, a women's fair was held in the Presidential Park near the White House. Booths displaying women's literature and placards depicting scenes from the suffrage movement were set up amidst the greenery. There were speeches, too, on the ratification of the equal rights amendment. Nancy Flinch, a past president of the Washington chapter of N.O.W., said that only 30 states had ratified the amendment and that her group was aiming for ratification by the other states in the Union. The day's activities in Washington were capped by a women's song and dance festival in the ballroom of George Washington University's Marvin Center. Men Get Into Act The suffrage anniversary was observed by some men, too. About 50 of them, accompanied by their wives and children, and led by Warren Farrell, coordinator of the Task Force of the Masculine Mystique, a group affiliated with the N.O.W., paraded in front of Brentano's bookstore at Fifth Avenue and 47th Street here. “While women have been made sex objects, men have been made success objects,” Mr. Farrell declared. “Particularly in children's books men are always shown as doers and women as always housekeepers. This leads to men developing contempt for women. “I want to be seen as a warm man sharing in child‐raising, not as that cold cigar‐smoking man after power, money and prestige.” Mayor Lindsay announced new guidelines for removing sex as a basis for job qualification from virtually all city jobs. These guidelines were recommended after a three‐year review of the city's job title requirements by the Human Rights Commission and the Personnel Department. Mayor Lindsay said: “The guidelines will be interpreted strictly.” Governor Names Task Force In Albany, Governor Rockefeller announced the establishment of a task force to work out the creation of an equal employment opportunity program for women in state government. He directed the task force to recommend guidelines to meet requirements of state and Federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of sex. But in the city yesterday, about the most colorful ceremony was a hay ride on Staten Island organized by N.O.W., to commemorate a similar ride in 1848 in Seneca Falls, N. Y., where the women's suffrage movement is considered to have originated. Donning costumes of the period and waving banners, 100 women paraded through the quiet streets, drawing startled smiles from passerg‐by. In the Battery Park rally, Mabel Rees, a 93‐year‐old woman who had worked for the women's cause for nearly 70 years, observed: “I feel that whatever work you do with your head and hands is human work and shouldn't be confined to this sex or that.”"
Humanist Manifesto II Offers a ‘Survival’ Philosophy,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/26/archives/humanist-manifesto-ii-offers-a-survival-philosophy.html,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/27/archives/letters-to-the-editor-suicides-in-prison-a-cry-for-help-our-halls.html,"To the Editor: I have read with interest the press’ recent attempts to understand the increasing number of suicides in the New York City prison system. There can be no simple answer to this problem, for each suicide seems to point to a different problem within the prisons, the courts, the hospital prison wards or at times the very structure of our society. As 1973's suicides are reviewed, the trends which are revealed seem very similar to those of previous years. One trend is that individuals with long histories of mental illness and suicidal behavior are placed under the most stressful physical and psychological conditions imaginable in tiny, dark prison cells. Another trend is that very self:destructive individuals are shuttled back and forth from prison‐to overcrowded hospital to overcrowded prison mental observation units. A sad frequent occurrence is the impaired communication about mental symptoms among relatives, lawyers, courts, mental health staff and the correction officers ultimately responsible for care. Still sadder is when this lack of understanding breaks down into overt hostility between the involved parties in which the inmate is the ultimate sufferer. It is of interest that suicide is nonexistent at the Women's House of Detention and quite rare at several other houses. Invariably, those prisons with low suicide rates are the best‐organized and most therapeutic prisons in the system. The high suicide rates in other institutions are almost directly proportional to such conditions as disorganization, overcrowding, noise, filth, quality of medical and psychiatric care and cooperation between mental health and correctional staff. Just as the individual's suicidal behavior must be considered a cry for help for that individual, so must the rising suicide rate in the entire system be considered a cry for help for that ailing system. This cry must not be dealt with solely by enhanced observation of suicidal inmates. It must be met by the desperately needed changes which are being screamed out for and focused on by these suicides. EDWARD KAUFMAN, M.D. New York, Aug. 21, 1973 The writer is former director of psychiatry of the Prison Health Services of New York City. Our Halls of Justice In Need of a Cleanup To the Editor: I had occasion to visit the Brooklyn Criminal Court Building at 120 Schermerhorn Street to observe a case involving assault against the son of friend. It is an understatement to say that I was shocked at the state of the building and of the courtrooms themselves. If cleanliness is next to godliness (and the signs in all the courtrooms above the judges’ heads read, “In God We Trust”—with half the letters missing) then how do you explain a court building ‘that is so dingy, dirty and dreary? The shades were torn, and the walls were badly in.need of fresh paint. How can we expect public buildings so obviously neglected to instill respect for the law and the role of the courts in the minds of the people brought there? Psychologically it is the worst possible atmosphere in which to dispense justice. Little wonder that “deals” (some of them as dirty as the floors) seem possible or probable in these courtrooms, especially since little that is said there can be heard. Acoustically the rooms are badly designed (there do not seem to be any provisions for amplification) and it all seems “sub rose” rather than open and aboveboard. Since surroundings do have an effect upon people, why doesn't the department in the city which is responsible for these “halls of justice” clean them up, at least physically? It would be a beginning. ELSIE R. MARRUS New York, Aug. 10, 1973 To the Editor: Professor Dershowitz’ Aug. 22 letter regarding U.S. condemnation of Israel does grave damage to his deserved reputation as a legal scholar, while perhaps improving his position as stanch defender of the Israeli state. In an ordered society, a basic mainstay must be the cohesive rule of law, according to those first principles the society dictates. The commingling of morality and legality results in the terrifying prospect of choosing the arbitrators of morality, a far more difficult task than logical extension of legal precedent. Rewarding clearly guilty parties on the basis of past injustices compounds injustice. Equity is not served by rewarding those with “unclean hands.” The exemplary record of the U.S. delegation in support of Israel over the past combined with its numerous condemnations of Arab terrorism combine to suggest a continuing policy of adherence to those basic principles of law necessary to insure a structured international society. To suggest that Israel has been continuously subjected to one‐sided condemnation requires subjective judgment except where such one‐sidedness is clearly established, The learned professor has failed to provide such evidence, nor, I suggest, is such possible. MICHAEL C. LEEHY New York, Aug, 22, 1973  To the Editor: Apropos of J. Bacharach's strictures on international law and order as observed by Israel [letter Aug, 20], it should be noted that there were no meetings of, or condemnation by, the Security Council when in 1971 the Libyan Government forced a British airliner to land at Benghazi by threat. ening to shoot it down. Or when in 1956 French fighter planes compelled a Moroccan plane carrying Ben Bella to put down at a French‐controlled airport. Or in 1967 when a British plane carrying Mr. Tshombe was directed to Algeria, where the Government kept the former Congolese Premier in detention until he died. The Government of Lebanon had given open sanctuary to the group of terrorists unashamedly controlled by Dr. Habash which organized many of the past years’ hijackings and last year's slaughter at Lod Airport. It was Dr. Habash whom the Israelis were now seeking to capture in the complete absence of any other action being taken against him for his murderous activities. Should Israel stand by and let such activities against its citizens continue unpunished? DAVID CIVVAL Great Neck, L. I., Aug. 20, 1973 Debate and Abortion To the Editor: The Times was not consciously guilty of suppressing a view of which it disapproves when it editorialized (Aug. 15) on the pro‐abortion sequences of the C.B.S.‐TV “Maude” comedy. However, by building your editorial on press release from a “spokesman” for a small organization with no official connection with the United States Catholic Conference, you have effectively suppressed the central and genuine issue raised by the Conference and supported by other church and civil groups. In this connection, it Is noteworthy that three copies of the full documen tation distributed by the Conference were sent to The Times, two of them personally addressed and hand‐delivered to members of your staff. In those documents, Bishop James S. Rausch, General Secretary of the Conference, stated the issue as advocacy of abortion in the unanswerable context of an entertainment program in prime time. The Bishop wrote: “The issue is advocacy of one side of a con troversy, presented under the guise of situation comedy and aired at a time when children make up a substantial part of the viewing audience.” ROBERT B. BEUSSE Secretary for Communication U. S. Catholic Conference New York, Aug. 17, 1973 To the Editor: I completely agree with The Times when it asserts (Aug. 15 editorial) that the morality of abortion is a legitimate issue for public debate. But a genuine debate can occur only if both sides of an issue are presented. This is pre cisely what C.B.S. has failed to do regarding the abortion question. Through its situation comedy “Maude,” it will have devoted about two hours of prime time viewing to a totally onesided, emotional presentation of the issue. Obviously this is not a debate. My objection to the action of C.B.S. in the context of “Maude” is not its apparently pro abortion bias but, rather, its consistent and steadfast refusal to grant to others of opposite persuasion an equal hearing. Hasn't C.B.S. ever heard of an “Op‐Ed” page? J. J. REILLY Bellport, L. I., Aug. 16, 1973 Agnew in the Media To the Editor: in the Watergate case, many in the news media have not hesitated to find President Nixon guilty before all the evidence is in. Mr. Reston has now added a new twist to the powers of the media: He exonerates Agnew he.fore the evidence is all in [column Aug. 10]. Or is this merely a new way of playing the game of beat the President? BENJAMIN GINZBURG Arlington, Va., Aug. 10, 1973 To the Editor: In his Aug. 10 column, James Reston observes that the Vice President “.. saw the reality: The headlines in the newspapers made him look like crook....” Unintentionally, but succinctly. Mr. Reston has demonstrated why some members of the public, including my‐, self, entertain continuing concern with respect to the veracity and objectivity of the media. One tends to the conclusion that headlines sell papers, and if the presumption of innocence bars so doing, the presumption will be the casualty. ANDREW N. FARLEY, Pittsburgh, Aug. 14, 1973 A Cover Story Does Not To the Editor: In regard to the secret bombing of Cambodia, your columns seem bent on misrepresenting the nature of the means used to maintain the secrecy. The device of a “cover story” is probably as old as the institution of government, but only in your columns of the recent past, in connection with the cover story for the 1969.70 bombing in Cambodia, have I seen it repeatedly described as “falsified reporting” or as a device “to hide from Congress and the American people the fact....” As a parallel,’ consider the operation (in 1956.1960) of our U‐2 reconnaissance aircraft, which were routinely overflying the Soviet Union, an operation I believe you did not criticize. The Soviet Government obviously knew of this operation, but did not oppose it as long as it was not public knowledge. Our Government was thus motivated to keep it highly secret, and accordingly used a cover story in documents on the U‐2 that this type aircraft was used for high‐altitude atmosphere sampling (as, indeed, it was, but not exclusively). The secret was well kept, and the operation thus feasible, until Mr. Powers was shot down. Presume Misconduct The Cambodian bombing may or may not have been an equally justifiable operation; the fulminations on the subject in your columns scarcely enable one to judge. But, according to your own accounts, it is quite clear that senior American officials rightly or wrongly believed (a) it was justified, and (b) it would have been dif ficult to carry out — because of potential Cambodian reaction, not American—if it became public knowledge. Hence the desire for secrecy, and, accordingly, a cover story that would help maintain it. As in the U‐2 case, the opposition knew what was going on, but was motivated not to publicize it. The cover story was not in either case intended “to hide from Congress and the American people..” the facts involved, except as means to maintain secrecy required A cover story of a different type has been indicated many times in your own paper. Several of your news reports over the years stated that the budgets for the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency are concealed in the Federal Budget as presented to Congress, I assume that means that not only are the budgets for these agencies not given, but that the sums involved are added to the figures for other programs, so that these latter programs appear to be getting more money than they get in fact, This deception may no longer be appropriate. But I do believe it ill behooves anyone, whether in the Congress or in the press, who has acquiesced in these procedures for many years suddenly to commence describing them as “falsified reporting,” as if there were misconduct involved in the mere fact of a cover story. Such characterization is genuinely falsified. DONALD G. BRENNAN Croton‐on‐Hudson, N.Y., Aug. 17, 1973 The writer is Director of National Security Studies and a fanner president of the Hudson Institute."
5 Diverse Groups Urge Action To Counter Censorship of TV,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/30/archives/5-diverse-groups-urge-action-to-counter-censorship-of-tv-freedom-of.html,"The country's television statians, advertisers and public interest organizations were called’ on yesterday to “exert counter‐pressure against censorship of television dramatizations.” Five diverse groups issued joint statement condemning TV censorship because, the statement said, of recent controverlsies surrounding the airing of two episodes of “Maude” dealing with abortion and of the antiwar play “Sticks and Bones.” The groups were the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Council of Churches, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Young Women's Christian AssociationU.S.A. and the Freedom to Read Committee of the Association of American Publishers. Freedom of Speech Cited While congratulating the Columbia Broadcasting System for rerunning the “Maude” episodes despite pressure from “pro‐life” and anti‐abortion forces, the organizations said: “We deeply regret that some 39 of the C.B.S.‐affiliated stations apparently bowed to this pressure. as did the seven major U.S. corporations who withdrew their sponsorship.” The groups, in their statement sent to advertisers, station managers, and others, said that “Freedom of speech, guaranteed in the First Amendment, is an essential ingredient of healthy, functioning democracy. The public needs to receive diverse points of view, especially on controversial subjects, such as abortion, where robust debate is essential to the development of wise public policy. “Creative artists, in turn, need to be assured the freedom to express their own interpretations of such subjects. This is the vital principle at stake in the current controversy over the ‘Maude’ programs — and indeed, as in the dispute over the airing of Joseph Papp's production of the anti‐Vietnam war play, ‘Sticks and Bones.’ Violation of that principle by broadcasters and advertisers “amounts to self‐censorship on the ground of mere controversiality, a most insidious abridgement of free expression,” the statement said. Responsibility Acknowledged The statement of the five groups acknowledged that TV stations, on being granted Federal licenses to operate, are charged with the responsibility to serve the public interest and thus have the right and obligation to establish standards for judging what is shown to audiences. “But the public interest is not served,” the statement said, “when a station's program decision is made on the basis of fear of controversy, or when an advertiser's sponsorship is determined by fear of economic reprisal. . . . The public's right to view a diversity of innovative program material could be subject to the personal caprice or whim of individual media managers and their commercial sponsors.”"
Chinese Emphasis on Duty Leaves Time for Romance,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/30/archives/chinese-emphasis-on-duty-leaves-time-for-romance-illegitimacy.html,"PEKING (Reuters)—Though this is a land untouched by the attitudes and values of permissive society, “The Pill” is widely used in China. At the same time, romantic love and sex, which in China's past were inextricably associated with such “decadent” considerations as arranged marriages and bound feet, do have a place here, however muted. Foreign residents in Peking believe there is little validity to the view that holds contemporary China to be a country of unisex clothes, ideology and work quotas. On marriage, most Chinese will tell a foreigner, for instance, that the main quality looked for in a prospective spouse is “a similar political orientation” (of course, only a Maoist orientation is possible). Physical appearance as a criterion for choosing a marriage partner is regarded as a ‐""bourgeois concept” and a person's “inner world” is held to be more important than good looks. The Main Factor Yet love is clearly still the main factor in marriage—as most Chinese will shyly admit, though they talk of such matters only with reluctance. Unlike many countries in the West, there is no explicity erotic material in China, But pharmacies still routinely stock and even have special counters for such traditional stimulants as deer antler and ginseng root. Birth control devices and sterilization are easily available and for the most part are free, although pills are issued by the “barefoot doctors” in the communes only to married couples. Birth control methods, often more highly developed than in the West, range from daily and monthly pills, three monthly injections and intra‐uterine devices for women, to male contraceptives selling, openly and cheaply in city department stores. Social and moral pressure is brought to bear—not always successfully—to discourage premarital relations. Unmarried girls who become pregnant may have an abortion on request, but Chinese officials say the incidence of children born outside wedlock is not high. Though girls may legally wed at the age of 18, and boys at 20, couples are encouraged to wait until the girl is 25, and the man 28. The ideal family, in the eyes of the state, would consist of two children. Illegitimacy Called Low Economic considerations, based on population control, is the basis for these disciplines, which are less rigidly adhered to in the countryside than in the cities. But China is not a sterile country, and young couples can often be seen embracing at dusk in the parks alongside the Pearl River in Canton, or along the riverside in Shanghai. In the capital, public displays of affection are more restrained among the more stolid inhabitants, but lovers stroll on warm summer evenings alongside the ancient walls of Peking's Forbidden City. As with sex, romantic love is also missing in contemporary Chinese writing, the theater and cinema. For romantic interest in entertainment, the Chinese view North Korean and Albanian films, which elsewhere would be considered turgid fare. These films at least have some genuine “love interest,” while Chinese films stress only revolutionary comradeship. But it is real love that rules the choice of a husband and wife, though the words “husband” and “wife” are not used today in China. Surprisingly, a marriage partner is known in Peking dialect, China's national language, as “airen” or “lover.” It appears to be true, as officials insist, that the factory or neighborhood revolutionary committee plays a minimal part in the matchmaking process. Among officials with whom foreigners come into contact, the political or ideological character of a woman is more important than feminine beauty. In Shanghai recently, a native of the city, told that he must feel proud that the girls of Shanghai were so beautiful, said vehemently: “That is nothing to be proud of. am proud of the fact that the Communist party of China was founded here.” That girls like to look nice in China was demonstrated during the Cultural Revolution, when girls fought fanatical, scissor‐wielding Red Guards who sought to cut off their long braids. As the diplomatic community expands with China's outgoing foreign policy, foreign students such as the more than 200 Zambians and Tanzanians here have a more difficult life. Can't Get Dates These students, all males, spend up to three years in China studying engineering for future work on the Chinese‐built Zambia ‐Tanzania railway. They are without feminine companionship and about 30 have already returned home because of the social barriers. “Sometimes we ask Chinese girls out and we see in their eyes they would like to accept, but they cannot do so,” said one young African student. But some discreet flirting with Chinese girls is possible and some Chinese men are bold enough to compliment some of the pretty Embassy secretaries now living in Peking. And, especially in Shanghai, pretty Chinese girls will discreetly exchange a foreigner's glances."
Family Planning in China,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/01/archives/family-planning-in-china.html,"PEKING — In China today family planning is an invisible but relentless and most efficient movement, with its own personnel, committees at every level, from the small production team and its grassroots cadres, through the Ministry of Health family planning council. Yet nowhere on any Chinese street, or in any village, will one ever find any poster or slogan advertising birth control, such as one finds in India. “We did that at the beginning, but people were shocked, and it produced hostility,” one official said to me. In Yunnan I was told that women would still resent having this public discussion of the problem, although they are very willing to discuss it in meetings. There is no “surplus population.” But it is emphasized that the time has come, now that the cultural revolution is over, to devote attention to this problem. In the provinces and in every county it is the party branch secretary who is in charge of this birth control drive, an indication of its importance. “The role of the barefoot doctor in birth control is fairly limited; it is the woman cadre, better known to the people, who can exert influence.” In the big cities, such as Peking, Shanghai and Tientsin, every factory, every organization, department, ministry, bureau, every workshop, has its family planners and its family planning nucleus and program. Once again, the drive seeks total participation and total involvement and after the Cultural Revolution this has become almost an ingrained habit, for people are far more ready to discuss and to debate issues than they ever were. In each street there is a neighborhood committee, staffed by two or more women of the street; they are linked in each quarter to a clinic with a visiting doctor, five or six nurses, all of them are involved also in family planning. Questionnaires were circulated some months ago throughout the population in Peking, carrying out a check of the babies born, and the babies to be born. Each courtyard then held “meetings,” to debate the number of babies that each would plan to have within the next year. The families have to agree, between them, whose turn it will be to have, or not to have, a baby. Thus in one courtyard with four families, family A, newly married, would be entitled to priority for a baby in 1973; family B, with already four children, was to be persuaded to stop producing and to be “mobilized” either to have the wife sterilized, or the husband vasectomized, or to carry out birth control through other methods—all contraceptives are distributed free, and all operations are also done free of charge. Family C had a problem: it had two girl children, and wanted a third, a boy, but was asked to wait till 1974. Family D had no children after seven years of marriage. The wife was sent to a sterility clinic. In every institution the same mass process of personal invokement and decision, through collective debate, is followed. A friend told me that in her organization every woman had decided to have no more than two children. Unfortunately one woman got pregnant, inadvertently and out of turn; she was thus taking away the possibility of giving birth from another woman, who had had no baby and wanted to give, birth. “This woman, not to interfere with her neighbor, then had an abortion, although she had only two girls and wanted a boy. It was publicspirited of her.” Public spirit, abnegation, a woman‐to‐woman solidarity, is thus promoted throughout the streets, and brought into birth control. In every factory, at the workshop level, there are family planners, edu cating the men as well as the women workers. In one factory where some of the more senior workers come from another city, they are given contraceptives free when they return. The birthrate in the cities has fallen. In Peking and its region, population 7.8 million, there were 140,000 births and 53,000 deaths in 1973, or a population increase of 1.17 per cent. Shanghai had an even more estimable score: a mere 0.6 per cent increase of population in 1972. Of all methods used, the oral pill is most in use in the cities, and intrauterine devices most in use in rural areas. Abortion is also practiced on demand, mostly after two children, and the consent of the grandparents Is no longer necessary. In Yunnan Province (population 23 million of whom half are national minorities, who ao not practice family planning) 79,000 abortions were performed in 1972. National minorities do not practice birth control, again a concession to human feelings. “The minorities all want to have more children, we must not force them, they were so oppressed in the past.” Hence the birth control drive only affects the Han people (93 per cent of the total population of China)."
These Little Pressure Groups Went to Market — With a Club,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/02/archives/these-little-pressure-croups-went-to-marketwith-a-club.html,"IN one episode of “The Waltons” last season, the large and loving family befriended an ItaloAmerican boy from New York City. Just passing through town, as all sorts of “exotic” outsiders conveniently happen to do on “The Waltons,” the youth displayed the usual hostility of an urban juvenile delinquent. In the end, though, after returning some money he stole from the Walton family, he came to trust and respect the ways of his friendly benefactors. The plot was about harmlessly average for the series. It wasn't harmless enough, though, to avoid viewer objections entirely. An Italian organization informed the Columbia Broadcasting System that the program was biased, not because the delinquent thief was Italian but because he was subjected to the process of “waltonization.” The point: No matter what appears on the TV screen, somebody, someplace, is bound to be unhappy. This was dramatized on a grand scale recently by the furor surrounding “Sticks and Bones” and the reruns of the two “Maude” abortion episodes, also involving CBS. It is tempting to conclude that CBS must be doing something right, but the problem isn't limited to a single network or to such glaringly visible programing. * On one side, there is the advertiser, anxious to sell products and equally anxious, for the most part, to avoid making controversial waves. When “Sticks and Bones” and the “Maude” reruns encountered some antagonistic flak, the advertisers, displaying backbones of tapioca, withdrew all commercials from the programs. Occasionally they don't stop there. Last year when the “CBS Evening News” covered Congressional hearings on issues affecting fisheries, a manufacturer of canned tuna fish decided CBS did not give enough air time to the industry's side of the case. The manufacturer then withdrew its commercials from the network and most affiliate stations. Then, on the other side, there are the pressure groups and professional lobbyists. For instance, in “What Price Health?”, an hour‐long documentary, the National Broadcasting Company took a frankly critical approach to the general state of health care in this country. It questioned spiraling costs, insurance plans, the incidence of medical injuries and some of the policies of the American Medical Association. * Yes, it might be argued, the quality of medical care has been improving constantly, and the miracles of modern medicine are indeed occasionally wondrous. But, it can also be argued, there is something basically wrong with a system that can, easily and frequently, wipe out the modest savings of hardworking families and individuals. That was one of the areas attacked, with a degree of emotion unfortunately rare for TV, in “What Price Health?” Predictably, the massive wheels of the AMA were ready for the counterattack, charging unfairness and imbalance, putting every detail of the program under a microscope. Equal time was demanded for a response, forgetting that the critics might justifiably demand equal time after each episode of “Medical Center” or “Marcus Welby,” which never seem to be burdened with the reality of a medical goof or hospital bill. * A compromise was finally reached. The president of the AMA recently appeared on NBC's “Today” show. There, in an interview with Frank McGee, he presented the organization's view of medicalhospital matters. The presentation was rather ineffectual, but the confrontation seemed to be resolved. Actually, formats like “Today” and the “CBS Morning News” have long been used by the networks as a convenient forum for satisfying insistent critics. And the practice is valid. While the networks may use it as a device for “getting them off our back,” the critics are being given legitimate and effective exposure. In the end, a variety of viewpoints can work their way onto the TV screen. That has to be encouraged. On television, less is definitely not more. And that, precisely, is what is disturbing about the campaigns to keep “Sticks and Bones” and the “Maude” reruns off the air. These campaigns were not asking for equal time. They were de manding censorship. What was deemed objectionable by some was to be denied to all. When “Sticks and Bones” was postponed last March, CBS said that its presentation might prove “unnecessarily abrasive” at a time when POWs were returning from Vietnam. Meantime, those returns, generously covered by television, were being carefully orchestrated into a demonstration of support for the Nixon Administration. Months later, dozens of affiliates still couldn't bring themselves to show David Rabe's award‐winning drama. The public couldn't even be afforded the opportunity to decide for itself. The “Maude” reruns provide a somewhat different case. When shown the first time, they were rejected by only a couple of stations and public response to the content was not overwhelming. Then a number of “pro‐life” groups, spearheaded by the U. S. Catholic Conference, went into action and when rerun time rolled around they had stirred up enough fuss to scare away nearly 40 stations and, of course, all of the advertisers. * It can hardly be denied that pregnancy and the question of abortion are sensitive issues. But it is also apparent that the “Maude” programs tried to deal with them sensitively. One major argument of the protesters is that abortion “is certainly an entirely unfit subject for a situation comedy.” A letter to this reviewer adds, “Subjects that are extremely explosive in nature have no place on a comedy series. The fact remains a comedy is entertainment of a light touch....” That would have been news to, say, Molière or Sheridan or Shaw. Television, needless to say, has hardly approached those explosive levels, but at least Norman Lear, producer of “Maude,” is attempting to go beyond the roast that burns on the night daddy's boss is coming to dinner. Again, it is not a question of equal time. Situation comedies are chock full of large and adorable families. The mere announcement of a pregnancy on any television program is geared to make the viewer go misty of eye and weak of knee. Perhaps the most startling thing on the two offending programs was not Maude's decision to get an abortion—a decision well within the law of the land—but husband Walter's confession that he never wanted to have children at all. While that sentiment is familiar enough off screen, in television it almost rings subversive. * But pressure groups, all pressure groups, will continue to insist that television somehow has an obligation to rectify their own failings. Some Jewish groups, for instance, objected to “Bridget Loves Bernie” not because the series was in any way antiSemitic but because it might encourage intermarriage and assimilation, a problem of real concern to these groups. And in all cases, these protesters will insist that they speak for an entire group. However, I received letters from several prominent Jewish groups that had no objection to “Bridget Loves Bernie.” And, not surprisingly, one of the groups in favor of rerunning the “Maude” episodes was made up of Catholics. No one, obviously, is about to suggest that American network television is faultless. As the “great reflector,” it tends to be too safely and blandly centrist. It needs pressures, to improve what is already on and to expand the possibilities of what might get on. Controversial and explosive subjects might be allowed to survive or fail in a free marketplace. The audience may not be as naive as the protesters seem to assume."
Is Dr. Welby a Menace to Women?,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/02/archives/is-dr-welby-a-menace-to-women.html,"DIAGNOSIS: Acute depression specifically among members of the female sex; communicable to millions of weekly television viewers. PROGNOSIS: According to the ratings, shows no signs of being terminal. THE M.D. in “Marcus Welby, M.D.” must stand for something like “Masochists' Delight” in view of the show's chronic portrayal of women as being isolated, ineffective, dependent, child‐like, depressed and selfdestructive. These are women who have no understanding of themselves or control over their lives. What's worse is they don't need either of these qualities as Dr. Welby is on the scene (whether anyone wants him there or not) and all the plots revolve around the daddy‐willkiss‐it‐and‐make‐it‐well syndrome, a.k.a the white‐knight‐to‐the‐rescue syndrome. The typical plot concerns a woman who, through no “real” disease, collapses, is hospitalized, almost dies, recovers and is given a two‐minute psychiatric session by Dr. Welby which supplies her with all the self‐knowledge, self‐love and courage she will need for the rest of her life. And it's all giftwrapped, with Dr. Welby's approving smile as the bow. “Marcus Welby, M.D.” gives a woman's life crises the depth of a Miss Subways poster. * Here are five of my favorite episodes from the past season: 1. A fat woman fears that her handsome, successful husband will leave her for his thin, attractive assistant. She is so ashamed of being fat that she refuses to join her husband at any businessrelated social affairs and consequently is consumed by guilt because her absence may hurt her husband's career. Of course she cannot bring herself to discuss any of this with her husband so she goes to Dr. Welby, who puts her on a diet and an exercise routine and warns her against diet pills as she is hypertensive. However, she doesn't lose weight fast enough so she sneaks off to a charlatan fat doctor, who gives her a carnival of pills. Eventually she collapses and almost dies. When she regains consciousness, her husband is at her bedside looking tremendously relieved that she didn't die (why I can't imagine) and tnis plus Welby s little sermon is enough to give her back her self‐esteem. Her smile says to the two men: I'll be from now on. Moral: Thinness is important but not quite as important as life itself. Also, you think you're losing your husband, get yourself in the hospital near death and then he'll realize how much he loves you. 2. A young woman has left her husband, who she found was having an affair with a “career girl.” The wife's roommate is a sex bomb who advises her to “groove with the now.” She takes the advice and is seduced by a handsome, smooth‐talking marine biologist who is straightforward about wanting to get her into bed. He succeeds and she gets VD. She delays treatment and finally collapses, whereupon the boyfriend brings her to Dr. Welby and the hospital bed. It's touch and go whether or not she will need a hysterectomy. Her boyfriend comes to the hospital, but Dr. Welby will not let him see her and is quite nasty to him because he'd taken advantage of this nice girl. Dr. Kiley (Welby's handsome young assistant) also takes an immediate dislike to the boyfriend, perhaps because the boyfriend is even more handsome than Dr. Kiley. Anyway, because of Welby's further interference, the woman's estranged husband arrives at the hospital and begs her to come back to him. But in an incredibly modern twist, she realizes she was much too dependent on him and decides to try to make it on her own as a piano teacher. Moral: By all means be liberated and take a nice job like teaching piano while you're becoming a whole person. But you sleep with a man, watch out! you may die or at least become sterile. 3. A woman television personality is advised to rest as treatment for her heart problem, but since her entire identity is tied up with her success as hostess of a TV talk show, she can't adjust to staying home. She doesn't discuss her feelings with anyone—least of all her husband, who she feels married her for her fame anyway. (This does seem likely, since the woman is portrayed as a heartless bitch.) She takes to a diet of “ups” and liquor, collapses and is rushed to Welby and the hospital. She almost dies, but when she pulls through her husband tells her he loves her not her success. That makes everything cool, even though it is obvious she doesn't love herself but only loves her success. But as we all know, what she thinks of herself is irrelevant anyway, and so she can look forward to a happy future. But not too happy, because as a result of her illness she can't have a child. Moral: A career success will ruin your health and your personality and your chance to have a child; better find a man who loves you as a failure. 4. A young wife has been working for nine years at a job she hates in order to put her husband through school. He gets sick during his law school finals and refuses to finish the tests. The wife is shattered because she thought she'd be able to quit her job and have a baby. To make matters worse, she is promoted in her job. Her boss tells her that with nine years' experience she ought to be able to handle the new position, but she says she isn't ready. However, he insists. She gets depressed. She also gets pregnant since she stopped taking her birth control pills without telling her husband before he dropped out of law school. She considers abortion, but Welby asks her to talk it out with her husband who by now is so shamed by not being able to support his wife that he has taken a high‐pressure job. Eventually the husband collapses and we find out he had a “real” disease after all. In the hospital he promises his wife he'll grow up and that they can have baby soon. She says, “How about in seven months?” and they kiss. Moral: If you slave and deprive yourself long enough for your husband, it will pay off. Also, if you want a baby, use trickery if necessary; you can manipulate your husband later. 5. A cute blonde high school girl loses a lot of weight under the pressure of her mother, who has suffered the humiliation of having a fat daughter to the point of madness and whose life now depends on her daughter's being popular. The girl finds the best way to get dates is to sleep with every boy she goes out with. In a lecture to her health education class, Dr. Welby labels premarital sex “unwise” and the girl runs out of the classroom crying. She becomes quite depressed until she meets a boy who, although he sleeps with her on the first date, loves her for herself. She is elated until Welby tells her she has VD. He advises her to tell her parents. Her mother's reaction is, “It's disgusting! I just want to go to bed and sleep for a month!” * The girl gives Welby the names of the boys she has slept with, but leaves out the new boyfriend as she doesn't want him to know the truth about her. Eventually her conscience wins out and she reveals his name. Then she swallows a bottleful of barbiturates, collapses, is hospitalized and almost dies. While her parents wait to find out whether she will live or die, they realize they love her very much. The girl recovers but is filled with shame —but only for a moment. Everything is set right when Welby tells her, “I think you're a good person. And do you know what? I think you're pretty!” However, she has to pay a little more —the boyfriend brings her roses but ha won't see her because, he explains to Welby, he can't accept what she has done. Moral: If you have premarital sex, you'll get VD. If your boyfriend finds out you slept with anyone but him, he'll dump you even if you try to kill yourself. On the other hand, suicide is a good way to get your parents to appreciate you. Ridiculous? Nope. People take this stuff seriously. Millions of viewers live by it. Unfortunately, it's suicidal for a woman to swallow the crippling medicine “Marcus Welby, M.D.” dishes out. In real life there's no Dr. Welby to step in at the last minute, bandage up the attempted suicide and send her back into her shadow of a life, smiling."
"Enrollments Fall, But Aid to Schools Climbs in Jersey",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/03/archives/enrollments-fall-but-aid-to-schools-climbs-in-jersey-enrollments.html,"TRENTON, Sept. 2—New Jersey's public schools will open this week with fewer pupils than last year, more money, some labor and fiscal problems and a few educational changes. Total enrollment appears to have peaked out and has now declined by 9,000 students to 1,489,000 in a trend that is likely to continue through the next decade, thanks to declining birth rates. At the same time, state aid to the schools has risen from $28.3‐million to $491.8‐million. Superficially regarded, the combination of those circumstances —more money and fewer students—should help hardpressed educators to breathe a little more easily, but a collection of other factors has conspired to insure that life will be anything but “business as usual” in the administrative offices. There are unsigned labor contracts in such major school districts as Paramus and Clifton and the prospect that suppliers' reluctance to agree to long‐term contracts on oil and gas deliveries could cause heating and transportation difficulties in some school districts this winter. Food for school cafeterias will also he a problem. Walter Colender, chief of the office on food program administration in the State Department of Education, said that cafeteria managers faced both inflation and shortages. Meat, which was served four times a week in the last school year, will be on the menu less frequently this fall. But “the big question mark,” according to Mr. Colender, “is what we're going to do, because we can't get prices.” Meat dealers are unwilling to quote prices more than a clay in advance, he said, and “we have no idea what's going to happen when the beef freeze ends.” Some districts reported Federal and state agencies that finance their school‐lunch programs have indicated that funds will not he available until October. As a result, the districts may have to notify parents that youngsters will be sent home for hunch during September. Turnover in teaching staffs has been small this year, and available supply of new teachers is exceeding the demand. For the first time in many years we have had the opportunity to be fully selective,” one superintendent said. “There have been enough applicants for all jobs so that we could pick what we think are the best. I guess the only real problem is in the specialeducation field, and this has worked out well.” One position still not filled permanently is right at the top —that of Commissioner of Education. The last Commissioner, Dr. Carl L. Marburger, has not been replaced since the Legislature refused to approve his reappointment to the post last winter. Some changes that Dr. Marburger envisioned before he was denied reappointment will take effect this term, however, ineluding changes in curriculums and a greater exchange of programs among communities. A number of districts are preparing to introduce programs designed to help pupils who plan to look for jobs after graduation rather than go to college. Already, some districts have developed programs in this area that include working on farms and with retailers in their area. Plea Going to High Court Statewide, a one‐year experiment on graduation credits has been completed and will now be used in all high schools. Under this system, nonacademic courses, such as industrial arts, will be rated on a par with academic courses, such as English and history. The major intangible facing the system is the impact of the state court decisions last year that struck down as inherently inequitable New Jersey's reliance on the local property tax as the prime source of school funding. Leaders of the Legislature, in an election‐year gambit apparently designed to demonstrate that it is doing everything it can to preserve the status quo, intend to ask the United States Supreme Court to review the State Supreme Court decision. The request for a review, which some lawyers feel is very much a long‐shot proposition because the court's decision was based on the state rather than the Federal Constitution, will probably be filed sometime this month. One easy textbook solution to the financial questions raised by the court would be a state income tax, but the object lesson of Governor Cahill's defeat at the hands of Representative Charles W. Sandman in the gubernatorial primary last June, partly because of his earlier stand in favor of such a levy, has not been lost on other politicians. Byrne's Position Mr. Sandman, a conservative who is in the process of moving slightly to center, has conceded that he might in the extreme—the state's imminent bankruptcy, for example—support an income tax, but otherwise he has held firmly to his position against an income tax. Brendan T. Byrne, the Democratic candidate for Governor, has talked generally in terms of a tax reform that might or might not include a levy on incomes. Both aspirants are presumably eying the $200‐million budget surplus that Governor Cahill recently forecast for this year as a potential windfall that could offer a way to bring poorer school districts up to whatever is decided to be “thorough and efficient” level of education. Speculation about the range of possibilities runs from what the New Jersey Education Association called a “radical overhaul of the entire funding system” to piecemeal legislation that will upgrade the quality of schools in such large cities as Newark and Paterson. Though New Jersey's average annual statewide expenditure per pupil is the third highest in the country (behind Alaska and New York), the proportion of that spending which comes out of the state treasury (27 per cent) ranks 43d in the country. 68% by Local Taxation About 68 per cent of the money New Jersey spends on education is raised by local taxation—5 per cent comes from the Federal Government—and for the last several years the state, at least on paper, has been trying to do something to change the mix. The anticipated decline in enrollments over the next decade will probably do nothing to slow the rate at which classroom cost—namely teachers' salaries—has been climbing. The main decline in enrollment over the next five years, according to Dr. S. David Winans, who has been studying the demographics for the Education Department, will be in the elementary grades. Classroom rosters in high schools, on the other hand, are expected to continue rising, and education costs considerably more in the high schools than in the elementary grades. Exception Noted Some districts, in fact, particularly in such fast growing counties as Ocean and Burlington are not likely to show any decline in enrollment at all. While the state's school popuilation as a whole was virtually stable last year, for example, Ocean County added 3,270 pupils to its student body of 52,125, and Burlington added about 1,300 to its previous year's base of 78,800. If the decline in birth rates —a product of the pill, legalized abortions, the rising cost of living, and generally later family formations—continues over the next decade some of the wealthier school districts may be dealins with significantly lower enrollments.

Running for Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/04/archives/running-for-governor-sandman-appeals-to-white-urbanites-and-byrne.html,"TRENTON, Sept. 3—One of the most enduring rituals in New Jersey politics manifests itself every fourth Labor Day weekend in the opening gambits of the Democratic campaign for Governor. It is as predictable as the evening traffic jam on the Garden State Parkway, and it invariably includes such things as the traditional homage to the ethnic vote in Hudson County, a hand ‐ shaking foray on some boardwalk along some New Jersey beach, and a wreath‐laying ceremony at the Pennsauken grave of Peter McGuire, the labor leader credited with founding today's holiday for the American working man. News Analysis Brendan T. Byrne, the Democratic candidate for Governor, is no different than his predecessors. So he spent yesterday afternoon being formally embraced by the Hudson County Democratic organization at St. Anthony's Festival for the Sons and Daughters of Italian Parentage at Schuetzen Park in North Bergen. Last evening, Mr. Byrne strolled along the boardwalk at Point Pleasant Beach, reaching out for sticky, sandy hands. And this morning he was at Peter McGuire's grave along with the members of the Camden Central Labor Union. Underlying Tension For the most part, Mr. Byrne's weekend was routine, uninspiring and hardly representative of the underlying tension that has gripped his campaign ever since he won the party's nomination for Governor in June. Most New Jersey politicians regard Mr. Byrne as a favorite to defeat Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., the conservative Republican who wrested the party's nomination from Governor Cahill in the June primary. However, there are still a number of influential Democrats and Republicans — and Mr. Sandman is not the least of them—who contend that Mr Sandman has a good chance of defeating Mr. Byrne, whose public issues have earned him a critical press during the summer political doldrums. Mr. Sandman has staked his chances of winning on reducing his campaign to a handful of issues: his unequivocal opposition to such things as a state income tax, a liberalized abortion law and any encroachment on New Jersey's rock‐ribbed tradition of home rule that enables individual communities to zone out poor people and lowincome housing. By his own admission, the Sandman pitch is directed primarily at the white, urban voter who feels abandoned and cheated by his government and threatened by blacks. It is a campaign that likes to use the slogan “Stop, no and enough!” In contrast, Mr. Byrne espouses a traditionally liberal position on virtually all of the issues on which Mr. Sandman has taken a negative approach, except on abortion, where both men—both Roman Catholics—oppose any liberalization in the law. While Mr. Byrne holds that tax reform and liberalized zoning codes are vital, he is expected to back away from such positions during the next two months, largely out of the realization that a majority of the voters do not support them. For example, when he was asked about an income tax while walking along the Point Pleasant boardwalk, Mr. Byrne was decisive: “We don't need one,” he said. Referring to Governor Cahill's announcement that the state would end its fiscal year with a $200‐million surplus, Mr. Byrne said: “The $200‐million surplus is probably more than that. It's probably closer to a quarter‐billion dollars, and if we have a quarter‐billion extra, we don't need an income tax.” Watergate and Scandals Some of the more vocal Democratic liberals in the party contend that Watergate and the scandals that drove Governor Cahill from office and the inflationary spiral that has driven up prices in New Jersey are enough to defeat Mr. Sandman. In addition, he represents the conservative wing of his party while Mr. Byrne has achieved a degree of Democratic unity that has not been attained here since Gov. Richard J. Hughes won his second term in 1965. Mr. Byrne is hoping his campaign will be given a lift by an appearance here Thursday night by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts at the state Democratic fundraising dinner in Sea Girt. Meantime, the relative simplicity of the Sandman campaign has eliminated the need for an early start. While he took most of the weekend off, a plane droned along New Jersey's southern beaches dragging a long tail sign that seemed to say it all: “No income tax, vote for Sandman for Governor.” Mr. Sandman announced last week that his drive would not begin formally until Sept. 18 when Governor Rockefeller of New York appears in his behalf at a Republican fund‐raising dinner in Cherry Hill. However the first major confrontation of the campaign is now set for Friday, when Mr. Sandman and Mr. Byrne appear together at a meeting of New Jersey newspaper editors in Atlantic County. Although the meeting will not be a formal debate, it is regarded as extremely crucial in both camps because both men are expected to be subected to intensive inquiry. The ??utcome should decide who has drawn first blood in the campaign."
New Land Ethic: Its Spread Raises Political and Legal Issues to Be Resolved by Public,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/04/archives/new-land-ethic-its-spread-raises-political-and-legal-issues-to-be.html,"The nationwide movement toward land‐use regulation poses an array of important and nearly inescapable policy decisions that the public is going to be called on to resolve. These include political questions, legal questions, fiscal questions and, finally, the ultimate question of how far, and in what ways, the nation should grow. Most of the nation's environmental problems — air pollution, water pollution, solid waste disposal, noise, the “energy crisis” — involve the common factor of land use, with solutions dependent in the end on land‐use decisions. News Analysis Under environmental pressures; the states have enacted a spate of land regulation measures and Congress is considering a measure designed to get all the state to mount comprehensive programs, eliminating the current confusion. Whether this comes to pass quickly or slowly, what authorities have called a “quiet revolution” indeed seems to be under way. And underlying it, the concept of land as a purely private commodity to be regulated by economics seems to be giving way to the concept of land as a national resource in which all citizens have an interest. Implicit in the new “land ethic,” a movement documented in a New York Times report yesterday, are two fundamental shifts of power. One is movement of the initiative in land use planning from individual owners and developers to the general public, acting through governmental agencies. The other is a certain redistribution of wealth implied in large‐scale land‐use control: Individual freedom to maximize profits from land is replaced in various degrees by collective decisions about the disposition of land. Market Value an Issue The public will have to decide, in a multitude of instances, just how far these shifts of power should be carried. New restrictions on the use to which a piece of private land can be put are likely to lower its immediate market value, and therefore in a sense to constitute the public taking of property. The Constitution says: “... Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.” Courts down the years have held that some restrictions, such as municipal zoning, are a proper use of governmental police power in the public interest, and therefore do not constitute compensable “taking.” However, just how far the public interest in this respect extends has never been clearly defined. “Many precedents,” reported a recent study sponsored by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, “are anachronistic now that land is coming to be regarded as basic natural resource and urban development is seen as a process needing careful guidance and control.” The study suggested that the United States Supreme Court should “re‐examine its earlier precedents that seem to require a balancing of public interest against land value loss in every case, and declare that when the protection of natural, cultural or esthetic resources or the assurances of orderly development are involved, a mere loss in land value will never be justified for invalidating the regulation of land use.” Population Limits Another prospective legal problem is limits on population. A community or a state can ultimately hold only so many people. Any comprehensive land‐use plan is necessarily premised on some concept of a maximum population. A number of communities have already begun thinking about establishing population ceilings. While this is logical, in practice it is on a collision course with the constitutional provision that citizens have the right of free travel—and inferentially the right of settlement —among the states. State efforts to exclude interstate immigration during the Depression were invalidated by the courts, and subsequent rulings, such as those on arbitrary state residence requirements for welfare recipients, have been along the same line. The Rockefeller study took up this problem but could conclude only that: “Clearly the courts are going to be asked to draw with some precision the line between legitimate protection regulations and improper restrictions on growth and mobility. “The line they draw, and the responsive measures adopted by governments as the line becomes clearer, will have a major influence on how and where we grow.” If states institute comprehensive land‐use planning, as envisaged in the pending Federal legislation, it is going to entail some radical changes in community thinking and financing. The reason most cities are such messes physically is that cities get two–thirds of their revenues from real estate taxes; accordingly, the dominant criterion in designating land use is: “What use will bring in the biggest tax revenue tomorrow?” Junkyards and crackerbox subdivisions pock the outskirts of cities essentially because they pay more taxes than the weeds that were there before. Land‐use planning by defini tion subordinates the immediate‐tax‐revenue yardstick to broader criteria, such as environmental values and measured development calculated to produce a more pleasant—and more valuable—community in the long run. Foregoing opportunistic tax revenues from random development leaves citizens with several possibilities to explore and weigh: some potential property tax revenue can be replaced with state or Federal “revenue sharing”; other local taxes can be substituted; municipal budgets can be trirhmed—or, for a transitional period, somewhat higher real estate taxes can be levied. Beyond the legal and fiscal thickets, there is the fundamental question: How much, and in what way, does the nation want to grow? A national revolt against uncontrolled, haphazard growth plainly has been gathering. Coloradans reject the 1976 Winter Olympics. The Governor of Oregon urges people not to think of settling there. Communities from coast to coast block development projects that seem to involve more cost than benefit. But up to now this sentiment has been inchoate and not entirely apt. With the nation biologically committed to an increase of at least 50 million people in the next 25 years, the question is not whether there will be growth but where and what kind. The major national inquiry into this question to date was summarized in the 1972 report of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. It was quickly whisked into a White House closet because it talked about politically touchy things like birth control, abortion, and eventual stabilization of population. The irony of the current “land crunch” is that 70 per cent of the nation's population is jammed into less than 10 per cent of the nation's land area, while the other 90 per cent stands relatively unused. Eventual redistribution of population seems a logical inevitability, particularly in view of the 25 per cent population increase immediately in prospect. The National Commission on Urban Growth in 1969 recommended that 10 new communities of one million people each, and 100 new communities of 100,000 people each, be developed to accommodate at least half of this increase. But the Nixon Administration shied away from any such expansion program saying in effect that the newcomers would just have to cluster around existing metropolises. The 1972 National Governors Conference called for the formulation of Federal policies in half a dozen critical areas: development of established and new communities; population growth and distribution, and economic, agricultural and land development. Meanwhile, the questions of how much population, and where, remain substantially unaddressed. But they remain. While Administration and Congressional sponsors of the pending Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance Act (S.268) have stressed that land planning is basically a state affair, there are obvious qualifications to that principle and still must be delineated. Taken at face value, with optimal state planning, the state‐by‐state approach would produce a nation of 50 Camelots. While that may have pleasant ring, it also has manifest shortcomings. “It would be a miracle,” one high Federal official remarked, if 50 states, operating independently, gave us the exact distribution of farmland, industry, power plants forests and public beaches, not to mention population, that would best serve the over‐all national interest.” In other words, substantial Federal coordination of the 50 states' land planning seems unecessary and inevitable. But no one of prominence is saying much about this now because it is politically explosive. This perhaps most portentous question among the many landuse policy decisions facing citizens was summarized in recent Environmental Protection Agency report: “A national policy must be established to fill the void between the Federal Government's land impact and its de facto role. “States and localities alone cannot always be expected to make the most appropriate choices. They cannot adequately assess national goals nor determine the aspirations of American society. “A national perspective also is necessary to insure that a land use policy is consistent with national policies for growth, energy and population, all of which must be developed simultaneously if any is to be functional.”"
Specials to Get Extra Listings In '73 TV Menu,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/07/archives/specials-to-get-extra-listings-in-73-tvmenu-calendar-of-tv.html,"The new television season that gets under way Monday will be replete with the usual meat‐and‐potatoes fare such as “Marcus Welby,” Archie Bunker, and “Ironside,” but it also shows promise of giving hefty servings of truly special “specials.” A trend toward devoting more network time than ever before to special programs is a major one for the 1973–74 TV season. Also discernible are a move away from half hour shows and an increase in hour‐long and 90‐minute programs; a fragmentation of regular, set program scheduling, and an increased emphasis on showing off blockbuster movie hits. This is the fourth in a series of previews of the cultural season. Perhaps the most interesting, and promising, trend on this season's schedules is the development of several four‐to‐eight part “mini‐series” by the networks, which had promised a batch of them last year but failed to deliver. Although Sept. 10 is the official starting date of the new season, it will sputter along for six weeks or more before all 20 of the new prime‐time evening shows and the returning series have their premieres. That is because of a prolonged strike last spring by the Screen Writers Guild. It caused script and preproduction delays at the West Coast studios that supply the bulk of entertainment programs for the American Broadcasting Company, the Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company. Some Promises Fall N.B.C., perhaps hardest hit by the strike, has scheduled several musical‐variety specials to take up some of the slack in opening weeks. It will not start the returning “Wednesday Mystery Movie” until Oct. 3. C.B.S.'s new detective series, “Kojak,” with Telly Savalas, will not be seen until Oct. 24. The writers strike had little effect on the Public Broadcasting Service, but it too will have its troubles getting into the new season, mostly traceable to late‐ar riving and curtailed financing. Broadcasters, like other mortals, do not always make good on their promises, and so this year they may fail to provide the more than 300 hours of entertainment, sports and news specials they say they will. Last year their promises were almost as lavish, and as it turned out, they lived up to them about 80 per cent. But indications are that the broadcasters intend to try to deliver, and in doing so they are offering viewers such potential treats as Katharine Hepburn, making her TV dramatic debut as Amanda Wingfield in Tennessee Williams's “The Glass Menagerie.” The two‐hour special is due on A.B.C. Another movie superstar, William Holden, long a holdout from TV, will make his dramatic debut in that medium this season. He will star in the four‐part N.B.C. “miniseries” based on Joseph Wambaugh's novel “The Blue Knight.” Some writers not usually associated with TV will also be working for the networks this year. Arthur Miller has adapted his own play “After the Fall” as a two‐hour N.B.C. special, for example. For the same network, Truman Capote has written an original 90‐minute drama, “Uncle Sam's Hard Luck Hotel.” The teleplay of an ambitious, four‐hour adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel “Dr. Frankenstein,” to be seen on N.B.C., has Christopher Isherwood, who is new to TV, as its coauthor. Irish Show Listed The novelist Brian Moore has adapted for TV his examination of ideological conflicts in Ireland, “Catholics,” for presentation as the first C.B.S. “Playhouse 90” offering this season. These are but some of the drama specials the discerning viewer may look for this season. Others include A.B.C.'s “The Merchant of Venice,” with Lord Olivier as Shylock; Clifford Odets's “The Country Girl,” with Jason Robards, on N.B.C.; and C.B.S.'s two‐hour “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” a drama dealing with the life of a black Calendar of TV Highlights Here is a calendar of highlights of the 1973–74 television season. Sept. 13, 10 P.M.: Premiere of “N.B.C. Follies,” variety series, with Sammy Davis Jr., Mickey Rooney, Jerry Lewis. Sept. 20, 8 P.M.: Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Riggs in “Tennis Battle of the Sexes,” A.B.C. Sept. 28, 8:30 P.M.: “Don't Call Me Mama Any More,” C.B.S. special starring Cass Elliot.

March 18, 9:30 P.M.: American Film Institute tribute to James Cagney, C.B.S. woman who lives to be 108, starring Cicely Tyson. In addition to its “The Blue Knight” drama miniseries, N.B.C. will offer the six‐part “The Zoo Gang,” with Brian Keith, John Mills and Lilli Palmer. C.B.S. has a three‐part mini‐series about Benjamin Franklin on its schedule, and A.B.C. has a six‐hour version of “QB 7,” Leon Uris's best‐seller, starring Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara, Leslie Caron and Dame Edith Evans. There was speculation this season that one of the chief reasons that many affiliate stations refused to carry “Maude” episodes dealing with abortion and the antiwar play “Sticks and Bones” was that the stations were responding to Nixon Administration warnings that they would be held more accountable than ever for carrying network programs deemed “controversial” and “sensitive.” If that were the case, the affiliate reaction does not seem to have particularly scared the networks. The very first episode of “All in the Family,” for example, will have some explosive commentary on the Watergate affair. Later in the season, the same show will deal with mental retardation and problems of the aging. The first two episodes of “Maude” will deal with alcoholism, as will an A.B.C. made‐for‐TV movie, “The Morning After.” And A.B.C. has in the works a drama about guns and gun control that seems destined to upset the National Rifle Association. Although much of the preWatergate Administration criticism was aimed at network news, and officials responsible for network news still contend the pressures haven't let up, they nevertheless say their budgets for news this year will rise, that they are adding news bureaus and they intend to pursue more investigative reporting. The decision to present the new monthly, hour‐long “A.B.C. Closeup” investigative series is a direct result of the Watergate disclosures. Coincidental with the trend toward more hour‐long and 90‐minute shows this season will be a fragmentation of regular program schedules. Viewers will be less able, than in past seasons to see the same program in the same time slot each evening each week. For example, C.B.S., on Tuesdays, will present three separate shows on a rotating basis in the 9:30 to 11 P.M. period. Movies to Be Prominent The networks figure that movies first shown in theaters will continue to attract huge audiences, so they will use them to get those allimportant good showings in the audience ratings early in the season. A.B.C. will unspool what is perhaps its biggest movie blockbuster, “Airport,” next Tuesday, and “Rosemary's Baby” on Sept. 22. At the same time in the latter case, N.B.C. will be showing Paul Newman in “Cool Hand Luke.” C.B.S., has scheduled “Bonnie and Clyde” to run at the same time on Sept. 20 as a powerful attraction of another sort: The BobbyRiggs‐Billie Jean King tennis match on A.B.C. As in any season, everything on TV won't be top movies and specials. Old Standbys like “Gunsmoke,” “Here's Lucy,” “Adam‐12,” “Flip Wilson,” “The F. B. L” and “The Rookies” will be back. There will be many new situation comedies, like “Calucci's Dept.,” “Lotsa Luck” and “Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice” and more detective shows, such as “Police Story,” “The New Perry Mason” and “Griff.”"
2 IN MAYOR'S RACE CHIDE EACH OTHER,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/10/archives/2-in-mayors-race-chide-each-other-but-marchi-and-blumenthal-aim-big.html,"State Senator John J. Marchi. called Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal “a Tammany Haill pussycat” yesterday and Mr. Blumenthal said Mr. Marchi was such a lackadaisical campaigner that he “needs a little more orange juice.” The uncharacteristic use of epithets by the two politicians, customarily among the most mild‐mannered, reflected an apparent desire to stir some action in a mayoral campaign in which the Democratic nominee, Controller Abraham D. Beame, is thought to hold a comfortable lead. Mr. Beame picked up the endorsement yesterday of City Council President Sanford D. Garelik, who once declared for Mayor himself, then dropped out of the race to run for renomination to his current job, but lost. Representative Mario Biaggi, the Conservative party candidate, issued a statement deploring the Lindsay administration's plan to abolish the minimumheight requirement for Police Department recruits. A much‐decorated former police lieutenant himself, Mr. Biaggi said that abolishing the current 5‐foot 7‐inch minimum was contrary to the aim of “developing a police force capable of dealing with the type of physical hazards faced each day by a policeman on duty.” Mr. Marchi, the Republican mayoral candidate, also spoke during the WNBC‐TV “Sunday” program on safety in the streets, which most politicians believe to be one of the major matters preoccupying the New York City electorate. He said that he would propose a “tough” overhaul of the criminal‐justice system but that his opponents were merely proposing Band‐aid programs. Mr. Blumenthal, the Liberal party candidate, dismissed Mr. Marchi as a pallid campaigner, during the WCBS‐TV “Newsmakers” show, but on the program and in interviews afterward he concentrated on drawing a distinction between himself and Mr. Beame. On the show he said Mr. Beame had the political philosophy of “leaving to Caesar what is Caesar's.” Afterward, seated on a couch in the C.B.S. lobby at 525 West 57th Street, he was asked to specify what he thought Mr. Beame would leave to whom. “in this case,” he said, smiling, “Caesar is Frank Rossetti.” He said that Mr. Beame had declined to intervene to stop Mr. Rossetti, the Democratic leader of Manhattan, from making a deal with Republicans for a common slate of Supreme Court nominees. Abortion‐law Issue Mr. Blumenthal seemed to be going out of his way to pick a fight. He said he agreed that labor unions representing municipal employes were “too powerful.” He said he would “absolutely” oppose efforts by the biggest of the municipal unions, District Council 37 of the State, County and Municipal Employes, to win 20‐year half‐pay peesions. And he brought up, without waiting for questions, his role as the prime proponent of the state's liberalized abortion law, which is thought to pose some problems for him with the city's Roman Catholic electorate. As Mayor, he said, he would be vigilant to see that municipal hospitals were committed to operating under the law as it stands. He said he was worried that they might not reflect the liberalized law under a Mayor Biaggi or a Mayor Marchi. It was a day for verbal assaults, Mr. Marchi's unexpected tartness stirred the Beame forMayor mimeograph machine into equally unaccustomed rebuttal. So far, the Beame campaign, has operated in the frontrunner's style of decining to make unnecessary waves. But after Mr. Marchi had criticized both Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Beame in his TV interview, the Controller's aides distributed a statement that said in part “For Senator Marchi to pose as a city advocate is comparable to the wolf telling Little Red Riding Hood how much he wanted to help her.” The statement stressed a series of actions in the Legislature that, Mr. Beame said, showed that Mr. Marchi had helped “bludgeon and scuttle scores of vital programs to help New York City.”"
TV Review,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/11/archives/tv-review-deluise-diana-rigg-star-in-new-shows.html,"When the producers Norman Lear and Bud Yorldn adapted a British comedy series for American television and turned it into a pot of gold called “All in the Family,” the hunt was on for adaptable British comedies. Now there is “Lotsa Luck,” adapted from the British comedy “On the Buses” and venturing forth in this new TV season as a weekly series, Mondays at 8 P.M., on the National Broadcasting Company network. “Created by” Carl Reiner, Bill Persky and Sam Denoff, it titers Dom DeLuise as Stanley Belmont, bachelor and breadwinner for a household that includes his mother, sister and unemployed brother‐in‐law. Although the series is being taped “before an audience” in Burbank, Calif., the story is set in New York City, apparently Brooklyn. Stanley, his long‐suffering patience etched in deadpan hostility, has been promoted off the buses and works in the line's lost‐and‐found department. In last night's first episode the question of what to get sister Olive (Beverly Sanders) for her birthday is settled after Olive gets her foot stuck in the toilet tank and Stanley is forced to break the tank. Olive is getting a new toilet. Shopping by phone, Stanley screams, at a salesman, “162 for a toilet!” Pause. “Suppose I told you I was a veteran?” Pause. “With a wound?” Noël Coward, obviously, it's not. The humor is persistently low, running to bizarre situations and rapidfire wisecracks. Mom (Kathleen Freeman) is dotty, insisting that Stanley's girlfriend is a “tramp” while he tries to explain it wasn't her fault that she was mugged a few times. Brotherin‐law Arthur Wynn Erwin seems preoccupied with going to hospital clinics “to pick up my salve.” In the style of Mr. Reiner's “Enter Laughing,” the comedy tends to be outrageous. At times, however, it verges uneasily on being cruel teward its lower‐class characters. Otherwise, “Lotsa Luck” got off to a very funny, often hilarious start. Only the Nielsen ratings will show what the audience in mid‐America makes of it, and it's difficult to imagine where the plots will go now that the toilet has been used. But the quotient of laughs on the initial episode would be impressively creditable for, say, “All in the Family.” At 8:30 P.M. on Mondays, N.B.C. has another new series (the network schedule was unusually low on situation comedies) called “Diana.” Diana is Diana Rigg, the British actress formerly of TV's “The Avengers,” who, on the initial evidence, is being totally wasted in this series. Miss Rigg is cast as a British “fun‐loving divorcée seeking a new life in America.” She works as a fashion coordinator for a Fifth Avenue department store. She is subletting her brother's apartment. And that, evidently, is where the fun comes in. It seems numerous characters have keys to the apartment and are constantly dropping in on the hospitable Diana. All the characters get to do their comic turns while Miss Rigg stands graciously in the center. Aside from lacking an elemental touch of believability, the program is also short on pacing, style and wit. The result is as light and frothy as a large glass of prune juice. Among the returning series, “Maude” comes bounding back to the Columbia Broadcasting System this evening with the first of two episodes devoted to “Walter's Problem.” The problem with Walter (Bill Macy) is alcoholism. After all the controversy stirred up by Maude's abortion last season, it is reassuring to watch Mr. Lear continuing his campaign to inject serious subjects into situation comedies. Admittedly, the taste line is thin but Mr. Lear treads it carefully and, more with alcoholism than with abortion, successfully. The point is made that there are more than 12 million alcoholics in the United States, and that alcoholism isn't funny even though “Dean Martin gets a zillion dollars a year for his buzz.” In tonight's episode, a drunken Walter hauls off and smacks Maude (Beatrice Arthur) across the face. Perhaps the most shocking aspect of the scene is the sound of lingering giggles from a few members of the studio audience. Both episodes on alcoholism solidly deliver the message, and are also very funny."
Judge Upholds Bias in Hiring Of 4 Women as State Troopers,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/11/archives/judge-upholds-bias-in-hiring-of-4-women-as-state-troopers.html,"ALBANY, Sept. 10—A judge ruled today that state police officials practiced sex discrimination in appointing four women troopers, but he ruled that the action was justified because of a “bona fide occupational qualification.” Supreme Court Justice Harold E. Hughes Jr. of Altamont made] the ruling in dismissing a cornplaint by Thomas Button, al 21‐year‐old patrolman from the Village of Albion, Orleans County, who said he had been denied appointment as a trooper even though he scored a higher mark on a competitive test than the four women. A spokesman for the State Police Superintendent, William E. Kirwan, said that the women would begin training this week. The force has been all men since its formation in 1917. The women were to take the oath of office as troopers last Thursday along with a class of 124 men recruits, but the court challenge caused a delay. Although he noted that the state police conceded that Mr. Button scored higher in the competitive examination, Justice Hughes said he agreed with state police affidavits that asserted that “the searching of female prisoners would be better performed by female troopers. Justice Hughes also said that women troopers were better suited than men for “undercover assignments to investigate purse snatchings and unlawful abortion.” He also noted the increase in women arrested for drug crimes in recent years. “In the present case,” Justice Hughes said, “sexual status is reasonably related to job‐performance ability and the sexual discrimination is based upon bona fide occupational qualification.” Mr. Button was supported in the action by Local 1908, Fraternal Order of State Troopers, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employes."

Senate Leaders to Discuss Budget Outlook With Ash,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/12/archives/senate-leaders-to-discuss-budget-outlook-with-ash-report-awaited.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 (AP) —Senate Democratic leaders agreed today to a Nixon Administration proposal for a series of meetings with key Senators to discuss next year's budget outlook. The proposal, apparently part of the Administration's effort to improve relations with Congress, was made in a letter yesterday from Roy L. Ash, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, the Senate majority leader. The meetings will mark the first time the Nixon Administration has sought such Congressional advice in advance of the budget. Usually the first time Congress sees the budget is after the President has completed his proposal and has formally presented it. The proposal was accepted unanimously at a meeting of Senate committee chairmen at which a secret “must list” of about 50 bills scheduled for Congressional action this year was drawn up. Senator Mansfield declined to disclose what was on the list, noting that it, would be discussed at a breakfast meeting tomorrow with Democratic leaders in the House. In his letter to Senator Mansfield, Mr. Ash proposed that the meetings over the next six weeks “discuss in broad terms next year's budget outlook and the implications this will have in developing legislation.” He said the meetings would include the chairmen and ranking Republican members of Senate committees, plus key staff members and possibly others, with himself or Frederick Malek, deputy director of the budget agency. In another development today, the Senate voted to bar federally funded research on fetuses from induced abortions until guidelines are written governing research on human subjects. The issue arose as the Senate passed a bill, 81 to 6, setting up a commission to develop such guidelines. Report Awaited The measure also bars the use of Federal funds for psychosurgery until the commission makes its report in two years. It would direct the Administration to continue a broad program of grants to graduate students in biomedical research that the President wants to end. The bill was sent to conference with the House, which passed a much different version May 31. The Senate also voted today to advance the date of a Social Security increase, making the higher benefits effective immediately. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Democrat of Minnesota, offered the amendment, which was adopted by 58 to 31. It applies to a 5.9‐per‐cent benefit increase that is scheduled to take effect next July. Mr. Humphrey said the increase in the cost of living, especially in higher food prices, required that the higher benefits be available immediately upon enactment. The increase, approved earlier this year, raises the average monthly benefit from $167 to $176 and the average benefit for a couple from $278 to $294. The amendment was added to a bill making minimum benefits for workers who retired under Civil Service pensions Comparable to those available under Social Security. The increase would affect 30 million recipients of retirement, family survivor and disability payments. The Senate vote sent the bill to the House, where its fate is uncertain."
3X‐RAYTYPES HELD RISK IN PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/12/archives/3-xray-types-held-risk-in-pregnancy-scientists-see-peril-to-fetus.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 11—At least three types of drag nostic X‐ray procedures could expose a pregnant woman to enough radiation to be a serious danger to the fetus, two scientists reported today to an international meeting on radiation protection. One of the authors of the report suggested that any of these three procedures should be scheduled only during those days of the month when it is least likely that a woman has become pregnant without yet knowing it. In the case of a woman who is already known to be pregnant, he said, the doctor in the case must weigh carefully the relative risks to the woman and her unborn child. Withholding a diagnostic Xray procedure from a woman who needs it entails a risk to her, while the X‐ray exposure is a potential risk to the unborn child. The three procedures listed in the report as carrying a substantial risk each involve fluoroscopic examination of the woman's abdominal area and therefore can deliver radiation to the fetus. Abdominali Studies  One method is flubroscopic study of the abdoininal section of the aorta, the body's main artery. Another involves a similar study of ether arteries in the abdomen. The third covers the urinary bladder and the tube through which urine leaves it. Any of these three prooedures, the report said, can deliver a dose to the fetus as high as 20 rads. Eight other procedures were listed, any of which could deliver as much as four rads. A rad is a unit of radiation dose. The report to a congress of the International Radiation Protection Association here, was by Drs. Roberts Rugh and William‐Leach of the Food and Drug Administration's Bureau of Radiological Health. Dr. riugh, who has studied radiation effects on fetal animals for 25 years, said during a news conference that he considered an exposure of four rads to an early fetus to be cause for concern. He emphaSized that this was his opinion and did not reflect government policy. He said that doctors in Denmark recommended thempeutic abortion if a fetus in the first three months of development had been exposed to a total X‐ray dose of 10 rads. Defects and Death Dr. Rugh, who has, studied the effects of radiation in more than 300,000 mouse fetuses and embryos, said it was clear that excessive radiation could cause birth defects and. In extreme cases, fetal death. His report covered 66 different diagnostic X‐ray procedures that, might be administered to a pregnant woman in the course of medical or dental practice. Of these, the report estimated that 10 Might deliver four rads or more to the fetus and three of those were likely to give 20 rads. The other 56 procedures all deliver substantially fewer and are not known to entail any risk to the fetus, Dr. Rugh said. He emphasized that caution was needed in the use of X‐rays in caring fora woman who might be pregnant, but that need should not result in th withholding of needed X‐ray diagnosis or treatment. For tivoinart who needs any of the ‐types of X‐ray procedure most likely to deliver a substantial dose of radiation to a fetus, he said, it would probably be wise to give the X‐rays during the 10 days after the start of the menstrual period. In women with regular menstrual cycles, he said, there is very little risk that the patient will become pregnant during that 10‐day period. Data collected during the nineteen sixties indicate that more than 20 per cent of pregnant women in the United States are exposed to some X‐rays by medical or dental procedures during the first three months of pregnancy, the report said. This is the period when the fetus undergoes the greatest risk."

Parent and Child: Sexual liberation?,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/16/archives/what-about-the-right-to-say-no-parent-and-child-sexual-liberation.html,"A freshman came to see me at the university infirmary complaining of swollen glands, fever and a rash. It was infectious mononucleosis, a diag nosis that considerably relieved the young man. It turned out that he had thought he had VD. I asked if there were a real possibility. His answer was startling — because of the igno rance revealed.  He was a virgin, he explained. Tech nically a virgin, he said, because he had engaged in “heavy” petting with his girl friend to orgasm. And his sexually active roommate (male) had recently been treated for gonorrhea. So he felt he had ground for concern. I was able to allay his concern. In the course of our conversation, he brought up another worry: Was it normal for a man his age (19) to be a virgin? He was really asking if he was abnormal. Was he homosexual? His answers to my questions re vealed no hint of overt homosexual impulses and no fear of heterosexual relationships. He was very much in volved in sports and was carrying a heavy academic load, a combination that left him little time and little energy for sexual intercourse. In fact, he seemed healthily heterosexual, but anxious. More anxious than he should be. It turned out that much of his anxiety was based on the fact that he had decided against having a sexual relationship with his present girl friend—much to her disdain. Since he was not all that involved with her and did not feel the need for a sexual relationship, I thought bis decision was not only appropriate, but normal —and told him so. This college freshman's ignorance of sexual basics was not particularly unusual — even in this supposedly enlightened age of the new morality. His roommate, the one who had been treated for gonorrhea, was back in the infirmary a few days later. He had shared his antibiotic pills with his girl friend. The result: neither had been adequately treated. A 17‐year‐old freshman woman came to the student health clinic that same week for a consultation. She said she was homesick. She came from a moderate‐sized Western city, was one of six children. She was doing well academically and she had a boyfriend she liked a lot. But she‐was homesick. It turned out that the boyfriend was the real prôblem. Two years older than she, he was pushing her to have sexual intercourse. She was reluctant, she told me, “to go all the way.” She was not ready, she said. Not because of fear of pregnancy or parental disap proval, not because she was scared of sex, but because she felt that sex would interfere with her life as a student, with her plans for herself, with her studies, her freedom. She did not want to be tied down. And she felt sex should be a commitment. Her most anguishing problem, how ever, was the attitude of the other girls in her dormitory. She had talked about her boyfriend and his desires and she had explained her reserva tions obviously expecting support from her peers. Instead, she had been hurt to find them abrasively scornful of her virginity. Our conversation centered about how she could cope with the attitude of these girls with whom she was living more than how she could cope with her boyfriend's insistence on sex. Talking seemed to help, and a few weeks later, she reported that life as the “virgin queen” in her dormitory was rather unpleasant, but tolerable. She said she could handle the scorn of her girl “friends” and was con tinuing to date the young man, whom she still liked very much. Then one morning she called. She was crying. The night before, one of her “friends” had told her she had seduced my young patient's boyfriend. My patient didn't believe it and asked him if it was true. He confirmed it. She was terribly shaken, but still liked the young man so much she didn't want to break off with him. For several weeks, she vacillated be tween deciding to go to bed with him or never see him again. As a physi cian, I felt totally useless. All I could do was listen while she talked out her problem. Finally, she decided there was no solution. As least not in that time and not in that place. She decided to leave the university. If she had found support among her girl friends, she might have decided different ly. But they were brutally un helpful. In fact, they seemed to relish her distress. Her choice of virginity had made her an outcast. She came to recognize that her openness about her feelings had made her doubly vulnerable. Then there was the young couple—he was 18, she 16— who came to the infirmary one Sunday morning. The girl, trembling, asked me to give her the “morning‐after” pill. They had had intercourse the night before. It was the first time for each and they had used no contraception. After questioning her about the circumstances and estab lishing the date of her last period, I informed her that it was quite unlikely that she would have con ceived. I was relieved not to hive to prescribe the high doses of estrogenic hormones, with their unpleasant side ef fects. But the couple would not believe me. They kept insisting that I give her the pill. It turned out that neither the girl nor her boyfriend knew much about the menstrual cycle, ovulation, conception and implantation. After an hour of explanation and in struction, they reluctantly ac cepted my decision not to give her the “morning‐after” pill. Even then, the young still Five days later, the girl tele phoned me to report that her period had started. I asked if she had told her boyfriend. The conversation went some thing like this: “No!” “I think he'd like to know. Aren't you going to tell him?” “No! I suppose it's mean, but it wasn't very much fun for me. And he hasn't even called to see how I am. I suppose I shouldn't be so upset, but don't really want to talk about it to him.” “Would it be O.K. if I told him?” I asked. “I guess so.” “You sound pretty glum. Are you depressed?” “Yes,” she told me. “Really depressed?” “I don't know. Maybe.” “Killing yourself de pressed?” Laughter from her and a sigh from me. “Oh, no! I wouldn't do that. I'm O.K. Just disappointed. The whole thing was so dumb. I guess I'm some kind of freak, but I wish I'd waited. It wasn't so great.” “Um,” I ventured. “Everybody says it's so great. Some of my girl friends sleep around a lot. They say they really enjoy it. And they told me this was my big op portunity. One of them even offered me her diaphragm, but I didn't know what to do with it. “I wish I'd waited,” she concluded. The “problem” of virginity is not uniquely adolescent A young teacher came to me complaining of frequent colds and fatigue. She was obvi ously nervous and appeared depressed. Her fatigue, she told me, was so severe at times that it was all she could do to struggle through the school day. To rule out the possibility of some serious underlying disease, I gave her a thorough physical examina tion, ordered X‐rays and lab tests. On her next visit, I was able to assure her that every thing had checked out normal. I asked about her social life. She was obviously uneasy but, answered my questions open lyenough. Then I asked about her sexual life. She burst into tears. “If you tell me that what I need is a good lay, I'm going to leave,” she in formed me between sobs. “That's what the last doctor I went to see told me.” I was upset to learn that a colleague had diagnosed her problem thus crudely. I as sured her that I was not going to recommend anything until I knew just what was going on with her. And then the story poured out. She was attractive, in her mid‐twenties — and a virgin. She had two very serious boyfriends. She had consid ered marrying one of them and then the other at differ ent periods. But, she told me, each man had insisted on a sexual relationship before marriage. This was the root of her problem. I pointed out to her that her depression and physical complaints could be related to her ambivalence about premarital sex. It was easier for her to be ill than to say no. She accepted this diagnosis, but asked what she was go ing to do. First of all, I told her that I thought she should remain a virgin until she was ready to stop being a virgin. She was to do whatever made her most comfortable — and not to concern herself about either of the men's desires. I didn't see her again for two months. At this time, she felt much better, was able to get through her teach ing day without the fatigue that had dragged her down— and she was still a virgin. Being able to say “no” defi nitely and flatly had been a great relief. The next time I saw her she announced that she was engaged. I suspect that she may have some difficulties in adapting to her new sexual role, but I think the chances are good that she will find happiness in marriage. None of the rates that I have outlined is particularly unusual. The notion that young people know more about sex than their parents has not been demonstrated in my medical practice. And the idea that most teen‐agers revel in the pleasures of sex unencumbered by the inhibi tions and ignorance of the past is pure fantasy. Adolescents are as ambiva lent and anxious about sex as their elders ever were. Yes, there has been a youth rebel lion against Victorian moral ity, but rather than liberating, it has transformed sex into an ideology. The new ideology is that sex is good and good sex means orgasm and any body can. The result has been to turn the pleasures of sex into a duty. Along with all this goes the “knowledge” that if you don't have inter course, you'll go crazy—and that virginity is a hang‐up. I suppose I would be less upset if all this nonsense were not taken so seriously. But I get very concerned. To my mind, this new sex ual ideology is as dicta torial and cruel as Victo rian prudery. It unites the expectation of easily attained sexual competence and grati fication with a cavalier dis regard for some of the unde sirable side effects of sexual activity. It has used easier contraception, legal abortion and surer diagnostic and ther apeutic methods for venereal disease as arguments to make virginity irrelevant. It refuses to accept virginity as a rea sonable (usually temporary) way of life. In this atmos phere where chastity is con sidered actually harmful, the advocacy of virginity becomes anachronistic. The new mo rality allows no choice — it's “liberal” or nothing. Our ‐sexual liberation does not include the freedom to “no.” There are few public de fenders of chastity. Parents, counselors and physicians are aware that all young people have sexual impulses, but they are not equally aware that not all young people want to have sexual inter course. Nor are they aware of the sexual ignorance of young people. The older gen eration has accepted the myth of the happily promis cuous adolescent. Not only have they accepted it, they are intimidated by it to swoh an extent that they do not venture to talk to young peo ple about sex—acquiescing in the second myth that young people know more about sex than their elders. Both myths create problems for adoles cents. How do they find an informed adult willing to an swer their questions about sex and understand their am bivalence about their sexual impulses? It is essential that physi cians, counselors and parents distinguish‐ between the facts and the myths and accept that young people need guid ance. Guidance should not be confused with pomposity, puritanism or permissiveness. The most important guideline for both generations is: Don't take anything for granted. This means: Ask questions, discuss, communicate. My role as a physician is to prepare each young person whom I counsel to make as intelligent and wise a choice about sex as possible. In my eyes, this is also the task of each parent. Discussions about respect and responsibilty are not irrelevant. Without them, adolescents are prey to sexual “group think” and peer‐group pressures. In my practice, I have found that these pres sures can torment adoles cents. WHEN I talk to adolescents about sex, I usually ask them four questions—just to start them thinking and talking. There is no reason why par ents can't ask the same ques tions. They are: (1) Is sexual intercourse necessary for the relationship? I spend a lot of time help ing young people discriminate between desirability and ne cessity. I explain that I do not think that sexual inter course by itself is sufficient to sustain an intimate, grow ing relationship. In fact, dur ing adolescence, it may often destroy the relationship be cause it places too much pres sure on one or both partners. There are times when coitus can add new dimensions of intimacy and pleasure, but it should remain a choice, not an imperative. Many adoles cents who regard intercourse as a necessity have major dif ficulties in establishing inti mate relationships. For them, sex is a substitute for inti macy. (2) What should you expect from sexual intercourse? One of the most prevalent myths about sex is that suc cessful intercourse culminat ing in orgasm is easy. It isn't. I explain to young people that one major difficulty with the view that sex is “natural” is that it overlooks the fact that enjoyable love‐making usually requires mutual education. It takes time, effort and pa tience to learn how to love and make love. Some young people look on the sex act as therapeutic— either for themselves or for their partner. I discourage adolescents from sexual inter course that is motivated by the idea that they will be helping somebody — or being helped. (3) If you should need help, where will you seek it? Many young people never consider the possibility of per sonal or mutual distress. Most are aware that contraception, abortion and counseling serv ices exist, but few know how to go about making use of these services. Many distrust the “establishment” so much that they won't ask for help. (4) Have you thought about how this relationship might end? It is relatively easy to establish a sexual relation ship. But the notion that sex on a trial basis is less of a commitment than marriage and therefore less upsetting when the relationship ends is also a myth. Rejection is rejection whether we call it divorce, puppy love or adoles cent turmoil. In my opinion, it may hurt the adolescent even more than the adult. I am not urging a moral istic approach to sex, but I believe that young people who want to remain virgins need as much reassurance that their choice is healthy and correct as do those who choose to enter sexual rela tionships."
Showdown Expected in Jersey Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/17/archives/showdown-expected-in-jersey-the-basic-issue-fight-for-control.html,"NORTH BRUNSWICK, N.J., Sept. 16—A showdown was expected this week over wheth er 280 10th‐graders from pre dominantly white North Bruns wick should continue to attend New Brunswick's racially trou bled, overcrowded high school.  A parents group here has threatened a boycott of the school in New Brunswick un less school officials rule in their favor. North Brunswick wants its sophomores to go to the town ship's new $10‐million high school, which was completed this summer. But school offi cials in neighboring New Brunswick are resisting their departure for fear that it would foreshadow the loss also of all the juniors and seniors now being bused from North Bruns wick and nearby Milltown. Such a development would leave New Brunswick's high school virtually nonwhite. It is now about 60 per cent black, while North Brunswick's high school is 97 per cent white and Milltown's is all white. Under arrangements dating back several decades, North Brunswick and Milltown send their high school students to the larger city of New Bruns wick because the outlying communities had neither the money nor the population for high schools of their own. While the contracts govern ing those arrangements are close to expiration, a proposal for school regionalization has kept the school controversy alive. The Basic Issue Public debate has been char acterized by such phrases as “quality education,” “split shifts,” the “high cost of bus ing,” “utilization of facilities,” “community responsibility” and a “drain” on taxpayers' money. But the basic issue appears to be whether a racial balance can be maintained in the New Brunswick school system by continuing to bus In outsiders against their parents will. After a number of racial clashes in the New Brunswick school over the last several years, North Brunswick—now a town of 17,000—two years ago set out to provide high school facilities for its nearly 700 pu pils in grades 10 through 12. The school, built with a $9.8‐ million bond issue, also ac commodates the township's more than 1,000 pupils in the seventh through ninth grades. When the students moved in, North Brunswick asked the state to permit it to enroll the 10th grade here this year as well. State authorities explained that they were studying various proposals for the solution of problems faced by this area's school systems, but that they were not ready to make an mediate decision. Fight for Control New Brunswick, however eacted bitterly to the request, eading North Brunswick to iropose that New Brunswick end 50 sophomores to attend he new school here. New Brunswick authorities replied that the suggestion seemed acceptable on the con dition that the entire combined 10th grade of local and New Brunswick children remain un der the exclusive administra tive and teaching control of the New Brunswick school sys tem. North Brunswick's response was angry, and its school super intendent, Arthur Wise, called. New Brunswick's demand pre posterous. “Never!” Mr. Wise told a meeting of angry parents. “What they're doing to their own people is an educational abortion.” The township's new high school was planned and built with the approval of the State Department of Education, and school authorities and parents alike had hoped to have all their high school pupils now attending New Brunswick High enrolled here by September, 1975. If that happened, and Mill town would likewise withdraw its pupils from New Brunswick and send them to adjacent North Brunswick, the high school in New Brunswick would become virtually all black. In the opinion of school offi cials, the number of white stu dents in that city, many of whom attend parochial and private schools, is not enough to rebalance the high school even if they were enrolled there. New Brunswick officials ap peared determined to keep their school system racially balanced. But in North Brunswick and Milltown, officials and parents complained that New Bruns wick had failed to anticipate a growing school population and that the resulting overcrowding and double shifts had caused the quality of education to de cline. Bearing 2,000 petitions and banners proclaiming themselves the “North Brunswick Citizens for Quality Education,” a dele gation of 200 parents and school officials went to Trenton last week to attempt to per suede the State Education De partment to approvoe the im mediate transfer of their 10th‐ graders to the new school."
PANEL ON FETUSES PASSED IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/17/archives/panel-on-fetuses-passed-in-senate-safety-of-research-subjects-would.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16— The Senate has passed a bill that would establish a national commission for the protection of human subjects of medical experiments and charged it with special responsibilites to weigh the ethics of psycho surgery and research involving the live aborted human fetus. In the case of fetal research, an amendment to the bill called for a temporary ban on use of Federal funds or facilities for studies involving any fetus re moved from the mother's body in the course of therapeutic abortion. The ban would be effective until the proposed commission established its own guidelines on this subject. The commission was also charged with the responsibility of doing a study of psycho surgery, the use of brain sur gery to modify human behavior or emotion. Fetal research and psycho surgery have each been the sub ject of much recent debate by laymen as well as scientists. For months panels convened by the Department of Health, Edu cation and Welfare have been trying to work out guidelines setting Federal policy on both subjects. Although draft state ments have been prepared on both issues, no final versions have yet been published. Research Training Grants The provisions for establish ing a national commission for the protection of human sub jects of biomedical and be havioral research and fir set ting policy on psychosurgery and fetal research were passed last Tuesday in a bill that would also set up a program of re search training grants for men and women who are beginning careers in biomedical research. The bill, whose chief Senate sponsor is Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, will now go to a House ‐ Senate conference. Earlier the House passed a bill providing for med ical research training grants and calling for a ban on re search involving the live abort ed human fetus unless the re search objective was to save the fetus's life. Since both House and Senate versions take closely similar positions on fetal research, it appears likely that the final bill emerging from the conference will embrace sharp restrictions on such research, at least so far as federally aided efforts are concerned. Research on live aborted human fetuses has been per formed in Europe, sometimes with participation of Anierican scientists who receive support, for other research, from the Federal Government. Ma btter of Dbefinition The issue of psychosurgery has been complicated by a diffi culty, among those debating it, in agreeing on definitions dif ferentiating it from other brain surgery that might have some effects on the patient's be havior. Two examples often cited are surgery for some types of epilepsy and for relief of intractable pain. The issue is further compli cated by the fact that some surgeons who have done psy cho surgery do not consider it experimental, but therapeutic while some other persons con sider it altogether unacceptable ethically. Judging from draft reports and testimony on the subject from officers of the Department of Health, Education and Wel fare, the department's position appears to be that psycho surgery is experimental and of unproven effectiveness in modi fying behavior beneficially. The proposed national com mission for the protection of human research subjects would be established within the de partment and would consist of 11 members appointed by the President. The President would also choose one of his nominees to be chairman of the com mission and another to be co chairman. Only one of these would be a person who has toiiducted research involving human subjects. One of the commission's ma jor functions would be to de velop basic ethical guidelines for the conduct of research in volving human beings and to develop policies and regulations to insure that all federally funded research conformed to the guidelines."

But the basic issue appears to be whether a racial balance can be maintained in the New Brunswick School system by continuing to bus in outsiders against their parents' will. After a number of racial clashes in the New Brunswick school over the last several years, North Brunswick—now a town of 17,000—two years ago set out to provide high school facilities for its nearly 700 pupils in grades 10 through 12. The school, built with a $9.8 million bond issue, also accom modates the township's more than 1,000 pupils in the seventh through ninth grades. When the students moved in, North Brunswick asked the state to permit it to enroll the tenth grade here this year as well. State authorities explained that they were studying various proposals for the solution of problems faced by this area's school systems, but that they were not ready to make an im mediate decision. Fight for Control New Brunswick, however, re acted bitterly to the request, leading North Brunswick to propose that New Brunswick send 50 sophomores to attend the new school here. New Brunswick authorities replied that the suggestion seemed acceptable on the con dition that the entire combined 10th grade of local and New Brunswick children remain un der the exclusive administrative and teaching control of the New Brunswick school system. North Brunswick's response was angry, and its school su perintendent, Arthur Wise, called New Brunswick's de mand preposterous. “Never!” Mr. Wise told a meeting of angry parents. “What they're doing to their own people an educational abortion.” The ywnship's new high school was planned and built with the approval of the State Department of Education, and school authorities and parents alike had hoped to have all their high school pupils now at tending New Brunswick High enrolled here by September, 1975. If that happened, and Mill town would likewise withdraw its pupils from New Brunswick and send them to adjacent North Brunswick, the high school in New Brunswick would become virtually all black. In the opinion of school of ficials, the number of white students in that city, many of whom attend parochial and pri vate schools, is not enough to rebalance the high school even if they were enrolled there. New Brunswick officials ap peared determined to keep their school system racially balanced. But in North Brunswick and Milltown, officials and parents complained that New Bruns wick had failed to anticipate a growing school population and that the resulting overcrowding and double shifts had caused the quality of education to de cline. Bearing 2,000 petitions and banners proclaiming themselves the North Brunswick Citizens for Quality Education,” a dele gation of 200 parents and school officials went to Trenton last week to attempt to persuade the State Education Department to approve the Immediate trans fer of their 10th‐graders to the new school. Petition Rejected Officials of the State Board of Education said that the board could not accept the petition because the entire problem was under study and accepting it might jeopardize both hearings on the regionalization issue and the township's own case. Meanwhile, North Brunswick parents in fairly large numbers have been keeping their 10th‐ graders at home since the open ing of school earlier this month. And a Citizens Action Group that is leading the community forces to “recapture” those 10th‐graders and perhaps all the township's high school stu dents has set Friday as the deadline for a boycott of New Brunswick High by all North Brunswick pupils. “We are fully prepared to provide first‐class education not only for our 10th‐graders now but for all of our high school grads within a reasonably short time,” said James L. Salvatore, principal of the new high school here."
Advertising: Magazine Pitch,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/19/archives/advertising-a-magazine-pitch-savings-bank-changes-its-charity.html,"It was one of those mo ments—a stirring, memorable, heart‐tugging moment that will be long remembered by all those lucky enough to have been there. Imagine the largest assem blage of magazine adver tising space salesmen ever brought together in this town, all singing their hearts out: God bless the medium It's number one We'll stand beside it And guide it Till our jobs—all our jobs— have been done. The music, of course, was “God Bless America” and flags (American flags) were flying as they sang it. Now, just because news papers are the nation's larg est advertising revenue mak ers and television the second largest is no reason maga zines can't be considered number one by these good people; they are their bread and butter, after all.

Last year for another pro gram, new depositiors were given the opportunity, instead of receiving a gift, of having the bank donate to the New York Public Library. Now the beneficiary will be the New York University Medical Cen ter.

The message was clear enough:, Despite the death of once‐great magazines and the threat of enormous postal in creases the magazine indus try is “health,” both in ad revenues and circulation. And it is healthy because it offers advertisers both selectivity and flexibility. On the subject of health, it was pointed out that even with the loss of Life, Look and The Saturday Evening Post, the three of which in 1960 accounted for a third of all ad revenues, total rev enues have increased 50 per cent since that year.

F.D.A.Will Require A Warning on Pill For ‘Morning After’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/21/archives/fda-will-require-a-warning-on-pill-for-morning-after.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 (UPI) — The Food and Drug Administration said today that it would require doctors to warn patients that the “morn ing after” birth control pill may not be safe and may trig ger side effects such as blood clotting.  Starting 60 days from now, the agency said, manufacturers of the pills will have to pro vide with it an F.D.A.‐approved pamphlet “explaining the risks and benefits of the drug.” Doc tors who prescribe the pills will have to provide their pa tients with the same informa tion. If a pregnancy occurs de spite its use, the patient will be advised to seek advice from her doctor on the possibility of an abortion because of the chance that the child, if fe male, may have cancer of the vagina or cervix. The drug involved is diethylstilbestrol — DES — the synthetic hormone that was once used to promote growth in beef cattle. The use of DES in cattle feed was banned in August, 1972. The substance is known to have caused cancer in animals used in laboratory tests, al though there has been debate about how much of it would have to be ingested to produce that effect in humans. “The agency emphasizes that it does not consider the drug safe for routine or repeated contraceptive use because of the relatively large amounts of estrogen taken over a short period of time,” the F.D.A. said. Dr. Alexander M. Schmidt, F.D.A.'s commissioner, noting that “the drugs are normally given to young, healthy wom en,” added: “There are non chemical alternatives for pre venting pregnancy. For these reasons the patient should know the options available and participate on an informed basis with her physician in the decision making.”"
Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/23/archives/the-pill-worksif-you-take-it-birth-control.html,"For the past five years American demographers have, been congratulat ing themselves on the success of con traceptive practices in this country. They point out that the population growth rate for the nation has de clined rapidly—from 1.5 per cent a year in 1962 to 0.8 per cent last year. Most of that decline has been at tributed to the mass acceptance of birth control pills, intra‐uterine devices (IUD) and voluntary sterilization.  But last week the idea that Amer icans are doing extremely well in controlling their fertility was chal lenged. A five year study has found that one‐third of all couples using contraception to avoid or delay preg nancy have children anyway. This study on the effectiveness of birth‐control practice was part of the 1970 National Fertility Study, one of the most authoritative indicators of population trends and family planning efforts in the nation. The one‐third failure rate among the 6,752 participants led Dr. Norman Ryder, a co‐director of the study, to conclude: “We have a substantial number of people in the United States using ineffective methods of contra ception or using effective methods carelessly.” He said it was “nonsense” to say that Americans were having the number of children they wanted. These findings on contraceptive ef fectiveness in no way conflict with the movement toward zero popula tion growth. In fact, the nation's birth rate is declining. But the pioneers in the family planning field—the health professionals rather than the demog raphers‐have always measured the success of birth control factors on an individual rather than a societal level. It is in this area, the study concluded, that more work needs to be done. Dr. Ryder found, for instance, that wo men who felt they wanted no more chil dren were much more diligent about birth control than women who wanted to delay having a baby. While the failure rates for the pill and the IUD were lower thin that for other meth ods, the conclusion remains that the method chosen is only as effective as the commitment to its use. Many women, for instance, have IUD's removed because they complain of cramps and heavier menstrual bleeding. Some women just cannot get used to “having something put into them.” “Women are ambivalent about preg nancy throughout most of their repro ductive lives,” two obstetricians wrote in an article entitled “Psychology of the Misuse and Rejection of Contra ception. “Psychic conflict regarding contraception is to be anticipated, as conscious and unconscious reasons for and against its use commonly exist simultaneously. This will include the conflict between wanting evidence of fertility but not wanting to have a child, a conflict which often results in pregnancy and the acquisition of an abortion.” Trends The article, which appeared two years ago in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was writ ten by two Stanford University physi cians, Eugene C. Sandberg and Ralph I. Jacobs. The pill, now used by more than eight million American women, carries with it similar problems of non acceptance, some linked to reports questioning the safety of oral contra ceptives. Most recently, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop ment reported finding more than half a dozen medical differences between women who use the pill and those who do not. The five‐year study, based on a sample of 18,000 women patients at the Kaiser‐Permanente Center in Wal nut Creek, Calif., showed that pill users had higher blood pressure, faster heart rates, higher blood sugar level and a greater tendency to form blood clots than nonusers. On the plus side, the pill users seemed to have better hearing. And those over 40 had lower blood cholesterol levels than women of the same age not taking the pill. Meanwhile, scientists are continuing to look for safer and more effective means of preventing conception. Dr. Sheldon J. Segal, vice‐president of the Population Council, outlined the following efforts: • Doctors are working on new types of IUD's with fewer side effects and lower failure rates. • Lower dosage “minipills” are being developed with the hope that the lower hormonal concentration will cause fewer side effects. In addition, weekly, monthly and yearly birth‐control pills and shots for women are under study. • The Food and Drug Administra tion has approved for study an im planted capsule of slowly released birth‐control hormones which could be changed yearly, lowering the chance of failure from forgetfulness. • Work is being done on a male “pill” which would combine progeste rone with a male sex hormone, andro gen, rendering the man infertile. • Doctors are working on a pill for women to be taken before intercourse which would change the chemical makeup of the mucous in the cervix, so that sperm could not fertilize an egg. Scientists are even looking for a vaccine against pregnancy by taking one molecule of the hormone in wo men which supports pregnancy. By injecting this molecule they hope the body will build up an antibody against the hormone so that if pregnancy oc curred, the supporting hormone could not be developed in the body and the pregnancy would naturally abort."
Jackson On the Offense,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/23/archives/jackson-on-the-offense-in-the-nation.html,"WASHINGTON—At a Cook County political dinner last spring, Mayor Daley of Chicago, in fine oratorical fettle himself, introduced the evening's speaker, Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington. Closing with a Daley esque flourish, the Mayor declared: “And with God's help, Scoop Jack son will lead this nation in 1960!” This small setback in time is about the only setback Senator Jackson has suffered since the early 1972 prima ries, in which he made a generally poor showing. But anyone who thinks that experience took him out of the running for 1976 had better look again. The fact is that Scoop Jackson is running hard and may have more going for him right now than any other Democratic aspirant. He is en thusiastically supported by Mayor Daley and George Meany, those in destructible twin terrors of Demo cratic politics. Try as he might, Rob ert Strauss, the Democratic National Chairman and money‐raiser, can't quite hide the fact that he's a Jackson man, too. But it is not just that kind of pow erful backing—which in years gone by could almost have clinched a nom ination—that makes Mr. Jackson for midable. Important issues are break ing his way, too—first and foremost, the plight of Soviet Jews and in tellectuals. The so‐called Jackson amendment to the pending trade bill would deny most‐favored‐nation status and trade credits to the Soviet Union if it main tains restrictive emigration policies for Jews. His introduction of it has turned out to be a publicity and po litical bonanza for Mr. Jackson, and is reported to have won him wide support among Jews, particularly wealthy contributors, and even among some liberals not otherwise attracted to his positions. IN THE NATION ‘Scoop Jackson poses the Democratic dilemma ...’ These include notably a tough stance on defense policies, particularly on maintaining nuclear strength against the Soviet Union. (It's often forgot ten that President Nixon wanted Mr. Jackson for Secretary of Defense back in 1968.) He is the automatic cham pion in Congress of a strong nuclear capacity, which has several useful political consequences. It keeps him almost constantly in the headlines; just this week, he was calling attention to new Soviet silo technology, which he said gave the Soviets an advantage in nuclear pay loads. Calling for American military strength is still good politics with lot of Americans unpersuaded of Soviet good intentions. And it pro duces important support in the aero space industry, as well as a continu ing feedback of information from the Pentagon. Mr. Jackson, the chairman of the Interior Committee, also has got him self well out front on the “energy crisis.” As far back as 1972 he brought out a constitutional amendment that would effectively ban busing for pur poses of racial balance, while easing the burden of supporting schools through local property taxes; but he does not have the ugly racist back ground that George Wallace can never shake. Even Mr. Jackson's 1972 experience is not a total liability. Running for President is a difficult matter for any one, and presumably he learned a lot his first time out. He can always say, moreover, that the McGovern debacle shows that the party had better swing back toward Mayor Daley, George Meany and Scoop Jackson, making sure there can be no more “Amnesty, Acid and Abortion” slogans and no more calls for $30‐billion cuts in the defense budget. So the Jackson candidacy is swing ing along in fine style and the Wash ington Senator can appear at the next Democratic convention with a strong bloc of delegates. If the more liberal candidates are still fighting among themselves, it is at least conceivable that he could be the Democratic nominee. But that is not really likely; unless the party beats a drastic retreat from the delegate‐selection rules of 1972, which would be difficult, the 1976 convention is not going to be too dif ferent from the Miami Beach gather ing of 1972. If that is true, it is hard to see such a convention nominating a Daley‐Meany candidate who talks tough on busing and nuclear arma ments. Scoop Jackson, in fact, poses the Democratic dilemma—unchanged by Watergate—rather precisely. His nom ination would infuriate and alienate the still‐powerful elements that nomi nated George McGovern; but Mr. Jackson's impressive support is dead set against anything even resembling the McGovern candidacy of 1972. That is a built‐in formula for disunity and defeat, and the most often prescribed remedy—the nomination of Edward Kennedy as party unifier—only poses another, possibly more difficult, set of problems."
A Business Summit by San Francisco Bay,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/23/archives/a-business-summit-by-san-francisco-bay-a-business-summit-by-the-bay.html,"SAN FRANCISCO—A sizable chunk of the world's corporate wealth was represented last week in San Francisco. While the public meeting was laced with discussions of the epochal responsibili ties of the multinational corporation, champagne flowed freely from fountains at private parties and rented Cadillac limousines filled the streets around Nob Hill. The occasion was the quadrennial International Industrial Conference, co sponsored by the Stanford Research Institute and the Conference Board. This meeting is unique in the annals of the business world. As Antoine Riboud, president of the French glassmaker Boussois Spuchon Neuvesel, put it, “You can see more presidents and chairmen per square foot here than anywhere else in the world.” Mr. Riboud, who a few years ago made an unsuccessful bid to take over Saint Gobain, made this remark as he was waiting in the lobby of the Mark Hopkins Hotel for a 6 P.M. appointment with Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, the im perious, 38‐year‐old president of A. B. Volvo, the Swedish automaker. Mr. Gyllenhammar, who only the week be fore had announced that Volvo would open an assembly plant in Virginia, had four different persons waiting to see him at 6 P.M. It was the kind of meeting where presidents did wait to see presidents and where much of the “business” was con ducted at a series of private social gatherings during the week. It was the kind of meeting where a reporter found himself at the newsstand of the Fair mont Hotel flanked on one side by Henry Ford 2d, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, and on the other side by John H. Loudon, chairman of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company. The specially invited participants numbered more than 600, and they came from 75 countries. Nearly all were chief executive officers of major companies. No. 2 men are not generally welcome at the International Industrial Conference. It is designed to serve as a free ex change of ideas among world business leaders. No formal resolutions are made at the conference. The proceedings are not taped. No post‐conference reports are made to the delegates. The chairmen and presidents are supposed to gain their own impressions and make their own deals. In keeping with this character, the chief executive officers were not ac companied by public relations retinues. They came instead with their wives and, in some cases, with their children as well. The social calendar of the seven‐day meeting was full, beginning with a Sunday afternoon reception held by Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Kaiser of Kaiser Center in Oakland. The social week wound up with a Saturday morning visit to Fioli, the suburban home of Mrs. William P. Roth of the Matson shipping family. On Tuesday evening 65 socially prominent Bay area families opened their homes for private dinner parties, all arranged by the conference sponsors. In his novel, “The Billion Dollar Sure Thing,” Paul E. Erdman fashioned a plot in which an assault on the dollar is launched on the basis of a Swiss bank er's noticing two international financial leaders dining together at the Savoy Grill in London. Dozens of similar plots could have been inspired by, last week's scene in San Francisco, attended by captains of industry from around the world, heads of the largest banks in the world and such government leaders as Hel mut Schmidt, West Ger many's Finance Minister, and Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Re sources. Carey Cadillac and other limousine‐renting agencies in San Francisco reported they were sold out. They began taking orders for chauffeured cars two months ago, and they pulled in Cadillacs from other cities to meet the de mand from the conference delegates. Security was tight at the conference, and there were guards at all doorways. While Akio Morita, president of the Sony Corporation, and his wife were attending one of the dinner parties, how ever, thieves broke into their Fairmont Hotel suite and stole $37,000 worth of jewelry. Not all the luminaries who traveled to “Baghdad on the Bay” were highly visible. But their absence from public functions did not mean the dignitaries were not minding the store. Multinational com panies operate throughout the world, and this confer ence presents an unparal leled opportunity for the heads of world corporations to meet privately with their peers and national business leaders with whom they are already doing business — or hope to. Weldon B. Gibson, execu tive vice president of the Stanford Research Institute, comments that many times on his trips around the world a businessman will say to him something like, “You see that new petroleum refinery we have—that all started at the I.I.C.” One of the delegates who were here in a quiet fashion was David Rockefeller, chair man of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Mr. Rockefeller and his wife were staying at the Fair mont but did not attend many of the conference functions. They were not seen at the most spectacular reception of the week, a lavish predinner cocktail party held in the grand ball room of the Fairmont on Monday evening by First Na tional City, Chase's big New York rival. It was here that fountains disgorged champagne, a string band played senti mental Broadway show tunes and delegates wound their way through a reception line for nearly two hours. It was a triumphant mo ment for Walter B. Wriston, the Citibank chairman. More than any other figure at this conference, he held the cen ter stage. Coming into the headquar ters city of the world's larg est bank, the Bank of America (whose president, A. W. Clausen, was active in the conference), Mr. Wriston ar rived flush from having his picture on the cover of Busi ness Week. He had been singled out by the magazine as having turned his com pany into a financial institu tion unmatched “anywhere in the world.” Mr. Wriston delivered one of the keynote addresses at the opening session of the conference, and it was a scholarly talk that set the tone for the entire meeting. He treated his sophisti cated audience to a thumbnail history of the evolution of business and society, casting the multinational corporation as a logical extension of the “business tradition that grew out of capitalism and the in dustrial revolution.” Today's world corpora tions, Mr. Wriston said, represent “agents of change,” and that is why they “are so profoundly disturbing” to so many governments that “would like to turn the clock back to the mercantile era.” The Conference Board dis closed a new study showing that in the last decade gross national products have grown faster in the developing na tions than in the developed countries (5.9 per cent against 4.9 per cent). How ever, many delegates here were concerned that popula tion growth would erode these gains. Roberto T. Villeneuve, president of the Trans Philli pines Investment Corpora tion, introduced himself as coming from a country (the Philippines) where popula tion, increasing at the rate of 3.4 per cent a year, “ap pears to be our fastest‐grow ing industry at the present time.” J. Phillip Wogamas, dean of the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C., defended birth control as a moral practice. The Conference Board study estimated that the population of China would reach 965 million by 1985, up from the current 750 million. Han Suyin, the author and lecturer, who was unable to be present because of illness reported in a paper prepared for the conference that China is now engaged in a massive effort to slow the birth rate. She shaid that this effort in cludes a nationwide educa tion campaign, a policy of encouraging later marriages, abortion on demand, vasec tomies and sterilization of women. In the Peking area, she said, the birth rate was 43.4 per 1,000 in 1962. It had de clined to 17.8 per thousand by 1972. Dr. Suyin predicted that China's planners would be able over the next decade to bring the annual popula tion growth down to about 1.2 per cent. Outside last week's cock tail and dinner party circuit, in the public sessions of the international Industrial Con ference, the two dominant themes were the role of the multinational corporation and the social responsibilities of business. Speakers made note of polls showing in creasing public distrust of business. There were many exhorta tions about the need for busi ness to he socially responsive —enough for Charles W. Robinson, president of the Marcona Corporation, to de scribe the conference as the “San Francisco version of Watergate” where “we con fess all our sins.” He and others at the conference urged businessmen to estab lish new codes of conduct. A vociferous exponent of this idea turned out to be G. William Miller, president of Textron, Inc., who conducted a panel on “Management Response to Changing Values.” Mr. Miller, replying to a question from the floor, as serted that there were good reasons for the growing lack of public confidence, in busi ness. “Our standard of conduct has been atrocious,” he said, citing a lack of honesty and integrity. “We shoudn't de fend bad practices,” Mr. Miller added. “A Jot of the public believe businessmen are crooks — and some of them are.” These remarks didn't sit too well with Sir Ernest Woodroofe, chairman of what may have been the world's first conglomerate, Unilever, Ltd. He emerged from the session complaining to Fred erick J. Philips, chairman of N. V. Philips, the Dutch elec tronics giant, that “we're be ing too self‐denigrating.” The Unilever chairman got his chance the follow ing day when he delivered an address defending the con tributions of the multina tional corporation. Sir Ernest touched on a gore spot that was festering at this con ference—namely, that the de veloping countries look upon the foreign investor as a mixed blessing. A number of delegates from developing countries made the point here that their national interests do not always coincide with the global interests of the multi national corporation. The frustration of the multina tional corporation was sum med up by Sir Ernest:. “We find ourselves both cajoled and reviled and accused of rape by those who are try ing to seduce us.” This was the first Interna tional Industrial Conference in which there was repre sentation from the countries of Eastern Europe, a reflec tion of expanded East‐West trade. Their presence was symbolized by the appear ance on the program of J. M. Gvishiani, deputy chair man of the Soviet Union's Council of Ministers for Science and Technology and a son‐in‐law of Premier Aleksei Kosygin. It was clear, from a talk by Dr. Gvishiani, that the Soviet leader had spent some time boning up on the debate in American business circles over social responsibility. Dr. Gvishiani noted that there are different views in the United States on the role of business in society. He as sociated himself strongly with the opinions held by Arjay Miller dean of the graduate business school a Stanford, whom he quoted as follows: “The central fact of busi ness today is that we are in a new ball game. We cannot return to the old, familiar ground rules. Life would be so much simpler if our only task and our only responsi bility was the narrow pursuit of profit.” Dr. Gvishiani remarked, “I don't think Mr. Miller is an outsider in the American so ciety.” Mr. Miller, a former president of the Ford Motor Company, did not receive an invitation to this high‐level fleeting."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/23/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-moscow-2-a-message-for-us-the-oil-nations.html,"To the Editor: The Administration's attitude, pro fessedly for raisons d'état, toward the Russian dissidents' cause should come as no surprise. It is totally in accord with its domestic behavior.  After all, if these two nattering nabobs of negativism were citizens of our Republic, no doubt Professor Sak harov's telephone would be tapped by Dr. Kissinger and Solzhenitsyn's psychiatric files. rummaged by the plumbers. so that Mr. Colson might “nail” him. I suspect that the Assistant State Procurator who told Sakharov that Nixon would eventually wiggle out of the whole Watergate mess has done the sharpest political analysis of the season. He just looked at the affair as if it were happening to his own kind, and all the rest followed. The only difference is the barely conceivable possibility that here an angry and aroused citizenry will re member the moral values out of which the democracies of England, France and America were fashioned. Public indifference, reflecting the absence of any sense of right, wrong and retri bution, is what the Nixons, Kissingers and Connallys are counting on for vindication. Iii that case, the retribu tion will surely fall upon this Repub lic, fort (as Machiavelli wrote in his “Discourses”) “where corruption has penetrated the people, the best laws are of no avail.” Doubtless, sooner or later, the Krem lin will crush the Sakharovs and Sol zhenitsyns as it crushed the Czechs. It is too dangerous tci be a brave and outspoken man over there, and the state makes them pay the price. But the real challenge that the Moscow Two are meanwhile throwing up to us is this: Can we, in a society where there isn't any penalty involved in standing up for truth and liberty, produce enough good men who can say, “No more”? Can we bring forth politicians who will rally the nation with a sense of moral purpose? Can we have artists, teachers, writers and intellectuals who are concerned with—and can tell the difference between—right and wrong? Can we all be honest and tough minded citizens not too far sunk in materialistic torpor to save the coun try before it loses its way forever? Or are we going to perish because it's too easy to take the safe and lazy way? This is a country where no one has recently had to pay with his life for witnessing the truth. (Except, maybe, Martin Luther King, who was black and so a good cause, and who anyway had fuzzy, old‐fashioned preacherish ideas.) We all find it too easy to be on the side of virtue when both vil lain and victim are on the other side of the earth, and too convenient to be relativistic about evil when it's right here at home. If Nixon, wearing the Halloween false face of a strongman, is allowed to get away with flouting the law and no one challenges and stops him out of principle (and not out of expedient tactics), then the methods of the White House will become the accepted and standard procedure of his suc cessors. And then, perhaps too late, we'll find out what Solzhenitsyn and Sak harov are talking about. Spring Valley, N. Y., Sept. 17, 1973 The Oil Nations' Trump To the Editor: Juan de Onis's comments [Week in Review Sept. 9] on Libya's present bargaining strength are perceptive. However, a subtle key variable in the Libyan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabian situations is omitted in de Onis's as sessment as well as in the observa tions of others on the use of oil for political leverage purposes in the Mid dle East. The forgotten factor can be simply put: Because of their population sizes and the volume of their daily produc tion, Libya, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia can halve their present daily produc tion of oil and stillremain super affluent. Given the present demand for oil, the prospective increase in the de mand for oil, the tightness of the O.P.E.C. organization, the improbabil ity of filling the oil gap in the near future through alternative sources of energy, these exceptional economies, as I have called them, will continue for some time to enjoy exceptional bargaining strength. What is remarkable is that the oil companies never seemed to have an ticipated or prepared for this kind of unique bargaining situation. Yet it was easy to anticipate, regardless of the state of Middle East politics, just as the exceptional economies have to anticipate counteractive economic steps on the part of the importing countries to improve, if possible, their own bar gaining power. The situation will obvi ously continue to be indeterminate for a long time to come. RAW LE FARLEY Professor of Economics State University of New York College at Brockport Brockport, N. Y., Sept. 12, 1973 A Ride for 10,000 Neros To the Editor: The disintegration of the once‐superb passenger railroad service in the North east Corridor is coming more and more to symbolize the decline of American civilization. Hardly anyone disagrees that good passenger service is essential if we are to control pollution, meet the fuel crisis, stop profligate overconsumption of natural resources and slow the de spoliation of open space. Few would argue the point that good passenger service is essential to our economy, will help save our cities, attract more users (and revenues) at home and from abroad and improve the quality of life daily for millions of nonriders as well as riders. Yet for much of our lives we have endured increasing shortages, filth, delays, cutbacks in schedules, break downs of equipment, incompetence and accidents we expect to find in only the most retarded of countries. All the while, ten thousand Nerds in the guise of Federal and state offi cials, bureaucrats regulators, Con gressmen and Senators, municipal politicians, union leaders, railroad ex ecutives, highway lobbyists, finan ciers, lawyers and assorted experts fiddle and scratch and jawbone away the years. These do‐nothings should all be required to ride the railroads every day, and perhaps then we would see a little action. STOWE C. PHELPS New York, Sept. 11, 1973 • On ‘Feeding’ Mr. Agnew To the Editor: In your Sept. 14 issue you reported that for years Mr. Agnew was supplied with food packages by Joseph H. Rash, vice president of Food Fair Stores, Inc. Can it be found out whether or not Mr. Rash as the donor paid for these food packages or whether they were financed out of the pockets of the shareholders? I have Food Fair stock and lost heavily on it, and I am not willing to feed Mr. Agnew. If the salary we pay Mr. Agnew does not support him, he should resign and apply for welfare and food stamps. He may find that he is better off—and we would not miss him. HENRY W. ROEHRIG River Edge, N. J., Sept. 17, 1973 On ‘Hounding’ Mr. Nixen To the Editor: Most thinking people in Britain are very bored with your Watergate af fair, and with seeing the posturings of Senator Sam Ervin on our TV screens, but what we can't understand is why your people crucify your President so. To us it savors of the very unsavory McCarthy era. The President of the United States is undoubtedly the most powerful and the most influential man in the whole world, and from what we over here read of his record, I think he has done more for the peace of the world than most Presidents in your history. To us the Watergate affair seems so trivial, and even if Mr. Nixon was cognizant of the facts, the whole af fair is petty and is just being used as a means of hounding the President. When will the people of the United States realize that your country and the man who presides over it are being belittled everywhere, to the conse quent hurt of the Free World. Will the political opponents of Mr. Nixon not be content until they have brought him down and discredited him? The whole affair is on a par with our “Zinoviev” letter of the late nineteen twenties, and in retrospect will seem as stupid. Finally, while I have no brief for either side, I think Mr. Nixon is con ducting himself and his office with great dignity. ROBERT F. KELSEY Strathaven, Lanarkshire, Scotland Sept. 2, 1973 • The Rise and Fall of Allende To the Editor: Repeated references to the Allende Government as the “first democrati cally elected Marxist regime in the Western Hemisphere” should not be permitted to obscure the fact that Allende was appointed by the Chilean Congress acting under the threat of bloody civil war, leveled by Allende's supporters and Allende personally. Allende had nowhere near a major ity. Two other candidates with 33 per cent and 27 per cent of the vote, re spectively, had nearly as many votes and would have been more popular choices. The constitution also allowed for a run‐off election between the two strongest candidates; an election Al lende would have lost. Such an out come would have been more “demo cratic” than appointing a minority candidate so distant in his outlook from the majority. Congress was controlled by anti. Marxist parties, yet it appointed Dr. Allende. Compare that with the way our Republican‐controlled Congress dealt with the Hayes‐Tilden dispute. Clearly, the Chilean Congress acted under duress. The violent demise of this demogogic regime recalls the aphorism: “Those who live by the sword shall perish by it.” HERBERT DIENSTAG New York, Sept. 14, 1973 • What Professors Do To the Editor: Leonard A. Kirsch “suspects” that academic people work less than other professionals and, rather than trou bling to discover the facts, commu nicates his suspicions to the public [letter Sept. 16]. If he had asked someone who knows or had looked at one of those occasional legislative or administrative inquiries that set out to demonstrate Mr. Kirsch's point and invariably prove the opposite, he would have found that the standard academic work week is around sixty hours, winter and summer, and longer hours than that are not uncommon. Nine hours of teaching a week the maximum that can be kept in any kind of balance with other forms of communication with students, depart mental and administrative responsibili ties, and new learning and scholarship; in a properly financed educational world, six would be more like it. The increasing pressure of work falling upon faculty these days (along with static or declining real income) is bound to damage educational quality. I find that, on average, it takes me about seven months to prepare a new one‐semester course, and that is only so I feel I can show my face in the classroom. If I repeat the course, far from leaving it “unchanged,” I must restudy the subject, examine the re cent work of others, gauge student response to improve effectiveness, etc. This is the normal procedure; the fabled professor lecturing for decades from the same yellowing notes is an anachronism. As for those vacations Mr. Kirsch so envies us, they are the only time we have for sustained preparation, study and writing. The academic may be the only worker in our society whose reaction to the onset of a vacation is: “Now I can work.” (Prof.) JEFFREY L. SAMMONS Chairman, Germanic Languages Yale University New Haven, Sept. 16, 1973 • A Question for Humanists To the Editor: Edwin H. Wilson mentions “the paucity of real evidence in support of revelation and supernaturalism” in his Sept. 15 letter. However, he does not produce any real evidence to show the reasons for the humanists' support in Humanist Manifesto II of eutha nasia, abortion, divorce and freedom to commit suicide. Apparently, these things are justi fied when the “quality of individual life” does not measure up to the standards laid down by the 120 dis tinguished “humanistic” authors of Manifesto II. Might not these gentle men and ladies examine the quality of life of the handicapped, mental defec tives, prisoners and political dissent ers? And where do we go from here? SIDNEY SAMENT.

C. B. S. Head to Speak Out on TV's Rights',https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/26/archives/c-b-s-head-to-speak-out-on-tvs-rights.html,"Arthur R. Taylor, president of the Columbia Broadcasting System said yesterday he planned to speak out this fall on television's rights under the First Amendment, on TV's re sponsibility to the public and on “what dangers we see in Government regulation.”  “I elected in my first year to remain silent,” said Mr. Taylor, who has been president of C.B.S. since July, 1972. He did not spell out what issues he would deal with in his speeches but hinted that he would be stepping forward as a defender of television and the press against the kind of attacks made in the past by Nixon Ad ministration spokesmen. In an interview with report ers and editors of The New York Times, Mr. Taylor also made the following points: C.B.S. intends to be “No. 1” among corporations in upgrad ing the status of women em ployes and will soon release a specific timetable and affirma tive action program in that area. ¶C.B.s. feels that it got better union contract 11 months ago with the National Association of Broadcast Em ployes and Technicians than the National Broadcasting Com pany got this past weekend. ¶Advertisers who withdrew sponsorship from the delayed C.B.S. airing of the play “Sticks and Bones” last month and from the “Maude” abortion epi sodes “made a mistake” and will eventually “come around” on such controversial broad casts. ¶A team oi 10 auditors, about 8 lawyers and various corporate officials is still going through Columbia Records files in the company's private inter nal investigation into payola. In discussing freedom of the press, Mr. Taylor said that, as a result of Watergate scandal and the problems of Vice Presi dent Agnew, “my guess is the very harsh criticism that the Nixon Administration has meted out ... will be quite bit muted from now on.” He added, however, that he did not think television and press spokesmen “should fire the First‐Amendment cannon at every battle.” Mr. Taylor defended the C.B.S. decision to discontinue “instant analysis” of major Presidential policy speeches on the grounds that television commentators often “did it badly.” He said Eric Sevareid and “other senior correspond ents” at C.B.S. had been in favor of dropping the “instant analyses.” On the payola issue, Mr. Taylor said that if Columbia's internal investigation found any evidence of corruption, it would be turned over to the Justice Department. He said he did not know if the results of the investigation would be released to the press, which, he complained, had made Columbia “look particu lary bad” in its stories detail ing the fact that a Newark grand jury is looking into al legations of payoffs from some record companies to disk jockeys."
Advertising: Latest Rallying Cry,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/26/archives/a-advertising-latest-rallying-cry-harvester-to-end-deal-with-young.html,"There is a new rallying cry abroad in the land, still so faint that it is barely audible, but it goes like this:  “Advertising power to the people.” It can be heard in San Francisco and Los Angeles and Washington. It can al most be heard here. And it comes from a small, but growing, number of people who believe that the strengths of the communications form should aid not only the rich marketer and the popular cause, but also the contro versial cause. The San Francisco outpost —Public Interest Communi cations—is headed by King Harris, by all outward ap pearances a stalwart member of the establishment. But, then, that's what one expects a retired executive vice president of Campbell Ewald to look like. But you don't expect him to be in volved for Cesar Chavez's Farm Workers Union, the Wounded Knee Legal Defense Fund or for anti‐utility com pany or pro‐abortion efforts. But that's just the kind of work he and Jerry Mender, the West Coast ad man, are doing or planning to do—help the promotion and fund‐rais ing efforts of organizations that are just too hot to han dle for regular agencies or for the Advertising Council. Public Interest Communica tions, which has six full‐time workers, gets its operating capital from donations by in dividuals and foundations. That's what brought Mr. Har ris to the East a couple of weeks ago—he was doing the foundations circuit. “There are those who have the money to advertise and there are those that have something to say,” said Mr. Harris, making an interesting distinction. Most of his organization's work is for the print media, but in Los Angeles the Public Advertising Council, founded by Marvin Segelman, a for mer high school teacher, creates for all media. It has, in fact, done a number of well publicized counter‐com mercials. Surprisingly, even though this firm offers a free service in a town renowned for some wild‐eyed groups, Mr. Segel man can say, “We've never had the problem of being Because of “conflicting product activity,” the Inter national Harvester Company will end a 25‐year relation ship with Young & Rubicam Dec. 31.

Here in New York, John A. Zeigler has been long plan ning — but has yet to acti vate — a group called Speak Out! Its purpose will be to conduct workshops to teach the techniques of advertising to the silent minorities. Two Missionaries The speakers bureau of the New York Council of the American Association of Ad vertising Agencies sent its first two missionaries out yesterday to convert the cyn ics. The only trouble was that they were believers business school students at Columbia. So there was very little give and take, mostly give and give. The representatives of the marketplace were Richard Gilbert, president of Gilbert, Grace & Stark, and Walter W. Bregman, president of Norman, Craig & Kummel and chairman of the New York Council. Mr. Gilbert brought along a reel of those delightful, fun‐filled commercials that serve as grist for cocktail party conversation. The stu dents received them warmly. Mr. Bregman brought along some of those N. C. & K. products that everyone seems to hate but that sell products—the White Knight, the White Tornado and even the old Silva Thins cigarettes TV spots. There was little response from the 50 or so in the audience — either good or bad. Before the noontime pro gram, Mr. Bregman said that the council was running into difficulty lining up groups to speak to.

CONGRESS WEIGHS PATIENTS' RIGHTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/28/archives/congress-weighs-patients-rights-may-protect-subjects-of-all.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 27— Despite Administration objec tions, Congress may be moving toward the creation of a na tional commission to protect the rights of human subjects of all federally supported medical research. The prospect of a commis sion with such broad responsi bilities emerged today in testi mony before the health and en vironment subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee. The subcommittee is consider ing a bill, passed earlier this month by the Senate, that would establish such a commis sion to oversee the ethical con duct of medical research done with support from the Depart ment of Health, Education and Welfare. The subcommittee chairman, Representative Paul G. Rogers, Democrat of Florida, said to day that it might be necessary to broaden the scope of the commission to cover all other departments and agencies of the Federal Government. Wider Scope Suggested Indeed, Mr. Rogers sug gested that the commission might even take on responsi bilities concerning research that has no Federal sponsorship. “I am not convinced,” he said, “that in trying to write into law the proper ethical protocols for experimentation we can limit ourselves to one area, that being the Depart ment of Health, Education and Welfare. Nor am I convinced that when addressing the ques tion of ethics we can limit our concern to projects or programs which are federally funded.” Testifying before the House subcommittee today, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chief architect of the Senate bill, said he believed that the commis sion should eventually have jurisdiction over all federally sponsored research involving human subjects. Initially, it would cover only research sponsored by H.E.W., said the Democrat from Massa chusetts, but the legislation re quires the commission to report to Congress within a year after its formation to recommend ways of expanding the jurisdiction. Other Agencies Although H.E.W. almost cer tainly sponsors the largest share of federally supported research involving human sub jects, other agencies, including the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commis sion, also have interests in medical research. Mr. Kennedy said today the intent of the legislation was to give the commission great flexibilty and wide discretion in developing policies that would protect patients without hampering the conduct of re search. He said that the com mission's policies toward re search would also be applied to medical service programs to the maximum feasible extent. Had clear‐cut ethical guide lines been in effect this year, ho suggested, they might have prevented the sterilization of two teen‐age girls in Mont gomery, Ala., in June, which was said to have been done without their informed consent or that of their parents. The Senator made public an internal report of the Office of Economic Opportunity showing that guidelines had been drawn up to cover cases of voluntary sterilization, but that these had never been distributed to O.E.O. offices throughout the country. President's Stand The report suggested the Administration did not want the guidelines made public partly because federally au thorized programs of volun tarily sterilization would seem to be in conflict with the President's expressed opposi tion to performance of abortion with Federal funds. The Senate bill that would establish the commision also covered the provision of Fed eral training grants for young medical scientists. The measure passed by a vote of 81 to 6 on Sept. 11. A some what comparable research training bill that does not call for a national commission on the rights of research patients passed the House earlier. A House‐Senate co?ference may be held as early as next week to work out a final version of the bill and deal with the provision for a national com mission. In testimony opposed to the bill today, Dr. Charles C. Ed wards, Assistant Secretary for Health in the Department of Health, Education and Wel fare, said the department was already making great progress in revising its guidelines for the ethical conduct of medical re search. He said a national commis sion would be duplicative of efforts already in progress and might even tend to create an irresponsible attitude among research workers by separat the realms of “science” and “ethics” artificially."
Trumpeter in a One‐Man Band,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/28/archives/trumpeter-in-a-oneman-band-books-of-the-times-news-of-kevin-white.html,"GOODBYE, MR. CHRISTIAN. By Richard Dougherty. 263 pages. Doubleday & Co. $7.95. Books of The Times “I don't know of any quicker way in the world to be forgotten in this country than to be defeated for President,” Will Rogers said. “A man can leave the Country, and people will always remember that he went someplace. But if he is defeated for Presi dent, they can't remember that he ever did anything.” Judging from the small freshet of books about his campaign issuing forth, however, George McGovern is clinging to a kind of literary immortality at least. Now comes Richard Dougherty, who served as Sena tor McGovern's press secretary during most of the campaign, to weigh in with his version of the story. A McGovern campaign book must perforce deal with the anatomy of a disaster, and it's as though the story of the sinking of the Titanic were written by the crew, which puts the reader into a “Rashomon” situa tion as he listens to the lulling litany: “If he'd only....” In “Goodbye, Mr. Chris tian,” Mr. Dougherty comes across as such a mensch, has such a candid eye for the humorous side of a campaign staff that sometimes resembled the early Mets in disaster proneness, that I feel he is giving us as much of the truth as he knows. When he says he descried an iceberg and ran to the captain, I believe him. News of Kevin White In a book written by a press secretary the reader expects to find some news, and there is some, though perhaps not so hard as one might like. For example, Mr. Dough erty says he thinks it was not Senator Edward M. Kennedy who vetoed the choice of Boston's Mayor Kevin White as Vice Presidential candidate—White was one of the final two remaining front‐runners; the other was Senator Thomas F. Eagleton but rather John Kenneth Galbraith, who told Senator McGovern that the Massa chusetts delegation would take a walk he chose Mayor White (who had been a Muskie supporter). Later evidence sug gested that this was news to most of the Massachusetts delegation, but no matter; Mr. White was eliminated, and that is why in the first episode of the running serial of bad luck that was the McGovern cam paign, only Tom Eagleton remained in the picture. Mr. Dougherty devotes a good chunk to the Eagleton affair. His theory is—he has no evidence—that Mr. McGovern learned from Senator Eagleton's physicians that the nervous breakdowns were much more serious than Mr. Eagleton had let on. Rather than destroy the man publicly —and perhaps privately—he kept mum and thus appeared to dither. The upshot was that Senator Eagleton dictated his own terms for being taken off the ticket, even to writing Mr. McGovern's own state ment announcing it. What is more, he emerged as a kind of hero in the eyes of a sentimental American public who hated to see this cleancut young Senator ruined. Thus Senator McGovern became the Abra ham and Senator Eagleton the Isaac of the affair—although the Biblical analogue Mr. Dougherty seems to prefer is the story of Cain and Abel. AS the candidate's press secretary, Mr. Dougherty is privileged in the matter of Senator McGovern's press relations, which he says were not the best. He attributes this partly to what he called Mr. Mc Govern's “one‐man band” psychology— his inability to heed his advisers and his penchant, bolstered by a mystical belief in his own luck appropriate to a former bomber pilot, for striking out on his own. Some Words for the Press But Mr. Dougherty is too big a man to be worried about any infringement of his own prerogatives. He liked Senator Mc Govern, was close to him, thought him of Presidential caliber. He gets almost as apoplectic about the press at times as Vice President Agnew did, especially for the running “McGovern in trouble” story that was the dominant theme after the Eagleton affair and which, he says, re sulted in the public seeing a caricature of the real Senator McGovern—although, a newspaperman himself, he does not stay mad for long. Certainly some stories hurt—the stories saying Mr. McGovern favored legalization of abortion and marijuana, that he was a Goldwater of the left, and a news‐magazine story late in the campaign, which—com plete with adjectives that Time magazine might have used in Briton Hadden's hey day—pictured Senator McGovern as a kind of religious fanatic. After all, Mr. Dough erty says, was not there sufficient evidence of rottenness in Denmark to provide an objective correlative to the increasingly moralistic tone of late McGovern? It is not difficult to understand George Mc Govern's defeat; what is hard to under stand is the sheer magnitude of it, as though the American public collectively shunned him with the alacrity of subway riders turning their backs on the blind man passing through the car. The staff prima donnaism Mr. Dougherty cheerfully de scribes in his book had something to do with it, but could another reason be that Americans feared that Senator McGovern might have been right in his charges of sin in the temple? Nobody loves a preacher —especially if there is a suspicion that he is telling the truth—and that is why the pew are so empty every Sunday."
Both Parties See Sandman In Trouble as Vote Nears,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/30/archives/both-parties-see-sandman-in-trouble-as-vote-nears-postwatergate.html,"TRENTON, Sept. 29—With New Jersey's gubernatorial election a month away, leaders of both parties agreed today that Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., the Republican candidate seeking to regenerate President Nixon's “silent majority,” was in serious political trouble. For one thing, Mr. Sandman's conservative candidacy reportedly has deeply divided the Republican party here and in this swing state, no recent statewide candidate has won without a united party behind him. For another, the Watergate scandal involving President Nixon and the kickback charges involving Vice President Agnew have robbed Mr. Sandman of the help of two major national voices he had counted on heavily. Post‐Watergate Test Still another factor is the fact that New Jersey Democrats have apparently recovered from their divisions of recent years and have united behind the candidacy of Brenclan T. Byrne, a former prosecutor and Superior Court judge. Aware that New Jersey's voting patterns tend to reflect closely the trends in national politics, leaders of both parties in Washington are watching the election here as the first major post‐Watergate test of Republican political resiliency. George Bush, the Republican national chairman, met with Mr. Sandman here last Tuesday and said afterward that “the eyes of the nation will be on New Jersey.” Robert Strauss, the Democratic national chairman, said much the same thing during a recent visit, describing the New Jersey election as the first test of voter reaction to the Watergate scandal. Virginia is the only other state with a gubernatorial election this year, and its politics are so scrambled that political analysts avoid reading national trends into voting outcomes there. As for the major issue in this campaign, Mr. Sandman, a blunt, tough‐talking, ex‐prize fighter from Cape May, has zeroed in on the income‐tax issue, pledging that New Jersey would never have such a tax while he is Governor. Mr. Sandman has also seized upon other issues, such as crime in the streets, abortion, schoolbusing, capital punishment and exclusionary zoning practices in the suburbs. On all of them, he has taken positionS aimed primarily at capturing the support of what he and his chief political adviser, F. Clifton White, have identified as the “peripheral urban ethnics”—the traditional Democratic blue‐collar workers living neighborhoods that feel threatened by encroaching blacks, skyrocketing taxes and inflation. Poles Are Cited “These people live in the fringe areas of the most rundown parts of the cities,” Mr. Sandman said in an interview at his campaign headquarters here recently. “They're hardworking and for the most part blue‐collar. They have become increasingly interested in what's happening to them, what's happening to government, what's happening to theirl tax money. “In great droves, these people are coming into the Republican party. You find it predominantly among the Polish. They're all proud hard‐working people. Almost none of them are on public assistance, even when they're out of work.” Mr. Sandman contrasts them with Southern blacks who have moved to Northern cities, such as Newark and Camden. He told a group of newspaper editors recently: “Down there, they don't give ’em food stamps. They just give ’em bus tickets to Newark.” Coalition Doubted Mr. Byrne characterized such comments the other day as out and out appeals to fear, but Mr. Sandman denies making any appeal to a white backlash. Mr. White, a highly successful political manager who helped Barry Goldwater win the Republican Presidential nomination in 1964, contends that the basic interests of the peripheral urban ethnics are no longer represented by the traditional coalition of Democrats and organized labor and that their votes will help Mr. Sandman win. His confidence is not echoed by a number of other Republican leaders who concede in private that Mr. Sandman is in political trouble. To counter the Republican ethnic effort, and to punish what it regards as one of the most regressive labor voting records in the Congress, organized labor in New Jersey is concentrating its efforts against Mr. Sandman in the same working‐class neighborhoods being plumbed by Mr. White. Parallel Is Seen Long before anyone ever heard of Watergate, New Jersey itself was riddled with allegations of political corruption, with the most recent ones Involving kickback charges against qfficials of the Republican’ administration of Governor Cahill. It was these charges that enabled Mr. Sandman to defeat Governor Cahill in the Republican gubernatorial primary election. The same charges inspired Mr. Byrne to jump into the crowded Democratic primary. Mr. Byrne won his party's nomination in June. Since then, he has succeeded in reconstituting the traditional Democratic political coalition that had been ripped apart by the antiwar movement in the nineteen‐sixties and by Senator George McGovern's Presidential campaign last year. Democratic politicians and Mr. Byrne himself offer several explanations for their swift rapprochement. One is that Mr. Sandman is perceived as an extremely conservative candidate, even by many Republicans. Retreat Is Made Another, Mr. Byrne believes, is that the magnitude of the McGovern defeat has subdued the ideological intensity of left‐wing Democrats. This has enabled him to pursue a moderate, almost right‐of‐center political course aimed at capturing as big a share of the political middle as possible. For example, Ann Klein, a member of the Assembly from Morris County, who was Mr. Byrne's most critical liberal opponent in the Democratic primary, has been silent in recent weeks, even though Mr. Byrne has‐retreated from liberal positions on a number of issues, such as tax reform and zoning. Mrs. Barbara Werber, the Bergen County Democratic chairman who was an outspoken liberal supporter of Senator McGovern, is aware of Mr. Byrne's shift to the right and conceded that it would have engendered a hostile liberal reaction in the past. Evaluation Offered “Let's just say we have matured,” Mrs. Werber remarked with a smile the other day as she joined Mr. Byrne on a campaign swing through Bergen County. Most politicians have perceived New Jersey as an essentially moderate political state that generally elects the candidate who wins the biggest share of the independent vote while keeping most of his own party's support intact. However, Mr. Nixon's twc victories have convinced many political leaders that there has been a swing to the right prompted by distrust of of poli ticians and government and the apparent failure of liberal policies of the nineteen‐sixties to deal effectively with such issues as crime in the streets. Mr. Sandman, a 51‐year‐old veteran of the State Legislature and South Jersey rural Republican politics, began attempting to harness this discontent here long before it became a vogue in national politics. His name has long been synonymous with conservative Republican politics in the state. Wide Differences Mr. Cahill, a liberal independent Republican, has announced his support of Mr. Sandman, but some Sandman supporters have charged that the Governor actually would prefer Mr. Sandman's defeat. New Jersey's other top Republican, United States Senator Clifford P. Case, has not endorsed Mr. Sandman, and Republican sources report open warfare in several big Republican county organizations over Mr. Sandman's campaign. On the major campaign isues, there are wide differences, although Mr. Byrne, apparently emboldened by liberal acquiescence, has increasingly leaned toward a more conservative position every time Mr. Sandman has attempted to make a clear distinction between them. On the income tax, Mr. Byrne was helped—perhaps deliberately—by Governor Cahill's announcement of a $200‐million state‐budget surplus, thus allowing Mr. Byrne to say that next year's budget could be balanced without imposing an income tax. Reservation Expressed On capital punishment, Mr. Sandman strongly advocates its restoration. He told a recent legislative hearing that he had no strong reservations against public executions. Mr. Byrne, who sent 19 men to the deathhouse when he was the Essex County Prosecutor, does not advocate capital punishment. But he said he would “if it saved the life of only one police officer.” He also says he would sign a restoration bill if urged by study commission and a constitutional measure were approved by the Legislature. Both candidates are Roman Catholics with large families and are morally opposed to abortions. However, Mr. Sandman contends he is more opposed to abortions than Mr. Byrne because Mr. Byrne refuses to support a constitutional amendment that would outlaw them. Busing Is Opposed Nothing in New Jersey politics has the capacity to engender more anger, fear and racial animosity than the school‐busing issue. Candidates who have tried to exploit it in the past have done so at their peril. However, political leaders were not surprised two weeks ago when Mr. Sandman seized the issue, proclaiming his opposition to forced regional school consolidations and the mandatory busing they involve. However, a clear‐cut distinction was denied Mr. Sandman again when Mr. Byrne said that he too was opposed to forced busing, although he deplored its injection into the campaign. In other words, some Democratic leaders say that Mr. Byrne is practicing what they call “selective liberalism”—taking moderate noncontroversial positions on issues that provoke strong passions while holding onto traditional liberal positions on less volatile issues such as election reform and environmental protection. Contract Is Drawn On the stump, Mr. Sandman is a seasoned campaigner. Newsmen like him because he is direct and enjoys a reputation for shooting from the hip, a proclivity that Mr. White is striving hard to arrest. In contrast, the 49‐year‐old Mr. Byrne has never run for office. During the early weeks of the campaign, he tended to be wooden before audiences. Some of his own supporters were prepared to concede he was “a political stiff.” However, in recent weeks a change has been shown. For example, leaders of an International Ladies Garment Workers Union local compared Mr. Byrne's appearance at Holly Stores, an apparel distribution center in North Bergen, last Monday with the early days of the late Robert F. Kennedy in New York. Slim, ruggedly handsome, with piercing, deepset eyes, Mr.Byrne is showing new ease. He takes off his coat, meets people easily and has an ingenuous, self‐deprecating manner. Mr. Byrne never learned to speak fluent Spanish at Princeton or at the Harvard Law School. But this did not stop him from wading easily through hundreds of Spanish‐speaking workers, fracturing their language, shaking their hands. Although the campaign has been officially under way for some time, little fire and excitement is expected until the last three weeks of the election. By then the World Series will be over and the apathy that invariably grips the early stages of most elections here will most likely have dissipated."
Feminist Coalition Planning Workshops,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/30/archives/feminist-coalition-planning-workshops-discovering-goals-harmony.html,"A communications network and men‐women workshops are being planned by the Long Island Feminist Coalition, which recently brought together a variety of women's groups seeking to unify and coordinate activities. Mrs. Lynn Libros of Ronkonkoma, who will become the coalition coordinator on Nov. 3, said a convocation is tentatively scheduled for “around Easter” to present workshops and discussions open to both men and women. We have to get rid of the myth,” Mrs. Libros said. “Some people think if you're involved with a woman's group you are going to go out and burn your bra and others think that the only women involved are women who can't get husbands. We've got to take out all the myths so that men can come and see that we put our shoes on one at a time just like they do.” The input at coalition meetings, she said, will help correlate information and avoid overlapping projects. Also to be decided ds how the groups will celebrate the 54th anniversary of woman suffrage next Aug. 26. Unlike comparable groups in New York City, the Long Island coalition has no “stars.” Mrs. Libros describes herself as “only a woman who got interested in the movement,” and each representative, like Mrs. Betty Schlein of Merrick, president of the Long Island National Organization of Women, stresses her role as only a representative. “There is no ‘No. 1',” Mrs. Schlein said. “The coalition is another step in the codevelopment of the feminist movement. Each group has its own priorities and its own profile. The coalition is a move toward solidarity end unity among women. Our individual voices will become stronger with it.” Harmony Stressed And also unlike the urban disputes between some factions and the small but vocal lesbian contingent, Long Island's much smaller but emerging lesbian group seemingly has been accepted without much fanfare. “We are not a separatist group,” said a spokeswoman for the Lesbian Feminist Collective. “We've been warmly received and both gays and straights come to our workshops and socials.” Harmony among all women's groups and communication to avoid duplication of efforts are prime objectives of the coalition. “Previously, one group would have a rally one day and two days later, or even on the same day, another, group will have a rally,” Mrs. Libros said. “You can't get much support if two are being held at the same time. “From what I understand, several groups decided to go to Albany on the abortion issue. Two groups had buses they couldn't fill. If they had gotten together, one bus could have been used for both groups. “Or, say, one group wants to conduct a self‐help clinic and it gets all the key people, while another group wants to set up the same thing without knowing about the other.” Discovering Goals Mrs. Yves LeMay, who teaches a course entitled “Women and Society” at Plainview High School and works both in the National, Organization of Women and on the steering committee of the Women's Liberation Center of Nassau County in Hempstead, said: “I think the coalition will help us find our goals. “Each group will send one or two elected delegates to the coalition meeting each month or so, or to an emergency meeting if necessary. They will report back to their own groups. Then every group can decide what it wants to do. It will help us as a communication network on every issue of mutual concern and we will be united if there is some kind of action we want to take.” Because the coalition is loosely structured, the number of members in participating groups is not readily available. According to Mrs., Schlein, the Nassau chapter of NOW “probably has about 400 members,” but she said she could not estimate the membership of Suffolk NOW and South Shore NOW. “The coalition possibly involves 2,000 or 3,000 women,” she added. In addition to the three NOW chapters, other women's groups participating in the coalition, Mrs. LeMay said, include women centers in Islip, Hempstead, Stony Brook and Huntington; the Suffolk Women's Political Caucus; the Nassau Women's Political Caucus, the United Feminist Organization at Dowling College; the Adeiphi Women's Rights Committee; the Hofstra University Women's Center; the Hofstra Organization for Women; the Organization for Women Professionals at Hofstra, the South Fork Women's Center and Women Honor Women in East Hampton.

"For the mentally ill, a court of last resort",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/30/archives/the-psyche-and-the-surgeon-for-the-mentally-ill-a-court-of-last.html,"At 18, Julia stabbed an unknown girl who jostled her, arm in a movie theater. Months later, she nearly killed a nurse in a mental hospital in a fit of rage over a minor incident. By the time she was referred by a psychiatrist to Dr. Vernon Mark, head of neurosurgery at Boston City Hospital, Julia was 21—a comely, musically inclined woman with a record of a dozen unprovoked assaults on acquaintances and strangers. This much Dr. Mark knew: As an infant, Julia had suffered a severe attack of encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Several years later, she began to have epileptic seizures, including convulsions. Psychotherapy, drug therapy and electroshock treatments had been tried over the years, to no avail. As a last resort, Julia had been referred to Dr. Mark, one of the nation's leading experts a demanding and ever‐more‐controversial specialty, psychosurgery. He performs operations on the brain, not only to remove diseased tissue, but alleviate neurotic and psychotic symptoms —in short, to alter human behavior. Initial examinations of Julia showed, not surprisingly, that she had brain wave patterns typical of an epileptic. But a special, newly developed X‐ray technique disclosed a physical abnormality, a shrinkage of a portion of the brain in the vicinity of the amygdala, which has been described as the seat of the emotions. Through tiny holes drilled Julia's skull, Mark implanted electrodes in her brain. The hairlike wires made it possible to continuously monitor electrical signals from her brain and to send bursts of stimulating current into the amygdala. Moreover, the process could be remotely controlled, so that Julia could move freely about her room in the hospital and could be observed from a position out of her sight. Julia was seated quietly one day, playing a guitar, when suddenly the monitoring equipment picked up electrical activity from her brain typical of the onset of an epileptic seizure. Julia did not, however, go into convulsions. Instead, she bared her teeth, her face contorted in anger and she smashed the guitar to bits against the wall. Scientists had previously known that fits of uncontrollable rage sometimes accompanied certain forms of epilepsy, but this was the first time that the connection between disease and violent behavior had been experimentally demonstrated. Later, by electrically stimulating the amygdala, Mark was able to reproduce the same symptoms. With the assent of Julia's parents, Mark proceeded to surgically remove a section of her right amygdala — guided by the results of the electric stimulation tests. In the traditional sense, the operation was far from an unqualified success. Much like psychosurgical operations in general, it could not cure Julia's underlying psychosis; the most Mark could hope for was a beneficial alteration of her behavior patterns. And indeed, Mark says, Julia has had fewer epileptic seizures, and no uncontrollable rage episodes, in the five years since. She still exhibits abnormal anger occasionally, but she is no longer institutionalized—she can live at home, she sings in a church choir and she recently passed her high‐school equivalency exam. The treatment of Julia had its dramatic aspects, but none to match the uproar that followed in its wake. The case has become a cause célèbre, a focal point for the attacks of the critics of psychosurgery. Mark has been accused of changing Julia irrevocably into a “vegetable” who leads a wasted life. Some have described him as being a Clockwork Orange type who carries his patients screaming to surgery, who seeks to develop psychosurgery as a dehumanizing and dictatorial instrument for pacifying and controlling man's mind. Recently, radical students picketed his hospital during a symposium on psychosurgery. They carried placards with such messages as: “Psychosurgery is Mutilation.” “Stop Pithing [a reference to the procedure whereby frogs are paralyzed by running long pins or wires through their nervous system].” Frank Ervin, a psychiatrist who was co‐author of the book “Violence and the Brain” with Mark, was the object of a similar outburst at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he has been seeking to set up a center for the study of violence. The book, published in 1970, included a description of the case of Julia, with its use of electrodes in the brain to stimulate and monitor behavior. One Interested reader was a former Ervin student in medical school, Michael Crichton, who proceeded to write the best‐selling Frankensteinian novel “The Terminal Man,” in which the brain of a violent epileptic is tied into and controlled by a computer. Aside from adding fuel to the controversy over psychosurgery, the novel led to a public identification of criminal violence (as exhibited by the main character) with epilepsy. The vast majority of epileptics do not display such behavior, as Crichton felt impelled to make clear in a disclaimer in the paperback edition of his work. There is some irony in the fact that Mark has become such a storm center of the controversy, since he is generally viewed by his colleagues in the field as among the most cautious of psychosurgeons. There is further irony in the notoriety attached to his treatment of Julia, since surgery was actually performed on damaged tissue in the brain to treat the behavioral symptoms of a disease — epilepsy — generally conceded to have an organic cause. In the typical case of psychosurgery, there is no such evidence of observed brain pathology. But the controversy over the field is so heated, the issues are so emotionally charged, that no psychosurgeon can expect, to escape a share of public, and professional, hostility. Some of the questions raised by critics: Is current knowledge of brain function sufficient to justify such irreversible surgery? Are there adequate safeguards to ensure that psychosurgery is always, truly, the court of last resort =that all other possible therapies have been tried and failed? Doesn't surgery on patients in such institutions as prisons and mental hospitals raise the specter of indiscriminate operations to “pacify” those considered to be “dissidents” or discipline problems? The debate over psychosurgery figured large in hearings on human experimentation conducted early this year by a Senate subcommittee chaired by Edward M. Kennedy. And the Senate bill that emerged calls for a national commission to examine the ethics of psychosurgery. At the hearings the battle lines were clearly drawn, including that between the neurosurgeons, with their emphasis on the biological underpinnings of mental illness, and those psychiatrists who emphasize the role of environment in determining abnormal behavior. But much interest focused on the work of one of the more controversial psychosurgeons, Dr. O. J. Andy of the University of Mississippi, and his operations on hyperactive, hard‐tomanage institutionalized youngsters. In one case, Dr. Andy removed a part of the brain of a 9‐year‐old hyperactive boy. The results of the first operation were not considered satisfactory, and several more such operations were performed. In the end, the boy's hyperactivity was ameliorated, and Dr. Andy believes the operation prevented the child's being kept under permanent sedation and restraint. But critics emphasize that the boy's intellectual capacity deteriorated after the operations, and that—since some important brain development continues through childhood—the youngster never got his chance to learn what nature might eventually have done for him. It is mainly because of this uncertainty that American doctors have shied away from using the scalpel in such cases, though operations on hyperactive children as young as 5 years are performed with regularity in Japan, Thailand and other nations. In the United States today, the number of psychosurgical operations is estimated at 500 to 600 a year and appears to be on the increase, though no one has really accurate figures. They represent only a small fraction of the 38,000 brain operations performed each year, but they grow out of the same dramatic increase in scientific understanding of the function and structure of the threeand‐a‐half‐pound pinkish‐gray blob inside the skull that makes man what he is. There are some 12 billion nerve cells in the brain, creating a fantastically complex network of chemical‐electrical switches. But the whole is so highly organized into functional centers that it can receive millions of messages from the environment, process and evaluate them and respond almost instantly with appropriate behavioral orders to the muscles. The brain sits on the spinal cord like a cabbage on a stalk, directing the body through a number of outposts. Start with the brain stem, which joins the upper end of the spinal cord to the rest of the brain. It contains the primitive core‐400 million years old on the evolutionary scale —and has to do with such elementary functions as breathing and heartbeat. The brain stem branches into two main protuberances. At the lower end is the cerebellum; ‐ with its controls on such primitive characteristics as balance and muscle tone. The upper end comprises the twin hemispheres of the cerebrum, each half of which is divided into lobes according to their position in the skull. The frontal lobe, for example, up front; the temporal lobe just beneath the temple and ear. Around the rim of the brain stem is the limbic system, so called because its components are in a kind of physical limbo. Here are the structures —including the amygdala and the thalamus—that are said to be involved with the body's survival responses, often emotional and violent, to the terrors and demands of the environment. In the higher animals, the cerebrum includes the cerebral cortex, a wrinkled and folded sheet of gray matter that in humans covers the top of the brain to a thickness of a quarter of an inch and fits snugly under the arch of the skull. Nine billion of the human brain's nerve cells show up in the cerebral cortex — a proportion so large compared with that of the lower animals that scientists have concluded that it must be the seat of man's ability to think. “To look into our hearts … is not enough,” T. S. Eliot once observed. “One must look into the cerebral cortex.” Psychologists have long been interested in the cerebral cortex in general, but the psychosurgeon's first target area was the frontal lobes—and that came about by sheer accident. In 1848 a railroad foreman, one Phineas Gage, was directing the work of a construction gang when an explosion sent an inch‐thick, 4‐foot‐long iron‐ rod through his head. Gage survived for 12 years, and an autopsy revealed that the rod had penetrated his frontal lobes, causing considerable damage. Yet much to the surplise of psychiatrists of the day, who had assumed that such damage must affect a victim's mental capacities, Gage never lost his memory or other intellectual abilities, though he suffered personality changes. During the nineteen‐thirties, scientists pursued this lead, cutting away the frontal lobes of chimpanzees, whose brains are not too different structurally from man's. One such experiment involved a group of young female chimps subject to violent tantrums. When their frontal lobes were removed, the tantrums disappeared — the animals spent their days sitting in a corner munching bananas and nothing disturbed them. The portion of the frontal lobe involved in this behavioral change was mapped out by a Swiss physiologist, and later Nobel Prize winner, Walter Hess, who died last month. He was the first to implant wires in an animal brain to record electrical activity. Hess subsequently found that the hypothalamus and associated neural structures located on the rim of the brain stem the limbic system—controlled emotional and aggressive behavior. It was also, incidentally, the site of appetite (motivating the animal's aggressive acts), the focal point of sexual behavior, and was tied to the sense of smell. ON the basis of this new knowledge — and the growth of brain surgery in general —a Portuguese physician, Antonio Caetano de Abren Freire Egas Moniz, in 1935 introduced the operation known as prefrontal lobotomy, the destruction of large sections of the frontal lobes. His patients were long‐time psychotics who had undergone other available treatments without effect. Of his first 20 patients, Moniz reported “cures” in seven, help in eight, no change in the rest. Though Moniz won the Nobel Prize in medicine, he paid a high price for his pioneering excursions into the brain. He was shot five times by a lobotomized patient; one bullet lodged in his spine, leaving him a hemiplegic. But he lived to see prefrontal lobotomy reach almost boom proportions. During the decade following the end of World War II, 50,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States alone—the numbers swollen by Veterans Administration backing of the operation for G.I.'s with severe emotional problems. The boom was based on thousands of apparent successes, patients who had been unable to function in the community who were returned to active, “normal” lives. But reports of frequent dismaying side effects began to appear; some lobotomized patients lost their “creativity” and higher reasoning powers and became vegetablelike in their placidity. Some doctors performed lobotomies for mental ailments that did not require such radical treatment. Horror tales proliferated: Walter Freeman of George Washington University, who brought lobotomy to the United States from Lisbon, performed some 4,000 of the operations with an ice pick. Critics told of a Freeman lobotomy on a Peeping Tom. After the operation, the patient no longer slunk through back alleys to take his visual pleasures—he walked right up to the front windows. The operation had apparently freed him of any sense of shame, but not of his abnor‐mal tendencies. It was not the medical profession, however, that eventually put a stop to lobotomy in this country. It was actually the development of shock treatment and certain psychoactive drugs which apparently performed the same function as did the operation with (it was thought) less deficit to the patient. Yet lobotomy did not die out everywhere. Today in England, where the operation was handled more cautiously, lobotomies in various forms are still the therapy of choice in many instances. (The American surgeon Dr. William Beecher Scoville, who has possibly performed more lobotomies than any other surgeon alive today, says that at least 50 per cent of his patients were benefited enough to be discharged from the hospital—but, he admits, at a price: “the blunting of higher sensibilities, such as intelligence, abstract thinking and ability to fantasize.”) The medical profession soon began to realize, however, that drugs and shock therapy had their limits. In many cases the benefits of the treatments wore off, or there were adverse side effects. And there developed a renewed interest in the possibilities of surgery. MEANWHILE neurosurgical techniques had been improved, so that doctors could go deep into the brain with the help of well‐worked‐out three‐dimensional maps. Dr. Scoville was one of those who felt the Moniz type of lobotomy was too gross; fibers were cut without much knowledge of their functions. He began to seek methods of pinpointing more exact sites in the brain for surgery. In the early nineteen‐fifties, an intensive study at Columbia by a group of psychiatrists and surgeons focused on three areas of the brain—the superior, orbital and medial parts of the frontal lobe—which connect to the limbic system. Various operations were attempted: leucotomy, for example—the cutting into the white matter to disconnect the inflow and outflow of neural information to and from the frontal lobes. But they were not fully satisfactory. As Scoville points out, the brain isn't a switchboard in which you can easily cut out or repair the wire you are looking for. So many interconnections exist in the brain as to make the outcome of such delicate operations uncertain. To overcome these disadvantages, Scoville developed a new surgical technique called orbital undercutting, which he describes as comparable to lifting a blanket off a bed. In the old lobotomy, the surgeon cut a narrow slice through the base of the frontal lobes along the midline, taking both gray and white matter and disrupting fibers and blood vessels along the way. In contrast, Scoville delicately peels off only a thin sheath of white matter at the base of the frontal lobes, without touching the underlying blood vessels. Scoville now performs about 25 such operations a year —for many types of mental disease where there is abnormal compulsion — and he is gratified, he says, that 85 per cent of his patients are returned to normal living. He claims his greatest success is with the obsessive neurotics such as the “hand washers,” who must wash their hands constantly. One such patient washed his hands in carbolic acid until the skin came off and gangrene set in. The brain operation removed the obsession. Another psychosurgical procedure was developed by neurosurgeon Petter Lindstrom of San Francisco, former husband of Ingrid Bergman, and has been applied to 500 patients. He uses a technique known as prefrontal sonic treatment (PST), which focuses a beam of high intensity ultrasonic sound into the prefrontal white matter of the brain. This causes some change in electrical activity, but it does not damage brain tissue. Dr. Lindstrom devised the method for use in the alleviation of epileptic seizures, but over the years he has extended it to the treatment of many kinds of neurotic and psychotic symptoms. He reported recently that patients with anxiety, depression, obsessions and compulsions, as well as those with phobias, have responded favorably to the treatment in the sense that many have been able to return to work and to family life. Many other doctors, while favorably impressed with the reported results, regard the ultrasonic technique as too specialized—requiring special training on the part of the practitioner—and the Lindstrom‐developed equipment has not been commercially available. Meanwhile, other psychosurgeons were placing their emphasis on another part of the brain — the cingulum, a small bundle of fibrous tissue that connects the front brain with the midbrain. In many hospitals, cingulotomy has now become a standard operation for intractable pain, such as arises in terminal cancer cases—it reduces the anxiety associated with pain, giving die patient a measure of relief. Dr. H. T. Ballantine, of Harvard Medical School—the Mr. Cingulum of psychosurgery—has been using the procedure on severe cases of neurosis over the past 11 years. He recently revealed a follow‐up on 68 patients who suffered from various mental disorders, including severe depression, anxiety and obsessional neuroses that proved not amenable to other kinds of treatment. He found that 14 cases could function satisfactorily in society without help; 38 were aided, but needed some support, and 14 showed little or no improvecould be traced. At the University of Texas at Galveston, Drs. Glenn Meyer and. Winston Martin have used cingulotomies to relieve anxiety and tension in drug‐addicted patients. They report that these patients have lost their addictive habit after the surgery. Another frequent target of psychosurgeons has been the amygdala, the limbic‐system structure involved in the case of Julia. Doctors found early on that when the amygdala of cbimpanzees is destroyed, there is a strange spectrum of changes, all related to emotion. In one colony of monkeys, the operation led to placidity; in another colony, a postoperative pugilist was created who beat down his opposition until he became boss monkey. The doctors think that adversary systems that may govern opposing behavior patterns are involved. In the case of human patients, especially young men who have suffered cranial injuries to the limbic system, there is a phase of hyperactivity and belligerence traceable to defects in the amygdala. Viral diseases, such as encephalitis and rabies (from the Latin for “rage”), cause aggressive behavior and correlate with lesions in the amygdala or nearby structures. Epilepsy of the limbic system, some clinicians have found, gives rise to destructive impulses. Surgeons Vernon Mark and Thomas Sweet of Massachusetts General Hospital have now performed amygdalectomies on 13 patients who had shown violent behavior associated with epilepsy, including Julia. Mark's most successful case was that of Clara, a 62‐year‐old, 86‐pound woman who suffered 20 epileptic seizures a day and became so violent she had to live in restraint. After the operation, Mark reports, not only did she lose her violent impulses but her seizures declined radically and she became well enough adjusted to take on a responsible job. The doctors now bring her to medical meetings to show the beneficial effects of amygdaleetomy. An even more dramatic before‐and‐after case occurred on the West Coast, where a waitress had shown such violent rages that at times she tried to mutilate herself with a knife. She had been kept in a strait jacket for several years, and nothing, it appeared, could quiet her. Within a few months of the operation, according to Dr. L. Jolyon West of U.C.L.A., she was out of the hospital. Her insanity cleared and she found a steady job. And her I.Q., previously thought to be subnormal, tested out at 130, a level achieved by only 1 per cent of the population. Push‐button therapy for the brain Perhaps the most intriguing area related to psychosurgery encompasses electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB), applied not simply to map the brain and diagnose its sick part but as actual therapy. ESB moved from the early work of Hess into such exotic areas as the control of animal behavior publicized by Jose Delgado of Yale. Delgado, one of the nation's more ingenious brain technicians, developed a device known as a “stimoceiver,” which has been used to record patterns of electrical activity arising during attacks of uncontrollable rage and violence. (It was this device that Mark used in recording Julia's seizures.) Delgado speculated—long before Michael Crichton —that such abnormal electrical activity signaling the approach of an epileptic attack could be telemetered to a computer which could then automatically send a corrective signal to the brain to thwart the convulsion. The man largely responsible for applying such data to human psychosurgery is Robert Heath of Tulane, who during the nineteen‐fifties was the first to implant electrodes deep in the brains of human beings. Heath, a controversial figure in the field, has used as many as 125 electrodes in a single patient. He has developed a control box, which enables a patient to press a button and send a burst of current into different parts of the brain. Heath has reported positive results in many different kinds of cases involving painful emotional states stemming from faulty learning experiences. There is a debate among psychiatrists today as to whether homosexuality is really a mental disease, but Heath says that some of his patients, who exhibited homosexual behavior, have been able to condition themselves to enjoy heterosexual experiences—with the help of the brainstimulation box. The procedure: A homosexual is shown films that include heterosexual acts. Each time such an episode appears on the screen, the patient presses a button on the biotelemetry box, which is connected to the pleasure center in his brain. Eventually, Heath claims, the patient is sufficiently conditioned that he finds pleasure in personally participating in such acts.—L.E. SUCH success stories, however, have done little to soothe psychosurgery's critics. The most vocal of them is Peter Breggin, a Washington, D.C., psychiatrist and novelist who in 1972 persuaded former Representative Cornelius Gallagher of New Jersey to put his case against psychosurgery into The Congressional Record. He has carried his campaign to the courts, and pursued it in the halls of Congress and the newspapers and medical journals. He has invented such terms as “cranial clean‐out” and “abortion of the brain.” Breggin sees the psychosurgeons, along with such behavioral scientists as B. F. Skinner of Harvard, as representing “the greatest future threat that we are going to face for our traditional American values.” He adds: “If America ever falls to totalitarianism, the dictator will be a behavioral scientist and the secret police will be armed with lobotomy and psychosurgery.” Breggin also opposes “tampering” with the brain grounds: “I believe your eternal spirit passes through your brain and lives there for a while and then goes on.” Breggin claims, with apparent justification, that he and his supporters have stirred up enough opposition virtually to stop Federal spending for psychosurgical experimentation. In the past, funds have been made available in the main by three agencies: the National Institutes of Health; the Veterans Administration, for use in its hospitals, and the Justice Department, for work in prisons investigating the relationship between mental disease and criminal violence. In addition, a number of state agencies have underwritten the costs of a variety of state institutional projects. Much of this money has recently dried up, one of the latest casualties being the rejection this year of a $348,000 proposal to N.I.H. by Dr. Mark who has been funded by the Government for several The antipsychosurgery point of view has numerous supporters among scientists. “Nobody knows the cost of surgery to the organism,” says Dr. Michael Gazzaniga, an experimental psychologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. “Neurosurgeons are not disposed or trained to judge long‐term improvements in the total person. They tend to look at just one dimension of a multifaceted human being. Even if psychiatry isn't successful, it is better to continue it in many cases than to alter the person forever.” “The big problem is that the neurosurgeon doesn't really know how to follow up his patients,” adds Dr. Fred Plum, chief of neurology at the School of Medicine, Cornell University. “You can't really take his word for what happens to the behavior of the patient after an operation. It is not because he, and the psychiatrist who may be on the case with him, aren't honest, but because they may easily be biased toward their own work.” Dr. Robert Neville of the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences at Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N. Y., head of a recently formed task force designed to study the full social impact of psychosurgery, says that psychosurgery has potential for mischief, especially in institutions. “It can be the cheapest and easiest treatment to adopt for controlling patients,” he says, “and therefore potentially dangerous, especially because it can be used improperly to subdue aggressive dissidents on the theory that they're diseased. Our preliminary conclusion (though I don't know what the full task group will determine) is that psychosurgery should never be performed on persons under court jurisdiction as a result of criminal activity.” This same concern was reflected in a decision last July by a circuit court in Michigan, which ruled that psychosurgery for “experimental purposes” could not be performed on mental‐hospital patients or prison inmates. And Representative Louis Stokes of Ohio has introduced a bill in Congress to levy a fine of $10,000 for each psychosurgical operation performed in a federally connected facility; he fears the procedure might be used against institutionalized blacks, in particular. PERHAPS the most devastating criticism arises from those psychologists who challenge the merits of the theoretical foundations of psychosurgery. Eliot S. Vallenstein of the University of Michigan, in a forthcoming book called “Brain Control,” questions the validity of the proposition that the stimulation or destruction of certain regions of the brain results in predictable changes in behavior. No specific behavior, he says, is consistently elicited in response to stimulation. Even the legendary story of the charging bull of Yale University's Jose Delgado which was supposedly stopped in its tracks in the arena and turned into a placid Ferdinand by a radio‐transmitted surge of current to its brain, leaves him skeptical. “The bull,” he says “was forced to turn around and around in the same direction, but no evidence was presented to prove that the bull's aggressiveness was modified. The bull was simply confused and frustrated, not altered.” Psychosurgeons are outraged by attacks on their professional judgment. While they admit that there is no unified theory of the brain, or even a complete map of all its interconnections, they insist that more than three decades of clinical evidence, actual case histories of human patients, not to mention extensive animal experimentation, have shown that psychosurgery, properly practiced, brings beneficial behavioral changes. “Until we get a truly good nondestructive treatment, surgery is the only alternative for thousands of desperate patients for whom all other forms of therapy have failed,” says Dr. Mark. “People think that operations on simpler organs are all right,” says one surgeon. “The brain is a mysterious sanctum sanctorum, and God knows what the potential side effects might be. But with these other organs, people feel, the surgeon knows exactly what he's doing and what might go wrong. The truth is that many kinds of medical procedures, ranging from treatments for the common cold to openheart surgery, are based entirely upon empirical findings without completely defined theoretical foundations. And without exact knowledge of every detail or possible side effect.” Dr. Karl Pribram, former neurosurgeon and now professor of psychology and psychiatry at Stanford University, is one who suggests care in the selection of cases for psychosurgery; but he adds: “We must work in partial ignorance to relieve suffering.” Psychosurgeons seem to respond most heatedly to criticism from the psychiatric side, pointing out that psychiatry has the poorest data base — the worst record of clinical and experimental results—in all of medicine. Dr. Mark, for example, is quick to criticize what he says is all too frequent in conventional psychiatry: the tendency to ignore the organic causes of much mental disease. “At Boston City,” he says, “a 29‐year‐old patient given to spells of headache, backache and nausea had been treated by eminent psychiatrists for a number of years without much improvement. After one of his visits to the psychiatrist, he returned home, fell into a coma and died. I examined him and found that he had a tumor which covered one‐sixth of his cranial cavity. Some of the signs of this disease were visible through the eyes, but the psychiatrist, concerned only with the outward behavior, failed to see it.” IT is not likely that this in ‐ house argument will be soon resolved — nor does it seem likely, notwithstanding the controversy over the procedure, that psychosurgery will be banned. But the concern among the public and within the medical profession does suggest that there will be increasing pressure for stricter controls on psychosurgery. Many hospitals now have medical committees that review any proposal for psychosurgery. And Boston City Hospital is trying out a variation of that approach, by having a lay review committee (its members include a civil‐rights attorney, a nun and a sociologist) make certain that the patient or his family understands the consequences and potentials of the operation before consent is given. Some in the medical profession are uncomfortable with even such a minimal intrusion of laymen intd the traditionally sacred patientdoctor relationship. Other doctors feel it is hardly enough, and much tougher controls are being urged. Dr. Willard Gaylin, president of the Hastings Institute; stated his views this way before the Kennedy subcommittee: “I do not want abandonment of psychosurgery, because I think it may have some potential. I am sure it has not been given adequate safeguards, and supervision—and this is the current urgent need.” He would have the Federal Government, through the National Institutes of Health, insist upon certain standards before any psychosurgery is performed. As Dr. Bertram S. Brown, director of N.I.M.H., has observed, psychosurgery has become a kind of “lightning rod,” drawing to itself public and professional concern over a host of issues, ranging from doctors’ prerogatives to civil rights—the whole given special emotional fervor by fears of an Orwellian future. The danger in such a continuing controversy seems very clear. It poses a threat to the progress of brain research and to the alleviation of those diseases that plague man's peace of mind."
Jersey Delays in Setting Policy For Abortions Under Medicaid,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/01/archives/jersey-delays-in-setting-policy-for-abortions-under-medicaid-state.html,"TRENTON, Sept. 30—Eight months after the United States Supreme Court limited state regulation of abortions, New Jersey has still not drawn up guidelines that would make financially poor women who elect to end a pregnancy on a doctor's advice eligible for Medicaid payments. New York, by comparison, issued its Medicaid guidelines less than three months after the State Legislature liberalized the abortion laws. Meanwhile, the Right of Life Committee of New Jersey, group that opposes liberalization of abortion laws, staged “walk for life” rallies in Newark, Trenton and Pennsauken today. Civil rights activists in Trenton attribute the delay in setting of guidelines to political pressures, legislative inaction and bureaucratic timidity. They contend it has put unnecessary financial burdens on women who can least afford them. The lag, ccmbined with an almost equally long delay in establishing criteria under which abortion clinics may operate, says Stephen M. Nagler, head of the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, “affects women who are least mobile, least able to pay and most in need of medical services.” State Medicaid officials do not quarrel with that assessment. “It's true that Medicaid payments on elective abortions are in limbo until the guidelines are worked out,” says William J. Jones, director of the division of medical assistance. “We've told the hospitals to neither accept nor decline such claims until state policy has been worked out,” he declared. Medicaid is paying the hospitals for therapeutic abortions —abortions certified by a doctor as necessary to a woman's physical or mental health. Guidelines ‘Coming Soon’ At the moment, however, Mr. Jones says, Medicaid is “holding in abeyance” payment on elective abortion claims—abor?? not strictly necessary—totaling about $49,000. Mr. Jones added that the guidelines “should be coming very soon,” but he maintained that the final decisions should be made by the Department of Health, the Legislature or the Attorney General's office. ‘Ground Rules’ Sought “I do not think,” he said, “that Medicaid should, by administrative fiat, either make policy or law. Everybody is looking at us as the bad guys, but we have to administer by law and regulation. What we're looking for is ground rules.” Though it is “studying” the problem, Medicaid is, in essence, looking to either the Department of Health or the State Attorney General — or both—to resolve its problems. The Attorney General, George F. Kugler, said last Jan. 31 that, as a result of the Supreme Court decision that an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy was a matter to be decided by the physician and patient, Medicaid could be used to pay for abortions on eligible patients whether they were done in or out of the state. An assisant said that the Attorney General's office was “working on the guidelines” and, at the same time, was attempting to establish that New Jersey's abortion law, which was struck down by a lower Federal court as constitutionally vague, could be read “as “consistent” with the Supreme Court decision. The Attorney General's office insists it is plunging through the legal thicket that has grown up around abortion because of the Legislature's unwillingness to deal with a thorny political issue in an election year. “Since the Legislature won't do anything,” one assistant attorney general said, “we've got to do something to preserve the law. How else can we go ahead and prevent nondoctors from performing abortions, for example?” Other lawyers contend that almost no one In government wants to take the lead on the abortion issue because of the political muscle packed by the “Right to Life” groups. Eighteen of 30 Bergen County candidates running for the Legislature, have told the antiabortion group they would support an amendment to the United States Constitution forbidding “abortion on demand.” Byrne Less Militant Representative Charles Sandman, Jr., the Republican candidate for Governor, has introduced a resolution similar to the amendment and has drawn praise from the New Jersey Right to Life Association for his “positive profile stand.” Brendan T. Byrne, the Democratic candidate for Governor, has taken a somewhat less militant stand, but noted he is opposed to abortion “as a matter of personal conscience.” Politics aside, State Health Department officials are convinced that the delay in resolving the Medicaid issue has made it difficult for welfare recipients to get elective abortions in New Jersey hospitals. I were a hospital administrator and I didn't know whether I was going to get paid or not,” says one state official, “I certainly wouldn't want to play Russian roulette. I'd be very reluctant to go ahead.” The New York Planned Parenthood Association is trying to force Medicaid's hand through an administrative action demanding payment for abortions performed in New York on New Jersey residents prior to the Supreme Court decision. Still another action has been filed against Medicaid by the American Civil Liberties Union. And in another court case, Dr. Robert M. Livingston, an Englewood Cliffs gynecologist, is suing the Prudential Life Insurance Company, Medicaid's disbursing agent, for payment for 30 abortions he has performed on welfare patients. Dr. Livingston, who played an important role in the tests against the New Jersey abortion law, treats many such pabents and says their finances are often so tight that “even a fee of $25 is beyond their flieans.” Clinics Seek Certificates Dr. Livingston's Palisades Medical Group is one of seven in the state that have asked the Department of Health for a “certificate of need” that is a pre‐requisite to setting up such a clinic. Dr. Livingston's group filed its application last May. The State Health Planning Council has not yet acted on it. It maintains that it will have to take “some further investigational steps” before doing so. In part, the investigation may be focusing on the potential economic impact of the clinics on established hospitals. Abortions performed in a hospital often cost more than four times as much as the $100 average that Dr. Livingston is projecting for his clinic, and short‐term ambulatory patients make a considerable contribution to hospital profit margins. Dr. Livingston, who runs a fertility center as part of his general gynecological practice, thinks the same political crosscurrents that have delayed a ruling on Medicaid are at work on his clinic application. “It's all very controversial,” he says, “and I doubt that anybody in the state will want to lact within the next couple of inonths. It looks as though the state will just refuse to act until somebody takes them to court.”"

The loudest applause came when he urged his listeners to keep the Hungarian language and spirit alive. Speaking in Hungarian, the Cardinal called for areturn to the sanctity of unblemished family life and condemned as “murderers” women who seek abortions. Banners of Welcome He also deplored the fact that only 35 christenings were held in the church this year, while 60 had been held there three years ago. About 800 families attend St. Ladislaus. The community—there are about 18,000 Hungarians here —went all out for the Cardinal's visit. Street signs were changed from Somerset to Cardinal Mindszenty Avenue. Huge banners strung across the avenue bore on one side the words, “Welcome Cardinal Mindszenty.” The outdoor platform was decorated with yellow chrysanthemums and the red, white and green colors of Hungary. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Kelerman traveled from Myerstown, Pa., just to catch a glimpse of the cardinal. Seven‐year‐old Patricia Kelerman came with them to see and “not forget a real martyr,” as her mother put it.

Sandman Pledges to Bar Public Funds for Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/01/archives/sandman-pledges-to-bar-public-funds-for-abortion-pressure-is-urged.html,"NEWARK, Sept. 30 — Five hundred people at a rally sponsored by opponents of legalized abortion heard Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey, declare today that if he were elected, “no public money will be appropriated for mass murder – for that is what abortion is.” The rally, held in Brand Brook Park, was one of three marches in the state under the slogan “Walk for Life.” The goal was to mobilize support for a campaign to force the release from committee of a House of Representatives bill to ban legalized abortion. The bill would amend the Constitution to achieve the ban. The other rallies were held in Trenton and in Pennsauken near Camden. In Trenton, 1,000 marched through the business district and a rally followed at the War Memorial Building. Pressure Is Urged Mr. Sandman urged pressure on members of the House Judiciary Committee to report the antiabortion bill to the floor. Mr. Sandman is a co‐sponsor of the bill. The Constitutional amendment authorized by the bill would prohibit abortion, “from the moment of conception of life, without due process of law.” The Judiciary Committee is headed by Representative Peter J. Rodino, Democrat of Newark. Mr. Sandman charged that Mr. Rodino was “bottling up” the bill in committee. “Prevail upon him to release this bill so that the floor can vote on it,” Mr. Sandman urged the crowd. Brendan T. Byrne, the Democratic candidate for Governor, was invited to attend the Newark rally by the New Jersey Right to Life Committee, the sponsoring group. He sent a letter of regret, saying that he was unable to attend because of a conflict in commitments. Mr. Byrne says he is opposed to abortion as “a matter of personal conscience.” The gubernatorial candidate on the American party ticket, Howard Freund, was a speaker at the rally. He said that abortion, legalized or illegal, amounted to “murder.” The drive for a Constitutional amendment arose following a United States Supreme Court decision early this year that sanctioned abortion on a limited basis. Before the appearance of Mr. Sandman, who arrived with Assemblyman Anthony Imperiale, of Newark, 500 people carrying placards denouncing abortion marched through Newark streets near the park. The procession passed Mr. Rodino's home on Grafton Street and Mount Prospect Avenue. The Congressman was in Washington, where he appeared on the Columbia Broadcasting System program “Face the Nation.” Initial Confusion There was some confusion before the rally started over whether Mr. Sandman's helicopter would be permitted to land in the park. The police ruled that the helicopter would have to land elsewhere, and the craft was set down at the edge of the Passaic River on a pier in Newark. Mr. Sandman and his party then rode to the park in automobiles."
Manlila and Democracy,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/04/archives/manila-and-democracy.html,"ITHACA, N.Y.—The American conscience is not difficult to prick when democracy is in distress. It sent America into two world wars to save democracy. It sent her into a less decisive and less popular war in Vietnam to save democracy. It keeps hundreds of thousands of American soldiers posted around the world to stand guard for democracy. And it speaks up, eloquently and quite officially, whenever and wherever democracy is raped. America frustrated the first Philppine Republic in 1898 and then revolted American conscience sent her fumbling and laboring through forty years of occupation attempting to prove to the world and to herself that she could make up for her sin of forced abortion by institutionalizing the noble democratic aims of that Republic. In 1946 that conscience had its finest hour. It allowed the Filipinos to inaugurate their own stable republican democracy. ++For a quarter of a century America loved that democracy well, and even fondly referred to it as her fostered child. On Sept. 22, 1972, it was raped by one of our kind. It is now a full year since, and the American conscience has managed to express its revulsion at it, clearly if sporadically, especially through editorial opinion. But American policy makers are under a sustained bombardment of the “smiling” propaganda of Mr. Marcos, directed mostly at U.S. business and the U.S. military, namely, that Philippine democracy was simply begging to be raped since it was flirting too much with license, anarchy and indiscipline. It is interesting that while Mr. Marcos would justify dictatorship with the insistence that Philippine democracy was not working, American observers will claim the opposite. The Rev. Bruno Hicks, the American Franciscan missionary expelled by the government of martial law, after he had spent years in the rural areas of Central Philippines, reported that he was seeing “more and more Filipinos getting into the political arena.” He saw “simple and conscientious peasants forming their own political groups, expressing themselves, beginning to vote independently of their landlords and employers.” He then asked the agonizing question: “Could this have been the reason why martial law was declared: because democracy was just beginning to work [and] the grievances of the masses were finally getting organized, getting aired, bringing pressure to bear on the political institutions?” ■ Democracy was beginning to work and this, not the flamboyant programs for cleaner streets and increased tourism, is the reason why it had to be destroyed by someone who cared little for it. And ironically he destroyed it with the very instrument with which the people had hoped to preserve it—the Constitutional Convention. Now the Marcos dictatorship would like to make itself viable by appealing for more military and economic aid, reminding America of her commitment to our “democracy,” and for more U.S. investment so that American business may assist in giving economic substance to that “democracy.” It may be well for American policy makers and businessmen to ponder the instability which Mr. Marcos has introduced into our Government, He has substituted his single will for that of the people and is governing without successor. If, by accident or intent, Mr. Marcos should go, chaos would ensue, the type of chaos which historically has been the favorite setting for the seizure of power by small but well‐organized extremist groups. When that happens, will America with her large military and economic presence there, be sucked into another conflict as long and as traumatic as Vietnam, another war to save democracy for the Filipinos, when—as in Vietnam—perhaps the Filipinos might have been encouraged to save it for themselves? The American conscience can respond effectively to this challenge, It can move to approve the recommendation contained in the report of Senator Fulbright's Committee, on Foreign Relations that economic and military aid be withheld from countries which imprison or persecute the political opposition. And it can move to get America to stand aside, neutrally if approvingly, should the armed forces of the Philippines and the Filipino people move to restore our country to the original democracy that is part of the Filipino soul."
New Jersey Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/06/archives/new-jersey-briefs-murder-trial-of-2-ends-in-mistrial-courtmartial.html,"Morris County. Judge John D. Collins declared a mistrial yesterday in the trial of two men charged with a 1969 slaying in Morris Township. One of the men, 32‐year‐old Aurelio Cagno of Livingston, was arrested Thursday on another murder charge; he was one of 10 persons indicted by a state grand jury on a charge of committing a gangland‐style murder in 1971. The motion for the mistrial was made by the attorney for the other defendant. He said that adverse publicity concerning Cagno's arrest would make it impossible for his client, Samuel Corsaro, 29, to receive a fair trial. Cagno and Corsaro are charged with the slaying in November, 1969, of Gerardo Ladalardo Jr., 24, in a liquor store. Court‐Martial for Sergeant An Air Force sergeant accused of passing military secrets to a Russian diplomat will be tried by general courtmartial. Seven charges were served yesterday on T./Sgt. James D. Wood, 35 years old, of Tacoma, Wash., who has been held in the Fort Dix stockade since he was arrested in New York City on July 21 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An Air Force spokesman at McGuire Base said a trial date had not yet been set. Sergeant Wood was arrested when he allegedly prepared to turn over confidential military records to Viktor Chernyshev, first secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Washington. A.E.C. Asks Shift in Power Plant Site The Atomic Energy Commission urged the Public Service Electric and Gas Company to shift the location of a proposed nuclear generator from Newbold Island to Salem County. The A.E.C. indicated that its preference for the Salem County location was based largely upon the population densities of the two areas. By 1980, according to the A.E.C., a five‐mile radius of Newbold Island, which is in the Delaware River, will have a population of 125,000. At the Salem County site, which centers on Alloways Creek Township, the estimated 1980 population will be 4,700. Other factors that affected the commission's decision were a proposal to build a housing development for 40,000 people just across the river from the original site, and the existence of two nuclear generators already under construction at the Salem County location. Slaying Suspect Held for Observation A woman charged with the slaying of Eleanor Caldwell, found stabbed 21 times in the chest and back, was temporarily committed to a state institution by an Ocean County Court judge because of her, “physical and mental condition.” The suspect, Denise Simpson, 24 years old, of Lakewood, was arrested along with her brother‐in‐law, Herbert Simpson, 33, on Thursday night. Mr. Simpson, also of Lakewood, was held in the County Jail pending arraignment as a material witness. Miss Caldwell of Lakewood was beaten on the face and head and her skull was fractured, according to an autopsy report. Her body was found along Whitesville Road in Toms River. Woman Protester's Conviction Upheld Superior Court judge Arthur Salvatore upheld the conviction of Martha Buck, a senior field representative of the State Division on Civil Rights, for interfering with a state police officer during a feminist demonstration at the State House last June. Miss Buck was among a group of 30 women who protested Assembly passage of an antiabortion resolution during a legislative session last spring. The women began protesting vocally from the Assembly gallery and had moved their demonstration to a corridor outside the Assembly chamber when State Police Sgt. Majarwitz, dressed in civilian clothes, began taking photographs of them. Miss Buck and other witnesses for her testified that the police sergeant had identified himself as a news photographer, an allegation Sergeant Majarwitz denied. Miss Buck's lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union argued that she was the victim of undercover surveillance."
Five Independent Candidates Are in Race for Mayoralty,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/07/archives/five-independent-candidates-are-in-race-for-mayoralty-against.html,"If you go by petitions filed with the Board of Elections 103,108 registered voters “intend to support” one of five independent candidates for Mayor rather than one of the four official‐party nominees. The petition slates include two brand new entries. The Free Libertarian party offered 20,562 signatures to nominate Francine Youngstein as a candidate who is for as much community control as possible, and isn't even sure there ought to be a citywide government. The U. S. Labor party submitted 19,003 signatures to nominate Anto, (Tony) Chait; kin, who says “we are preparing the working class to seize power” in five to six years. Back on the ballot is the Communist party which put in 27,113 signatures for Rasheed Storey, whose 1969 vote for Mayor was tallied by the board as 4,018. The other slates are the Socialist Workers, with 26,128 signatures for Norman Oliver for Mayor, and Socialist Labor, with 10,302 for John Emanuel. Both longtime Marxist groups had been forced off the 1969 mayoral ballot by supporters of Mayor Lindsay who contended they lacked 7,500 valid signatures in their respective petitions bearing 13,390 and 10,389 names. Following is background information on the five parties and their candidates: FREE LIBERTARIAN The most novel ideological voice is that of the Free Libertarians, led by Miss Youngstein, 30 years old Sept. 30, a Syracuse University graduate in mathematics and now staff instructor in marketing techniques for the International Business Machines Corporation. She got involved by leading group to repeal abortion and contraceptive laws. The party's first Presidential candidate, John Hospers, philosophy chairman at the University of California, won one electoral vote last year from jaundiced Nixon elector in Virginia, although only having 2,691 official nationwide votes. Bylaws say the party Aims at “eliminating the intervention of government in moral, social and economic affairs.” Duespaying members number about 200 in the state, 3,000 nationally. “Big government only creates bigger problems,” Miss Youngstein says. She would decentralize. Public schooling she calls “a method of thought control.” She's for letting each community set up its own schools. Against Transit Bond She would “fire City Hall and hire competitive enterprise.” So she's against the transportation bond issue and would auction off the subways to “two or three competitors.” Even the police, Miss Youngstein says, could be a neighborhood enterprise—and out on the beat against violent crimes. She would repeal “victimless” crime laws, such as drug use. pornography, gambling and prostitution.” The strident U. S. Labor party stems from the National Caucus of Labor Committees, which contends it has “wrested left hegemony” from the Communist party, in part by an “Operation Mop Up.” Its weekly newspaper, “New Solidarity,” says “many Cpers have been sent to the hospital after jumping Labor Committee members in the CP's own meetings.” Mr. Chaitkin, who became 30 March 11, is quoted by the National Unemployed and Welfare Rights Organization which his group helped to set up as declaring “we intend to wreck the campaigns of our major opponents.” The party had 70 one‐minute radio spots on WCBS and WINS last week for which Mr. Chaitkin says it paid about $5,000 to charge Abraham D. Beame, the Democratic candidate, with responsibility for the city plan to put welfare recipients to work. It calls this “scab” and “slave labor.” The “caucus” dates from the 1968 student strike at Columbia University. Some sources call it an offshoot of splits in the leftist Progressive Labor party and the Students for a Democratic Society. Mr. Chaitkin, however, says it was started as a Greenwich Village discussion group by Lyn Marcus, now national chairman. COMMUNIST Last spring its newspaper was referring to “the few hundreds of Labor Committee members” across the country. Some outsiders currently estimate its New York members as 60 to 75, frequently moving around the country. At least 33 persons in the National Caucus's disfavor have been injured in “a score of violent incidents in New York City, Buffalo, Newark, Philadelphia, Detroit and other cities since April 7. Opponents say Caucus members frequently came in with clubs. Caucus members contend they were defending their right to speak or retaliate against provocations. The State Election Law bars the name or abbreviation for “United States” in a party name, so the group is to be on the ballot as “Labor.” Mr. Storey, 37, says he is second‐generation Communist, full‐time party worker since 1964, state chairman since 1967. He drew 5,229 votes in the city for Governor in 1970 and 2,531 upstate. Mr. Storey says the city has about 1,700 “dues‐paying cardcarrying” Communists; and the nation some 22,000 to 25,000. Gus Hall, 1972 candidate for President, had an officially reported 25,222 votes, including 5,641 in New York State. The Communists' nine candidates for city offices this year average 35 years of age, including four 28 or under. The rival Trotskyist Socialist Workers party has urged votes for three Communist Councilmanic candidates, but Mr. Storey refuses its plea to support four Trotskyists. The Communists' 4,000‐word city program calls for an immediate $1 hourly wage increase for all workers, a Mayoral commission to roll back prices and utility rates to 1969 levels, and city take‐overs of “food, fuel, telephone, gas and electric monopolies” and of “shops threatening to close or leave New York to escape unionization.” It also proposes to end unemployment by “massive construction” projects, and forced work for welfare recipients, provide unemployment insurance even for “first‐time jobseekers,” repeal sales taxes and taxes on incomes under $15,000 a year and bring back 15‐cent transit fares by taxing businesses. SOCIALIST WORKERS Mr. Oliver, the youngest Mayoral candidate, turned 23 on Sept. 18. While in high school in Detroit, he belonged for a few months to the Black Panthers; he says he left when they “began romanticizing about picking up the gun.” He joined the Young Socialist Alliance and its parent party then, worked in peacetime movements against the Vietnam war, toured European bases in 1970 “investigating racism,” and is a full ‐ time party leader. The Socialist Workers, espousing Communist doctrines of Leon Trotsky, polled 7,979 votes statewide for President last year. Mr. Oliver says their movement has 2,500 to 3,000 dues‐paying members nationally, including 2,000 in the Young Socialist Alliance. The party has a pending Federal Court suit, with Leonard B. Boudin as counsel, charging President Nixon and 18 others with “blacklisting, harassment, electronic surveillance, burglary, mail tampering and terrorism,” which seeks $27‐million in damages. One count alleges that Mr. Oliver”s apartment was burglarized last May 24, with apparently only documents relating to the party and his campaign taken. The Socialist Workers have nine candidates for city posts. Their 4,000‐word platform calls for a $5 hourly minimum wage, ending of wage controls, unionconsumer committees “to regulate prices” in the city, public works to provide jobs, “preferential hiring for blacks, Puerto Rican's and women” and unemployment benefits “at union wage scale for all unemployed, including those just leaving school and all strikers.” It also asks for “control by the black and Puerto Rican communities” of their school staffs, funds and curricula; “living ‐ cost stipends through high school and college years”; repeal of the sales tax and taxes on incomes under $15,000 a year, and free mass transit paid by corporation taxes. SOCIALIST LABOR “New York City is moving steadily toward a total breakdown,” says the Socialist Labor party. Mr. Emanuel, running at the age of 65 after 35 years in the party and seven previods candidacies for various offices, finds things “very encouraging.” “I look at the behavior of the capitalist class, how worried it is,” he says. “Their system is on the brink of collapse. The economics of capitalism is deteriorating because inflation threatens to bring down their monetary system.” The Socialist Labor party dates itself from 1876. It embraces the philosophy of Daniel De Leon for “a peaceful, civilized change from “capitalism” to a government of representatives elected from industries."
Commentary on today's church,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/07/archives/did-i-say-that-commentary-on-todays-church.html,"In the afterwash of Roman Catholic renewal, there trailed a wake of derelict magazines with sadly optimistic names, Good Work, Today, Insight, Continuum, whose post‐Vatican II readers jumped ship at the first sign of trouble. AD 1970, for instance, foundered in its titular year. Rare then is the record of The Critic with a subscription list twice that of a decade ago. The Critic's literary origins are well preserved, but it is to its commentary on the Catholic Church of today that readers have responded with enthusiasm. Dan Hen's iconoclasms, Joel Wells's irreverencies and John McKenzie's total involvement with his church have given substance and flair to considerations elsewhere often pure froth or painfully esoteric. By John L. McKenzie. 222 pp. Chicago: The Thomas More Press. $7.95. “Did I Say That?” is a collection of 31 brief essays from John McKenzie's Q.E.D. column, 1966 through 1972. One expects then the usual potpourri of religious controversy, abortion through zeal (excess or, cf. Pentecostalism). Not so. McKenzie, who early on admits his uncertainty about abortion, for instance, sticks close to his last. He is first and foremost a Scripture scholar, and most of his writing stands firmly astride the New Testament. Secondly he is concerned with the key question of authority in the church on which he wrote a moderately controversial book in 1966 (“Authority in the Church,” Sheed & Ward, cloth $3.95; Doubleday, $1.25). To McKenzie it is obvious that the sole basis of the church's authority is in the New Testament. Any misuse of that authority is a mark of deviation from the clear and simple message of Jesus, a message of love. “Treating persons as things” is McKenzie's particular agony, and examples of dehumanizing uses of authority, secular and ecclesiastical, abound in his essays. His strictest criticism is directed at those who exercise authority in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. In an essay on the decline in numbers of vocations, he flings the gantlet back at those in power who see today's youth as unfit for the rigors of religious life. “His holiness, with the self‐pity characteristic of the hierarchy, has said it is not easy to rule a diocese. In dioceses like Washington, San Antonio, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and St. Louis, it is still easier to rule a diocese than to be ruled in it.” In many of these essays, Mc Kenzie writes with similar strength of purpose: on the question of magisterium, the teaching authority of the church, and academic freedom; in the matter of “defection” from the clerical ranks, especially that of James Kavanaugh whose voice, McKenzie feels, may have been too shrill but whose values were sound indeed. He praises him with telling irony: “Sometimes in his twisted mind he has got the idea that every person is sacred, and that all human persons are equally sacred.” The birth control encyclical, “Humanae Vitae,” he sees as another Galileo case so far removed from the consensus that again must the Roman Catholic Church be judged harshly now and in the future. Its imperious resistance to change he condemns for the moral harm clone to a generation told to wait while the church moves with ponderous deliberation. Where there is an observable evil — the war in Vietnam—it must be removed swiftly, surgically. Unless liberated enough to be nostalgic about them, those of us conditioned by required college theology courses will suffer a certain queasiness with his arguments citing natural law or that old bugbear, concupiscence. What manner of today's priest is this McKenzie who shies from four‐letter words, who thinks there's been too much said already (by the clergy) about sex, who refuses to leave the church for a successful career in publishing? Well, he is clear‐headed and people‐centered—and so what if his theological terminology creaks a bit? His ideas do not. He recognizes that the church and its organization are not one and the same, that criticizing the hierarchy is not subverting the word of God, and he has the wit, crustiness, and wisdom to furrow a few brows in the process. ■"
Cooke Warns Catholics on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/08/archives/cooke-warns-catholics-on-abortions-cardinals-message.html,"Cardinal Cooke warned Roman Catholics yesterday that any involvement with abortion would mean automatic excommunication. The prelate voiced his warning in a rare pulpit appearance at St. Patrick's Cathedral (the Cardinal always presides at a mass when he is in the city, but rarely delivers the sermon). An aide said the Cardinal deliberately took to the pulpit to emphasize his opposition to abortion and, in addition, to open formally the Church's “Respect Life” program, which began yesterday in 160 dioceses and 18,000 parishes across the country. The antiabortion project will continue into 1974 with rallies, youth programs and special masses throughout the country. Cardinal's Message The Cardinal, who is also chairman of the Respect Life Committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, called upon 2,000 worshipers in the Cathedral to “consider our immediate moral obligations.” “Putting aside the public debate for a moment,” he deGlared, “we remind ourselves emphatically that any association with an immoral abortion, for any reason, is a grave personal sin. No state law can change that. “Nor can any convenience — psychological, matrimonial, economic, cultural or social —permit any Catholic to perform, undergo or encourage a direct abortion. To do so is to commit a grave personal and social sin against God and humanity. In so doing so a person separates himself from the Catholic community and cornmunion.” Automatic excommunication, or separation from the sacraments of the church, occurs when a person knowingly cornmits a sin. A person automatically excommunicated “incurs” the censure by just perpetrating the sin. However, a sentence of excommunication is “inflicted” by a competent authority such as the Pope or a bishop. “Catholics must not be misled,” the Cardinal said. “There is no ‘new theology’ on abortion. An informed Catholic conscience can never tolerate the direct destruction of ipnocent human life. It is a serious and heinous sin for any Catholic—priest or doctor, parent, husband or friend — to encourage a girl to undergo an abortion. “If we oppose unjust wars, criminal assassinations, political murders and terrorist hijacking; if we move against life‐damaging poverty, poilution, hunger and neglect, then we must not condone abortion. I ask you all to join me in prayer today that innocent life, in every form, will be made safe in this nation.” The Cardinal also called upon the United States Senate and the House of Representatives to start action on proposed constitutional amendments designed to overturn the Supreme Court decision of last Jan. 22 that overruled all state laws prohibiting or restricting a woman's right to obtain an abortion during her first three months of pregnancy."

EPISCOPAL CANON ON DIVORCE EASED,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/10/archives/episcopal-canon-on-divorce-eased-church-parley-liberalizes-rules.html,"LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 9—Threats of excommunication and long waiting periods for divorced persons seeking remarriage were deleted today from the Canons of the Episcopal Church. With emphasis on the role of pariih priests rather than bishops in granting approval for remarriages, the church's 64th general convention here significantly liberalized church remarriage laws, which were previously revised 25 years ago. For the first time in the denomination's 200‐year history, the Episcopal Church now recognizes civil divorce. The decisions approved today dropped previous requirements for remarriages that first marriages must be held in judgment by a bishop and that one of the couple must be a “member in good standing of the church.” The convention also eliminated the former requirement of a one‐year waiting period before remarriage after divorce could be considered. In the past, refusal to comply with any of these directives has been cause for excommunication from the sacraments of the church. Pastoral Role The revisions name parish priests as the primary pastors in decisions on remarriages and they may now perform the ceremony for any couple where “at least one of the parties has received holy baptism.” While the priests may perform this rite whenever they choose, Episcopal bishops were charged to be wary of “Marrying Sams” in their dioceses. The changes “won final approval today by the Episcopal House of Deputies, one house of the bicameral convention, after gaing approval yesterday by the House of Bishops. The Right Rev, Ned Cole Jr., Bishop of central New York, praised the changes for reflecting “a more pastoral, more prompt and more human” attitude by the church toward second marriages. In other convention action, the House of Deputies approved a $13,625,732 budget for 1974, with ecumenism emerging as the only victor in attempts by various delegates for reapportionment of alloted funds. Increase Allocated By a margin of four votes the, 756 lay and clerical deputies approved a motion to add, $65,000 for the church's participation in the World and National Councils of Cluticlies ands the Consutation on Church Union. This funding was requested in a public statement by the Right Rev. John M. Allin, Bish op of Mississippi, who was elected Thursday the new Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church. A motion to increase churchbudgeted funds for black colleges was soundly defeated. The new budget, which is a $1‐million increase over the 1973 budget, was adjusted to fit priorities recommended by the dioceses in a massive information‐gathering process last year. It goes to the House of Bishops for concurrence and frriat approval, which is expected tomorrow. Still to be debated before the convention adjourns on Thursday are the issues of amnesty for draft evaders and abortion."
Sandman Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/10/archives/sandman-campaign-candidates-hard-line-on-the-issues-and-a-fund.html,"TRENTON, Oct. 9—How can the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey, a formidable campaigner who seems to have all the big issues going for him, also seem to be trailing badly in the election that is four weeks from today? The question is beginning haunt some of New Jersey's leading Republicans and plague some of Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr.'s most vociferous supporters. News Analysis Mr. Sandman approached the first days of October convinced that a campaign blitz during the final three or four weeks before the election would erase any early lead ascribed to the Democratic candidate, Brendan T. Byrne. But the evidence available here tonight, in the opinion of political leaders from both parties, was that the Sandman strategy was being undermined in at least three different areas and thwarted, in part, by a Democratic campaign that had initially sought to portray the conservative Republican as a right‐wing extremist who had divided his party. Money a Problem For one thing, Mr. Sandman and his principal political adviser, S. Clifton White, are counting heavily on a television‐media saturation campaign to reach the large numbers of voters that would be required to reverse what is now believed to be a substantial Democratic lead. But television commercials are expensive and the Sandman campaign is having enormous problems raising funds. For another, the Sandman campaign apparatus has been described as politically disastrous in some respects and it has undergone a major upheaval during the last few days, in an effort to reorganize it for the final drive of the campaign. However, some Republicans believe that the upheaval may have come too late. In addition, the Sandman campaign strategy, as laid out by Mr. White, is based on the premise that all a candidate must do to win in New Jersey is come down hard on the popular side of all the issues that seem to have the state's voters on edge. These, of course, would include such issues as busing, narcotics and crime in the streets, taxs, abortion and capital punishment. A Negative Reaction One Republican leader explained it this way: “Charlie Sandman believes that New Jersey is one big erogenous zone and that all anyone has to do to get a favorable reaction is to touch it in the right places.” But even Sandman campaign officials acknowledged privately today that their candidate's hard line on the issues had developed a strident edge that was picking up negative reactions from Republican voters in such key areas as Bergen and Morris Counties. With this in mind, the Cape May conservative is now making a conscious effort to ameliorate his appeals to the fears and angers of those voters whom Mr. White has designated as the peripheral urban ethnic, or the blue‐collar white residents of older neighborhoods near cities, who feel abandoned by the political system and threatened by blacks. Mr. White, who succeeded in helping Senator Barry Goldwater win the Republican Presidential nomination and in electing a series of conservative Republican candidates in recent years, has concentrated he Sandman campaign in these areas in an effort to exploit the new Nixon majority and what he and other politicians perceive as a swing, to the right in the country. But there have been some second thoughts. For example, Sandman officials consistently agreed that the highly volatile issue of the stalled Kawaida Towers housing project in New ark was “the” perfect issue for their candidate. It would they said, give the Republica a dramatic vehicle to exploit his opposition to the forced encroachment of low‐income (black) housing in predominantly white neighborhoods in New Jersey. It was one more gut issue, they reasoned, that Mr. Sandman would have all to himself. However, Mr. White and Mr. Sandman have apparently concluded that the Kawaida Towers issue is too hot to handle and they were reported today to have no plans at the moment to attempt to exploit it. On the other issues, though, the Sandman: strategy has been unequivocal: it is dead set against a state income tax and abortion, and against any zoning reforms that would in any way violate New Jersey's historically strong concept of local home rule. At the same time, Mr. Sand man has come out strongly fo state aid to parochial schools, which is not a bad position in this state, in which the majority of voters are believed to be Roman Catholics. The Republican also is calling for whit amounts to martial law in the streets. On every issue, then, Mr. Sandman has attempted to monopolize what even the Democrats readily concede to be the most popular side of the major issues. Byrne Shifts Stance At the same time, however Mr. Sandman's conservative approach to the issue's has enabled Mr. Byrne to assume moderate, ever right‐of‐center positions that would have been denied him had he opposed a more traditional Republican candidate, such as Governor Cahill. For example, in his latest two shifts, Mr. Byrne now is calling for a public hearing on an amendment to the United States Constitution that would outlaw abortions, thus bringing him much closer to Mr. Sandman's position. Moreover, to day Mr. Byrne even chide judicial zoning decisions that infringed upon home rule. Byrne strategists, such as Richard C. Leone, the Democratic campaign manager, are convinced that they have such ceeded in making Mr. Sandman the major issue in the election, and by doing so they have superimposed an image of a divisive candidate upon a state that is regarded as essentially moderate in its elections. As for the Sandman campaign, it is being masterminded from Westchester. County by Mr. White, who admittedly knows very little about internal New Jersey politics but a lot about what motivates voters. On a day‐to‐day basis, campaign operations and tactics have been overseen by a group of Sandman supporters, not one of whom has ever been involved in a leadership postion in a statewide election in New Jersey. As a result, campaign schedules have been scrambled, press releases lost, and the feeling. of local Republicans unnecessarily hurt, All this is in contrast with a Democratic campaign that is acknowledged by senior Democratic party lead ers in Washington to be one of the most professional ever mounted in the state."
WOMAN RUNNING FOR CHURN POST,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/13/archives/woman-running-for-church-post-national-council-expected-to-pick.html,"A 53‐year‐old theologian and ecumenist who is also a champion of women's rights stands a good chance of becoming the first woman general secretary of the National Council of Churches. She is Claire Randall, executive director of Church Women United, a national movement of Protestants, Roman Catholics land. Eastern Orthodox, to the development of Christian unity through cooperative action and fellowship. Miss Randall was officially nominated yesterday to the secretaryship, one of the highest posts American religious organizations have to offer, at a meeting of the council's governing board in the Statler Hilton Hotel. Her name was presented by a special search committee as its only nominee. Ohio Pastor Her Opponent But she will he opposed in today's election by the Rev. Albert M. Pennybacker, 42‐year‐old senior pastor of the Heights Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Dr. Pennybacker, whose former pulpits were in Youngstown; Ohio, and Norwich, Conn., was nominated from the floor in what many members of the 350‐member policymaking board regarded as a surprise move. Some delegates representing the Eastern Orthodox churches privately expressed dissatisfaction yesterday wtih the naming of Miss Randall because of her chairmanship of a national council task force that developed a pro‐abortion study paper now being distributed to the organization's member denominations. Today's balloting will select the successor to Dr. R. H. Edwin Espy, general secretary of the church council for the last 10 years. Dr. Espy will retire at the end of this year, having reached the age of 65. A testimonial dinner in his honor was held last night at the Riversid Church, Riverside Drive and 120th Street. Bishop Paul A. Washburn. chairman of the 21‐member search committee, described Miss Randall as “a woman of strong, problem‐solving capacity, possessing a superior intelligence and an analytic, perceptive and innovative mind.” She joined the staff of Church Women United in 1962 when the organization was administratively a part of the national council. In 1971, it became autonomous with recognition by the national council as a “related” movement. A native of San Antonio, Miss Randall served two of that city's Presbyterian churches as director of Christian education. She attended the San An tonio Art Institute and Schreiner Institute, a small Southern Presbyterian junior college in Kerrville, Texas. Miss Randall graduated from Scarritt College in Nashville, a United Methodist institution that concentrated on the training of missionaires, and she also attended the Presbyterian School of Christian Education in Richmond, Va. The Rev. A. Dale Fiers of the Disciples of Christ denomination put Dr. Pennybacker's name in nomination. He described the nominee as “theologically competent and socially sensitive” with a “comprehensive understanding of church structure and fuctions.” Dr. Pennybacker is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and holds a Bachelcir of Divinity degree from Yale University. Last year, Miss Randall directed a conference of some 70 women, drawn from all parts of the country, who were either studying or teaching theology and who were also searching for new understandings of what it meant to be a woman in that discipline. “We found that when women were free to explore theology from their own experience, it opened up new approaches to theology in terms of both form and content,” she reported later. “Women are able to do a kind of communal theologizing, bouncing off ideas with each other and combining experience with intellectual approaches,” she said."
Woman Is Elected to Top Post In National Council of Churches,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/14/archives/woman-is-elected-to-top-post-in-national-council-of-churches-the.html,"For the first time, the National Council of Churches yes. terday elected a woman as its general secretary, one of the highest and most prestigious religious posts in the United States. She is Claire Randall, a theologian and ecumenist who will be 54 years old tomorrow, shoots golf in the 90's and occasionally plays a game of touch football with her church team in Central Park. Miss Randall was named the chief administrative officer at a meeting of the council's governing board in the Statler Hilton Hotel. The Council is a federation of 30 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations in the United States. She defeated the Rev. Albert M. Pennybacker, senior pastor of the Heights Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Shaker Heights, Ohio, by a vote of 110 to 61. The Opposition The unexpectedly large number of opposition ballots were apparently cast by the more conservative board members and by Eastern Orthodox delegates who had privately categorized her as an “advocate of abortion.” Miss Randall will succeed Dr. R. H. Edwin Espy, who had served the council as general secretary for the last 10 years. lie will retire Dec. 31, having reached the age of 65. In an interview following her election, Miss Randall said her lope for the future would be make the council “increasngly open and inclusive so that the various denominations night work together in closer harmony to help the needy and the wounded.” She emphasized that she would welcome Roman Catholic membership in the Council, negotiations for which have been on and off for some time. Previous Post Miss Randall comes to her new position from the post of associate executive director of Church Women United, where she brought together Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox women in a wide variety of tasks designed to raise a national “consciousness” about the role of women in religion. Her close associates describe her as “hard driving” in both work and relaxation. When in the city, she swims regularly at a private pool near her West Side apartment and does yoga exercises when circumstances permit. She plays touch football at “fun” games conducted by her local church, Good Shepherd‐Faith Presbyterian at 152 West 66th Street. Asked to comment on her chairmanship of a National Council Task Force on abortion that developed a study paper on the attitudes of the major church bodies on the subject, she emphasized that abortion was only one of the issues facing religion today and “not the major nor the only issue.” One of Miss Randall's loves is art. She attended the Art Institute in San Antonio, her home city and was for a time art director for the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. (Southern)."
Justices Bar Hargis Tax Plea; Religious Groups Fear Impact,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/14/archives/justices-bar-hargis-tax-plea-religious-groups-fear-impact-brief-was.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 13—The Supreme Court rejected this week an appeal that sought to restore the tax exemption of the Rev. Billy Hargis and his Christian Crusade. Eight Justices voted against considering Mr. Hargis's appeal of a decision handed down by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver. Only Justice William O. Douglas voted in the affirmative. The assent of four Justices is required to place a case on the docket. Importance of Case Almost every major Protestant and Jewish organization in the nation had supported Mr. Hargis's appeal, despite their antipathy to his ultraconservative theology and his flamboyant anti‐Communist campaigns. The Hargis case was considered important to religions organizations because it involved their right to become involved in public issues while retaining tax exemptions. In a statement issued from his Tulsa office, Mr. Hargis said the court decision marked la “sad day for all religion.” “Freedom of speech and freedom to worship God according to the dictates of our conscience ended today,” he declared. The Rev. Dean M. Kelley, director of civil and religious liberties for the National Council of Churches, said the Court had given the Internal Revenue Service “a blank check to harass religious groups with unpopular views.” Brief Was Filed Last April, the national council filed a friend of the court brief urging the Supreme Court to rule on the case and to restore tax‐exempt status to Mr. Hargis's ministry. In 1962, Internal Revenue challenged the exemption of Christian Echoes, the corporate entity of Christian Crusade, on the ground that its radio programs and periodicals went beyond the limits of the tax code. That code bars those enjoying tax exemption from “substantial” involvement in lobbying. “If a minister can no longer preach on any issue that involves legislation,” Mr. Kelley said, “then he cannot take a stand for or against abortion, for or against capital punishment or any other national moral issue and enjoy taxexempt status.”"
Some Mystic Shops Protest ‘Blue Laws’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/15/archives/some-mystic-shopsprotest-bluelaws-some-merchants-in-mystic-protest.html,"MYSTIC, Conn., Oct. 14—A group of shopkeepers here appears resolved to do business on Sundays in defiance of Connecticut's “blue laws,” or to force others, including some of the biggest employers in the state, to shut down on Sundays too. In Circuit Court in New London Thursday, 11 of the offending merchants were each fined $25 for each Sunday in the last two months on which someone found them selling things and complained. There were 19 occasions, and 19 fines, and Joseph D. Reardon of Old Saybrook, the group's lawyer, said they would appeal. They have also asked that a Federal Court declare the Sunday laws unconstitutional, on the ground that the laws are unevenly applied. A hearing is scheduled in Federal District Court in New Haven tomorrow. The merchants all have shops in Olde Mistick Village, a new cluster of two dozen shops, mostly selling trinkets and hand‐crafted things that appeal to tourists and Sunday drivers. The shopping complex was built to resemble a colonial village, and lies between the Connecticut Turnpike and Mystic, one of the main tourist attractions in Connecticut. Since the warrants against the shopkeepers in Olde Mistick Village started coming in, they have retaliated by lodging complaints against shops in Mystic and elsewhere that stayed open on Sundays. A couple of them have since stayed closed on Sundays. Joyce Regan, the manager and part‐owner of Olde Mistick Village, has tried to lodge complaints against two Groton companies—the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, which makes submarines, and the Charles Pfizer Company, the maker of pharmaceuticals — and against the Dow Chemical Company of Gales Ferry. Together the three companies employ 16,700 people in this southeastern corner of Connecticut. “He said he tore up my complaint,” Mrs. Regan said of New London County's chief prosecutor, Harold B. Dean. He had not torn them up. They were still in his desk drawer last week. Mr. Dean simply had not issued warrants against the three big companies because, in his opinion, the. Sunday operations at Dow and Pfizer fall under the provision of the law that exempts “... commercial operations or industrial processes as by their nature are required to be continuous.” He had taken it upon himself to exempt Electric Boat, which is now gearing up for at least a part of a three‐year Navy contract to build 10 nuclear‐armed Trident submarines. “I recognize that the national defense of the country is more important than any of these laws,” Mr. Dean said. The “blue laws” are religious in origin and have their roots in the strong puritanical influence among colonial Americans. In 1648, Puritan leaders in Connecticut published the restrictive laws in blue paper bindings, hence the name “blue laws.” What Laws Said In 1781 the Rev. Samuel A. Peters published a list of them in his “History of Connecticut:” “No one shall run on the Sabbath Day or walk in the garden or elsewhere, except reverently to and from meeting. “No one shall travel, cook victuals, make beds, sweep house, cut hair, or shave, on the Sabbath. “No woman shall kiss her child on the Sabbath or fasting day. “No one shall read. Common Prayer, keep Christmas or Saints'‐days, make minced pies, dance, play cards, or play on any instrument of music, except the drum, the trumpet, and Jews‐harp ...” The last of these reflected the early Puritans' aversion to stringed instruments and to the organ. Most of the “blue laws” have fallen away over the centuries, and are still under criticism from Seventh Day Adventists, Jews and others whose sabbath is not on Sunday, and from businessmen for whom Sunday has become a major shopping day. The restrictive Sunday laws still exist in about 30 states, including Connecticut, where it is against the law to sell or display for sale anything on Sunday except these: Dairy and fresh agricultural products, fruits, confectionary and horticultural items, tobacco and smokers' supplies, ice, icecream, nonalcoholic beverages, antiques, newspaper and magazines, drugs and medical supplies and repair parts for motor vehicles. ‘It's Ridiculous’ “It's all right to have an abortion on Sunday,” Maraine Meszaros said with bitter reference to the recentlyoverturned Connecticut abortion law. She is the proprietor of the Yankee Drummer, a gift shop in Olde Mistic Village. “By contrast, to have a law saying you can't sell something — it's ridiculous,” Mrs. Meszaros said. In most places in the state the violations are ignored, except during the Christmas shopping season, when the big department stores demand that the law be enforced against the drug stores and others that sell toys and other gifts in great quantities on those last few Sundays before Christmas. The big stores would like to avoid paying overtime for Sunday work, especially if they know the shoppers will be in on Monday anyway. The drug stores in Connecticut, when taken to court, have quietly paid their fines, which never exceed $50, and continued to do business on busy, pre‐Christmas Sundays. ‘Form of Entertainment’ But the picture has been complicated in recent years by the growth of suburban shopping centers, especially those that depend heavily, once the summer tourist season is over, on the families that happen by on a Sunday. “Our style of living today is different,” said Mrs. Regan. “This type of shopping is a form of entertainment,” said Mrs. Meszaros. “People get very upset if we're not open,” said Robert Goffin, who runs the Green Onion, a shop in the village with pots and pans and oddments for the kitchen. “People bring their, friends and everything out here, and we're not open.” At the Yankee Drummer, Mrs. Meszaros suggested it might have been easier and cheaper in the long run to go on paying the fines rather than to hire lawyers to fight the matter out in court. “Presumably it mouldn't go on forever,” she said. “What's it going to cost to fight it?” she asked. “Forget it.” Mrs. Regan was angry that the campaign against Sunday sales was being directed only against Olde Mistic Village. “I'd respect them if they went right across the state and did it,” she said “They're just doing it to us.” Originator of Complaints The man actually lodging the complaints against the shops in the village was Jose Fuentes of Westport, the director of Loss Prevention and Inventory Control for Davidson & Leventhal, a department store group based in Bridgeport. The group owns the Weathervane, a clothing store in the village. It stays closed on Sundays. Mr. Fuentes said in Circuit Court that he had not been instructed by his employers to keep an eye on the shops in the village and lodge complaints against those opening on Sundays. “No, they did not instruct me to do it,” he said. “I was not forced. I was not told you have to do it.” Outside the courtroom, Mr. Fuentes said that before he had taken on United States citizenship, he had been a Cuban, watching his country being torn apart by revolution largely because of a widespread disrespect for the law. “What these people here are doing is against the law,” Mr. Fuentes said. “We do not like to be in a place where everybody else is breaking the law.” “In essence, he's playing God,” Mrs. Regan said. “An individual can stymie any group just by making a complaint.” She has begun lodging complaints against outside businesses only to show the injustice of it, she said. She is toying with the idea of going to a New York Giants game in the Yale Bowl in New Haven to see what complaints she might lodge there. “What about the Danbury State Fair,” asked Monroe Green, part‐owner of the Potpourri, another gift shop in the village. “It's the biggest thing in the State of Connecticut. That's also against the law.” “If you allow them to go around and pick their shots, what kind of a law is this?” he asked."
"Wood, C. B. S.‐TV Head, Defends ‘Mature’ Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/16/archives/wood-cbstv-head-defends-mature-shows.html,"Robert D. Wood, president of the Columbia Broadcasting System's television network, defended the presentation of controversial entertainment programing in a speech prepared for delivery to the Better Business Bureau in Nashville this afternoon. Mr. Wood said the mature subject matter of certain programs that some viewers have found objectionble grows out of a C.B.S. commitment to “participate in the present” and to raise television from the escapist, lowest‐common‐denominator mentality that had earned the medium the reputation “vast wasteland.” In his address Mr. Wood stated that, in recognition of the changing tastes and standards of society and the growing maturity of audiences, C.B.S. had been taking certain calculated risks with programs it expected would be controversial. He cited as recent examples the two‐part episode on abortion in the “Maude” series; the Ingmar Bergman drama dealing with marital infidelity, “The Lie”; the bitter David Rabe play, “Sticks and Bones,” about a blinded G.I. returning from Vietnam, and such adult motion pictures as “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “In Cold Blood.” The network has been criticized in mail from viewers for all of them, but, Mr. Wood points out, it used to be criticized, before striking out in its new direction, “for being dull, for trafficking in escapist literature [and] for ignoring the basic issues in our society.” Moreover, he said, the number of letters deploring the network's presentation of mature subjects was relatively small considering the size of the audience for each program. When the “Maude” abortion programs were first presented they drew 7,000 letters of protest and, when repeated last summer, they drew 17,000 more. “At first glance 24,0U0 critical letters may seem to be a public outcry,” Mr. Wood said, “But actually In television terms the number must be considered insignificant. An estimated 65 million people watched at least one of the four broadcasts ... and keep in mind that these 24,000 letters represented the fruits of one of the most highly organized, all‐out, nationwide campaigns ever mounted against a particular program.” His reference is to antiabortion organizations, led by the National Catholic Conference. “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” played to an audience of 33 million viewers, but C.B.S. received only 1,200 letters of criticism, Mr. Wood said, while for “Sticks and Bones” the network received only 1,075 letters, and more than half of them were congratulatory. (That program, adapted from the stage and produced by Joseph Papp, did not command a large television audience, chiefly because nearly one–third of the C.B.S. affiliated stations declined to carry it.) The film of Truman Capote's “In Cold Blood” produced fewer than 200 letters of protest, but its total audience was reported as 42 million. Mr. Wood said that although C.B.S. did not disregard the letters—each is tabulated, forwarded to an appropriate executive and answered — it was careful not to overreact to them. “Part of being fully responsive to our public,” he said, “is to make sure that we do not allow a small, vocal and, at times, highly organized minority to determine what can be seen on your television set. If we fell into this trap we might be easily led to ban presentday equivalents of such literary classics as Nathaniel Hawthorne's ‘The Scarlet Letter,’ Charlotte Bronte's ‘Jane Eyre,’ George Bernard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's Profession Theodore Dreiser's ‘An American Tragedy,’ Emile Zola's ‘Nana,’ even Walt Whitman's ‘Leaves of Grass.’” Public Broadcasting To Open a Meeting WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 (AP) —The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced today that its board of directors has decided to open one of its meetings to the public for the first time. The decision was made by a vote of the board taken at its monthly meeting in Boston today. The board said it would accept written comments, statements of any length and brief verbal comments at the board meeting here on Noy. 8. Those wishing to appear before the board may apply in advance by telephone or writing to the corporation office here in advance, or in person on the day of the meeting. The meeting will not be a question and answer session but rather a forum to hear the view of various groups and individuals interested in public broadcasting. Travelers Underwrites ‘Primal Man’ Series The Travelers Insurance Company of Hartford has agreed to underwrite the research and development of television specials as well as future movies to be produced by Atticus Productions, the company headed by Gregory Peck. The first project is a series of one‐hour TV shows, generally titled “Primal Man,” dealing with the 2‐million‐year development of man's behavior. The first chapter in the series created by the Wolper organization, “The Killer Instinct,” is slated for showing on the American Broadcasting Company network on Dec. 2."
Candidates' Day,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/17/archives/blumenthal-snubbed-for-smith-dinner-candidates-day-blumenthal.html,"Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal was the only mayoral candidate not invited to the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation dinner scheduled for tomorrow night. Both Mr. Blumenthal and his press secretary interpreted the absence of an invitation from the Roman Catholic organization as a rebuke because of Mr. Blumenthal's sponsorship of the New York State abortion law. Msgr. Eugene Clark, public relations director of the New York archdiocese, said, however, that this was not the reason. He said that Mr. Blumenthal has not been invited because he had not been a subsciber to the foundation and its annual dinner in the past. He denied, in response to a question, that Mr. Blumenthal's sponsorship of liberalized abortion legislation was, a factor in the noninvitation. However, Mr. Blumenthal's press secretary, Mark Corrigan, who is a Catholic priest, said that Mr. Blumenthal did attend the Al Smith dinner last year, a celebration that has traditionally been a showcase, for political candidates while helping to raise funds for private hospitals. Blumenthal Saddened After he learned he had not been invited to this year's dinner, Mr. Blumenthal said: “I am proud of the leadership role that I played in changing, the abortion law. I am saddened by an attitude that does not permit diversity of belief in a multireligious, multiracial and multiethnic city. But if my leadership in the struggle for freedom of choice among women means I am to be penalized for that role, so be it.” Msgr. Patrick F. Raftery, who, until this year, had organized the Al Smith dinner, said that in his experience, guests did not have to be regular subscribers to the foundation or the dinner to attend. “It was nothing closed out at all, said Monsignor Raftery, going on to express surprise that Mr. Blumenthal had not been invited. The monsignor said that usually in years past all the major mayoral candidates had been invited, “and some of those who came did not pay.” Charles H. Silver, who has been chairman of the dinner for many years, also said that a person did not have to be a regular subscriber to the dinner or the foundation to be invited. When asked why Mr. Blumenthal had not been invited to this year's dinner, which will be held at the Waldorf‐Astoria, Mr. Silver said he knew “nothing about that.” Cardinal Cooke, the official host of the dinner, was criticized by antiabortionists last year after he invited Governor Rockefeller to the dinner. Abortion foes were angry at the Governor for his veto of a bill that would have repealed the liberal 1970 abortion law sponsored by Mr. Blumenthal. The Governor has been invited to the dinner again this year, along with scores of other public officials, including Mayor Lindsay and Mr. Blumenthal's three major opponents, all of whom will sit on the dais with the Cardinal."
Bishop Urges 4 in Race To End ‘Manhattanopia’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/17/archives/bishop-urges-4-in-race-to-end-manhattanopia-bishop-asks-4-in.html,"The Most Rev. Francis J. Mugavero, Roman Catholic Bishop of Brooklyn, has called on the four mayoral candidates to pay attention to the needs of Brooklyn and Queens, not just Manhattan. In an unusual open letter made public yesterday, Bishop Mugavero said the residents of Brooklyn and Queens—which his diocese covers — “complainthat the city suffers from ‘Manhattanopia.’” “They see neighborhoods like Bushwick and Brownsville decaying, buildings burning, areas demolished and no evident concern at the highest level of government to preserve their neighborhoods,” the prelate said. Bishop Mugavero is regarded as one of the more politically sophisticated members of the hierarchy in the local area in matters of social welfare as well as traditionally Catholic issues. Spokesmen said at a news conference that they knew of no other time that a Catholic Bishop here had made such a statement involving politics It reflects a new campaign to get the 1.6 million parishioners of the diocese involved in the political process. As a start, the diocese's Committee on Civic and Political Education, formed last February, has held meetings with representatives from the five vicariates into which the diocese is divided. One of the topics was school‐board elections. A future one will be the city budget. The committee has persuaded 80 of the diocese's 240 parishes to form political‐education committees. And it has arranged two forums next week at which all four candidates are expected to address parish representatives. The forums, open to the public, are to be held at Bishop Ford High School, 500 19th Street, in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, next Tuesday at 8 P.M. and at Bishop Reilly High School, 6100 Francis Lewis Boulevard, Fresh Meadows, Queens, next Thursday at 8 P.M. “We're not trying to start a Catholic party or a Catholic lobby or anything of that nature,” emphasized the Rev. Joseph M. Sullivan, director of Catholic Charities. He said he would be happy to see Jewish and Protestant groups start a !similar effort, and he indicated joint efforts might be a future possibility. Inspired by a 1971 papal letter urging the participation of Christians in all levels of a free society, the diocese analyzed the two boroughs a few months ago, using census and Board of Elections records. “We discovered a tremendous voter apathy,” said the Rev. Robert P. Kennedy, director of the social action department of Brooklyn Catholic Charities. Father Sullivan said: “Large numbers of blacks and Puerto Ricans do not vote. Young people are not voting. The aging are not voting. We're not interested in what party they are members of but in attainan informed Christian social ethic. We will help them get informed.” Acknowledging that one of the four mayoral candidates—Assemblyman Albert H. Blumen. thal—had opposed the Catholic position on abortion and aid to parochial schools, Father Sul ivan said this would hardly be a reason not to “dialogue with a man of great intelligence, great values that maybe are different from our own.” In his open letter, Bishop Mugavero said his parishioners sought “a government that is free and open and not an instrument of special interest groups, be they economic, religious or ethnic. “Unfortunately,” he went on, “many have lost confidence in the electoral process, in the government's responsiveness to their problems and in the quality and availability of public programs and service.” The Bishop cited this loss as one of nine problems “I have heard expressed on this side of the East River,” to which he asked the candidates to address themselves. The other, problems, he said, are services for the aging, health care, education, crime, neighborhood tensions, employment and housing, revenue‐sharing and transportaion."

An Apathetic Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/18/archives/an-apathetic-campaign-coolness-by-new-jersey-voters-could-hurt.html,"News Analysis TRENTON, Oct. 17—Apathy is nothing new in New Jersey election campaigns. But in this year of the Watergate scandal and the Agnew resignation, political leaders from both parties say public interest in the campaign for Governor and legislative elections is at a record low. Because the record shows that Democratic voters traditionally tend to be more apathetic than Republicans, the political depression politicans perceive in New Jersey has come to represent a major threat to Brendan T. Byrne, the Democratic candidate for Governor. With the election three weeks away, Mr. Byrne is widely acknowledged to be leading his Republican opponent, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. However, a leading New Jersey Democrat explained Mr. Byrne's problem today: “If nobody votes, how the hell can Brendan win or Charlie Sandman lose?” Strategists from both campaigns had prepared all along for an unusually low turnout on Nov. 6—the Democrats with a growing sense of trepidation. Both Parties Affected For one thing, scandals have plagued both parties in New Jersey. The most recently Republican ones were primarily responsible for Mr. Byrne's becoming a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination; they also enabled Mr. Sandman to exploit his conservative positions and defeat Governor Cahill in the Republican primary. Perhaps New Jersey's internal scandals would have been enough by themselves to turn people off. But the political hangover that politicians perceive here has been compounded by Watergate and the recent plea bargaining and resignation of Spiro T. Agnew as Vice President. “If it only generated some kind of outrage, then maybe we could do something about that,” a local Democratic campaign worker in Bergen County remarked. “But how do you cope with empty rooms, people who simply won't listen, how do you deal with nothingness?” One Bergen County Democratic legislator has told friends that he has simply stopped ad hoc campaigning in supermarkets because the public reaction has been so hostile as to be counterproductive. According to his own advisers, Mr. Byrne has himself to blame if his campaign has failed. At the beginning, the Democrat sought to deprive Mr. Sandman of any clearcut distinction on the major issues by moving as close to the Republican's conservative posture as his moderate Democratic conscience would allow. Current Strategy In other words, the current strategy has been to make Mr. Sandman and his positions on the issues the major issue in the campaign, a strategy that tends to rob it of the personal ideological clashes that are invariably a prerequisite to any public interest. While Mr. Sandman's widely publicized opposition to a state income tax, abortion, forced busing and any encroachment on local home rule is strong political stuff, it still requires an opposing argument to generate any fire, and Mr. Sandman and Mr. Byrne both know it. However, Mr. Byrne has apparently concluded that he has more to lose by confronting Mr. Sandman on the issues than he has by any Democratic attrition at the polls generated by the apathy that is implicit in his decision to lay low. A normal turnout in the gubernatorial election is about 73 per cent of the voters. Current estimates of the turnout next month are about 70 per cent, with some estimates as low as 65 per cent. Polls Cited Since Republicans turn out in larger numbers proportionately than Democrats, the attrition would seem to favor Mr. Sandman. However, his own polls and surveys taken by the Democrats have discovered an unusually heavy resistance to vote among higher‐income, predominantly Republican areas in such places as Bergen and Morris counties. Should that resistance persist, Democrats believe it would counterbalance their inability to galvanize the black vote in the cities or maximize their following among the same bluecollar whites that have become a major target of Mr. Sandman's efforts."
FORD ON THE DAIS AT SMITH DINNER,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/19/archives/ford-on-the-dais-at-smith-dinner-vice-president-designate-says-aim.html,"Vice President‐designate Gerald R. Ford pledged last night to work toward ending “partisanship and polarization” in relations between President Nixon and the Congress. Representative Ford made the pledge in remarks he delivered as the last‐minute guest speaker at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, the annual prestigious blend of politics and philanthropy at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. While some observers feel the dinner had lost some of its political edge in recent years since the death of Cardinal Spellman, the sudden addition of Mr. Ford to the affair amounted to a coup, for the dinner sponsors noted that it was his first. New York appearance since President Nixon nominated him to be Vice President. 81st on the Dais Mr. Ford was the 81st memher of the dais, which traditionally has been watched by political analysts the way Kremlinologists study the lineup atop Lenin's mausoleum during Moscow's May Day parade. This year's seemed one of the quieter affairs. The guests—some of them wondering about the Mets game—trailed into the grand ballroom with rounds of handshakes for old friends. The one unplanned event had a ludicrous quality as a man in brown dungarees showed up, identifying himself as David Burnham, a “photographer and scuba diver,” and slapped—literally, on the head—State Senator Harrison J. Goldin of the Bronx—with a subpoena at the entrance way. Mr. Goldin was speechless about the incident, which Mr. Burnham said involved an unpaid campaign bill for labels. In years past, the presence and relative prominence of mayoral and Presidential candidates was closely measured as a possible inkling of Cardinal Spellman's personal preferences. With Cardinal Cooke presiding in his red robes last night, the majir political controversy centered on an absence rather than a presence—for all the current candidates for Mayor were invited except Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, the Liberal nominee. Snub Is Alleged Mr. Blumenthal contended he had been snubbed because of his advocacy of the legalization of abortion in the Legislature. But officials of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York who plan the dinner denied this. They said Mr. ‐Blumenthal had been omitted because he had not been a past subscriber to the dinner and its sponsoring organization, the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation. Representative Ford included levity in his remarks as is traditional at the $100‐aplate dinner. He noted that this year marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of former Governor Smith, who died in 1944. Mr. Ford wondered that it might feel like to love to be 100, and said a friend had responded: “After you get through your confirmation hearings [in Congress] you may well know how it feels.” The Vice President‐designate said that he welcomed the “closest scrutiny” in the hearings and that, if confirmed, he would work “to move the legislative ‐ executive relationship in Washington away from partisanship and polarization on to a more constructive basis of partnership and cooperation. He also said he would seek to reassure the public that the system of government worked “not just for the self‐interest of those in office, but primarily for the public interest of all the people.” The second featured speaker last night was Judge William Hughes Mulligan of the United States Court of Appeals, Second District, who is well known in lay Roman Catholic circles for his lively speeches. President Nixon's daughter, Tricia, also attended with her husband, Edward Cox. A gray‐haired judge told Al Smith stories, with a heavy reliance on his Irish‐Catholic background. “His education was left in the tender hands of the Christian Brothers and he learned not only the Catechism but also how to duck a left jab,” the judge said. “Nobody knows much about either anymore.” The dais guest list included Charles H. Silver, the former head of the Board of Education, who, as an old friend of Al Smith and Cardinal Spellman, has been master of ceremonies, for more than two decades, Governor Rockefeller, Mayor Lindsay, Senators Jacob K. Javits and James L. Buckley, former Gov. W. Averell Harriman, former Mayor Robert F. Wagner, and the three invited mayoral candidates — Controller Abraham D. Beame, State Senator John J. Marchi, and Representative Mario Biaggi. The dinner annually raises more than $170,000, which is sent by the foundation to 22 private hospitals, denominational and nondenominational."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/20/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-addictioncrime-connection-guns-and-the.html,"To the Editor: Dr. D. B. Louria (letter of Sept. 14) finds no evidence that heroin‐addicted criminals are excessively responsible for the upsurge in urban violence. He opposes “regressive and punitive approaches” for this group and criticizes police failure to differentiate between heroin use and dependence. Although there is a measure of truth here, more important considerations appear to have been disregarded: In several documented instances strong analytic and temporal relationship has been developed between drug addiction and violent crime. For example, a recent Washington (D. C.) Department of Correction study found a close correlation between the rise in hard‐drug use, and the commitment of heroin addicts to jails and concluded that crimes perpetrated by jailed addicts and nonaddicts were similar: “In both groups property crimes exceeded the violent crimes, including criminal homicide, armed robbery and assault.” Significantly, crime index offenses (including murder and rape) were reduced impressively in 1970, after 2,300 addicts were enrolled in new methadone treatment centers. Diagnosis of heroin user, abuser addict requires complicated procedures. Can the police department be expected to make this differentiation routinely? Distinctions between crimes are often unclear. Theft activity easily escalates to violence when alcohol, amphetamine or cocaine has been taken or the victim resists or a police officer appears. Added confusion stems from erratic and inconsistent reporting. In Dr. Louria's view, the use numbers of “heroin‐related” crimes unfairly links addicts with increasing urban violence. While such group stereotyping always deplorable, it may be expected when a public issue is obfuscated insufficient data and widespread fear. The only valid way to compare the prevalence of crimes among addicts and other population groups is to derive rates of occurrence for specific crimes within the groups. This requires a knowledge of “denominator figures,” or universes addicts and non‐addicts. Since such statistics are unavailable, comparisons are speculative, and politicians and others remain free to pursue their “numbers games.” Clearly, only persuasive data can restore tarnished images or justify pleas for selective treatment. Frankly, I cannot reconcile Dr. Louria's anxiety to shield addict‐criminals from “extraordinarily harsh approaches” with his willingness to invoke any penalties against others, many of whom are mentally ill. I prefer to believe that society and all criminals are best served when equal punishments, equal remedies and equal efforts at rehabilitation are applied with understanding and firmness. FRANK L. MORTON, M. D. White Plains, Oct. 11, 1973 Guns and the Law To the Editor: Your recent editorial “Confiscating Handguns” ignores the vast difficulty of confiscating the tens of millions of pistols in the United States. Most were bought for self‐protection. No statistics will convince their owners that they will never need their guns, nor any logic prove to them that they are more likely to shoot themselves than an intruder. They are for psychological reassurance as much as for physical protection, and every report of a killing or an assault reinforces the determination to keep them. Such owners simply do not consider their handguns any substantial risk to their own or the public safety, and even if the government offered to buy them back at fair value, few would be turned in, law or no law. Laws which prohibit behavior considered rightful by those who engage in it won't be obeyed—and lead inevitably, like Prohibition, to contempt for the entire governmental process. We have enough of that already. The Times, which has editorially sought to ease some restrictions on drug usage, abortion and sexual conduct on the intelligent basis that unheeded laws are worse than none at all, ought to recognize the same problem with gun confiscation. Forty to fifty million Americans are gun owners. Without their cooperation or at least their neutrality nothing whatever can be done about the improper use of firearms. Absolutist suggestions to take guns away only result M even more resistance to less extreme gun‐control proposals. The Times is injuring instead of advancing the cause of firearms regulation. MARK K. BENENSON New York Oct. 18, 1973 • Tennis, Anyone ... On Wall Street? To the Editor: A suggestion for Wall Street. During weekends, why not make tennis courts out of that area's empty, flat acres of asphalt? Paint court markings on the street. Provide lightweight nets that could be put up Saturday morning, taken down Sunday night. Wall Street would never be Wimbledon. But for the desperate and harassed, city tennis fanatic, playing in the street would be better than not playing at all. DICK HOLT New York, Oct. 11, 1973 Train Terminal Controversy To the Editor: In the controversy over the use of Grand Central Terminal versus a new terminal under Third Avenue, the arguments in favor of the latter as advanced recently by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority seem to be unconvincing and full of errors. Here are a few examples. ¶“There is a shortage of layup tracks in G.C.T.” Grand Central has 47 platform tracks and 64 layup tracks. Since it is operating at 57 per cent of its proven capacity, it could comfortably accommodate the eight platform and fourteen layup tracks planned for the Third Avenue Terminal. We note also that the M.T.A. never mentions the loop tracks which so greatly facilitate train movements in G.C.T. ¶“Foundation columns for surrounding buildings preclude any significant rearrangement of tracks.” No building columns will be involved at the point where the L. I. tracks enter the G.C.T. structure because this will be under Park Avenue in the Fifties where no buildings straddle the avenue. Once entry is made, all tracks are accessible via ladder tracks and no columns need be disturbed. ¶“The third‐rail systems are incompatible . . . so Long Island trains cannot enter the G.C.T. system.” This is contrary to fact because for many years New Haven locomotives equipped with adapter shoes have entered either system freely. ¶According to the M.T.A., a Wallstreeter who takes the L.I. to Grand Central will either have to fight his way onto an overcrowded Lexington Avenue train or walk all the way to Second Avenue (when that subway is ready). The smart Wallstreeter will do no such thing; he will ride directly from Jamaica into Penn Station, where he will be within half a block of two less‐crowded subways to Wall Street. In sum, if Dr. Ronan wished to convince New Yorkers that his solution is superior, he would do well to produce more believable arguments. RICHARD EDES HARRISON New York, Oct. 4, 1973 On Taking Potshots at the Landlords To the Editor: It is unfortunate that in your Sept. 20 editorial on President Nixon's housing message to Congress you could not resist taking a potshot at property owners. When will you realize that the average property owner is not a money‐grabbing scofflaw but a responsible small‐business man who in the face of throttling, politically motivated controls has managed to provide millions of New Yorkers with decent housing? George Meany screams and warns that you can't control one sector of the economy without controlling all the costs to the sector, but he has never spoken out against an emergency rent law, continuing for thirty years, which allowed wages, taxes and maintenance costs to rise unconscionably without permitting proportionate rent increases. The Times once cost five cents. Could it have continued in business if it had not raised its price? Your reference to landlord “greed” is not only discriminatory, it is an affront to people who supply housing at prices that are less than tenants can afford to pay. If you want to expose greed, let me give you some examples: ¶Building employes' unions demanding bigger salaries and picketing away the tenants' right to a sanitary and safe environment. ¶Politicians licking their chops at the prospect of getting votes by promising controlled rents for tenants (including themselves) out of landlords' pockets while voting themselves raises. ¶Housing hustlers rallying round the cry “We need more housing” to seek more profits by building with government money and investing very little of their own, to ask for tax abatements and to provide their limited partners with tax shelters. ¶City Mitchel‐Lama houses asking and receiving 25 to 61 per cent increases in rent while getting lowinterest mortgages and tax abatements. But you attack the landlord. Does he not have to cope with inflation? Does he not feed, clothe and educate his children? And your fears that those who have been given a fistful of dollar bills to find their own housing will be “underwriting slumlords” are groundless. Shoppers have the ultimate choice of rejecting or accepting housing in openmarket transactions. Perhaps, given that opportunity, the poor will practice some much‐to‐be desired economies. Arms'‐length transactions in housing of every category are taking place right now. Your paper can attest to the growing number of vacancies: Look in the real‐estate section and see how fat it has become with rental listings. GERTRUDE M. SCHNEIDER Secretary, Community Housing Improvement Program New York, Sept, 20, 1973 Recess Isn't Vacation To the Editor: Jonathan L. Rosner's recent letter to the editor regarding the “summer recess” of the United States Supreme Court evidences a misunderstanding of the function of the so‐called “summer recess.” Specifically, Mr. Rosner incorrectly interprets the term “recess” to mean “vacation.” Having recently served as a law clerk to an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, I can assure Mr. Rosner, and all other skeptics, that the summer recess is not a three‐month vacation but merely a cessation of oral arguinents and issuance of opinions. The summer recess, in brief, is utilized by the various Justices for the following purposes: (1) To review approximately 30 per cent of the jurisdictional statements and petitions for writs of certiorari that are to be considered by the Court during the following term. (2) To prepare for oral argument in the majority of cases scheduled to be argued during the following term of Court. (3) To devote part of their time and energy to fulfilling the duties cast upon them in their roles as circuit justices. (4) To fulfill many of the public obligations which befall them as public officers. (5) To take a bit of a respite from the awesome pressures of the office. Indeed, the Justice for whom I worked is fortunate if he gets a total of one to two weeks of relaxation during calendar year. It would be impossible for the Supreme Court, on a year‐round basis, to consider the constant flow of petitions for review, prepare and hear oral arguments, issue written opinions and carry out the many other duties imposed upon it. The summer recess provides the only real opportunity to prepare for the upcoming term and to reflect on the important issues that the Court will be called upon to decide. The quality of justice dispensed by the Supreme Court depends, in large part, on the availability of this preparation and reflection period. Mr. Rosner would have been well advised to investigate the facts before rushing to judgment. This letter should not be construed as a comment on or endorsement of the Freund Commission Report, to which Mr. Rosner alluded in his letter. JAMES W. ZIGLAR New York, Oct. 10, 1973 • A Place for Demonstrations To the Editor: Ms. Charton's recent letter takes the National Science Foundation to task for supporting training programs for teachers which include discussions of teaching methodology and motivational techniques, particularly demonstrations. She should be reassured that N.S.F. programs still contain healthy proportions of scientific content. Furthermore, as evidenced by N.S.F.'s guidelines for 1974, they will continue to have a strong science component in the future. N.S.F. receives each year many more applications than it is able to support. This rigorous competition insures that those programs that are funded are of high quality. It is important to note in this connection that each program supported by the National Science Foundation has not only survived a careful internal review but has also been screened by panels of some of the nation's most distinguished scientists and science teachers. Finally, although Ms. Charton may not agree, many of us believe thett there is a place in science for intuitibn, guessing and demonstrations, particularly when teaching children. Fortunately, we need not always be serious and analytic. LESTER G. PALDY Staff Physicist Amer. Assoc. of Physics Teachers Stony Brook, L. I., Oct. 8, 1973"
On to Disneyland and the Real Unreality,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/20/archives/on-to-disneyland-and-the-real-unreality.html,"I have to go to Disneyland. I mean I really do have to go. For years when my children begged me to take them, I gave them a nice round “uh huh” designed to shut them up. I couldn't explain to them that I saw Snow White and the Cowardly Lion and the alligators every morning. That there were no fantasies in California that had not seen in New York. Besides, it was too tiring—being jostled by strangers who might not want to remain that way; having a female bus burner with, seams in her stockings strike up a friendly conversation with me just to talk about her devoted black baby sitter; and me listening with a nod and a smile hoping that my contempt (which I am able to express only by refusing to enlighten her—by encouraging her, in fact, to remain obtuse and white and gothic) will be permanent. I could never explain, so we never went. It was a mistake. This year especially I have regretted it. For this year fantasy itself lost its genuineness. The normal lines of communication between sham and reality had broken down. The TV screen stuttered a picture of a man who drank a teacupful of Vietnamese blood every afternoon, curling his lip in disgust at the thought of a politician who drank whiskey. A wispy girl guide described to me the butchery of Francois Premier and Catherine de Medici as though it were a lost art; and avant garde artists turned from canvas to selfbutchery. The world's best‐known black writer discussed his relations with his publisher in the same terms slaves used to describe their owners. Two of the most liberated and intelligent women I know talked about their abortions with the same verbs, the same adjectives, the same narcissism, the same fond recollection with which women of another generation discussed childbirth. I spent months doing (with what my father did in 1935: anguish about how to put meat on the table. smelled famine in the world's richest country, and was told by the privileged to tighten my belt. A 10‐year‐old French mulatto responded to being called a dirty black with “I'm not black, I'm Parisian.” Apparently Fanon had never lived; I hallucinated him. Nine years after a white boy spit at my son and accused him of being black, this year a white boy accused him of not being black. He was confused. “Well,” I said, “white people complain a lot. They use blackness for lots of things—for whatever is going on in the world. Please don't let them define you. And please don't try to please them. Whatever they want you to be, chances are they want it for themselves, not for you.” He didn't know what I was talking about, and, like not going to Disneyland, couldn't explain. But I'm going. The reason I had refused to go is no longer valid. Too tired? I've never been more exhausted in my life. Not just the numbness of watching hundreds of Mexicans — naturalized and otherwise —being kicked back across the U.S. border. Not just the bone‐marrow fatigue of reading about the latest outrage in outrageous South Africa. Not just the weight of old anger, but an inability to contain the new. Mine is a tiredness of perception, of strafed ganglia. Anchors float. Bread won't mold. Children's brains splatter on the walls of “very good” homes. So I want to go to Disneyland where the deceptions are genuine, where can see constant unreality, steady illusion. I want to see the real Snow White dancing among the dirty old men. I want to see the plastic teeth of real alligators snapping at the hull of my boat. I want to watch real cowboy‐murderers kill the same number of people at the same time every day."
Catholic schools are committing suicide,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/21/archives/catholic-schools-are-committing-suicide-parish-portraits.html,"In a certain city there are three Roman Catholic schools: St. Athanasius is a battered old building, sitting on a grimy street where every third car is a police patrol. It is in, the middle of the poorest neighborhood in the city, a neighborhood that is gradually being abandoned by all but its most destitute black inhabitants. From the outside, St. Athanasius looks as if it, too, is about to be abandoned, but inside its classrooms are brightly painted and gaily decorated. Its multiracial faculty teaches in full classroonis. Despite the poverty of the neighborhood, the parish school board of parents (all black) has set the tuition at $500 a year per child, $650 per family. St. Athanasius loses money each year, but very much. Of its $80,000‐ayear budget, $76,000 comes from tuition. (Not all the charged tuition is collected.) The heat and light in the school are subsidized by the Sunday collection in the parish, although the 50 churchgoers who appear in the gloom of the great, gray Romanesque church each Sunday do not contribute much because they do not have very much. The overwhelming majority of the students in St. Athanasius are not Roman Catholic, of caurse. Holy Sepulchre is set in one of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city amid tree‐lined streets and rolling hills. It has a contemporarystyle church and a school with 20 classrooms. The old basketball court has been filled with nine portable classrooms. Only four of the 30 teachers are nuns; the rest are lay people with salaries comparable to those of the public‐school teachers who work across the street. (This salary scale has been decreed by the school board, which is made up of successful business and professional men and their wives.) The school board permits no more than 30 students in a classroom and has a waiting list of applicants. The tuition is slightly higher than it is for St. Athanasius, but the crowds of Catholics who swarm into Holy Sepulchre church on Sunday morning contribute a huge subsidy (best guess: $50,000 a year) to the school from their Sunday contributions. All would be well at Holy Sepulchre if it were not for the fact that the fringes of the black ghetto are only a little more than a half mile away. How long the church will be full on Sunday remains to be seen. St. Fabiola is in the midst of one of the raw, new, working‐ and lower‐middle‐class suburbs on the fringe of the city. It looks like any other Catholic parochial “plant” at first, as one bumps down the rutted, unpaved street by the tiny bungalows and the low sprawling building attached to the church. Yet St. Fabiola has no parochial school. The two nuns who are assigned at the parish wear lay garb and are listed on the masthead of the parish paper as members of the team equal to the pastor and his curate. They preside over a “religious education” program carried on in the classrooms of the “school,” but the religious‐education program is not a parochial school. There are classes for adults, teen‐agers and elementary ‐ school children given in the afternoons, evenings and on weekends. The costs of building and maintaining a parochial‐school enterprise at St. Fabiola's were deemed much too high. The pastor, with the approval of the archbishop, decided not to try the parochial‐school route. Attendance at the religious education programs is good, though perhaps only half the children of the parish show up—about as many, the pastor ruefully remarks, as would have gone to a parochial school if there were one. Whether the people of the parish are satisfied with this compromise is not clear; no one ever bothered to ask them. These are three of the Catholic educational institutions which recent Supreme Court decisions have said must sink or swim by themselves. If it takes Government aid to save them, Justice Powell and his colleagues have decreed, then they are not to be saved. Many experts think that in the absence of such aid the parochial‐school system will collapse. The Supreme Court does not try to hide the fact that it will shed no tears if Catholic schools vanish from the scene. Neither will large numbers of other Americans, some of them Are parochial schools in trouble then? The black parents of St. Athanasius hardly think so. They maintain their own private school out of tuition, with a small financial subsidy from the parish. Nor are the parents in Holy Sepulchre particularly aware of the crisis. Their school is expensive, but in their judgment it is worth the cost. If they can hold their community together—and that is problematic—they have no doubt that they will continue to provide religious education as well as general education for their children in Holy Sepulchre school. Indeed, many of the younger parents of the parish were graduated from Holy Sepulchre themselves and have moved back into the neighborhood to raise their own children in the same atmosphere and with the “advantages” they enjoyed. As for the Catholics of St. Fabiola, the parochial school crisis has come and gone. For them parochial schools are part of the past. That there is a crisis in parochial schools is beyond all doubt. In 1967, there were slightly more than 5 million students in Catholic schools; in the present academic year, there are little more than 4 million. In 1967, there were almost 13,000 schools; there” are now fewer than 11,000. In 1960, about one‐quarter of the teachers on the staffs of parochial elementary schools were lay (only 7 per cent in 1950); now, lay faculty is approaching the three‐fifths mark. More than 80 per cent of the parochial elementary schools in the country charge less than $200 a year tuition per student, while in 1972 per pupil cost of the Catholic school — insofar as one can guess it from the obscure economics of parochial education —was $268 and going up at a rate in excess of 10 per cent a year, The President's Panel on Nonpublic Education estimates that between 1970 and 1980, seven states (California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey) will lose an enrollment in nonpublic schools of more than 1.5 million. Almost all this loss is in Catholic schools, of course. When Peter Rossi and I did our study of Catholic education in the early nineteen‐sixties, we estimated that more than two‐fifths of the Catholics of school age in the country were in parochial elementary schools. The figure at the present time must be closer to one‐third. The conventional wisdom inside and outside the Roman Catholic Church is that decline in enrollment is the result of a mixture of increased costs and disenchantment on the part of Catholic parents. In the church after Vatican Council II, it is argued, the “relevance” of parochial schools is no longer so obvious to large numbers of Catholic parents. Yet in survey after survey over the last 20 years, a little more than two‐thirds of the Catholic population has indicated support for parochial schools. There is no evidence in the survey data that this proportion has diminished at all. Unquestionably, some Catholic parents have pulled their children out of parochial schools because this is the “enlightened” and “progressive” thing to do. Undoubtedly, other parents have not sent their children to parochial schools because the costs are too high now Yet, much of the decline in parochial school enrollment is, in fact, the result of the closing of “uneconomic” schools and the failure to build new schools. The Catholic population continues to move from the central city to the suburbs. In the nine teen‐forties and fifties parochial‐school construction kept pace with this movement; in the nineteen‐sixties there was relatively little new school construction. How much of the decline in enrollment is the result of the failure to build new schools in those places to which the Catholic population is moving is difficult to determine. Catholic school administrators have only slight interest in data collection or high‐quality research. But there is little reason to doubt that the construction of new schools has diminished drastically, and this is an important factor in any explanation of the enrollment decline. Furthermore, insofar as there is any evidence, parents oppose the closing of the old school, and whenever anyone bothers to consult them, they vigorously support construction of a new one. Could St. Fabiola have supported a parochial school? If St. Athanasius can, surely St. Fabiola could. Did the parents of St. Fabiola want a school? No one knows, because no one bothered to find out. Should a parochial school have been built in St. Fabiola? The pastor and the bishop decided that it shouldn't, which may well have been the proper decision. But the point is worth emphasizing. The St. Fabiola decision was based neither on lay disenchantment nor a clear absence of funds; it was made by ecclesiastical administrators who decided that they did not want a parochial school in St. Fabiola. It is neither finances nor waning popularity, then, that will put parochial schools out of business. On the contrary, the parochial school system is committing suicide. To understand this selfdestruction, one must grasp what a powerful symbolic issue parochial schools have always been in the history of the United States. Indeed, anyone who tries to write about the subject in categories that have not been hallowed by the century‐long debate is likely to find himself clobbered by both sides. Neither the friends nor the enemies of parochial schools want dispassion and objectivity. The parochial schools were begun in this country as a Catholic response to a perceived threat from nativist bigotry. Only in their own school system, it was said, would Catholic children be free from the proselytizing efforts of the public schools, which were then in fact nondenominational Protestant schools. On the other hand, the native Americans used the parochial schools as evidence that Catholics did not want to become “really” American, and that they intended to maintain a loyalty to a “foreign power.” A few parochial schools were burned and many exposas were written about the terrible things that went on within them. Even today, an occasional Protestant organization will issue a statement claiming that parochial schools are a haven for racists who do not want to go to racially integrated schools. The assumption that somehow Catholic schools are “unAmerican” is still strong in the American Protestant and, sometimes, the Jewish collective subconscious. The United States is virtually the only country in the Western world that does not provide some sort of state aid for parochial schools. Chief Justice Burger's “entanglement” doctrine that purports to protect states from getting “messed up” in religious problems by supporting Catholic schools may be bad law and bad sociology, but it is good history. The American national consensus has never approved of parochial schools; it has only tolerated them. Since the consensus may have become more sympathetic, it follows that there is a bit more tolerance. Yet most non‐Catholic Americans, especially most public‐education administrators, would be delighted to see the parochial schools go away—although they would not want it to happen within their own school districts, because their schools might then be inundated with Catholic students. There is now enough research evidence to refute the hoary myths about the deficiencies of Catholic education. It is now reasonably well known that in the Catholic classroom the whole day is not spent working on religious indoctrination with a bit of spelling just before recess. Nor does the half‐hour‐a‐day religious instruction necesstilly impede efficiency in other educational activities. Despite crowded classrooms and allegedly inadequate teacher training, students in the Catholic schools do al least as well if not better on standardized tests than do students in Public schools in the same geographic area. (The black students in the St. Athanasius school are two gradea ahead in achievement over students in the neighboring public school.) Parochial‐school graduates do better in the social and economic race than do Catholics who went to public schools. They are also more enlightened on questions of race and social policy. But myths rarely yield to data, and the suspicions about and fear of Catholic schools are still powerful in the land. What is new is that a substantial proportion of Catholiceducated are willing to buy what has been the traditional non‐Catholic view of the Pirothird schools. This phenomenon can only be understood as part of the long‐range pattern of adaptation by Catholic ethnic groups to a predominantly non‐Catholic society. When a group you perceive as oppressive identifies a particular institution with your Cause, then, far from giving that institution up, you rally to its support. British oppression in Ireland guaranteed the identification of Catholicism with Irish nationalism. To be a good Irishman you had to be a loyal Catholic. Similarly, the Catholic Church flourishes in Poland today because Catholicism is a way of asserting one's Polishness in the face of a regime dominated by a foreign power. Precisely because the parochial schools were a prime target for native American attack (attacks that the Catholics thought represented bigotry), the Catholic population rallied to enthusiastic support of the parochial schools. To a very considerable extent the American Catholic Church became an educational institution, putting vast quantities of time, money and personnel into supporting the most extensive private school system In the World. The emergence of the separate Catholic school system in the United States has to be seen as one phase in the acculturation of the ethnic immigrant groups—the phase of militant defensiveness. But even in the last century that small group of Catholics who had managed to break out of the immigrant environment to receive some kind of tentative acceptance in the larger society became critical of the Catholic schools. When they perceived the Catholic school from outside the ghetto, the school did indeed begin to look “divisive” and “unAmerican.” Whether the Catholic critics of parochial schools were turncoats who had sold out to the enemy or progressive pioneers depended on one's perspective; but as long as they were a minority and did not have much impact on the Catholic educators themselves, they were no real threat. Since the Second World War, American Catholics have moved rapidly into the upper middle class. Priests and religious who teach in the Catholic schools are often now the sons and daughters of collegeeducated parents. If they are on the, faculties of Catholic higher‐education institutions and are under 40, they almost certainly did graduate work in non‐Catholic universities. The editors and writers of the most influential Catholic journals like Commonweal and The National Catholic Reporter are in many cases ashamed of and angry at the immigrant ghetto parishes of their childhoods. The quintessential symbol of all that was wrong with that ghetto parish is the parochial school that stood at its core. The new Catholic intelligentsia, then, is almost unanimously against a separate Catholic school system (even when that intelligentsia earns its support from that system). Given the general absence of serious scholarship within Catholic education, te intelligentsia has carried the day almost without opposition. There are few Catholic educators today who will not concede in private conversation that they no longer have much confidence in what they are doing. The Catholic school system was not prepared intellectually or emotionally for the dramatic change in social and economic status in the Catholic population. Nor was it prepared for the emergence of an anticlerical and antiparochial‐school intellectual elite. The morale of Catholic educators collapsed almost overnight. Indeed, one book, Mary Perkins Ryan's “Are Parochial Schools the Answer?” published in the early nineteen‐sixties, came as a death blow to the confidence of Catholic educators. That one book could topple the edifice is good evidence that the mortar was crumbling to begin with. Vatican Council II was another severe blow to Catholic educators. Most of them (perhaps I should say most of us) were raised in an atmosphere of certainties—religious, moral, ecclesiastical and liturgical. Without warning, the turmoil unleashed by the council destroyed most of these certainties. All the rigid structural supports of our commitments and convictions were swept away, and we had to face for the first time in our lives fundamental questions of meaning and vocation that had been either repressed or had never arisen. We found ourselves asking whether we believed anything any more and whether what we were doing was worth anything. American Catholicism was simply not equipped to answer these questions. And while some of us managed to survive, for better or worse, others of us experienced acute and painful personality disorganization. Priests and nuns left their vocations by the thousands. Religious communities tore themselves apart in internal conflict in which the liberals usually won, and having won, they left the communities anyhow. Still others decided that they would do anything but be bogged down in the foolishness of the Catholic school system. Even the more conservative clergy who had risen to the rank of pastor in Catholic parishes were not so sure any more. On the one hand they would extol the merits of Catholic schools, and on the other they would hesitate about taking on the huge debt necessary to build such schools and maintain them. Catholic education administrators would go to meetings of their teachers and preach confidence and optimism, then go back to their offices and sign letters closing an “uneconomical” high school. And bishops would issue solemn proclamations of commitment to Catholic education but discourage the building of new parochial schools in the suburbs. It was no longer clear, then, to the leadership of Catholic school education and to the ordinary rank:and‐file teachers that the separate school system was worth the cost. The number of lay teachers was increasing, salaries for teachers were going up, construction costs were skyrocketing. None of these need to have been insurmountable problems for people who believed unquestioningly in what they were doing. But it was no longer possible to believe that way. In the theoretical vacuum created by this collapse of confidence, all sorts of strange plants began to bear fruit. Sensitivity training, encounter sessions, Pentecostalism, “ecumenism” that virtually denied religious differences, yoga, intimate relationships between priests and nuns (sometimes sexless, sometimes not), radical militancy (despite the fact that many black parents were anything but enthused about such militancy for their children), celebration of the joys of the “secular city,” brave announcements that God was dead (which most parochialschool children accepted with the same indifference they had the announcement that the Blessed Mother had appeared in the Philippine Islands), and self‐defined “counterculture” liturgies—all of these have made the current parochial‐school scene a fascinating area for anthropological research. The natives are restless indeed. Catholic higher‐educational institutions have been acutely embarrassed by the fact that they are each year enrolling a smaller proportion of Catholies who are attending college. Never mind that Catholic attendance at college has increased dramatically in the last, two decades. (In 1960, 25 per cent of the college students in the country were Catholic, which is about the same proportion as in the national population; in 1972, 33 per cent of the college students were Catholic.) Never mind that most Catholic colleges have been able to maintain their enrollments in the face of the current enrollment crisis. Even a decline in relative proportion was enough to lead Catholic college administrators to wrestle with the question, what is a Catholic college? Once such a question is asked and taken seriously, there is no way to answer it without defining many of the things that the college is engaged in. The latent assumption in the question “What is a Catholic college?” is that there isn't any difference between a Catholic college and any other kind of college. Such an assertion is a historical and sociological absurdity, but Catholic intellectuals are not well‐know for letting reality get in the way of their ideas. Hence the fashion of Catholic higher education in the nineteen‐sixties was to become as much like “everyone else” as possible as quickly as possible. Every Catholic institution seemed to have a comparable non‐Catholic school that became its role model. One was told that a given college was a “Catholic Carleton” or a “Catholic Emory” or a “Catholic Amherst” or—heaven save us—that Notre Dame was on its way to becoming a “Catholic Princeton.” It did not occur to many educators that if they became like everyone else, they would have nothing unique to offer, and that parents might well decide to send their children to the real Carleton, Amherst, Emory or Princeton (or, more likely, to the local state university). The fundamental crisis in Catholic schools is neither financial nor organizational; it is theoretical. They will not be routed by external foes, increasing costs, apathetic laity or Supreme Court decisions, faithful to nativist tradition, that deny tax support. Catholic schools will go out of existence mostly because Catholic educators no longer have enough confidence in what they are doing to sustain the momentum and the sacrifice that built the world's largest private‐school system. The decline in enrollment seems to be leveling off. The morale crisis may also be leveling off, but that may be more out of weariness than anything else. The Holy See and the bishops issue periodic pronouncements about the importance of Catholic schools, but it is to be feared that no one is listening. Both the Pope and the bishops have long since lost their credibility. Paradoxically enough, even non‐Catholic educators are willing to say that the performance of Catholic schools is now at an all‐time high, and some educators like Donald Ericson of the University of Chicago are vigorous in their support for all nonpublic schools. Yet morale is still low. One of the nuns who teaches at St. Athanasius remarked to me, “We're not really reaching the people here that we should be reaching.” I was astonished, for it seemed to me that she and her colleagues were teaching precisely thoie children who would have a very hard time making it out of poverty without St. Athanasius. But she was not satisfied. “The kids we get,” she said, “are those whose parents are interested in their getting a good education. We are missing completely those whose parents are indifferent.” I suppose Sister was right. (In grammar school I learned that Sister was always right) St. Athanasius is indeed educating those poor black children who are educable by our current educational technology. She wanted to give them up so as to try to educate those with whom she could make little if any progress. There may well be some special kind of religious zeal in such a desire for failure, a zeal that can overlook the importance of a critical work that no one else is doing. My guess is that it is rather a manifestation of what Father Edward Duff, professor of political science at Holy Cross College, called “the mass masochism” of a group that is in the last stages of winning full acceptance in the larger American society. WHAT are the prospects for the future? There is, of course, massive dissatisfaction with the failures of public education. As Colin Greer has recently pointed out in his book, “The Great School Legend,” black immigrants to the city are only the most recent migrant group the public school has failed to serve. (Why Greer, an able, careful, and responsible researcher, ignores the work of the parochial school among previous generations of immigrants as well as among today's blacks is a puzzle.) That public education has failed in the great cities of the country is now hardly a matter of debate. It is also clear that every extra dollar poured into urban public education will be absorbed into the teachers' salaries demanded by the now militant unions and will have little if any impact on what happens to a student in the classroom. Despite the immense power of the publiceducation establishment, talk about breaking its “monopoly” is growing more vigorous even in those enlightened liberal circles where public education has always found its strongest support. “Competition,” “pluralism,” and “open market place” are becoming phrases that one hears more and more frequently. Indeed, one suspects that enthusiasm for nonpublic schools would have been much more powerful and much more effective if those who are so dissatisfied with the failures of the public schools had thought of a way to subsideze private schools without subsidizing Catholic schools. In a way, the existence of 10,000 parochial schools is one of the last strongholds protecting the public ‐ education bureaucracy from its liberal critics. For the public educator can always point to the parochial school and say to the liberal or radical critic, “But do you really want to give money to them?” Furthermore, before the Court's June 25 decision, there was increasing support for a constitutionally sound means of state and Federal support for nonpublic schools. The New Republic broke with the liberal line a number of years ago and endorsed such a notion. More recently, attorney Adam Walinski, writing in that journal, strongly urged tax‐credit support for Catholic schools. The President's Panel on Nonpublic Education has suggested tax credits, construction ‐ loan programs, tu ition reimbursement and voucher experiments as means of facilitating the work of nonpublic schools, A climate of opinion, then, is beginning to develop in the country that is both skeptical of the public education monopoly and sympathetic to the search for constitutional means to support private‐schools, including religious ones. But opposition to such aid is still vigorous. Both public educators and Protestant, Jewish and secularist pressure groups argue that such aid is completely foreign to the American tradition of separation of church and state—and it surely is foreign to that interpretation of the. Constitution that has held sway for the last several decades. If one is to judge the temper of the Supreme Court from its recent decisions, one might be tempted to conclude that the. Court will strike down any system of aid to Catholic schools no matter how sound the constitutional argument in favor of a particular proposal might be. Presidential candidates, of course, will continue to endorse such aid as a matter of general principle, and then not do much about it in practical legislation. Initial comment by Catholic educators after the June 25 decision indicates that many of them were willing to call off the battle for state aid. But some observers de tect a smoldering anger in certain segments of the Catholic population over the abortion and education decisions and suspect that there may be a massive political reaction which the educators and the hierarchy will not have turned on and will not be able to turn off. The Supreme Court is much less likely to follow election returns than it did in Mr. Dooley's day; but Presidential candidates still do. And the Court, altered in composition by successful candidates, is, not above reversing its own august decisions—as the recent obscenity decision shows. The battle over aid to parochial schools may go on as long as there are parochial schools. AT the present reading the prospects for governmental aid (either state or Federal) for Catholic schools must be considered unlikely. Such aid would take some of the financial heat off the parochial schools and would unquestionably diminish the rate of their decline. Though it would not solve the problems of morale and theory, it might create a breathing space in which such problems could be more reasonably faced. What may happen if Catholic schools do vanish? The Catholic Church will doubtless survive; so will urban public education, although there will be a huge increase in enrollment in public schools in many cities and still more of an educational tax drain. Whether the whole of American society will suffer because of the loss of the largest alternative to the public‐educational monopoly that currently exists depends on whether you think alternative education ought to be available. Harvard's Prof. Christopher Jenclii et al believe in maximizing freedom of educational opportunities. But what if Jencks's suggestions were followed and every school that is open to all were declared to be a “public school,” deserving of tax support? Would there not then be a proliferation of private schools, many of them also religious in orientation? There might be an increase in non ‐ Catholic parochial schools (though American Protestantism has not been enthusiastic in the past about developing its own school systems, with the notable exception of the Lutheran Church‐Missouri Synod). If you believe that a wide range of educational choice, is a bad thing for American society, you will be appalled by the thought of an, increase of nonCatholic parochial schools and delighted at the prospect of trouble for Catholic schools. If, on the other hand, you believe in an open educational market place, you are scarcely likely to be happy about the demise of public education's only serious competition—particularly when that competition is present in the worstinner‐city slums. The circumstances being as they are, only the most naive would attempt prophecy. One therefore hedges the bet: The parochial schools will survive, but they will be different. They will play a different role in the future than they did in the past. For this sort of prediction, you don't win Pulitzer Prizes. It is appropriate to end with St. Athanasius, whose dirty red bricks cut off what little sunlight the steel‐mill pollution might permit into my room. Black people are a total of about 1.8 per cent of the U.S. Catholic population; they are 5.1 per cent of the students in Catholic elementary schools, and 3.7 per cent of the students in Catholic high schools. It is safe to guess, then, that more than half of the blacks in parochial schools are not Catholic. Surely in St. Athanasius the overwhelming majority are not Catholic. The church provides a small financial subsidy (although in some inner‐city parishes the diocesan subsidy can be over $200,000 year). The largest subsidy comes from the life commitment of a group of priests and nuns. I trust I shall be excused from observing that efforts like St. Athanasius represent not only the finest hour of the Catholic school system but one of the finest things in American Catholicism. The inner‐city, alternative Catholic school may have come into being unintentionally, even unconsciously. The Catholic Church itself seems only vaguely aware that places like St. Athanasius are doing anything “relevant.” No one has suggested that the results of Chief Justice Burger's fears of “entanglement” may ultimately put St. Athanasius out of business. Catholic liberals and non‐Catholic critics don't care and pay little attention to St. Athanasius, and the mass media, so interested in the problems of the city, are apparently unaware of its existence too. About the only ones who give a damn about St. Athanasius are the parents of the children who attend it. If the Catholic schools do eventually disappear from the land, the highest price of all will be paid by the parents and children of St. Athanasius. But they are only black “respectables,” and nobody cares much about them. ■ Parish portraits"
Legislature's Action on Healh Criticized by Community Society,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/23/archives/legislatures-a-action-on-health-criticized-by-community-society.html,"The Community Service Society of New York accused the Legislature yesterday of an “unwillingness to deal realistially with alarmingly increased rates of health disorder and disease.” In a report called “1973 Health Legislation in New York State,” the society's committee on health cited as one example the Legislature's attempt to “strip” the city's Department of Health of “its power to set nd enforce its own standards for licensing hospitals and nursing homes.” The 112‐page document indicated that most health proposals introduced in the Legislature had the support of the society, a 125‐year‐old social service agency, but that most did not become law. The report said that a total of 1,143 health bills had been introduced. Discounting identical bills, the report said, there were 768 health‐related bills. The committee supported or opposed 123. Of those, 15 became law. The society had favored passage of 12 of these and opposed three. The society had established eight priority areas: abortion, environmental health, family planning, health costs, Medicaid, mental health, minors' rights to health care and venereal disease. The results in there areas, the society said, were less than totally favorable. The society praised legislafive actions that restored Medicaid to pre‐1971 income eligibility levels, established localState cooperation in mental health and alcoholism programs, required disclosure of financial transactions of voluntary and private hospitals, eased the organization of prepaid healty care plans, expanded the swillability of tests for venereal diseases and requirecfprescription labels to state the name and amount of the drug dispensed. Copies of the report are available for $1 from the society, at 105 East 22d Street."
Byrne for New Jersey,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/24/archives/byrne-for-new-jersey.html,"For any New Jersey resident with even a casual concern about the staggering problems that beset his state, the obvious choice for Governor is Brendan T. Byrne.” Judge Byrne, a Democrat, has impressive qualifications for Governor apart from the integrity conceded even by political opponents; but in this election he will command the votes of concerned, public‐spirited citizens of both parties almost by default. Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., the Republican candidate, has waged the most negative, demagogic and fiscally irresponsible campaign in recent New Jersey history. Mr. Sandman's strategy is shamefully clear. He appeals to every fear and suspicion, every prejudice and misgiving, that helps to cloud real issues and fog constructive debate. He aims at building a new majority on massive discontent and quack remedies. The Congressman's remedy for street crime is to restore the death penalty. He would ban abortion, not merely by statute but by constitutional amendment. He would bar forced busing even where regional school consolidations have left no practical alternative. In state whose outdated tax structure is glaringly unfair, he opposes long‐overdue reform, including the graduated income tax. He has opposed Federal revenue‐sharing and fought the use of Federal highway funds for badly needed mass transit. It is no wonder that moderate Republicans have deserted him by the scores of thousands, or that the state's highest elected G.O.P. officials, Senator Clifford P. Case and Gov. William T. Cahill, have put as much distance as possible between themselves and his divisive campaign. It is shocking that Nelson A. Rockefeller, in contrast, journeyed across the Hudson River to demean himself and try to improve his “conservative” image by campaigning for this candidate most of whose views are (we hope) poles apart from those of the New York Governor. Partly out of temperament, partly no doubt to attract defecting Republicans and swing voters in a swing state, Mr. Byrne has responded to Mr. Sandman's excesses with a cautious, middle‐road campaign that liberal Dernocrats have reluctantly accepted in order to preserve freshly rebuilt party unity. To the extent that this approach reflects Mr. Byrne's dislike for pat formulds tor complex problems and a distaste for extravagant campaign promises that cannot be made good in office, it is a creditable stance. On the most sensitive and emotional social issues—abortion, school busing, law enforcement, capital punish ment—Mr. Byrne's positions are always more constructive, or at least less negative, than those of Mr. Sandman. On problems of special concern for New Jersey—public transport, environment, ecology—his pro posals are vastly more, credible and progressiye than his opponent's hastily hatched schemes. Mr. Byrne's approach to issues is generally humane, pragmatic and common sense, if frequently not so forthright as we would wish. In a year of widespread disillusionment with politics, Mr. Sandman's chances must not be taken lightly despite the deep fissures he has opened in regular Republican ranks. He did manage to bring off an unprecedented feat in the June primary by swamping Governor Cahill. Judge Byrne obviously does not underrate his opponent's strength. Neither should any New Jersey voter who genuinely cares about the Garden State's future."
"Wood, Field and Stream: Regulating the Snowmobile",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/25/archives/wood-field-and-stream-regulating-the-snowmobile.html,"It has long been clear that snowmobiles—at last count there were two million of them in North America—are here to stay. The problem then is how to regulate their use so that they will do a minimum of harm to the natural environment and its denizens, including man. The Conservation Foundation, which is at 17 Massachusetts Avenue N. W., Washington, D. C. 20036, has recently published its second edition of The Off‐Road Vehicle and Environmental Quality, which includes a larger foldout chart of state regulations governing offroad vehicles. According to the report, evidence is accumulating that snowmobiles damage small trees and bushes, and harm the smaller animals that use snow cover to insulate themselves from winter's cold. Snow packed down by a snowmobile, for example, loses much of its insulative quality. And, notes the report, the animals so affected (they include voles, shrews, field mice, ground squirrels) form a major part of the diet of owls, eagles, hawks, foxes, coyotes, and bobcats. Although white‐tailed deer often show a high degree of tolerance to passing snowmobiles—this writer has observed instances where they have come out of the woods to move along a snowmobile trail a few minutes after the machine went by—there is evidence that other species of deer, and elk, will leave an area in fright if the machines pass too closely. An Idaho research team found that elk attempt to maintain a half‐mile buffer zone between themselves and snowmobiles. This often means that elk are driven from their feeding areas. During severe winters, biggame animals are involved in a grim battle for survival and burn precious energy if they are moved to flight. This can, according to the Conservation Foundation report, “cause absorption of embryos, abortion of the fetus or even death of the weakened animal.” When the animals are deliberately pursued or harassed with snowmobiles, the stress is, of course, intensified. Hunting with snowmobiles, if the machines are confined to logging roads, does minimum damage to the environment, but this does, of course, permit hunters to push much deeper into woods than they would normally do, for only a few hardy souls will snowshoe or ski 15 or 20 miles a day. Recreational snowmobiling —not including hunting, fishing or racing—accounts for nearly 90 per cent of the vehicles' use. In many instances, this conflicts with the desires of those who wish to ski or snowshoe through the, silent winter woods. Also, there have been far too many instances of the privacy of landowners being invaded at all hours of the day and night by the noisy machines. Suggestions for dealing with these problems, and those created by dune buggies, all‐terrain vehicles and trailbikes, are included in the report, as well as a model state statute for regulating the use and registration of these vehicles. Copies of the report, including the aforementioned chart, may be had from the foundation for $4 each."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/25/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-arms-and-the-country-remember-the-port-in.html,"Colonel Guiney's remarks [letter Oct. 15] about the “carte blanche” to the military on requisitioning astronomical budgets for military purposes are well taken insofar as they represent an explanation of the military's stance. To the Editor: But, thank goodness, this is still a democracy with a civilian administration and not a ruling military junta. Our civilian government does not consist of puppets who're bound to rubberstamp any and all demands by those who express the needs to safeguard our form of government in terms of bombs and bullets. If Colonel Guiney wants to register as a paid or voluntary lobbyist for the military, let him do so. This reader acknowledges the role of our Joint Chiefs as advisers to government rather than signatories on a blank check. I for one am desperately weary of international one‐upmanship, brinkmanship and all the other labels and stigmas appropriate to participants in an endless armaments race. This is not to deny the need for standing militia and the weapons to safeguard world peace, which has so far eluded us all. But unless we impress incipiently belligerent nations with our desire to reduce our own “first blow” capabilities, we are destined to keep building up hardware, budget and all. If one would but glance at the ratio of allocations for potential conflict machinery versus the monies requisitioned, set aside or needed for peaceful pursuits at home and abroad, the naked facts can make even the casual observer shudder. If we could but make all the Colonel Guineys tone down and remember their less important role in the whole drama, we might just strike a more hopeful balance “on the Hill” and prove to the world that all the dour speeches by Messrs. Nixon and Kissinger are more peace‐oriented than they appear at present. ARTHUR BODENHEIMER River Edge, N. J., Oct. 15, 1973 • To the Editor: It's tempting to dismiss arguments against cutting the military budget as “Pentagon propaganda.” But the Middle East conflict demonstrates again that the Russians have developed highly sophisticated weapons for use outside their territory. Also, the high casualty rate resulting from Israel's waiting for the other side to strike first illustrates the human cost that is ultimately paid when—rightly or wrongly—other priorities are placed ahead of national defense. SIMEON H. F. GOLDSTEIN New York, Oct. 14, 1973 Remember the ‘Port’ In Our Port Authority To the Editor: There is pressure on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey commissioners to vote to be “exclusively a transportation agency.” When I was a young man, my father, Herbert K. Twitchell, was made a commissioner of the Port Authority by New York's Governor, Al Smith. As a banker, his responsibility was to see that the authority's bonds had a good sale. They had not been offered to the public before. There were no government funds involved. The private investment by the bond buyers would be protected only by the tolls of the bridges and tunnels to be built. My conception of the Port Authority at that time was that its primary function was the development of the harbor area in all its ramifications. The harbor was what was shared by New Jersey and New York. This was the asset which often lay dormant because the two states could not agree on the development. This led to the creation of the authority by the two state legislatures. My impression still is that the movement of anything and anybody in and out of the general harbor area, and for the benefit of both states, is the true concern of the Port Authority. The World Trade Center to improve trade facilities was made possible partially by the authority agreeing to rebuild and refurbish a‐bankrupt commuter railroad under the Hudson River to the Trade Center site. Trade and mass transit were joined here to benefit the whole area. The Port Authority's purpose should not be diverted from the creative development of the whore harbor area based on well‐supported bonds. HANFORD M. TWITCHELL New York, Oct. 1, 1973 The Port Authority's Seal Subways: Shut the Doors! To the Editor: Thanks to Dr. Ronan for acknowledging that “there is no question that the IND subway line is one of the noisiest railroads in the country” (news story Oct. 11). I am one of those people who plug their ears when standing on the platform (IRT and BMT as well) and a train is approaching. And often I have to plug them while riding the train, especially in the summer, when most of the car windows and all the doors between the cars are open. Those doors! They are the main point in my writing this letter. It seems to me that while We wait years for the replacement of the old cars by those wonderful new quieter ones, something could be done quickly and inexpensively to lessen the din inside the older cars: Keep the doors between the cars closed at all times. It has become a habit on the New York subways to keep these doors open, more often than closed. This is due to the design of their latches, which makes it much easier to open them and keep them open than to shut them and keep them shut. How often have I struggled to close one of those offending doors only to see it open again by itself a few moments later. I believe a little engineering ingenuity could devise an inexpensive way to alter the hardware of the connecting doors of the older cars so as to make the doors tend to close and stay closed. Tens of thousands of riders' ears would thus feel relief every day. ALEXANDER HAMMID New York, Oct. 12, 1973 ‘Antisocial’ Psychiatry To the Editor: Hard‐liners in crime control come not only in opportunist political circles exploiting the fears of the electorate but also under a pseudoscientific banner of asserted psychiatric wisdom (letter of Julius Buchwald, M.D., Oct. 12). The solution he proposes for this insistent problem is “posting armed militia on every square block of the city ... armed guards in every subway ... television monitoring in every public place.” Such paranoia might easily be found among the extremely benighted in our midst, but advanced as the stern logic of psychiatric insight and conclusions it adds up to a most dangerous antisocial doctrine. For this proposal for a state‐ofsiege administration anent the problem of crime in the streets is a conclusion based on discredited theories of biologic criminal types. This plainly implicit in the doctor's assertion “that true crime prevention depends on our ability ... to alter drastically the moral character and impulsivity of people ...” which, he adds, “we simply do not possess today.” However, his “present ‐ day knowledge of character structure and human behavior” confirms his assumptions. A more patent refurbishing of the Nazi superman doctrine for justifying genocide, sterilization, etc., as a means for the elimination of biological inferiors, the culturally misfit or incurable criminal types can hardly be imagined. If it is neither safe to trust wars to the generals, nor our liberties, as James Madison warned, to an overgrown executive, it surely is not safe to trust social solutions of those psychiatric schools of thought which view the human animal as tropistically limited and defined and the individual human being apart from those environmental influences which overwhelmingly affect his ultimate behavior for good or for evil. Louis LINDEN Corona, N. Y., Oct. 16, 1973 Agnew: A Farewell ... To the Editor: Now that the political atmosphere has been cleared and the heated rhetoric has abated, I believe that most of us have arrived at the comforting conclusion that Spiro Agnew was inherently an honorable gentleman as well as a distinguished and patriotic American. He fought cleanly and valiantly for the true American principles of good government and fair play. As the courageous champion of the silent majority he will not be quickly forgotten. For myself, I would have preferred that he remain as Vice President and have fought to clear his good name. However, he has chosen to place the welfare of his country above that of his own. I salute him as a true American patriot and a stanch defender of the basic conservative principles held by most of the American people. As a loyal conservative, I bid him a fond farewell, and may good fortune smile upon him soon. HARRY S. GEORGE Bayside, N. Y., Oct. 16, 1973 • ... A Rebuttal ... To the Editor: In response to Walter Audubon's Oct. 16 letter: The place in which Spiro T. Agnew tacitly conceded culpability was not a newsroom but a courtroom. Nor was the man imposing the travesty of a sentence an editor or a columnist but a duly appointed judge of the court. Except for the unremitting efforts of the press, this might not have come to pass. Mr. Audubon indubitably would shoot the watchdog whose barking discloses the presence of burglars on his property. ERNEST ROSENFELD New York, Oct. 16, 1973 • ... And an Irony To the Editor: The decision of the national networks to give free time to Spiro Agnew to address the nation is regrettable. For the past nine weeks we have had to hear his televised cry of “damned lies” in defense of some of the now‐proven accusations. Mr. Agnew, the convicted felon, had his day in court and chose to make his case behind closed doors through plea bargaining. It is ironic that this arch critic of the media should choose nationwide television for the recording of his funeral oration. FRANCIS W. RODGERS Rensselaer, N. Y., Oct. 15, 1973 • Bargains at the Courthouse To the Editor: It concerns me that a jurist of the stature of Judge Harold Stevens would defend plea bargaining “because the Criminal courts could not function otherwise.” [News story Oct. 9.] That seems to put the tart before the horse. The courts do not exist independently of their purpose. How can justice be served ‐ if each man isn't tried fairly on the charges brought against him? Where is the justice if a milliondollar embezzler pleads to a minor charge and is either placed on probation or out in a short period of time with only a minor interference in his career? Or if a man is told by his lawyer that if he doesn't cop a plea he'll be in jail pending trial longer than if he pleaded guilty? Neither man is likely to leave the court system with any respect for the law. Plea bargaining doesn't seem to serve anything but the avoidance of coming to grips with the many real difficulties in our society. If the courts couldn't function, or if the prisons Weren't large enough to hold all the convicted men, perhaps we'd have to start wondering why so many people don't seem able to go along with what society, has set as its code. We might find some solutions other than more courts and larger jails. The law‐enforcement community is faced with a tremendous task, one in which it needs the assistance of all citizens. However, the job won't go away by our pretending it's a logistical matter. BARBARA VAN BUREN New York, Oct. 9, 1973 • The Cardinal and Abortion To the Editor: Cardinal Cooke's recent warning to his flock that any involvement with abortion would mean automatic excommunication is well within his responsibility as a religious leader. It is when he calls on the Senate and the House of Representatives to deny the right of abortion to citizens not of his religious belief that he oversteps his prerogatives in a democrity that has no state religion and that has the precious principle of religious freedom. The Cardinal well knows that medical authorities have not definitely determined when “human” life begins; that the living “human” mother has her rights; that maternal and infant mortality rates have been reduced with the passage of liberal abortion laws; that denying the legal right to abortion will result in needless loss of life and health of women driven to seek help underground. To call the right of abortion a “convenience” seems to imply that the Cardinal does not ascribe worthy motives to those who disagree with him. That is unworthy of an important religious leader. Let him confine his warning to Catholic believers. Let the rest of us have our religious freedom—to believe or not to believe. The Supreme Court ruled on behalf of all its citizens, not for or against any religious group.

Buffalo Physician Is Sentenced In Death of Woman in Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/27/archives/buffalo-physician-is-sentenced-in-death-of-woman-in-abortion.html,"BUFFALO, Oct. 26 (AP)—A Buffalo physician was sentenced to up to three yars in prison today for the death of a woman after an abortion. Justice Frederick M. Marshall of State Supreme Court told the man, Dr. Jesse Ketchum, that his conviction and sentence had nothing to do with the legality of abortions, which are legal under the state's abortion laws, but rather with negligence “in the discharge of your professional duties and responsibilities.” A jury had convicted Dr. Ketchum, 54 years old, on a charge of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Mrs. Margaret L. Smith, 25 years old, of Ypsilanti, Mich. Mrs. Smith died at Dr. Ketchum's office here on June 16, 1971, shortly after undergoing an abortion. Justice Marshall is permitting the physician to remain free on bail pending an appeal of the conviction, but he increased the bail from $5,000 to $10,000. He gave Dr. Ketchum until Monday to raise the additional bail. During the three‐week trial here, the prosecution contended that Dr. Ketchum was negligent in performing an operation with what it said was inadequate personnel and facilities. The defense lawyer, Roy Cary lisi Jr., said Dr. Ketchum was guilty only of “an error in medical judgment.” The defense said Mrs. Smith died of bloodstream blockage that was beyond Dr. Ketchum's control."
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/27/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-the-middle-east.html,"SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1973 The Major Events of the Day The Middle East War President Nixon said that the United States and the Soviet Union had agreed “to use our influence more than we have in the past” to put pressure on the Israelis and Arabs to reach a permanent settlement in the Middle East. He said that the outlook for a permanent peace was the best that it had been in 20 years. [Page 1, Column 8.] In a long speech before the World Peace Congress in Moscow, Leonid I. Brezhnev accused the United States of artificially fanning tensions over the Middle East with “fantastic rumors” of Soviet plans for unilateral military intervention. He said that some “urgent and decisive” Soviet measures had been necessary to bring pressure on Israel to stop “flouting” cease‐fire resolutions of the Security Council. [1:5.] The United Nations moved swiftly to get a military force of 7,0000 men into the Middle East to serve as a buffer between Egyptian and Israeli forces and to prevent a resumption of fighting. Secretary General Waldheim, speaking last night at an emergency meeting called at Egypt's request, said that an advance unit of 900 officers and men would be in Cairo by morning. [1:6–7.] In the Israeli‐occupied Sinai peninsula, scene of the only major continuing military action, officers and men of the Israeli forces agreed on at least one thing: The Egyptian troops, whose water supply has been cut off, should be given water only if they raise the white flag or should be allowed to withdraw to Israeli lines along the Suez Canal leaving behind their equipment. [1:3.5.1] President Nixon chastised this country's Western European allies for withholding the support the United States would have liked for its Middle East policies and actions, suggesting that Europe “would have frozen to death this winter unless there had been a settlement.” [1:6.] The failure of the. United States to provide advance word to its allies of Thursday's worldwide troop alert contributed to a sense of bewilderment in European capitals about the United States. There were no official complaints about what some called a snub, but there was substantial private grumbling, and acknowledgment in several capitals that the Middle East crisis had created a series of new embarrassments in Europe's relations with the United States. [1:4.] National President Nixon, his face showing fatigue and his voice expressing occasional hurt and anger, asserted at a 40‐minute nationally televised news conference that he would not be deterred by demands for his impeachment and that he had no intention of resigning. He depicted himself as an embattled but able President, bringing peace to the Middle East because of his special relationship with the Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, even while he was under fire, unfairly, on the home front. [1:2–3.] President Nixon said at his news conference that a new Watergate special prosecutor would be named next week by Acting United States Attorney General Robert H. Bork, and he pledged “total cooperation from the executive branch.” He said that the matter of turning over evidence from the White House to the special prosecutor “can be worked out and should be worked out in cooperation, and not by having a suit filed by a special prosecutor within the Executive Branch against the President of the United States.” [1:1.] The House Judiciary Committee, which will meet Tuesday to work out ground rules for an Inquiry into the possible impeachment of President Nixon, appeared to be headed toward a party‐line split on a central issue—the constitutional ground on which impeachment could be based. [ 15:8.] Secretary of Agriculture Earl L. Butz is under investigation in connection with an alleged attempt to influence a Federal Trade Commission inquiry last year for political, purposes, according to several informed sources, as reported by the Washington Star‐News. [9:3.] The Federal District Court in Washington ordered the Nixon Administration to release more than $140‐million in impounded medical research and training funds, which had been appropriated by Congress. [6:3–8.] Metropolitan The Consolidated. Edison Company said the cutoff of fuel supplies from Arab countries, had forced it to begin purchasing highsulphur fuel, which is banned by city and state laws. The company called for “temporary suspension” of those laws, and its chairman said that the company had 25 days' supply of heavy‐residual fuel.

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/28/archives/letters-delayed-adolescence-convent-dropout-are-the-best-priests.html,"To the Editor: One of the most common clichés heard in secular magazines is that “the Catholic Church is losing it best priests.” If the Father Bill in Paul Wilkes's article (“The tempting of Father Bill,” Oct. 7) is at all typical, then some of the “best priests” are staying in the priesthood. Before Vatican II, some priests were apparently maintaining their vocations out of fear or habit. Yet no man who remains a priest for those reasons can truly serve Christ or His church to the best of his ability. Many of these “men have now left the priesthood. But those who have remained are more likely to be men who still want to be priests. Men who want to preach the gospel; men who want to bring the sacraments to brother Catholics; men who want to live their lives for Christ Jesus. And these are the men who are truly “best” for the Church. The opinion that secular society may have of the abilities or qualities of those who leave the priesthood is irrelevant. JOHN M. BRESNAHAN Jr. Lynn, Mass. Convent dropout To the Editor: Thanks for the reminder of how things used to be. “The tempting of Father Bill” had all the elements common to most of us entering Catholic religious life during the nineteen‐fifties and sixties. As one who made the other choice after 11 years as a nun, I had honestly forgotten about the constant soul searching so indigenous to religious life. Caring for a husband and young; children certainly rules it out! RACHEL M. MCGEEVER (Mrs. Patrick J. McGeever) Indianapolis Delayed adolescence To the Editor: Whoever “Father Bill” is, I do not question his right to bare his soul and tribulations to people of all faiths the world over. But many thoughts came to my mind as I read “The tempting of Father Bill.” First, no one ever grabbed young Bill by the neck and dragged him to the Seminary. Rather, his decision was his own — certainly modified by environment, but nonetheless not one made by the church he was destined to do battle with. Second, it is somewhat disquieting and not a little pathetic to see this man, and so many other priests nowadays, living in their mid‐30's and 40's an adolescence which most of us cheerfully kissed goodbye in our early 20's. The crises of self ‐ identity, the uncertainty of self‐drives and future directions, the grappling with authority and the painful process of learning accommodation—one can tolerate these continual stresses just so long before being rescued by the onset of maturity. And therein, perhaps, lies Father Bill's, and many another young priest's, greatest problem: They have not been forced into confrontation with providing the necessities of life for themselves, of providing for others, of performing a task proficiently lest others in the bread line snatch it from them. And thus is maturity delayed, hostility and uncertainty bred, and self‐martyrdom born. And this last concept becomes the self‐defeating cornerstone for identity. The martyr will not, cannot, leave the church; but remains as torment becomes confused with triumph; remains at his expense and the expense of those for whom he is the priest. Third, the Catholic Church is now recognizing the inherent dangers of such developmental delays, and is now suggesting, and in some instances requiring, that the future priest or nun have prior college or work, experience before beginning seminary training. Thus we can hope that there will be fewer Father Bills in the future. And lastly—and this is the most important point—many strong, faithful, and wonderfully good priests were born of the system Father Bill has credited with his near destruction. I recently attended a ceremony in honor of my own pastor (Father Francis Sheedy) marking his elevation to the rank of monsignor. I was one of his first altar boys some 20 years ago when our parish was begun, and have had the privilege of growing with him and his parish. And through it all, this humble, wise, goodhumored and compassionate man of God has been the rock St. Peter promised the early Christians. A book could be written on this man and many others like him, but, alas, it will be the Father Bills who capture the limelight and thus distort not only what the church can be, but what it is in reality for many. JOSEPH S. ROTH Rochester Degrading To the Editor: Paul Wilkes's article was nothing more than a degrading personal opinion of my church and many of my closest friends who are priestslaicizd, married and otherwise. It was in very poor taste. (MRS.) PEGGY HARRISON Harrington Park, N. J. Borderline calling To the Editor: I experienced an unbelievable sense of identity when reading the article “The tempting of Father Bill.” You see, I am also a priest. I could be a double of Father Bill. I have gone through all the doubts, the fears, the satisfactions and disillusionments, the failures and victories, the frustrations and hopes that he has experienced. Like him, have become aware of the lack of anything of reality and worth within the hierarchical church here in New York, or in my native Puerto Rico. I am living the life of a priest on the borderline of my calling. I live in New York and work in a corporation uptown, where I deal with the living conditions of blacks and Puerto Ricans in the Bronx who exist outside the “motherly arms” of the hierarchical church. The awareness of my priesthood. as in Father Bill's case, has come the hard way. It was only by literally going through the mill of being cast off by, and in turn casting off, archbishops, cardinals, and other hierarchical red hard hats that I became aware of what the church is all about. And my priesthood. Thank you for the article. Don't let them tell you otherwise. There are many like Father Bill, and like me, out there. FATHER CESAR RAMIREZ New York The arrogance of celibacy To the Editor. “The tempting of Father Bill’ is an astounding piece that explains sympathetically to outsiders how anyone could enter the priesthood. As a woman, I found parts of the explanation frightening, and I think Father Bill still does not realize what an affront required celibacy is to the dignity of half the human race. He does not seem to realize that even to accept the basic assumption that women are to be avoided as “temptations” and evils is to abnormally denigrate and, in fact, hate and fear us. When one reads such a confession of a priest feeling separated from “real life” and then contemplates the insistent manner in which the celibate leadership is still trying legally to control the bodies of women whose minds, hearts and experiences differ from the Catholic dogma, one can only feel renewed fury. How can such men, who have the time and solitude to walk the floors at night worrying about themselves, dare try to dictate to mothers who do not even have that freedom to pace alone, but instead must walk and worry with sick babies for hours at night only to be awakened after very little sleep by the demands of other children! How dare they, confessedly so lacking in normal day‐to‐day experience of what parenthood is, seek so fanatically to limit the responsible use of sex education, contraception, and abortion—and by their efforts further deny, and fear, the possibility that women too can be sensitive, moral, intelligent human beings who also can, consuit their own consciences and make careful, ethically valid decisions about their own bodies, their own lives, and their own families! Unless the church hierarchy can learn to control its abnormal fear of women and respect and love us for what we are, it will continue to be out of contact, and in fanatical conflict, with an immense part of human life. KATHERINE TECK (Mrs. Alan Teck) Hastings‐on‐Hudson, N.Y. Who shook up whom? To the Editor: May I correct one error of fact in “The tempting of Father Bill” — the passage which states: “... because of the G.I. Bill great numbers of lay Catholics were ... starting the ferment that was to come to fruition in the Second Vatican Council”? The American arrogance of this statement is exceeded only by its Catholic ignorance. In point of fact, there is not the most tenuous connection between the G.I. Bill and the Second Vatican Council. The hierarchy of the United States were followers at the Council, not leaders, and were seen by some commentators as largely unaware of what was going on. They were a great disappointment to their European colleagues, who were the movers and shakers of the Council, and had little impact on the deliberations, except for the peculiarly American issue of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. CHARLES J. SHEEDY Woodhaven, N. Y. Not just a Catholic issue To the Editor: It would be a mistake, think, to consider Paul Wilkes's compelling account of “The tempting of Father Bill” as only a Catholic story. Though the issues of authority and celibacy in the Roman priesthood make his version more dramatic, essentially the same story could be told by many, perhaps most, Protestant clergy: The substitution of church, for family, priestly role for personal relationships, ritual for spontaneity, structure and regulation for openness—above all, the serene facade and the sense of exemption from human emotions, the psychological experience of being set apart that ordination ratifies. This is the life history and life style of Protestant clergy, too. It would be a mistake, also, to suppose that the church produces these traits. The traits are those of the boy who grows up as a “little adult” always more at home in “vertical” relations with adults and institutional authority than in “horizontal” relations with peers. The church doesn't produce. such traits, but it may attract them. However, it would be a mistake, most of all, to assume too easily that such traits misfit a person for ministry, that the church must be purged of such ministers and its ministers of such traits. Such emotional setapartness induces occasional personal agony, of course, and discomfort and handicap in some of the roles the clergy are asked to assume. But the emotional distance may also provide just that perspective and freedom that is prerequisite for ministry, journalism, and other professions keeping sensitive vigilance over human foibles. Father Bill must be as skillful and persuasive a pastor in others' life histories as he is a re JAMES E. Dims Professor, Psychology of Religion, Yale University New Haven A life renewed To the Editor: Ten years ago I was in a state hospital in about the same condition as Julia in “The .psyche and the surgeon” (by Lee Edson, Sept. 30). am very grateful that my doctors and parents did not decide to remove part of my brain in order to control my “uncontrollable rage episodes:4 My case was not as dramatic as Julia's, but it still took more than a year in hospitals and two or three more outside for me to learn that could behave the way I wanted to. I also learned a lesson that the psychosurgeons (and their electroshock colleagues) apparently have yet to grasp —that rage emanates from the pit of the stomach, the lobes of the lungs and the chambers of the heart as well as the amygdala of the brain. Mind‐body dualism should have gone out with the 18th More and more, I am learning to accept my life's flow as part of nature's rhythm. Accepting the visceral‐mental impressions that come over me, I find they no longer cause dread, the source of rage. If this philosophy seems simple, well, I am not leading a contemplative life, but am a suburban housewife with the usual chores, volunteer activities and friends. Today I spun a yarn for my children, and when I finished my son paid me the ultimate compliment: “Read us that story again, ‘Mommy.” I am glad that psychosurgery did not take away my ability to feel passion, to experience transcendence, or to make up a story for my children. NAME WITHHELD Fairfield, Conn. Lee Edson replies: It is certainly true that rage is evidenced in the muscles and organs of the body, but there is little support among contemporary psychologists for the idea that it emanates from there. On the contrary, a half‐century of experimentation and clinical observation shows that the center of emotion is in the brain and probably in the limbic system. Nonetheless, I am happy indeed that the letter writer was able to find a cure for her problem without having to undergo psychosurgery. Pooches in perspective To the Editor: Banjo, the pug in Claire Berman's article, “A member of the family” (Oct. 7), deserves all the adulation showered upon him. All pug owners know this. Once when I was taking my pug for a walk, a stranger with a pug sitting next to her stopped her car and asked, “Does yours know she's a rand she spelled out] d‐o‐g?” “Of course not,” I replied, “but be careful, she can spell.” The lady drove away satisfied. JOYCE JONES Summit, N. J. To the Editor: Claire Berman covered all but one aspect of owning, loving and caring for our precious animal friends. That is —what is to be done with the .mounds of animal excreta lying all over the streets of our fair city? Dollars are constantly being spent in doggie boutiques, grooming parlors and even gourmet restaurants for animals. How about dog owners spending a few bucks on a “scoop” for the “poop”?

Catholic. Forums Attract Candidates,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/28/archives/catholic-forums-attract-candidates-papal-injunction.html,"A year‐old Roman Catholic political‐education group attracted the four New York mayoral candidates to forums in Brooklyn and Queens last week that sought to deal with matters of particular concern to the “outer” boroughs. But the candidates spent most of the allotted time making the same points they have been pressing home to Manhattan voters, who assertedly receive too much attention from municipal officeholders. The forums were inspired by the Most Rev. Francis J. Mugavero, Bishop of Brooklyn. In a letter to the four candidates earlier this month that received wide publicity, the Bishop called attention to what he said was a feeling of many residents of Brooklyn and Queens that New York City suffers from “Manhattanopia.” “They see neighborhoods like Bushwick and Brownsville decaying buildings burning, areas demolished and no evident concern at the highest level of government to preserve their neighborhoods,” the Bishop said. He went On to list nine areas of concern to residents of the four outlying boroughs. None of the problems were related specifically to issues that are identified with Roman Catholic policies, such as abortion or public aid to parochial schools. Rather they dealt with social issues on which voters of all faiths might expect candidates for local office to speak out. The candidate forums were held last Tuesday at Bishop Ford High School in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn and last Thursday at Bishop Reilly School in Fresh Meadow, Queens. Papal Injunction The forums were arranged by the, Civic and Political Committee of the Brooklyn Diocese's Office of Social Action, which was formed a year ago in response to a Papal injunction to Roman Catholics to take a greater part in civic affairs in conjunction with persons of other faiths. The committee Is directed chiefly by laymen rather than by clergymen. Its chairman, George R. Donahue, said last week that groups were active in 126 parishes within the diocese and that the committee was seeking participation in all 240 parishes. “Whatt got us started, was the realization that only 45 per cent of eligible voters go to the polls,” he said. “We want to make Catholics in the Diocese of Brooklyn more aware of their civic responsibility to participate in the political process — not as Catholics, but as citizens.” Controller Abraham D. Beame and Representative Mario Biaggi came closest at the Queens forum, to dealing with “outer borough” concerns, but only because their campaigns have been pegged to such themes all along. Mr. Beame promised an enlarged role for community boards, which he would like to turn into councils on a town‐meeting style. He promised, if elected, to set up a Department of Senior Citizens' Affairs to improve all services to the elderly. Law‐and‐Order Theme Mr. Biaggi declared his intention to preserve neighborhood life as the most effective means of saving the city, and he sounded his frequent lawand‐order theme, noting that he would require policemen and all other city employes to live within the five boroughs “because when the cop and the fireman and all the other symbols of authority are around 24 hours a day, the wrongdoer knows he has to watch out.” State Senator John J. Marchi and Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, though paying homage to Brooklyn, Queens and the other two‐bedroom boroughs, directed most of their remarks to less earthly concerns. Mr. Marchi called for higher moral values as a way to improve the quality of life in the city, arguing that society today compared unfavorably with that during the Great Depression, “when people were poorer but there was much less crime.” Mr. Blumenthal, the only Manhattanite id the race for Mayor, noted that he was a native of Brooklyn but decided to detail a program for tipping the scales that Bishop Mugavero feels are weighted heavily toward Manhattan. Instead, Mr. Blumenthal argued that by electing better public servants, the residents of all boroughs would benefit. The Rev, Robert P. Kennedy, who directs the Brooklyn Diocese's Office of Social Action, said after the forums that response to the bishop's “Manhattanopia” statement had been uniformly favorable. He added: “I think people have taken the Bishop's words for what they were meant to voice—a call for greater citizen involvement in the political process, but not on a partisan basis.”"
"Woman, 71 Back in the Fight",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/28/archives/woman-71-back-in-the-fight-led-urban-league-a-standard-answer.html,"NEW BRUNSWICK —When the Middlesex County Planned Parenthood Association lost its president recently, it called on a 71‐year‐old former president to take over. When a vacancy occurred on the Monroe Township Board of Education in July, the septugenarian, Marion Rieman, was appointed to fill it. She now looks forward to running for the seat in February. And when the Middlesex County Advisory Council for Comprehensive Health Planning needed a chairman this year, its members also turned to Mrs. Rieman. “Everyone talks about me as a senior citizen now,” Mrs. Rieman said in discussing her many roles, “and I guess no one is going to object to this innocuous little old woman heading an organization.” Mrs. Rieman, who is a member of the board of directors of the county‐subsidized Kiddie Keep Well Camp, vice president of the Raritan Valley Community Development Foundation (whose goal is to develop low‐cost housing) and a member of the Monroe Township Juvenile Conference Committee, is a 1923 graduate of New Jersey College for Women (now Douglas College). A Standard Answer In her long career of community service, she has been called many things, including a Communist and radical. Most often, though, she is accused of being a dogooder. “My standard answer to that,” says Mrs. Rieman, “is to tell them, ‘Well, I try.’ “ The mother of three daughters and the grandmother of five children, Mrs. Rieman is never a figurehead in her varied battles. For example, as president of Planned Parenthood, she does a weekly volunteer stint at the Jamesburg clinic, as well as fillin chores at the New Brunswick and Piscataway, clinics whenever needed. At present, Mrs. Rieman is ready to engage in what may develop into a heated compaign to have Planned Parenthood, or another nonprofit organization, open an abortion clinic in central New Jersey. “There is a crying need for an abortion facility that will make abortion available to poor women in New Jersey,” she said. “If you have sufficient money, there's no problem getting an abortion here. But if you're poor, the chances are you'll have to go out of state.” Widowed a year ago, Mrs. Rieman was the wife of Prof. William Rieman 3d, former chairman of the Rutgers University Chemistry Department. Earlier this year, a new wing of the university's Wright Chemistry Building was named for him. Led Urban League Most of Mrs. Rieman's adult life has been spent in New Brunswick, where she has served as president of the Urban League, the Neighborhood House, the League of Women Voters, the Women's Republican Club and the New Jersey Welfare Council. In 1947, 1951 and 1957, she ran for the all‐male New Brunswick Commission. Although she lost, she still considers all three efforts a worthwhile learning experience. “If you're really, going to he a successful candidate, you must build an organization,” Mrs. Rieman said. “And to do that you have to do lots of things for a lot of people. I tried to run on my record of community service. Unfortunately, it takes more than virtue to win an election.” After living in New Brunswick for more than 40 years, Mrs. Rieman made a concession to her age. She moved to Rossmoor, a retirement village in nearby Monroe Township. Meanwhile, Mrs. Rieman has rented her New Brunswick home to the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Service for $1 a year. The home will be used as a children's shelter, and Mrs. Rieman, as a member of the shelters board of directors, is helping to prepare the house for the youngsters who will soon occupy it. Mrs. Rieman's three daughters are married and living on the West Coast, an arrangement that she considers healthy. Mrs. Rieman said she was glad that her daughters were adults. “I don't resist the new morality,” she declared, “because change must come. Yet, I find myself relieved that my kids are married and thus not coming home with boyfriends they want to share a room with. “I don't know how I'd han dle that. Still, I suppose as long as young women have the self‐confidence to know they can also say no, they'll probably be all right.” After 47 years of marriage, living alone is not easy. But there is barely a day in which Marion Rieman does not attend four or five meetings and participate in some other form of volunteer work. And in her spare time, she raises vegetables in a 13‐by13‐foot garden provided for residents of Rossmoor, plays duplicate bridge, attends the opera and visits friends. Bot mostly, she explains, she relaxes by working."
Ramsey Clark Scores U.S. Supreme Court's Rulings on Sex and Pornography,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/28/archives/ramsey-clark-scores-us-supreme-courts-rulings-on-sex-and.html,"“What, after all, is wrong with ‘hot sense,’” asked Ramsay Clark, the former Attorney General, quoting a Thomas Mann phrase at a symposium on sex, the law and the citizen sponsored by the Sex Informad tion and Educational Council the U.S. Mr. Clark, the keynote: speaker, ‐concluded that too many American laws governing sex and pornography were hypocritical, inhumane, unenforceable and unconstitutional. He criticized the United States Supreme Court's recent ruling leaving pornography decisions to individual communities, saying “the kids would call it a cop‐out.” “It's a failure of the court to face the issue and terribly mischievous” in that it would lead to more “fear,” more human suffering” and ultimately more pornography, Mr. Clark added. His remarks were applauded last week by several hundred listeners in the New York Hilton Hotel, but not by Joel Tyler, the New York Criminal Court judge, who barred “Deep Throat,” the test‐case pornographic movie. In an interview, Judge Tyler suggested that Mr. Clark was advocating “wholesale permissiveness” not acceptable to the majority of Americans. He is not antisex himself, Mr. Tyler insisted. if he had seen any good movies lately, he replied, “'Cries and Whispers. It had a lot of sex but it was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, I walked out like this—” he made a quivering movement with his hands. Despite the strong prosexualrevolution leanings of teachers, social scientists and medical professionals in the audience, Judge Tyler remarked, “I feel very comfortable here.” Indeed, the symposium's marriage of sex and scholarship seemed an almost Victorian one—a sign posted outside the conference room sternly told curiosity‐seekers it was “a scientific and professional meeting: no one admitted without badge”—and many of the presentations were punctuated with footnotes and such nine‐letter words as “continuum.” If there was a consensus discernible among the speakers and their listeners, it was for legalized abortion, prostitution, homosexuality among consenting adults and decriminaliza tion of transvestism, and against what many apparently felt was the degradation of sex through pornography shops and X‐rated movies. Dr. Ralph Slovenko of Wayne State University, for example, called for a “new grammar” about sex, based on “good manners,” to replace what he said was the now‐lost concept of sin. This means, he said, permitting prostitution, “provided they don't do it in Macy's window.” The sex symposium was held in the same corridor at the Hilton as a Planned Parenthood meeting, suggesting to one observer the joint title: “Truth and Consequence.” The Planned Parenthood group promoted its own message in a poster plastered across the ballroom wall. It said: “Love Carefully!”"
Four Abortion Clinics Approved By State Health Planning Unit,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/29/archives/four-abortion-clinics-approved-by-state-health-planning-unit-3.html,"TRENTON, Oct. 28—The State Health Planning Council has approved applications for the establishment of the first four abortion clinics in New Jersey. The recommendation that the four sponsors be granted licenses to open the facilities was forwarded on Friday to Dr. James R. Cowan, the Commissioner of Health. Dr. Cowan is expected to act on the council's recommendations by Nov. 15, according to Joseph Kale, the director of the Comprehensive Health Planning Agency, which supplies the staff for the health council. The sponsors of the proposed clinics that received initial state approval were the Alternatives Incorporated and the Atlantic Abortion Clinic, both of Atlantic County; the Englewood Medical Center of Bergen County, and Planned Parenthood, Inc., of Jersey City. 3 Applications Deferred The council, at its meeting, deferred action on three other applications for clinics, including one submitted by Dr. Robert M. Livingston of Englewood Cliffs. Dr. Livingston attracted widespread publicity in August, 1972, when he was indicted for performing an abortion in his office on a 33‐year‐old mother of 11 children, But the charge was dropped following the United States Supreme Churt's ruling last January that an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy was a matter to be decided by the physician and the patient. The application from Dr. Livingston's Palisades Medical Group was set aside by the state, Mr. Kale said, because a local health planning agency that studies applications initially recommended it be denied, without offering any reasons. Reasons To Be Studied “The [state] council wants those reasons” before its next meeting on Nov. 30, Mr. Kale said. The two other applications submitted by the Pilgrim Medical Group for clinics in Essex and Union Counties—were deferred because they had not been reviewed by local agencies, Mr. Kale said. A survey released by a coalition of groups opposed to abortion indicates that a majority of major party candidates for the New Jersey Legislature favor a constitutional amendment to ban abortion in most cases Some two‐thirds of the 240 candidates polled by the group, which includes the New Jersey Right to Life Committee, would favor an amendment similar to one that would bar abortions except to save the life of the mother the survey found."
N.B.A. Stronz Point May Be Less Scoring,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/30/archives/nbastrong-point-may-be-less-scoring-national-basketball-association.html,"Scoring is down and there appears to be a greater emphasis on team defense as the National Basketball Association heads into the first full month of the season. There have been 74 games and of the 148 team scores, 53 have been under 100 points. Teams that figured to run away with division races are not. Injuries, serious and nagging, have played key roles. Earl Monroe has yet to play for the Knicks or Archie Clark for the Capital Bullets. Wes Unseld of the Bullets has had his knee in a cast, since the opening game. Nate Archibald of the Kansas City ‐ Omaha Kings, Jack Marin of the Houston Rockets and Dave DeBusschere of the Knicks, all in the superstar class, have been sidelined. For some of the 17 teams in the league the ball has taken some funny bounces: ¶The Knicks, with a 93.1 average, are last in offense. ¶The Boston Celtics, who began with a 10‐game winning streak last season, and appear unchanged, lead the Atlantic Division with only a 4‐3 won‐lost record. ¶The Los Angeles Lakers, without Wilt Chamberlain, had thousands of words written about their scheduled demise, but lead the Pacific Division with a 7‐2 mark. ¶The only consistency has been in the Midwest Division, where the Milwaukee Bucks have won eight of nine games and the Chicago Bulls (7‐2) are second as expected. At this stage last season a pattern for the eight playoff qualifiers had been set. If the present‐pattern holds and the races stay close, the fans may not have to wa until the playoffs in March for excitement. “I don't think the teams have reached their peaks said Coach Tom Heinsohn of the Boston Celtics. “A lot of clubs have young players making their way. Before the season is over I expect the scores will be higher. The teams are a Iot quicker and there is a lot more running. A look at the divisional races: ATLANTIC DIVISION The Knicks are still tops in defense, but offensively their timing is not yet there Age may be catching up. The Knicks also miss Monroe's scoring and he doesn't figure to be back until late next month. Boston, which had the best record in the league last season (68‐14), has the same team back with a stronger bench. Why the three losses? “Against the Bullets.” said Heinsohn, “we shot 28 per cent. We played well offensively against Houston, but our defense was poor and against Cleveland Sunday night the game was an abortion. We had 67 points at half‐time and ended up with 99 points. We went into the last quarter with a 10‐point lead and the officials called 15 fouls against us and three against the Cavaliers.” CENTRAL DIVISION There is little consistency here. The four teams have a total of 14 victories and 21 losses. Atlanta, with Pete Maravich and Lou Hudson, second and fourth, respectively, in league scoring, has the best offensive average, but the Hawks' problem last season, poor defense, remains. Only Seattle has a poorer defensive record. Houston is running more and the defense (16th last season) has improved considerably. If injuries continue to hamper the Bullets, the Rockets could become a playoff factor. Cleveland appears completely out of it. MIDWEST DIVISION Kareem Abdul‐Jabbir, of course, is the major factor for the Milwaukee Bucks. He is fifth in league scoring, second in blocked shots and seventh in rebounding. The Bucks' defense is second only to the Knicks and Oscar Robertson's leadership on offense is evident. He is sixth among the assist leaders. Bob Dandridge is scoring more. The Chicago Bulls are using their old formula for winning: ball control, defense and rebounding. Detroit has improved but has no place to move up. PACIFIC DIVISION Elmore Smith, obtained from the Buffalo Braves before the start of the season, is making the Lakers forget Chamberlain. Smith is second in rebounding and leads the league in blocked shots. He had 17 against Portland Sunday night. Gail Goodrich, with the help of a careerhigh, 49‐point performance, leads the N.B.A. scorers. The Goodrich‐Jerry West back court is producing 53 points a game and the Lakers averaging 107. The major disappointments are the Seattle SuperSonics and the Phoenix Suns. Bill Russell has done little but talk about making the Sonics a winner. After Sunday's loss to Detroit, he said, “An awful, disgraceful exhibition. Doubts are beginning to creep into my mind about our talents.” Russell said everybody, but Spencer Haywood is up for trade. Connie Hawkins continues to sink lower in Phoenix. After a sharp dropoff last season, he is averaging only 11 points a game and the Suns are looking to Mike Bantom, the No. 1 draft choice, to replace him. Neal Walk, the center, also is off to a slow start."
Byrne Doubts White‐Ethnic Vote Shift,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/02/archives/byrne-doubts-whiteethnic-vote-shift.html,"MORRISTOWN, Nov. 1 —doubt today that many of the voters whom his opponent for Governor, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., calls “peripheral urban ethnics” Brendan T. Byrne expressed would foresake traditional Democratic loyalties Tuesday to support Mr. Sandman. Mr. Byrne, the Democratic nominee, said at a news conference here that working‐class New Jerseyans resented being called “P.U.E.'s”. The term has been applied by F. Clifton White, Mr. Sandman's principal campaign adviser, to blue‐collar white residents of older neighborhoods in and near cities who feel threatened by blacks and have sometimes felt abandoned by the political system. Mr. White, who was instrumental in Senator Barry M. Goldwater's successful campaign for the 1964 Republican Presidential nomination, and who has since successfully managed campaigns for other conservative politicians, has countled on a strong “P.U:E.” vote to bring Mr. Sandman an upset victory. Mr. Byrne said numerous campaign stops in workingclass neighborhoods had convinced him that there would be no swing of these voters to Mr. Sandman because they were well aware of the Sandman antilabor voting record, including Mr. Sandman's opposition to increases in the minimum wage. “People resent being called P.U.E.'s,” Mr. Byrne said. “They prefer to be called residents and citizens of New Jersey. They have the same concerns as the rest of us, the same goals in their lives and hopes for their families for a happy future, decent schools and a clean state, morally and environmentally.” It has been estimated that 500,000 of the state's 3.5 million voters could fall into the category that the Sandman camp classifies as “peripheral urban ethnics.” Assemblyman Anthony Imperiale, leader of a militant white faction in Newark, is campaigning with Mr. Sandman for what Mr. Imperiale calls “preservation of our communities.” But throughout the state, working‐class voters have been approaching Mr. Byrne daily with offers of support. Typical was Joseph Zimmerman, recording secretary of Local 2178 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Jersey City, who stopped Mr. Byrne on the street in Newark last Tuesday to say: “You have our support.” Last night, Stanley Kaminski of the brewery workers' union in Camden told a visitor to the Polish‐American Citizens Club there that “'we're strictly Democrats and with Byrne all the way.” Mayor Angelo J. Errichetti of Camden, a Democrat, who introduced Mr. Byrne at a rally in the club, said privately afterward that he foresaw no loss of white votes because of Mr. Sandman's appeals to fear of blacks. At today's news conference, in a historic prerevolutionary mansion where George Washington and his wife lived in 1779 and 1780, Mr. Byrne urged Democrats not to be overconfident because polls put him far ahead of Mr. Sandman. He called the publication of the polls “unfortunate” because they might reduce campaigning by his fellow Democrats and because they “generate more and more irresponsibility in my opponent.” Mr. Byrne also said he had been shown literature that he was told Mr. Sandman intended to circulate over the weekend, when it would be too close to the Tuesday election for him to respond. He said the literature contained false charges that Mr. Byrne favored abortion, forced busing and increased taxes."
BYRNE ATTACKED BY ABORTION FOES,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/03/archives/byrne-attacked-by-abortion-foes-million-fliers-to-be-issued-by-new.html,"UNION, Nov. 2—A newly formed ad hoc group opposing abortions disclosed plans today to distribute, in the final days of the New Jersey gubernatorial campaign, a million copies of a brochure denouncing Brendan T. Byrne and endorsing his Republican opponent, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. Mr. Byrne said the brochure “irresponsibly distorts” his position on the abortion issue, too late for an effective response to voters who receive the literature. The Democratic nominee charged that another piece of pro‐Sandman literature, on school busing, and some televiSion commercials on taxes also unfairly distorted his positions in an 11th‐hour Sandman effort to win votes through deception. The antiabortion brochure is credited to the Right to Life Association of New Jersey. Sunday Distribution Set In a telephone interview, Michael McDanield, who makes educational film strips, said he was Essex County leader of the organization. He said the brochure, with a picture of a dead fetus he described as 11 weeks old, would he distributed at polling places Tuesday He said members of the Sandman organization probably Would help in the distribution Where they were needed. He said he might need some Sandnian people in his county to help the 120 persons he had lined up to hand out the brochures. Asked whether the Sandman campaign organization had contributed to the cost of printing the pamphlets, he said, “you'll have all that information at the proper time for disclosure.” The next date for the disclosure of campaign expenditures is 15 days after the election. The brochure says of Mr. Byrne: “He supports abortion. He feels that it is an individual's right to kill the unborn.” Mr. Byrne's position on the issue, as stated in a compilation of his statements on campaign issues, is this: “As a matter of personal conscience, I am strongly opposed to abortion. Under the new Supreme Court ruling, however, any woman desiring an abortion is legally free to receive one in New Jersey. This raises serious problems for many of us who continue to hold deep personal objections to abortion ... As Governor, I would work [for] the right of any doctor, staff member or religious hospital to refuse to participate in an abortion when such participation would violate religious principles or conscience.” Amendment Proposed Both candidates are Roman Catholics. Representative Sandman is cosponsor of a proposed amendment to the United States Gonstitution to ban abortions. Mr. Byrne does not support this. Despite the confusing similarity of names, Mr. McDanield said, the Right to Life Association has nothing to do with the national, tax‐exempt, educational Right to Life Committee, which does not endorse candidates. The association supporting Mr. Sandman was formed about three months ago. Its only major undertaking is the brochure, which was printed a week ago. Some copies have been distributed already, Mr. McDanield said, but the major thrust will come at churches Sunday. Byrne supporters said priests had been asked to permit distribution of the brochure inside as well as outside churches. The Byrne headquarters here complained about two Sandman commercials seen in the last few days in South Jersey over Philadelphia television stations. Byrne campaign officials said both distorted their candidate's position against imposition of an income tax in the forseeable future. Commercials Given One spot commercial has a Than saying: “I can't afford my rent now. What am I going to do with the income tax Byrne wants?” A picture of Mr. Sandman then flashes on the screen and a voice says: “Vote for Sandman. Beat the income tax.” The second commercial starts with a woman's voice saying: son goes to college next year. I don't know how we'll afford it if Mr. Byrne gets his income tax.” Then the Sandman picture appears and a voice says: “Vote for Sandman. Beat the income tax.” After this a man says: “I gotta hold down two jobs just to stay even, and Byrne wants an income tax. Not for me.” Mr. Byrne complained recently to the Fair Campaign Practices Committee in Washington about the latest piece of literature on busing by the Sandman for Governor Committee that says: “Parents be alerted to this fact: Charles Sandman is against forced school busing of your children ... Brendan Byrne is for forced school busing of your children out of your district.” Mr. Byrne has spoken out repeatedly in opposition to such forced busing."
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/03/archives/letters-to-the-editor-a-vice-president-nowor-never-of-games-fog-and.html,"To the Editor: Our rulers in Washington are behaving strangely. One of the most vocal members of the House of Representatives has suggested that no attention be paid to the 25th Amendment of the Constitution. “We do not need a Vice President,” was the remark, the crispest nullification proposal ever advanced. Others view the amendment with such pretended reverence that they want to make a production out of its operation; time is not of the essence. Still others suggest using it as a ploy to compel adoption of some favored policy not related to filling the office. All seem to have forgotten that if anything happened to the President we would have a new President, the Speaker, with no investigation of his qualities whatsoever. In the Senate words rival Tennyson's brook. Several talk freely about impeachment, which is the exclusive privilege of the House. If the House were to draw a bill of impeachment, each Senator would fill a dual role, part judge, part juror. Yet the statements stream forth wherever a camera or a microphone can be found. One member of the Senate Watergate Committee, which insists it cannot make up its mind until the last conceivable witness is heard, showed the state of his indecision by calling upon the President to resign forthwith. He made the proposal to the sound of guaranteed thunderous applause. Mr. Meany had said it first. Most of these prospective judgejurors have made prejudicial comments that would bar them from any criminal bench or any petit jury where this putative “defendant” was involved. This they well know, most being lawyers. Still, they prejudge freely. Is it any wonder the public is losing confidence in government? The executive is not the whole government. We have a right to expect the legislative branch to behave as though its members knew and respected their responsibilities. HENRY M. WRISTON New York, Oct. 25, 1973 To the Editor: The resignation of the Vice President has stimulated several proposals for revising the procedure for selecting this official. I think that the VicePresidency should be abolished. In our representative democracy, anyone who becomes President should have been elected by the people on the basis of ability to lead the country. Under the existing procedure, the Presidential nominee selects the VicePresidential nominee on the basis of ability to placate groups among which the Presidential nominee lacks strong support. As the Vice President has no essential function except to wait upon the death or incapacity of the President, and typically Presidents do not favor assigning to the Vice President important duties, persons of Presidential stature are not available for the position. Yet, within the last three decades, two Vice Presidents have become President through the death of Presidents. The Founding Fathers had good reason for establishing a Vice‐Presidency. Transportation was by horse and communication by post. It was not practical to hold a national election on short notice. However, today nationwide television and air travel make it practical to conduct an election for President in a relatively short time. Upon death or incapacity of a President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as that elected official after the President most representative of the people, should serve as interim Acting President. As promptly as feasible, an election of a President should be conducted. The Acting President would then return to the position of Speaker. This recommendation would assure that the President is a person elected by the people on the basis of ability to lead the country. It would avoid the incongruity of a representative democracy subject to a President chosen by one person. ROSCOE L. BARROW Oakland, Calif., Oct. 21, 1973 Of Games, Fog and Crashes To the Editor: Recent auto accidents on the New Jersey Turnpike occasioned by dense fog, a commonplace condition for that area, lead one to think about the advisability of constructing a sports arena in the New Jersey Meadowlands. In all likelihood, almost every sporting event in the arena would attract thousands of spectators who would arrive and depart by automobile. I shudder at the thought of what could happen if a sudden dense fog enveloped the area of the arena at the conclusion of the event. I can envision a tie‐up of cars the likes of which our metropolitan area had never before seen. I can also envision cars stranded many hours and perhaps even overnight, with concomitant accidents and injury to the drivers. In view of this, shouldn't the sponsors of this project perhaps reconsider the advisability of erecting a sports arena in this chronically fogbound location? MORRIS MILLSTEIN Brooklyn, Oct. 25, 1973 • Easing the Fuel Shortage To the Editor: With the fuel shortage growing more serious daily, there are measures that could be taken to ameliorate the situation. One is to allow commuters an income‐tax benefit for traveling by train or bus instead of by private cars. This deduction of, let us say, about 20 or 25 per cent could be established by attaching the expired transit tickets to income‐tax reports. In this way, many more commuters would be encouraged to use mass transit. This in turn would result in a sharp reduction in gasoline usage and would help to relieve air pollution and congested highways. IRVING SHAPIRO Woodmere, L. I., Oct. 8, 1973 ‘Infantilized’ Children To the Editor: The series of racial crimes lately suggest that we have been on the wrong track. From day care to career guidance, government has been providing many black children for the past decade with services once offered, if at all, by home and church. So far, the only criticism I've heard is that these programs are not extensive enough and do not employ enough blacks. My objection to this institutional method of raising youngsters is that it infantilizes them. Human beings are socialized—taught self‐control and loyalty—by early dependence on one or two significant adults. For food and cuddling, the child returns imitation and obedience. But today, when the teen‐aged mother gets bored with the baby who is her proof of sexual success, she can dump him on the very hospital or clinic or psychiatric social worker who provided her with whatever steady food, love and guidance she received. Increasing the proportion of black workers has not changed the destructive transiency of these parent substitutes. Many young idealists give not only love but their own money to meet the expectations of these dependents; but then they move on to other jobs. Every time a youngster makes an emotional connection, it is broken by the free choice of the adult, who is not dead or incapacitated but right around the corner pouring forth the same devotion on other children. Ultimately the child only manipulates those adults who try to win him; his loyalty and obedience, if any, go to his peers. In rural days, black churches provided the socializing structure for young mothers and children. They did not infantilize their members, for they demanded service and responsibility in return for their support. Ultimately, young blacks internalized the voices of capable adults of their church into a conscience of their own. But these small churches, now struggling to survive the competition with city services, are ridiculous in the eyes of the young because of their poverty. I would suggest matching funds for established neighborhood churches in return for expansion of their youth programs with free breakfasts, sex and baby‐care classes, sports and crafts, theater and reading. (I emphasize “established” because of the hustlers that might quickly organize the churches.) With modest wealth and power, the church people would regain control of their children. We might once again see the version of black culture that marched at Selma and Birmingham. HELEN STEELE New York, Oct. 25, 1973 To Select a Judge To the Editor: The stubborn insistence of the Association of the Bar that it, alone of all of the metropolitan bar associations, has jurisdiction to pass upon the qualifications of judges throughout the City of New York [letter Oct. 23], does a disservice to the quest of the organized bar for a better judiciary. The alleged basis for this position—that it is a citywide organization—is fallacious. Its membership is composed almost exclusively of lawyers whose offices are in Manhattan and who practice only peripherally in the courts in the other four counties. A substantially higher proportion of its membership resides in Nassau, Westchester and suburban Connecticut and New Jersey, where it has not asserted jurisdiction, than resides in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx, where it does. Were the position of the Association of the Bar to be accepted at face value, then should not the county bar associations, a substantial number of whose members have offices in Manhattan and practice in the courts there, likewise assert jurisdiction to pass upon qualifications of judges in New York County? Opposition by the Queens County Bar Association to the intrusion of the Association of the Bar into the field of judicial selection in Queens County should not be dismissed as mere parochialism. Our membership is predominantly composed of lawyers having a first‐hand knowledge of the abilities of the lawyers and judges who practice or serve here and from whose ranks our county's judicial candidates have for the most part been selected. The location of the law offices of most of our members within Queens County, and the fact that they preponderantly practice in the courts located there, give them an intimate knowledge of their community and the condition and needs of its courts. It is for this reason that the Queens County Bar Association believes itself to be in the best position to judge the qualifications of judges to be elected or appointed to serve in courts located in Queens. It is likewise the reason why we so strongly oppose the intrusion of the Association of the Bar, composed as it is of a membership which lacks any real familiarity with the lawyers, judges and the courts of our county. JULES J. HASKEL President, Queens County Bar Assn. Jamaica, N. Y., Oct. 26, 1973 • A Vote for Goldin To the Editor: It is disappointing that in its Oct. 19 editorial on the Controller's race, The Times failed to endorse State Senator Harrison J. Goldin. On June 10, 1969, when Senator Goldin was running for Controller in the primary, The Times endorsed Goldin for “his forthright stands on controversial issues and his sponsorship of progressive legislation.” In that editorial, The Times wrote further that Goldin “holds the greatest promise among the candidates as a vigorous, creative leader.” The Times' editorial continued: “He believes, as we do, that the Controller needs to be more than a glorified bookkeeper, that he must exert positive community leadership.’ The Harrison Goldin who is candidate for Controller in 1973 is a more seasoned figure than the Harrison Goldin whom The Times endorsed in 1969. Meanwhile his commitment to social progress and his zeal for liberal purposes are as strong as ever. The Citizens' Union, in its analysis of candidates for Controller this year, labeled Senator Goldin as “preferred,” and pointed to his “obvious depth of understanding of governmental budgetary matters.” I have respect for his Republican opponent, but Harrison Goldin is, I believe, the man best qualified to use the capabilities of the office of Controller for the good of the government of the city. Senator Goldin brings a lively intelligence and an irrepressible personal drive to public office. He has the potential of being not only an effective Controller, but an effective force in city government as part of the broadly based leadership team which Controller Beame has promised to involve in the solution of the city's myriad problems. ROBERT F. WAGNER New York, Nov. 1, 1973 Unborn Children To the Editor: As so many others who criticize, the Catholic Church for its preaching to the whole world about the immorality of abortion, the Oct. 25 letter to The Times by Rebecca Goldblum misses the point. The Catholic Church is not trying to deprive anyone of his or her God‐given rights, but only to safeguard the rights of a sector of humanity that cannot defend itself: unborn children. Moreover, it has never been the right of medical authorities to determine or decide when specifically human life begins. If they were to declare that it didn't begin until the child began to walk or talk, their opinion would not constitute truth. And no more so would it constitute truth were they to decide that it doesn't begin until the moment of birth. Have the pro‐abortionists ever seriously considered even the possibility that what they are killing could be a human being? Have they ever proven that it is not? Can they in good conscience take the chance? (Rev.) GREGORY V. HADDOCK New York, Oct, 25, 1973"
ALEX ROSE DENIES HUGGING DE SAPIO,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/03/archives/alex-rose-denies-hugging-de-sapio-contends-he-did-not-even-attend.html,"Alex Rose, the Liberal party leader, denied yesterday a published report that he embraced Carmine G. De Sapio, the former Democratic County leader of New York County, at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial dinner. Mr. Rose's denial appeared in James Wechsler's column in The New York Post yesterday. Mr. Rose said that he had not even attended the dinner, and Mr. Wechsler called the report about the embrace of the two politicians a “dirty trick” in his column yesterday. Mr. Rose told Mr. Wechsler and later a reporter for The New York Times that he had “not even seen or spoken to De Sapio for a least 10 years.” And Charles H. Silver chairman of the dinner, said he recalled that Mr. Rose had bought two tickets but sent someone else to the dinner in his place. Mr. Rose also said that was the case. The report of the embrace of the two politicians appeared in James Brady's New York Intelligercer column in New York magazine's Nov. 5 issue. Prank Rossetti, the current New York County Democratic leafier said yesterday that he had not seen Mr. Rose at the dinner, and he said other politicians who were there with him could not recall seeing Mr. Rose. De Sapio could not be reached for comment. Mr. Brady said yesterday that he had not attended the dinner, but that he had received his information from “a source who would definitely recognize Alex Rose.” He said the source was not “a person with an ax to grind,” but he would not name the source. Source Not Named Mr. Wechsler and Mr. Rose were of the opinion that Mr. Brady's column item had been a “plant,” designed to discredit the mayoral campaign of Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, the Liberal party candidate, who has criticized the Democratic candidate, Controller Abraham D. Beame, for his public appearances with De Sapio. De Sapio was defeated by the Reform faction of the Democratic party in 1961, losing to Edward I. Koch, now Representative. De Sapio, a former Tammany Hall chief, was later convicted of conspiracy to bribe James L. Marcus, when Marcus was City Water Commissioner. De Sapio was sentenced to two years in Federal prison in 1971, and since his release last January has stayed away from all large Democratic party functions until recent weeks. “Who promoted the false story?” Mr. Wechsler wrote in his column yesterday. “Was it all a case of mistaken identity —or was it planted as a lastminute campaign gambit and published without checking?” Mr. Rose said that he had never attended a Smith Memorial Dinner in his life and that he had been especially disinclined to go this year since Mr. B??menthal had been pointedly left off the invitation list, the only mayoral candidate not invited. Mr. Blumenthan said he was not invited because of his having sponsored the state abortion bill."
Teaching About Watergate,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/04/archives/making-the-best-of-a-bad-situation-teaching-about-watergate.html,"Some of the children in the fifthgrade class that Joanne Cortellino teaches in Amherst, N. H., have been coming up to her in recent days and saying that they think that President Nixon may not be telling the truth about Watergate. Then, they ask her what she thinks. “How do I answer them without having the wrath of the community come down on my head?” wonders Miss Cortellino. Watergate is the kind of subject that can be an elementary or secondary school teacher's dream—or nightmare. On the one hand, it provides a perfect vehicle for bringing alive and making relevant lessons in government, history and social studies. At the same time, it Is controversial and has partisan overtones, causing almost any teacher to take pause. Whatever the viewpoint, Watergate has attracted the interest of educators and students around the country. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the state's School Journal carried an article on the pros and cons of teaching about the controversy. And Helen D. Wise, president of the National Education Association, insists that Watergate should be of concern to all teachers. “Teachers are asking me how they can fulfill their responsibilities in teaching young people the moral, ethical and spiritual values required in a free society while the President of the United States disregards the nation's traditionally high standards of morality,” she said recently. Recognizing Watergate's potential for enriching the curriculum, 135 elementary and secondary school teachers from throughout New England gathered last weekend in Scarborough, Me., under the auspices of the National Education Association to discuss the possibilities and problems inherent in using Watergate as a teaching tool. By the time the conference.ended, 25 of the organizers had signed a petition calling for, the impeachment of President Nixon. Before taking on the role of activists, however, the teachers had listened to speeches and participated in seminars in which they concentrated on the conference's theme, “The Educational Implications of Watergate.” It was in one of the seminars that Miss Cortellino told of the difficulties she faces in trying to respond to her pupils' questions on Watergate. An older, more experienced teacher, Jacqueline Johnson of Sanford, Me., who also has a classroom full of fifth‐graders, remarked that she thought forthrightness was the best policy for a teacher in dealing with a topic like Watergate. “We were discussing impeachment recently in connection with Andrew Johnson,” said Mrs. Johnson, “and then we related it to Mr. Nixon's situation. The children asked me, ‘What do you think?’ and I said that I was frightened when I thought about impeachment and its implications. Then they asked me, ‘Did you vote for him?’ and said that I did because at that time I thought that he would be a good President, but that I wouldn't vote for him today. That was being honest. I'm still waiting for the repercussions.” But some people resent the inclusion of Watergate in the curriculum. “The exploitation of Watergate has no bearing on the true education of youngsters,” says Addah Jane Hurst, a former Arlington, Va., high school teacher who is a member of the National Association of Concerned Parents, a group formed to counteract the radical movement of the nineteensixties. “Over the past few years, there have been increasing complaints from parents about the use of classrooms as political pulpits for highly partisan political views of teachers on such subjects as Vietnam, the legality of drugs and, more recently, Watergate.” In deciding whether to voice their opinions, teachers must weigh the consequences. If they say nothing, they run the risk of being labeled “cop‐outs,” according to Nancy Clark, a high school teacher in Freeport, Me. Also, in the view of Jack J. Rosenblum, who helps train teachers in Wakefield, N. H., a teacher who does not state opinions Education may “end up through example teaching children that it is best not to take a stand.” But giving an opinion may be dangerous, too. There is, above all, the possibility of getting in trouble with parents, principals and superintendents who believe that teachers should keep their opinions to themselves — especially on touchy matters. And, on a purely cognitive basis, there is the difficulty of being in a position to unpose one's values on impressionable young people. Although some teachers make it a policy to avoid trouble by sidestepping controversy, this sort of attitude has become less frequent in recent years as teachers have moved cautiously toward relating what goes on in society to what is happening in the classroom. They have been less reluctant to deal with such subjects as abortion, the movement to legalize marijuana and American involvement in Vietnam. Anyway, the primacy of television has assured that children will at least be of current events. Considered Important by some teachers in light of Watergate is the need to show students positive examples of integrity and honesty in government. “Even in this mess,” said Ralph Joy, director of the National Education Association's Leadership Development Academy, “there are models emerging that must be brought out, people like Elliot Richardson, for instance.” Charles Sanders, a guidance counselor in Millinocket, Me., told of giving a standardized intelligence test recently to a youngster in which there was a question asking why most government positions should be filled by examination. “The student's answer was ‘because politicians are crooks,’ which was not a correct response but showed something about the attitude of young people these days toward politics,” remarked Mr. Sanders. One way of countering such a feeling, according to Donna Smith, a fourth‐grade teacher in Bingham, Me., is to point out that the Watergate tribulations have to do with individuals and do not represent permanent defects in government. “I want to be careful,” Mrs. Smith said of her students, “that they don't confuse the office of the Presidency with a particular man who happens to be in that office.” In some people's eyes, teachers bear much of the responsibility for helping to heal the breach of confidence that has developed in the wake of Watergate.. “It is terribly relevant for educators to face the question of Watergate and to think about how to rekindle faith in our government, in our country,” Representative Margaret M. Heckler, Republican of Massachusetts, said in the opening speech at Scarborough. “The sense of confidence can be engendered by the way you tell students what power to the people really Means.” But helping to reestablish the faith of young people in American government is a task that some educators consider monumental in light of the effects of Watergate. “We used to tell these kids that you may grow up to be President of the United States, that it was something to which they should aspire,” said Claire Filbettaz, a white‐haired algebra teacher from Auburn, Me. “Now we can't tell them that anymore because they just laugh in our faces.”"
The President and the People,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/04/archives/the-president-and-the-people.html,"To the Editor:What are the high crimes and misdemeanors that President Nixon is charged with as the justifications for impeachment? The drive for impeachment has been gaining momentum with every headline and broadcast in the past few days. Several Congressmen and two mayoral candidates have spoken out boldly. The man on the street, waylaid by TV interviewers to declare his stand on impeachment, a convention of the A.F.L‐C.I.O. whipped into a frenzy by a grim George Meany, an exulting Bella Abzug — these are signs of growing tension. There is the smell of political blood in the air, and, as the hysteria mounts, the voice of reason is drowned out. The Nixon haters have their quarry at bay. This is not the first time they have called for impeachment. The “high crime” he was charged with in the Vietnam war was to persist against the enemy until he could achieve the honorable withdrawal of American troops and the return of war prisoners. The “misdemeanor” he committed in the Pentagon Papers affair was to proceed vigorously, if unwisely, against the stealer of classified documents. His involvement in the Watergate burglary was to dismiss members of his staff when he was convinced of their betrayal of his confidence. Throughout his ordeal of continual and relentless vilification, the President carried on his official duties with statesmanlike self‐restraint. He defended his honor, in reasoned public statements; he held press conferences in which he explained and justified his actions — to the discomfiture of some of his questioners. The President's statement of Oct. 20 on the Watergate tapes is a model of forceful exposition. In it he outlined the “compromise plan” by which an authenticated transcript of those segments of the tapes that were relevant to the Watergate investigation would be voluntarily given to Judge Sirica, the Senate committee and Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. What more could the President have done consistently with his belief in the need for confidentiality in his Oval Office conversations? Now he was willing to give up the principle of confidentiality in the interest of averting a constitutional crisis. The President's capitulation on Oct. 23 — his consent to hand over the tapes to Judge Sirica — was again an act of courage. Many lawyers, and at least one member of the Court of Appeals, agreed with Mr. Nixon's interpretation of the law. No one claims that his dismissal of Mr. Cox was not well within his legal rights, though, as Representative Anderson put it, it was not a judicious decision. But he was aware that the weight of opinion was against him. A storm that would imperil the Government was brewing. There was no time to present a logically persuasive case to the public. The example of President Andrew Johnson's impeachment should remind us that the passionately felt political consensus of the moment may be refuted by history. ALFRED T. VOGEL New York, Oct. 24, 1973 To the Editor: When Mr. Nixon said in his Oct. 26 press conference that he was not angry at the media because you can only be angry at those you respect, he was not only revealing his deep‐seated anger but showing a peculiar illogic. is extraordinarily obvious that human beings get angry mostly with those Hitler, Stalin, even Nixon himself. It is shocking and saddening to hear the President say, “I have what it takes.” One cannot think of a statesman of any stature who would say this in public. Imagine Washington, Jefferson, Churchill, Truman, Eisenhower or Julius Caesar, for that matter, having to reassure us in these words. Mr. Nixon was, I take it, reassuring himself. One shudders at that nonsense about the strength of character that came from his Midwestern grandparents. This is profound baloney of the first water, genetically and sociologically. It's about as sound as saying I get my drinking hatbits from my grandfater who was born in Cork. WILLIAM R. CLARK Mansfield Center, Conn. Oct. 28, 1973 To the Editor: In his recent news conference, President Nixon characterized news coverage of the Watergate affair as the most “outrageous, vicious, distorted reporting” he had ever seen in his 27 years of public life. Later, when asked exactly what it was about the news coverage that angered him, he retorted that he was not angry; that he could “only be angry with those he respects.” Perhaps Mr. Nixon needs to be reminded that the media's persistent investigative reporting was responsible for the first shocking revelations of high Administration involvement in all that is now known under the generic title of “Watergate.” Without this reporting, the whole sordid mess would still be beneath the White House rug, where it had been swept by Mr. Nixon's chief domestic affairs adviser, Mr. Nixon's legal counsel, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff and possibly even Mr. Nixon himself. On April 30, when he announced the resignation of the first three of the above officials, Mr. Nixon tacitly acknowledged that the charges made by the press had been correct and that the Administration's denials had been erroneous. Following his speech, he spoke to some newsmen and told them, “We have had our differences in the past, and I hope you will give me hell every time you think I'm wrong. I hope I am worthy of your trust.” Our President's memory must be short indeed. ZACHARY WINESTINE New York, Oct. 28, 1973 To the Editor: As an outraged American, I find the performance of the news media at Presidential press conferences a national disgrace. The so‐called journalists have made a mockery of eliciting information for the country. These hypocritical exhibitionists appear to have only one sickening motive in mind: to harass the President just as savagely as they can while in stage center. Their performance is capped with a cry of “foul” when he reacts. I think our President confirms his stature as a leader in the way he faces this most despicable firing line. PATRICIA MCDONOUGH Brooklyn, Oct. 27, 1973 To the Editor: President Nixon's recent actions shouldn't surprise his public. One can only wonder how far the people and the Congress will let Mr. Nixon go before he is compelled to make an accounting. Given the precarious state of our economy, diminished world prestige and seriously tarnished moral leadership, it is time to bring the Watergate series of traumas decisively to a conclusion. The only acceptable route is thorough, impartial (if at all possible) Congressional investigation as called for in impeachment proceedings. We cannot ask the Chief Executive to investigate his Administration when he stands to lose all. The investigation must be undertaken on a totally independent basis, one which precludes firing the investigator when he begins to find answers. NEIL S. SONENBERG Douglaston, N. Y., Oct. 28, 1973 To the Editor: If there is an overview in these confusing times, it is that one of the basic requirements of good government is an element of consistency or stability. One's own particular party or political views may not be in force at a particular time, but during those times one accommodates emotionally and psychologically to putting up with opposing views. Indeed, the supporters of the opposing views then have a turn to enjoy, with reasonable assurance, the fruits of their expectations. Simple. But what we have now and have had for five years is a box of surprises. We've had surprises during the Vietnam war. The various “phases” were surprises. The détentes were indeed pleasant surprises. Surprise is an understatement of Watergate. Mr. Nixon's way of governing has had nothing consistent to look forward to. Such “erraticism” has shock value sometimes, but as a constant governing by surprise is untenable. The recent events in Washington and the country's violent reactions to them are a predictable by‐product of our having been kept off‐balance for so long. Mr. Nixon should not have been surprised by cries for impeachment at Mr. Cox' firing because Mr. Cox and Mr. Richardson and the courts represented one of the few desperately needed threads of continuity remaining within the grasp of a troubled country. LAURA ELLS Concord, Mass., Oct. 22, 1973 To the Editor: If the tragedy of Lyndon Johnson was the tragedy of the American people (the death of the Great Society), the tragedy of Richard Nixon might prove to be the tragedy of the world. As dramatic as it sounds, the potentialities for it are there. The United States is facing a strong centralized superpower whose influence is expanding ominously. And who qualifies better than Mr. Nixon and Dr. Kissinger to hold their own against Mr. Brezhnev and his Politburo? Whoever could do it has still to prove himself. In a democracy, part of the strategy in maintaining the balance of power when confronting a dictatorship depends upon having a leader who can act swiftly, forcefully and uncompromisingly in an emergency. This Administration has proven itself very decisively in fateful events in foreign policy. To push for the resignation or impeachment of the President, in this time of crisis, seems irresponsible. And what about postponing the inner confrontations? Does history have to repeat itself indefinitely? In 1967 the general consensus was that Russia gambled on provoking the Arabs to war with Israel, taking advantage of the division and turmoil in U.S. at that time and the resulting weakening of the Presidency. Isn't it possible that Watergate has to a certain degree the same effect? Let Watergate remain a blessing to the American people with its most probably forthcoming new legislation and a generally constructive cleansing effect. There is no need to pay terribly destructive price in foreign policy, so crucial in the present crisis. At this time in history, when the achievements of this Administration toward a structure of world peke, through accords with Russia and China, were hailed by all in all countries as the hope of humanity, to weaken the Presidency, creating frightful turmoil by demanding the resignation or impeachment of the President, with its incalculable consequences, would be an act of destructiveness not only toward the American people but toward the world. “Where there is no vision, people perish.” JENNY PALATIN Long Beach, L. I., Oct, 23, 1973 0 To the Editor: The problems facing our nation will not be solved by the impeachment of President Nixon. Politics and selfish interests should be cast aside where the welfare of our country is at stake. All of us are to blame for the dilemma we are in. The wounds to our nation do not need surgery but statesmanship. SAMUEL SCHEINHORN Fresh Meadows, N. Y., Nov. 2, 1973 • To the Editor: As much as I dislike everything President Nixon stands for, I found no pleasure in seeing a man anguished as he appeared on Oct. 26 on the television, screen. Obviously trying hard to keep his cool, he couldn't refrain from lashing out at his “enemies”—the media and, implicitly, the American people who have rejected him. In his insistence that he was not too “shell‐shocked” to make an important decision in the “greatest crisis” since the Cuban missile confrontation (actually turning out to be seventy Russian observers sent to Egypt after the first cease‐fire had been violated), he laid bare his desperation. The, sad truth is that his past has caught up with President Nixon and is overwhelming him. It is cruel to him and harmful to the country to keep him on his tottering throne. He should be advised to resign without being subjected to any further recrimination, or, if he refuses, Congress should act with mercifill speed and remove him as painlessly as possible. HOWARD KOCH Woodstock, N. Y., Oct. 28, 1973 • To the Editor: I will never abandon Richard Nixon. He got us out of Vietnam. He dispersed rioters and demonstrators. He made a new beginning with China and Russia. He opposed abortion. He told a woman reporter to wear skirts instead of pants suits. Who else anywhere in the world accomplished so much in these unheroic times? Nixon's enemies are my enemies. I'm not helping them to cut him down so that they can return to power. JEANNE MCQUADE Queens Village, N. Y., Oct. 30, 1973 • To the Editor: It has been the pattern to describe Mr. Nixon and those associated with his position in recent events as “political and judicial conservatives.” The words have always had a somewhat ambiguous meaning in American politics, but today they seem to have become a euphemism for nothing more than amoral opportunism. What kind of “conservative” is it who flouts the very institutional structure upon which our political system rests? That so few proclaimed conservatives have spoken in protest of these actions reveals the shallowness of American conservatism as a tradition and as a doctrine. “Conservatism” as a political label seems to be on the verge of being thoroughly discredited as a force in American politics, for better or for worse.

Jersey Republicans Fear A Major Defeat Tuesday,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/04/archives/jersey-republicans-fear-a-major-defeat-tuesday.html,"TRENTON, Nov. 3—As New Jersey's campaign for Governor drew to a close this weekend, many state Republican leaders reported today that final efforts by Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. to avert defeat had failed and that he and the Republican party appeared headed toward a political disaster in Tuesday's election. The victory predicted for Brendan T. Byrne, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, is being measured by both parties in terms of a landslide. Influential Republican leaders reported that their position was so grim that they stood to lose control of both houses of the Legislature. Moreover, Republican tickets at the county and local levels were reported in danger. “It looks like a disaster, a wipeout,” said one Republican legislative leader, who drew a parallel in the political destruction suffered by his party when Senator Barry Goldwater was the Republican Presidential candidate in 1964. With that in mind, he and other prominent Republicans identified with the party's moderate wing are already discussing the inevitability of a purge, should the defeat they expect reach the proportions they foresee. The purge would be directed at Mr. Sandman's control of the party and at leaders he has installed in power, such as John Spoltore, the Republican state chairman. The gubernatorial election here has already been described by George Bush, the Republican national chairman, and by John B. Connally, the former Treasury Secretary, as a referendum on the political impact of the Watergate scandal. “If this election is to be a bellwether for the country, let it be a bellwether for victory,” Mr. Connally said at a $250‐aplate luncheon gathering organized by the state Republican finance committee on Wednesday. However, the prospects are that President Nixon will not derive much comfort from the Republican defeat that is expected by leaders of both par??s here. The most recent polls give Mr. Byrne a wide lead. One taken by Oliver Quayle for the National Broadcasting Company showed Mr. Sandman trailing by a margin of 24 to 57 per cent, with 19 per cent of the voters undecided. Another poll, taken by the Columbia Broadcasting System. gave Mr. Byrne a 66.32 point margin over Mr. Sandman. If 70 per cent of the state's 3.5 million eligible voters cast ballots on Tuesday, such margins as indicated in the polls would give Mr. Byrne a victory edge of approximately 800,000 votes. However, most politicians here believe that the margin most likely would be closer to the 525,000‐vote victory achieved four years ago by Governor Cahill. The polls will be open from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M. on Tuesday. During the final Saturday of the campaign, Mr. Sandman scheduled appearances today in Hudson and Bergen Counties, while Mr. Byrne was scheduled to appear in Union, Newark, Bayonne, Jersey City and Mercer County. From the very day he denied Governor Cahill renomination in the bitterly contested Republican primary last June, Representative Sandman was regarded as a long shot. This was because his conservative candidacy split the Republican party badly, while Mr. Byrne had united Democrats behind him. For example, Mr. Byrne enjoys the support of every major Democratic figure and of every county organization. Further more, his moderate and even right‐of‐center positions on a number of critical issues have failed to generate any criticism from the Democratic left while attracting support from more moderate voters in the center. Conversely, Mr. Sandman has Governor Cahill's endorsement, but nothing else. The other major Republican leader in the state, Senator Clifford P. Case, has refused to support him. At the county level, several of the major Republican organizations and scores of legislative candidates have isolated their campaigns from the Cape May conservative. And while Mr. Sandman seemed to hold the popular position on all the significant issues, his campaign swerved consistently to the right on virtually all of them, leaving the decisive middle ground to Mr. Byrne. Mr. Sandman chose to build his campaign upon his opposition to a state income tax. But his position was subsequently undermined by two major developments. One was that he was never able to raise enough money to make his opposition clear to a majority of the voters. The other was that Governor Cahill hurt him badly when he announced a $209‐million state budget surplus. This enabled Mr. Byrne to renounce an income tax, too, thus robbing Mr. Sandman of a clear‐cut project. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Sandman held to a strategy fashioned by F. Clifton White, the political campaign consultant from New York who generally manages conservative Republican candidates. His strategy called for Mr. Sandman to lie low and conserve his political and financial resources for a final, three‐week election blitz that would give him his victory Tuesday. Political leaders here believe that decision was the crucial strategic failure of the Sandman campaign because it gave Mr. Byrne the opportunity to gain stature as a candidate during the early weeks and achieve a dominant position after Labor Day. Throughout September and the early days of October, Mr. Sandman repeatedly announced that his blitz would begin any day. But the refusal of moderate and wealthy Republicans to contribute to his campaign denied him the money that such a blitz required for television and radio commercials. As a result, Mr. Sandman limped through the final week of the campaign with a modest radio‐TV campaign. Thursday night, he called reporters to stand by for what he called a “bombshell” that could turn the election around. But the bombshell turned out to be vague charge involving higher Byrne campaign expenditures than allowed under the new state limitations and it, along with Mr. Bryne's denial, received little if any play in New Jersey newspapers the next day. Finally, Mr. Sandman is counting heavily on a weekend compaign by the New Jersey Right to Life Association, which is expected to attempt to flood Roman Catholic churches with antiabortion literature tomorrow. The association has accused Mr. Byrne of supporting abortion even though the Democrat contends he does not."
Lawrence and the Movements Of Modern Culture,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/04/archives/lawrence-and-the-movements-of-modern-culture.html,"Among the major writers of the first half of this century Lawrence is, I think, unique for the ambiguous response he has always received from his readers. Not alone today, as we try to fit him to a world which is so much changed from his, but even while he was alive and even among his admirers, his reception was qualified one. James, Proust, Kafka, Yeats, Joyce, Eliot: most of the figures of Lawrence's time, once they were recognized or at least where they were recognized, were accepted with sufficient single‐mindedness even James, who probably came closest to Lawrence in the ability to create an unsure response in his public, was eventually more successful than Lawrence in persuading his readers to subdue their reservations to their appreciation. It is a striking fact of Lawrence's career that he had to wait scarcely at all for recognition; although his books never sold in‐enormous quantity his genius was acknowledged almost from the start. But his admirers, or at any rate the more sober of them as distinct from the fans and idolators, would seem always to have proceeded with some caution in assessing his work, separating Lawrence's sheer literary gift, the energy of his communication, from his message and trying to sort out what was relevant and useful in the doctrine from what was overcharged and excessive even as poetic statement. But our opinion of what is useful or not useful, relevant or irrelevant in a writer's work changes, of course, from generation to generation as our modes of feeling and perception alter, and while Lawrence has continued to be received equivocally, the ground for acceptance or rejection of his books, the very order in which we rank them, has regularly and significantly shifted. Indeed it is possible to trace certain of the major developments in culture over the last 40 years on the basis of how people have read him or what they have chosen to take from his work. Diana Trilling edited “The Viking Portable D. H. Lawrence” and is author of “Claremont Essays.” This essay appears in “D. H. Lawrence” edited by Stephen Spender, published this month by Harper & Row. Copyright © George Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd, 1973. Thus, remarkable as it seems today, in the 1930's what was thought to be at the center of Lawrence's doctrine was, simply, an appeal for the release of sexuality, and the book of his which was most fully responded to was one which, if it is now discussed at all, is assigned a relatively minor place in the canon, “Lady Chatterley's Lover.” It was “Lady Chatterley,” not “Women in Love” or “The Rainbow” or even “Sons and Lovers,” which was regarded as his most impressive accomplishment, also as his chief doctrinal pronouncement, and it was read as a rousing call to sexual freedom from a writer who had perhaps too often wandered in the dark bypaths of myth and metaphor but who had at last, near the close of his career, emerged into the clearer atmosphere of human actuality. It was of great point that the book had been suppressed: the public charge of indecency underwrote its worth as a document of the serious life—just as a few years earlier it had been one's high literary duty to bootleg a copy of Joyce's “Ulysses” and struggle with its innovative techniques, now it became one's high moral duty to acquire a copy of “Lady Chatterley” and put oneself to its sexual schooling. This was period in which sexologies were coming to be widely and openly read: mistakenly, Lawrence's novel was supposed to offer a similar if more elevated instruction. In fact, however, far from providing a manual of eroticism, Lawrence drew a curtain on the single scene of sexual excursion or improvisation in his book, leaving the reader to guess what had gone on, and he dealt with the detailed physiology of intercourse only insofar as he wished to describe the possibility of failure, which he then went on to blame on the female partner. But women in the 1930's and 1940's, almost in the degree that they thought of themselves as culturally advanced, and surely in the degree that they were available to Freudian doctrine, readily accepted the charge that they were lacking in proper submissiveness to men and at fault in most situations of unhappiness. Lawrence's harshness to women, instead of alienating his female readers, would seem to have fed their well‐itimufated appetite for blame. In venturing to be as outspoken as he was about sex, Lawrence had been solemnity itself; he never intended “Lady Chatterley” to be fun nor was it taken by his readers as anything except a thoroughly nononsense business. Despite his insistence on a language of love‐making which would rid sex of its shames and shams and present it in its naked purity, the sexuality of “Lady Chatterley” could not have been more cloaked than it was in portentous emotion. Lawrence's erotic manifesto had little or nothing to do with the investigation of pleasure, everything to do with the deeper connections of body and spirit and the subtle resonances of love. But the 1930's were, of course, the era not only of the great Depression but also of the rising tide of totalitarianism. In a world of deprivation and fear the abrogation of the pleasure principle in favor of new emotional economics, a new dialectic of male‐female relations, was not particularly noteworthy—whatever proposed a personal transcendence of material circumstance was a gift of and to the imagination. In “Lady Chatterley's Lover” Lawrence offered his readers a world which, actual as it was, with the actuality of explicit sex, yet led one beyond the banal universe of economic and political necessity. Under circumstances in which politics, or at least the politics of intellectuals, had become so egregiously moral an enterprise, Lawrence's undertaking was licensed only by the fact that it similarly charged the erotic life with morality, to the point indeed—as was eventually said—of puritanism. When his critics of the 1950's accused Lawrence of puritanism they meant something other than this would mean today. The word, when it is used now, refers to any view of sexuality which proposes a hindrance to the pursuit of sexual gratification. In the 1950's it meant a view of sexuality in which freedom was circumscribed, perhaps even defined, by those values of love and responsibility which had traditionally been supposed to curb and direct our sexual instincts. With the war and most immediately in response to the atomic bomb, a mood of profound if unchanneled despair had come to prevail in the advanced sections of culture; the young in particular were seized with the sense of having destinies already arranged for them, of being governed by governments in which they were unable to make themselves heard and of being in decisions in which they had no voice. It was this sense of fatedness, of having lost all freedom of social will or social choice, which was now to be corrected, or at any rate countered, by a new and unlimited freedom of the sexual will. But if unconditioned sexuality, which is to say a sexuality with no goal except its own fulfillment, was the reply of the 1950's to a society which had created conditions so coercive that nothing was left to the individual save his existenAlai self, then clearly Lawrence provided small comfort. It required no exigent reading to understand that the sexuality for which Lawrence spoke was nothing if not conditioned, and not merely by the full‐scale emotions which he insisted upon both as its source and justification but also by the larger social purpose to which he thought that sexuality must minister. No more than Lady Chatterley's affair with her gamekeeper was to be read as an essay in pleasure was her escape from her crippled and impotent husband, who represents our modern civilization, to be read as the negation of, society as such; it is only the society which produced a Clifford Chatterley which has been Because, as his work progresses, there is less and less of the paraphernalia of society in Lawrence's novels and because the social ideal becomes increasingly, more abstract, the 1930's and 1940's commonly thought of his work as antisocial in its intention. Indeed, in the 1930's, this may largely have accounted for the emphasis that was put upon his sexual doctrine—if one thought of Lawrence as only an advocate for sexual freedom one could the more readily forgive his neglect of its social context. The 1950's were more accurate in their comprehension. They recognized that behind the demand that we surrender to the dark imperative of the blood and return to a more primitive consciousness than that of the contemporary world there lay not the wish for the annihilation of society but Lawrence's vision of social regeneration. A renovated state of personal being would issue in a renovated state of social For the 1950's, however, the fact that Lawrence looked to sex as an instrument of social revision was not the sole evidence of his retrograde stance. For readers who came to his book from, say, Henry Miller, or even from Colette, the ultimate proof of Lawrence's puritanism and of his willingness to accept a regressive social authority was the extraordinary stress he put upon marriage. “Your most vital necessity in this life,” Lawrence had written in 1914 to Thomas Dunlop, British consul at Spezia, “is that you shall love your wife completely and implicitly and in entire nakedness of body and spirit.... You asked me once what my message was... this that I tell you is my message as far as I've got any.” Obviously at another moment Lawrence might have put the matter less simplistically or made more of the connection between personal and social modes of feeling. This does not alter the truth of his brief prescriptive summary. In the first instance Lawrence was always in search of some transcendent meeting of man and woman: a man, a woman. Except as seen in its metaphoric meaning, which is also its largest social dimension, the whole of his doctrine, whatever its transmutation into religion or politics or anthropology, boils down to Lawrence's imagination of the perfect. Two short decades after Lawrence's death in 1930, the Wagnerian heroism with which he had invested this quest had lost its splendid overtones of moral grandeur and become only embarrassing. As I have said, the importance which Lawrence gave to the relation of man‐woman or husbandwife, the generation which had come of age in the war years gave to a quite other sort of relation, that of self and society. In the face of society's manifest ascendancy over the self, withdrawal and passivity became the order of the day in politics—witness the fact that McCarthyism instead of being at once resisted and destroyed, as surely it might have been, was allowed to run its unrestricted course for several disastrous years—while in the more personal sphere the call went out, fundamentally different in kind from Lawrence's, for attainment to a new consciousness through drugs, on the one hand, and on the other hand through a reversion to the polymorphous perversity of infant life, before civilization makes its claim on the body Throughout his writing Lawrence had frequently used the phrase “lapsing back” to describe the process by which mankind must regenerate itself. The concept was always and only a figurative one, however fiercely he might insist upon its actuality. What was the precise intention of the writing of Norman Mailer or Norman O. Brown, of Allen Ginsberg or William Burroughs, whether their work, too, was chiefly to be understood as a figure of speech or whether a new generation of writers was issuing a literal summons to a more primitive way of life, might be open to argument. But one thing was certain: the resounding entrance upon the literary scene of these writers and others of like view heralded a new era in culture and yet another assessment of Lawrence. At no time in Lawrence's life or since his death had there been so sharp a swing away from the established culture and from the priorities of modern competitive society as developed in the late 1950's and 1960's — although this movement perhaps shows signs of abatement as we advance into the 1970's, many of its effects, particularly in the sphere of sexual conduct, are probably irreversible. Casual or merely companionable sex, sexual experience as an end in itself, indulgence of the desire for sensation: all of these had, of course, been distasteful to Lawrence and we can suppose that he would especially have loathed a culture which encouraged them in the name of radical progress. But the rejection by the young of the values and ambitions and rewards of modern industrial society should, in logic, have been sympathetic to him—the imperative of logic must be emphasized, however, because it is difficult to imagine Lawrence acceding in any attitude or principle unless he had him But then even the logical connection between Lawrence's views and those of a present generation of readers is perhaps not as firm as at first appears. To be sure, the part played by Lawrence's hatred of the First World War in his rejection of modern life is closely paralleled by the part played by the Vietnam war in the rejection of the powerstructure of the state by so many of the present‐day young. Indeed, in the force with which it announced the difference between that which increases and that which diminishes life, the slogan “Make love, not war” is close to the heart of Lawrence's doctrine. But Lawrence never made slogans nor, had he been offered one, would he have been willing to rest in it—which is an oblique way of saying that he had no instinct for the facile More directly to the point, the love‐making to which one is being encouraged in our contemporary use of this slogan, although it is presumably dedicated to the same social goal as Lawrence's, is of a very different order of personal experience than anything Lawrence had in mind; thus it is bound to propose a different social outcome. The sexuality which Lawrence celebrated was mating. What a present generation means by love‐making is coupling. Coupling can be understood in various ways; it can mean anything from the unimpeded satisfaction of the sexual appetites to an escape from singleness, from isolation. But one thing it does not mean is ultimate or transcendent emotion such as Lawrence was proposing when he spoke of loving your wife “completely and implicitly and in entire nakedness of body and spirit.” Therefore, while it can put itself in opposition to the established society, it cannot regenerate it in any way that would accord with Lawrence's moral‐ vision. Aware of Lawrence's antagonism to Freud one hesitates to adduce a Freudian concept, that of the superego, to explain what is surely the chief difference between Lawrence's view of sex and the view which has become increasingly salient in our contemporary culture, connected though the two may seem to be by their common aversion from the kind of eroticism which, to borrow Auden's famous line, has built our cities. If we accept Freud's definition of the superego as the sum and source of our ideals, our conscience, our guilts, the repository of the parental teachings in obedience to or in defiance of which we shape the character of our mature lives, then Lawrence must be recognized as one of the most superego‐ridden people who yet managed to be a literary genius. The sexuality preached by Lawrence, attached as it was to idealism and to high social purpose, was but minimally a function of the Freudian id and even less a reversion to the polymorphous perversity of infancy. It was a clear product of the superego, which in fact is why it was so perfectly tailored to the 1930's when any diminution of confidence in the efficiency of the existent social organization was so well compensated for by faith in the ability of man to solve all his social problems though highminded and selfless social action. The revolutionary ardor of the 1930's, optimistic, orderly, submissive to idea and discipline, is much more accurately described as an impetus than an impulse. It found its corollary in the disciplined and ideology‐bound sexual ardor of Lawrence. In fact, as was being demonstrated in Soviet Russia at the very time, the responsible mating for which Lawrence was a spokesman was far more appropriate to the continuing effort of radical social change than the earlier Communist promise of free love, free abortion, free divorce had been, for it represented a reassertion in the personal life of the rigors which are always involved in political as distinct from cultural revolution. For much of the same reason that ours is a time of revolutions in and through culture and not of political revolution, it is a time when there is also likely to be a considerable resistance to any view of the world which, like Lawrence's, is heavily charged with superego; that is to say, with ideals and stern ideas and discipline. While there was often a kind of grandiosity in Lawrence's projection of the social scene which consorted with his Wagnerian vision of a supernal quest and Which probably underlay his fascination with proto‐fascist posturings, actually one is misled in supposing that his image of the hero was itself larger than life. He was a slight man and much given to domestic occupations, and he always entrusts his doctrine to men of similar build and temperament, also to men of more or less the same class as his: his leading male characters are regularly slight, wiry, fierce, home‐centered men of the working class. These protagonists nevertheless stand full in the heroic tradition: they think of life as a test, a challenge to be faced up to and overcome. Even the clothes in which Lawrence dresses them or in which he would ideally wish them to be dressed make figures of them, molding their bodies, encouraging the swagof masculinity. The young today love swagger and costume, too, but they love the clothes of masquerade and deception, which Lawrence would have despised. More important, they have scorn for the defined maleness, the defined womanliness which led Lawrence to a concern with outward appearance and which made for him a first condition of the heroic. There is a way to put the difference, finally, which, while it may seem unflattering to the contemporary young, is surely not an unqualified judgment on Lawrence: whereas the representatives of the advanced culture of our present decade would find it difficult to bring sex into conjunction with character, for Lawrence it was impossible to separate the two. ■"
Kerr on ‘House Party’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/04/archives/weve-heard-it-all-before-house-party.html,"ED BULLINS has provided his own critic for “House Party.” There comes a moment in the author”s new get‐together at the American Place when actor Earle Hyman, in frilly blue formal shirt and very sleek slippers, leaps to his feet on our side of the footlights, calls commandingly for house lights, puts a stop to the piano that”s been tinkling beneath twinkling dragon‐wheels hung from the sky. Mr. Hyman, stuffy but articulate, is prepared to damn the performance on a number of counts. The most serious seems to be that playwright Bullins has a habit of creating “negative images” of his race all those dope‐pushers, fill those freak‐outs, all those ungentlemanly suitors who procreate and run. How can this sort of muck‐raking “fulfill the people”s needs”? Mr. Hyman, presumably unlike Mr. Bullins, wants life”s mirror polished tip a bit. And there are esthetic charges as well. What”s going on right here “isn”t playwriting, isn”t theater.” Besides, Mr. Hyman finishes Pecksniffily, “the work lacks range.” Having hurled his thunderbolt and anticipated everybody else”s, Mr. Hyman grins conspiratorily and slips back into an Piano. Well, “House Party” has range, but that”s about it. While parts of the stage revolve, and parts of the stage turn into motion picture screens, and a company of nine dance, drink, and engage in casual seduction, we are reminded of slavery, the depression, riots, Richard Nixon (in convict stripes), Josephine Baker, Adam Clayton Powell, “bad niggers” and good, cadgers who need quarter to get themselves downtown, the black bourgeoisie, and what have I forgotten? The evening is actually series of soliloquies strung together by musical rhythms that are sometimes tobaccosmoke lazy and sometimes headed for a nervous breakdown. Onto a runway come individual figures—a black writer who can”t make it because he”s saddled with a wife and family, a fellow with a broom who”s on the verge of buying a house, a pusher whose moral philosophy is summed up by “So what?” — to deliver themselves in fragments and make way for the next monologist. A few of these alert us sharply because they are so very well performed. The diminutive Mary Alice, blue shawl draped over green frock, has already commanded our attention in a shaken announcement over a martini‐glass that she”s about to have an abortion. When she moves out over the audience to introduce herself as a woman poet, protesting all the while that she”s bound to be misunderstood but insisting on asking “What is it to write life when the world wants to die?,” we know that we are in the presence of the real thing: talent in full charge of itself. Mr. Hyman Is arresting, too, as a chap who keeps a scrapbook because he”s thoroughly and unabashedly in love with himself. Eyelids flickering ecstatically, feet stomping with the joy of simply belonging to him, he is enormously funny as he proclaims “Me, the adorable one!” An ego was never more blissfully content. * But too much of what we hear during the intermissionless hour‐and‐three‐quarters is the thin top of the vat, easy skimming for a writer who hasn”t bothered to roll up his sleeves. “No future unless we make it/No hope unless we have it” is about as profound as any message gets, and jokey slogans are rarely better than “Power means buy, and when you buy, byebye.” We”ve not only heard it all before, we”ve heard it in deeper tones of voice. Odd as some of the vignettes are, we feel we”re flipping them as idly as the pages of a magazine, reading only the captions. Mr. Bullins won”t settle down, and neither can Why does a man who can write plays indulge himself so often in cavalier collage?"
"BYRNE, SANDMAN IN A CLASH ON TV",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/05/archives/byrne-sandman-in-a-clash-on-tv.html,"New Jersey's major candidates for Governor, carrying their battle for votes down to the wire, confronted each other yesterday in two televised appearances in which each reiterated his stands on such issues as the state income tax and legalized abortion. The bitterness of the contest was reflected in the demeanor of the two nominees. Brendan T. Byrne, the Democrat, was icily hostile toward his Republican opponent, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., who was smilingly sarcastic. When the telecasts ended, the two men went their separate ways without further conversation. National attention has been focused on the New Jersey race, which some politicians have seen as promising an indication of voter reaction to the Watergate disclosures. In the only other gubernatorial contest tomorrow, that in Virginia between Lieut. Gov. Henry Howell, running as an independent, and former Gov. Mills Godwin, a conservative Republican, Watergate is not counted as an important issue. Neither Mr. Byrne nor Mr. Sandman gave the national scandal much attention yesterday in appearances on the American Broadcasting Company's “Eyewitness News Conference” and on the National Broadcasting Company's “People in the News.” Mr. Byrne concentrated on statewide issues and Mr. Sandman took the position that Watergate was not applicable to the New Jersey race. When asked if there were any national significance of the “events in Washington,” Mr. Sandman said, however, “I'm not being helped by it.” When the question of campaign financing was raised on “People in the News” on WNBC‐TV, Mr. Sandman said, in response to an inquiry about the amount and sources of Mr. Byrne's funds: “If he should win this election, there will positively be a challenge in the courts.” He went on to charge that his opponent had exceeded the $1.5‐million of allowable campaign expenditures. Mr. Byrne, a former Superior Court judge, replied to a question on the income tax by saying that he saw no need for one in New Jersey in the foreseeable future. Mr. Sandman, who has taken a firm stand against an income tax, accused Mr. Byrne of hedging on the issue. On the subject of a state income tax, which seems to be the No. I issue as far as the state's taxpayers are concerned, Mr. Byrne reiterated that he saw no need for an income tax in the foreseeable future. Mr. Sandman asked with chuckle whether the foreseeable future might not mean the second week after inauguration. Mr. Byrne said he could not “see ahead for four years” but that he could see that for now “we can get along without it.” He said his opponent Mr. Sandman had offered the voters “some of his ridiculous schemes such as “Federal take‐over of welfare.” Asked if he would institute an income tax if elected Mr. Sandman said: “The answer is, no, during my term as Governor.” On the question of abortion, Mr. Sandman restated that he was unalterably opposed to abortion. Mr. Byrne said that he was personally opposed to abortion but that rulings of the Supreme Court were in his mind as a former judge and lawyer, a fact of law under which the problem had to be faced and under which the nation had to live. Outside the studio, Mr. Byrne said his supporters had never charged that literature condemning abortion, which was distributed by the New Jersey Right to Life Association, was being distributed on Mr. Sandman's behalf. “That kind of thing is Watergate trick,” said Mr. Byrne. Michael A. McDaniels, Essex County leader of the antiabortion group, said earlier in the day: “This literature is not being distributed by Charles Sandman. We printed it and we plan to distribute a million copies before the election.” During their studio confrontations, Mr. Bytne, a tall, solemn man with deep‐set eyes, and Mr. Sandman, whose manner was cheerfully pugnacious, interrupted each other frequently. Mr. Byrne kept his eyes riveted on camera or on the interviewing newsman while he was talking and while Mr. Sandman was responding to questions. Mr. Sandman, on the other hand, tapped his opponent on the arm or the knee frequently while challenging Mr. Byrne's statements or interrupting in an effort to gain the microphone."

Reds in Italy Oppose Abortion and Anger Feminists,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/05/archives/reds-in-italy-oppose-abortion-and-anger-feminists.html,"ROME, Nov. 4 — The Communist party has come out against legalized abortion, angering Italy's fledgling women's movement and pleasing the Vatican. The abortion issue dominated a lively three‐day convention of the Union of Italian Women that ended here last, night The union is a leftist organization claiming 240,000 members. Under strong pressure from young women militants, the 30‐year‐old group had for the first time placed sexual questions on the agenda of the convention. The group's leadership offered a proposal demanding that the present legal ban on abortion be lifted and that Government‐supervised clinics be allowed to terminate pregnancies on request. A Communist party representative, Leonilde Iotti, opposed the proposal and suggested that the leftist union consult with Roman Catholic women's organizations to reach a unified stand on abortion. Radical feminists on the convention floor booed Mrs. Iotti, Who described herself as a conservative in matters of sex and family life. Mrs. Iotti, who is 53 years old, is the widow of Palmiro Togliatti, who was leader of the Italian Communist party until his death in 1964. Mrs. Iotti is now a Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. Her opposition to legal abortion is widely seen as another sign of the Communist party's desire to appease the Vatican and strike a deal with the Christian Democratic party, the nation's largest political force, which is backed by the Roman Catholic Church. Such a deal could lead to Communist participation in the national government. Mrs. Iotti and the Communist party's leader, Enrico Berlin guer, have recently said that they are available for talks with the Christian Democrats to amend Italy's three‐year‐old divorce law. The Christian Democratic party, like the Vatican, is opposed to both divorce and legalized abortion. The proposed negotiations to change the divorce statute would be aimed at making it more difficult to dissolve a marriage. Neither the Vatican nor the Christian Democratic party had any official comment on the Communist move in the abortion debate. But priests familiar with Vatican thinking privately welcomed Mrs. Iotti's speech, which they termed “courageous.” A Roman Catholic newspaper, L'Avvenire of Milan, said in an editorial today that the evolution within the Communist party must be watched in a broadminded way. This seemed to mean that the church might consider a dialogue with Communists on such issues as abortion. Mrs. Iotti declared at the women's convention that “abortion is always a traumatic experience for a woman.” She said it was never easy for a woman “to rid herself of the fruit of love” and recommended dissemination of information on birth‐control methods other than abortion. In a final resolution last night, the convention supported the idea of abortion clinics but recommended much further research and discussion before any specific proposals."
"BYRNE, SANDMAN IN A CLASH ON TV",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/05/archives/byrne-sandman-in-a-clash-on-tv-each-reiterates-his-stand-in-a.html,"New Jersey's major Nandi, dates Governor, carrying their battle for votes down the wire, confronted each other yesterday in two televised appearances in which each reiterated his stands on such issues as the state income tax and legalized abortion. The bitterness of the contest was reflected in the detheanor of the two nominees. Brendan T. Byrne, the Democrat, was icily hostile toward his Republican opponent, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., who was smilingly sarcastic. When the telecasts ended, the two men went their separate ways without further conversation. National attention has been focused on the New Jersey race, which some politicians have seen as promising an indication of voter reaction to the Watergate disclosures. In the only other gubernatorial contest tomorrow, that in Virginia between Lieut. Gov. Henry Howell, running as an independent, and former Gov. Mills Godwin, a conservative Republican, Watergate is not counted is an important issue. Neither Mr. Byrne nor Mr. Sandman gave the national scandal much attention yesterlay in appearances on the Amer can Broadcasting Company's “Eyewitness News Conference” and on the National Broadcasting Company's “People in the News.” Mr. Byrne concentrated on statewide issues and Mr. Sandman took the position that Watergate was not applicable to the New Jersey race. When asked if there were any national significance of the “events in Washington,” Mr. Sandman said, however, “I'm not being helped by it.” Byrne Accused of Hedging When the question of campaign financing was raised on “People in the News” on WNBC‐TV, Mr. Sandman said, in response to an inquiry about the amount and sources of Mr. Byrne's funds: “If he should win this election, there will positively be a challenge in the courts.” He went on to charge that his opponent had exceeded the 1.5‐million of allowable campaign expenditures. Mr. Byrne, a former Superior Court judge, replied to a question on the income tax by saying that he saw no need for one in New Jersey in the foreseeable future. Mr. Sandman, who has taken a firm stand against an income tax, accused Mr. Byrne of hedging on the issue. On the subject of a state income tax, which seems to be the No. 1 issue as far as the state's taxpayers are concerned, Mr. Byrne reiterated that he saw no need for an income tax in the foreseeable future. Mr. Sandman asked with a chuckle whether the foreseeable future might not mean the second week after inauguration. Mr. Byrne said he could not “see ahead for four years” but that he could see that for now “we can get along without it.” He said his opponent, Mr. Sandman, had offered the voters “some of his ridiculous schemes such as Federal takeover of welfare.” Asked if he would institute an income tax if elected, Mr. Sandman said: “The answer is, no, during my term as Governor.” On the question of abortion, Mr. Sandman restated that he was unalterably, opposed to abortion. Mr. Byrne said that he was personally apposed to abortion but that rulings of the Supreme Court were in his mind as a, former judge and lawyer, a fact of law under which the problem had to be faced and under which the nation had to live. Outside the studio, Mr. Byrne said his supporters had never charged that literature condemning abortion, which was distributed by the New Jersey Right to Life Association, was being distributed on Mr. Sandman's behalf. “That kind of thing is Watergate trick,” said Mr. Byrne. Michael A. McDaniels, Essex County leader of the antiabortion group, said earlier in the day: “This literature is not being distributed by Charles Sandman. We printed it and we plan to distribute a million copies before the election.” During their studio confrontations, Mr. Byrne, a tall, solemn man with deep‐set eyes, and Mr, Sandman, whose maner was cheerfully pugnacious, interrupted each other Ireiquently. Mr. Byrne kept his eyes riveted on camera or on the interviewing newsman while he was talking and while Mr. Sandman was responding to questions. Mr. Sandman, on the other hand, tapped his opponent on the arm or the knee frequently while challenging Mr. Byrne's statements or interrupting in an effort to gain the microphone."
Campaign in Jersey Ends on Bitter Note,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/06/archives/campaign-in-jersey-ends-on-bitter-note-issue-of-abortion-creates-a.html,"TRENTON, Nov. 5—New Jersey's campaign for Governor ended as it began today, on a bitter note—this one caused by a last‐minute attempt by supporters of Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., the Republican candidate, to create an emotional abortion issue. Msgr. Harold Murray, secretary of the Department of Social Development and World Peace for the National Catholic Conference in Washington, criticized as “unfair” and “distorted” the distribution of antiabortion pamphlets endorsing Mr. Sandman by the New Jersey Right to Life Association. The distribution inside or near churches yesterday in several counties was not authorized by the state's Roman Catholic Bishop or by diocesan offices. The distribution was called “highly successful” by a Sandman campaign aide, but its effect will be impossible to assess before the state's 3.5 million voters have their opportunity to go to the polls tomorrow. Approximately 70 per cent of the voters are expected to cast ballots between 7 A.M. and 8 P.M. to decide the contest between Mr. Sandman and Brendan T. Byrne, the Democratic candidate, and contests for all 120 legislative seats. The race has drawn national attention partly because some Republican leaders have called it a referendum on reaction to the Watergate investigation and partly because there is only one other race for Governor in the nation. In the other race, Lieut. Gov. Henry Howell of Virginia is running as an independent candidate for Governor against former Gov, Mills Godwin, a conservative Republican. The anti‐abortion pamphlets, which state that Mr. Byrne “feels that it is an individual's right to kill the unborn,” were distributed in Bergen County and in Democratic areas of Hudson, Essex, Passaic, Morris and Mercer Counties. In some areas, the pamphlets were mailed to homes, in others they were placed on car windshields, left stacked in the rear of churches or distributed during the church service. In Our Lady of Sorrows Church in Mercerville, near Trenton, ushers distributed the pamphlets and a separate mimeographed list of candidates in the three legislative districts that grouped them under “prolife” and “pro‐abortion” headings. One candidate apparently did not answer the Right to Life Association's question and was listed under “nod answer.” Monsignor Murray, a New Jersey resident who delivered a sermon at St. Theresa's Church in Summit on Sunday, said the pamphlet distribution “put the church in a very difficult position, that of seeming to support the contents of the brochure.” “The church has to be careful not to take sides in a contest of this sort, especially,” he added, “when both men are Roman Catholics.” Monsignor Murray, an acquaintance of Mr. Byrne's, said the pamphlet “distorted his [Mr. Byrne's] position on the, issues quite a bit.” Mr. Byrne has said he is personally opposed to abortion and on a constitutional amendand would support public hearment to give the unborn full legal protection as human beings from the moment of conception, but he has refrained from endorsing the proposed amendment. Sandman Views Cited Mr. Sandman has introduced his version of the constitutional amendment. He is also unequivocally opposed to releasing Medicaid funds to pay for voluntary abortions. Mr. Byrne has said he would leave the question of Medicaid payments up to the courts. The Republican candidate rested this morning and then campaigned in South Jersey close to his home base in Cape May. He scheduled a visit to a senior citizens project in Salem and then toured the county before attending an 8 P.M. rally in Millville. The candidate's office announced that Mr. Sandman and his family would vote tomorrow at the Erma firehouse on Route 9 in Cape May County. Later, Mr. Sandman will go to his headquarters at the Holiday Inn in Trenton to await the results of the election. Byrne Works Hard By DONALD JANSON Special to The New York Times CAMDEN, N. J., Nov. 5—For Brendan T. Byrne the final day of a gubernatorial campaign that lasted all summer and into a chilly November was almost entirely outdoors—and he refused to let any of the last lap be washed out by rain. The Democratic candidate was up at 6:20 A.M. at his snug, hip‐length car coat with a rain hood, and was at the Westinghouse plant gate in Newark by 7 o'clock. After greeting workers there refused to predict the landslide for an hour, he moved by helicopter to repeat performances at a construction site in Camden, a walking tour through the East Ward of Newark, stops at a Radio Corporation of America Ford plant in Mahwah, and a handshaking stroll down Front Street in Plainfield. Here in Camden, Mr. Byrne refused to predict the landslide victory to Lici row forecast by polls and settled for a more modest phrasing: “We're going to do well.” About 100 men stopped work on a Rutgers University auditorium here and cheered as the ethelic‐looking candidate found a dry spot under a ternporary walkway linking steel construction beams and thanked them for their support. ?? told them their backing continued to demonstrate that his Republican opponent, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr., was wrong in saying: “Byrne has the support' of only a few labor leaders.” This was an allusion to the Sandman contention that while organized labor had made substantial financial contributions to the Byrne campaign, the sup‐, port represents a preference, only by top leadership of unions rather than by the rank and file. Mr. Sandman has assiduously wooed the state's “peripheral urban ethnics,” largely white blue‐collar workers, on the advice of F. Clifton White that they can be pulled away from traditional. Democratic loyalties with promises to hold the line against black residential and job encroachment. Mrs. Barbara Landsman of Gloucester Township, a student and mother of two, shared her umbrella, and a kiss, with Mr. Byrne. “We could use a little honesty in government,” she said later, explaining why her vote would go to Mr. Byrne. Steve Herz of Haddonfield said he was working for a Republican candidate for Freeholder here but would vote for Mr. Byrne for Governor. “Byrne has said some progressive things about revising taxes and revitalizing the system of higher education,” he said."

He received a military honor‐guard welcome in Morocco. American officials accompanying Mr. Kissinger cautioned against any spectacular breakthroughs during his talks in Morocco and other Moslem countries he plans to visit. [Page 1, Column 7.] International The Nixon Administration sought to sidestep Israeli charges that Egyptians were massing forces for an attack and that Egypt and Southern Yemen were blockading Israelibound vessels at the entrance to the Red Sea. George Vest, the newly appointed State Department spokesman, said he was “not aware that we have special information that would point to the fact that we are on the brink of war.” [17:6–7.] National Senator Peter H. Dominick, a conservative Republican of Colorado, who has been a stanch supporter of President Nixon, called on the President to make “complete disclosure of all information” about the Watergate investigations. “Nothing short of complete disclosure will be adequate to restore the confidence of the American people,” Mr. Dominick said in what was considered an unusually strong speech to the Denver Bar Association. [1:4.] William D. Ruckelshaus, who was ousted as Deputy Attorney General by President Nixon two weeks ago, disclosed that telephone wiretaps were placed on Nixon Administration officials and possibly newsmen who were not included in the previously reported 21‐month effort that President Nixon has said was intended to stop leaks of classified information to the press. [22:8.] The White House has balked at Egil Krogh Jr.'s request that he examine documents of the “plumbers” unit he directed at the time of the Ellsberg break‐in in 1971, Mr. Krogh's attorney said. Mr. Krogh, a former White House aide, has been indicted for his role in directing the break‐in and cover‐up. [23:5–8.] Donald H. Segretti was sentenced in Federal District Court in Washington to six months in prison for his efforts to disrupt the 1972 Democratic Presidential primary in Florida. He could have received a maximum sentence of three years in prison and $3,000 fine. In the same courthouse, an assistant Federal Watergate prosecutor told the court that John W.

With 30,000 union members off the job, the struck institutions closed out‐patient clinics, reduced admissions, limited surgery and put professional staffs on housekeeping and practicalnursing duties.

New Jersey Chooses Well,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/07/archives/new-jersey-chooses-well.html,"In electing Brendan T. Byrne Governor by an unprecedented majority, New Jersey has, delivered an emphatic rebuff to the reactionary and divisive campaign waged by the Republican candidate, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. This, impressive victory for responsibility and common sense will reverberate far beyond the Garden State. For a nation sick of corruption and deception in high places and anxious for reassurance that the system can still be. honestly employed to elect honorable men and women, the New Jersey result could not have come at a better time. It may dissuade other candidates from copying Mr. Sandman's negative strategy of trying to build majority on foundations of fear, suspicion, prejudice and distortion. Mr. Sandman was not the only loser in the gubernatorial contest. Barry Goldwater's former strategist, Clifton White, charted Mr. Sandman's blatant pitch for the “peripheral urban ethnics,” blue‐collar workers the cities and suburbs who usually back Democrats. This class appeal backfired and helped bring thousands moderate Republicans into Mr. Byrne's Democratic camp. There were also the abortive interventions of two 1976 Republican Presidential hopefuls. John B. Connally, only recently come to the aid of the Grand Old Party, may wish that in campaigning for Mr. Sandman he, had not touted the New Jersey election as a referendum on Watergate. And Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller may wish he had emulated New Jersey's top Republican officials, Gov. William T. Cahill and Senator Clifford P. Case, in giving wide berth to the campaign of Mr. Sandman, with whom, we trust,‐Mr. Rockefeller has little in common. * * * Given the deliberate pattern of the Sandman campaign it was difficult to generate genuine debate on the staggering problems that beset New Jersey—but it must be said that Mr. Byrne did‐not exert himself unduly to that end. He was mostly content to steer a middle course, giving priority to the theme of “restoring public confidence in government,” and tacking occasionally to the starboard side to blunt Mr. Sandman's appeal on such emotive issues as school busing, abortion and capital punishment. This proved good strategy for crushing Mr. Sandman; but it constituted neither good political education for New Jersey citizens nor the best preparation for the many difficult decisions Mr. Byrne as Governor must take. Still, Mr. Byrne shunned extravagant promises and came on strongly as a highly intelligent, pragmatic politician unquestioned integrity, dedicated to reforms New Jersey badly needs but ever conscious—perhaps too much so—of the hurdles that must be overcome along the way. With the Democratic party impressively reunited behind his candidacy and swept into control of both houses the Legislature by his landslide victory, Mr. Byrne at 49 has an excellent opportunity to reshape politics and government in the Garden State."
State Panels on Women Split,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/11/archives/state-panels-on-women-split-original-legislation-response-to.html,"TRENTON — After three years of confusion and occasional acrimony the New Jersey State Commission on Women is drafting legislation that would abolish the state's Office on Women. The commission and the office have been at loggerheads since the two groups were established three years ago under legislation that failed to define which of the two was to be the policymaking body and which the advisory branch. The dispute reached the Attorney General's office in October of 1972, and the Attorney General ruled that the commission had full power over the Office on Women, which was headed by Mrs. Dorothy B. Mery. Mrs. Mery resigned this fall, asserting that the commission had‐violated its own bylaws by excluding her office from budgetary and public‐relations procedures and by taking official action at closed executive sessions. No one has been appointed to fill the vacancy. Original Legislation The commission and the Office on Women were originally intended to operate as a single unit under the state's Department of Community Affairs. The commission has a nine‐member volunteer board, while the Office on Women was set up with a paid director. Both the director and the commission board were appointed by the Governor. The chairman of the commission, Mrs. Sylvia Sammartino, said that a restructuring was necessary to eliminate confusion. She said the new legislation would propose the appointment of an executive director of the commission, who would be named with the approval of the commission and the Department of Community Affairs. A Republican Assemblywoman, Mrs. Josephine S. Margetts of Morris County, introduced the first bill in 1967. It was passed in 1969 and implemented in 1971. Mrs. Margetts said she was willing to sponsor the amending legislation next January. “I'm pleased to, do something that will make the, legislation more workable,” she declared. Mrs. Margetts said she had not had time to review the proposed legislation thoroughly, but added that she had great faith in the commission. “I think great starts have been made,” Mrs. Margetts asserted. She cited the creation of a state talent bank, a vocational clearing house within the Office on Women, and the fact that the state now had a commission to back up legislation important to women. “Mrs. Mery was imaginative and enthusiastic,” Mrs. Margetts said. Response to Criticism Mrs. Sammartino has been criticized because the original members of the commission were all white and more than 30 years old. In reply, Mrs. Sammartino pointed to the recent appointment of an 18‐year‐old black woman, Mrs. Penelope Kuykenclall of East Brunswick, to the commission and the expected expansion of the commission to 11 members. “We don't know who the new members will be yet,” Mrs. Sammartino said. “But we know one will be an attorney and the other a Puerto Rican.” Since it was established, the commission has recommended the appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court, fought for the elimination of sexist inequities in state inheritance laws, held round‐table discussions on abortion and penal reform and published a brochure, on women's legal rights. “We have also commissioned the first history and bibliography of New Jersey women,” Mrs. Sammartino said. The Office on Women was more visible initially than the commission, in spite of the fact that its funds were limited. The office and Mrs. Mery are generally credited with bringing women's problems to the attention of the general public through a series of grass‐roots conferences. Attempts at Change The commission has tried to become more responsive to women's needs and, under pressure from feminist groups, has opened its five yearly meetings to the public and moved them from Trenton to Newark. While spokeswomen for women's groups agree that restructuring is a necessity for greater efficiency, they are opposed to any legislation that would give the commission, as it is presently constituted, anything but advisory powers. “It is perfectly reasonable to have an executive direcfor who Merely implements the policies of a commission,” said Dr. Phyllis Boring of Old Bridge, an associate professor of Spanish at Rutgers and a past president of the New Jersey State Women's Equity Action League, “but only if you have a strong commission which is willing to provide a leadership role. I don't think this commission can.” “We would like to see an active grass‐roots push for affirmative action in civil rights,” Judy Murphy of Teaneck, coordinator of the State Women's Political Caucus, declared. “Most commission members don't see themselves as having a large role. They bring an old cake‐sale mentality to what could be an effective body. They go in 45 different directions at once, and won't take a strong position on anything.”"

Elliott). RAILROADS Affirmed, over objections from the State of Pennsylvania, a lower court ruling upholding new procedures of the Interstate Commerce Commission designed to make it easier for railroads to abandon lines that are uneconomical (No. 73–359, Pennsylvania v.

Israeli soldiers with machine guns at the ready and standing shoulder to shoulder held back about 120 newsmen and cameramen who had come from Cairo to the point on the Cairo‐Suez road called Kilometer 101. [1:4.] Premier Golda Meir told the Israeli Parliament that she believed Israel and Egypt would be able to overcome their differences and carry out the American‐sponsored cease‐fire agreement along the Suez Canal. Despite the difficulties that have arisen since the agreement was signed Sunday, Mrs. Meir said she expected that the accord would be carried out if Egypt observed the spirit “as strictly as we do.” [18:1–2.] Britain's deteriorating economic position forced the Government to adopt a series of measures designed to shore up her balance of payments, curtail the money supply and cope with labor disputes that threaten to cause widespread power blackouts. The Bank of England adopted a sharply restrictive monetary policy, and about the same time the Government reported the worst monthly trade deficit in British history. [1:5–7.] Secretary of State Kissinger publicly assured Chinese leaders that American policy toward Peking would remain constant “no matter what happens in the United States in the future.” At a banquet on the eve of his departure for Japan, Mr. Kissinger seemed determined to reassure Premier Chou En‐lai and others that neither the Watergate scandal nor the Presidential elections in 1976 would retard American efforts to improve relations with China. [1:5–6.] National The United States and six European countries have terminated the five‐year‐old agreement that barred them from selling gold in the free market. The termination was announced by Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, immediately on his return from a weekend meeting of central‐bank officials in Switzerland. [Page 1 Column 8.] President Nixon met for more than two hours with 15 Republican Senators and apparently persuaded most of them that he intended to tell everything he knew about Watergate and allied scandals. Senators' comments indicated that the meeting had answered relatively few specific questions, and thus had fallen somewhat short of the goal stated by some White House officials: “Clearing the air” with Congress. [1:5–6.]. In an atmosphere of crisis, the Senate approved and sent to President. Nixon the Alaska pipeline bill. The vote was 80 to 5. Mr. Nixon was expected to sign it despite some Administration reservations. [1:3.]. In an unusually bitter struggle over contract ratification, the United Automobile Workers Onion announced that skilled tradesmen refused to ratify a tentative agreement negotiated with the Ford Motor Company. It was the first refusal to ratify a contract by rank‐and‐file in the U.A.W. history: [1:1–4.]. Metropolitan Justice Dominic S. Rinaldi of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn has been indicted for allegedly lying under oath and seeking to obstruct a state investigation into judicial corruption, the special state prosecutor, Maurice H. Nadjari, announced. The Appellate Division promptly relieved Justice Rinaldi of all judicial responsibilities. [1:1–2.] Governor Rockefeller said he did not see any way to save the 35‐cent transit fare here and that anyone who said it could be saved was “kidding the public.” “We may be able to prevent it from going all the way to 60 cents, but I'm not even sure of that,” he said. [1:8.] Attempting to gather support for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination next year, Howard J. Samuels is urging Democratic politicians to work for an ethnically and geographically balanced ticket. He said in an interview that he had been “creating discussion” among Democratic leaders on the subject of ticket balancing. [26:4.] Wellington Mara, the president of the New York Giants, said he was still enthusiastic about moving his football team to northern New Jersey despite new demands that the contract involving the Giants' commitment to move there be renegotiated. The Democratic Governor‐elect, Brendan T. Byrne, said Monday that he reserved the right to renegotiate the contract. [1:7.] The Other News International Spanish Cardinal backs critics of Government.

Catholics Find More Support For Abortions in Certain Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/14/archives/catholics-find-more-support-for-abortions-in-certain-cases.html,"KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 13 (UFO— A majority of Roman Catholics, Protestants and Jews favor abortion if the mother's health is endangered, in cases of rape or to prevent birth of a defective child, according to a survey conducted by The National Catholic Reporter. “Support for the Catholic position on abortion is eroding in the rank and file membership of the church,” the newspaper said in releasing the results of its survey yesterday. The survey published in the independent, lay‐edited newspaper was conducted by Andrew M. Greeley. William C. McCready, sociologists, of the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago. Their report was based on information taken from 1,592 Protestants, Catholics and Jews in July, 1972, and 1,367 Protestants, Catholics and Jews year later. “Catholics, like Protestants and Jews, overwhelmingly approve abortion in cases of danger to the mother's health, rape or the chance of a defective child,” they said. The 1973 survey's results showed the following: ¶In cases where the mother's health was endangered, 100 per cent of the Jews favored abortion, 91 per tent of the Protestants favored abortion and 88 per cent of the Catholics favored abortion. ¶In cases of rape, 98 per cent of the Jews favored abortion, 81 per cent of the Protestants favored abortion and 75 per cent of the Catholics favored it. ¶In the case of a possible defective child, abortion was approved by 100 per cent of the Jews, 83 per cent of the Protestants and 77 per cent of the Catholics. Catholics and Protestants, however, did not favor abortion in cases where mothers did not want more children, were too poor to have more children or were not married. Jews, however, indicated they approved of abortion in these cases. “There has been little change in the Catholic proportion supporting abortion in the latter three cases,” the sociologists said. Asked if “homosexual relationships are always wrong,” 76 per cent of the Protestants said yes, 71 per cent of the Catholics said yes and 31 per cent of the Jews said yes. The survey showed that 45 per cent of the Protestants, 44 per cent of the Catholics and 28 per cent of the Jews agreed that “all pornography should be banned.”"
Teen‐Alters Offer Information on Sex,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/15/archives/teenagers-offer-information-on-sex-professionally-trained-parent.html,"George Dunn has shortish blond hair, blue eyes and the gee‐whiz grin of an oldfashioned teen‐ager. His 18‐year‐old face grows intense, though, when he talks about his job in the Peer Group Information Service at Brooklyn's John Jay High School. “The most difficult part,” George said, “Is when a pregnant girl comes in and wants to know whether to have the kid, have an abortion, or what. I'm not in a position to tell her.” The Sulmers twins, Susie and Peggy, are 17, with a poise and style to match their fashion‐model figures. Until Peggy cropped her Afro, friends at John Jay had trouble telling the twins apart. The twins also share an enthusiasm for the Peer Group Information Service, which provides facts on such subjects as birth control to its teen‐aged clients. Professionally Trained “When you realize how one little pill can make your body think it's pregnant and make your organs work in a different way,” says Susie, “it's a real blow mind.” George, Susie and Peggy are among hundreds of “peer group leaders” who have been professionally trained to operate the information services on such sex‐related subjects as venereal disease, pregnancy, contraception, abortion and alternatives to abortion. Besides John Jay, 39 other schools offer the service under the direction of faculty advisers. The program, approved last January by the Board of Education, is supervised by its Bureau for Health and Physical Education. “It literally started out with students in one high school john passing out information on basic anatomy,” said Ann Welbourne, who coordinates the program in 13 pilot schools sharing a $174,524 Ford Foundation grant. “Basically, most students learn about sex from other students.” But these students organized. Through the Student Coalition for Relevant Sex Education, they appealed to the board to approve the program and to the Ford people to help fund it. Which, briefly, is how a sex information service moved from the bathroom to the classroom. Parent Support Maude Parker, coordinator of the Bureau's Family Living Sex Education Department, stressed in an interview the other day that peer group leaders are chosen for their maturity, discretion and ability to relate to others. “They're not there to check out dirty pictures,” she added. Nor are they there to play “counselor” (“We hate that word,” she said). Miss Parker explained that students using the service are referred to outside agencies only by professional staff members who encourage them to discuss things with their parents, when possible. “If you don't elicit support from the parents, you're through,” Miss Parker said, then added: “We're not out to change anybody's life‐style from homo to hetero or hetero to homo. We're not out to take away anybody's right to be a parent.” And their right not to have sex. That, according to Miss Parker, is a priority of the service. Its leaders are not necessarily sexually active, she explained, and its clients are sometimes “embarrassed” virgins. “We tell them it's normal not to be sexually involved,” Miss Parker said. “They do not have to feel guilty or strange.” That said, Miss Parker suggested a visit to John Jay High in Park Slope where a Peer Group Information Service has been operating since last February. Room 348. Along one wall stands the stoves and sinks the home economics class uses. On the other, hospital beds, tables, pink rubber dummies for the nursing students to practice on. But for three 40‐minute periods a day Room 348 functions as the information service's headquarters with its own trappings—anatomical charts, textbooks, birth control devices, pamphlets. Five students — George Dunn, the Sulmers twins, Susie and Peggy; Madeline Oberle, 17, and Pat Muro, 18 —sat in a circle with their advisor, Beverley Goff, 33, passing a box of pretzels around. “What we're really here for is moral support,” Miss Goff explained, “and to provide basic information.” Information is provided through individual counseling, small “rap sessions” and special workshops. “A couple of guys came in with birth control questions. the other day,” recalled Madeline, who, like the others, works two periods a day at the service. “I told them to come back tomorrow with 15 kids and we'd have a workshop. We wound up with 30 or 40, including the whole football team.” Madeline smiled. “Next, we're doing one on childbirth.” Open to All Miss Goff said such subjects in the past were treated only in the senior year hygiene course, which, she commented, offered “too little, too late.” Now, because of the information service's success, she's teaching a sex education class open to all students and based on the three‐month training course the leaders took. “And they're all taking it again,” reported Miss Goff. George grinned. “It's a dynamite course,” he said. The five student leaders of the peer group said their parents approve of their jobs. Peggy laughed, though, over the difficult time she had getting through to her father: “I said there's this program at school to help kids, like girls who are pregnant, but he wouldn't listen. He kept yelling: ‘What! You're pregnant? You're pregnant?’” Right now, George is the service's only male leader. Two others were graduated last year, he said, and several are being trained. Last week, when some girls dropped in to talk about gynecological examinations, George, something of a “g‐y‐n” expert by now, was asked to leave. “Aw, it doesn't bother me,” he protested. There are a few rules in Room 348. The words “should,” “right” and “wrong” must never be spoken. Students' names and personal problems must never be revealed. So far this year about 200 students (out of an enrollment of 5,378) have come to Room 348 either for individual or group sessions. Pregnant teen‐agers are welcomed in Room 348. So are those with casual questions about dating and those with “heavy” problems. For example, said Miss Goff, echoing their questions: “We have students who are involved in homosexual and tri‐sexual relationships —how do you deal with jealousy, with competition?” “Let them talk,” Madeline said. “We're not junior shrinks,” Pat added."
What's Doing in PHILADENPHIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/18/archives/whats-doing-in-philadelphia.html,"NIGHT LIFE — William, Claude (Whitey) Dukinfield, whose aver. sion to his home town was probably traceable to the fact that he spent his formative years here being chased by cops and irate saloon keepers, did not do Philadelphia any good in later years when, after adopting the name W. C. Fields, be was wont to say that Philadelphia was the only town of his acquaintance that closed on Sundays. The master, alas, is gone, but his assessment unfortunately lingers. Even love in Philadelphia is brotherly. Nevertheless, for those disposed to see what there is of night life here, there is a Vegas‐style glitter at the nearby Latin Casino (215‐WA 3–4343) across the Delaware River in Cherry Hill, N.J. The nightly features are the food, the drinks and the likes of Tom Jones and Ray Charles. Considerably hipper is The Spectrum (FU 9‐5000) at Broad and Pattison, right in Philadelphia, a sports hall that books groups like the J. Geils Band for dance concerts. Prices along the nightclub circuit are gradually inching up on those in New York, It is advisable to phone first for covers and minimums. Palumbo's (MA 7.7272) in South Philadelphia, Mayor Frank Rizzo's favorite boite, is big, noisy and serves Sergio Franchi with the spaghetti and scungilli. On the other hand, since Frank Rizzo is the guy who vetoed the purchase for the city of a Jacques Lipchitz statue, dubbing it “an abortion that looks like some workmen dropped a load of wet plaster,” those with more worldly sensibilities might prefer a place in which, His Honor would not be caught dead — Harlow's (WA 2–9222), named for a former male, whose sex‐change operation made her the switch hit of the city, or if not Harlow's then one of the other trendy clubs nearby. Longhairs and kindred types will feel more at home in the downtown Sansom Village area at places like Artemis (LO 7–9958), Oops (LO 7–6800) and Snagletooth (LO 7–8304), where the sounds are, as they say, heavy. Older heads will like Just Jazz (LO 7–3189), on downtown Arch Street, where you might hear the MJQ or Jimmy Smith. The Parson's Table (WA 5–4447) has decent food downstairs, contemporary sound upstairs. Nothing you like? Pick up Philadelphia Magazine's “Guide to Philadelphia.” At $2.95, it knows all and Philadelphia. SHOPPING—Those who live in New York or in Chicago won't find a lot out of the ordinary in Philadelphia's fine big department stores like John Wanamaker's or Strawbridge & Clothier, but the Sunday Flea Market at Independence Mall is good for an afternoon's browsing: arts, crafts and antiques. The cheek‐by‐jowl antique shops along Pine Street from Seventh to 13th offer everything from junque (junk at thrice the price) to occasional good buys in the real thing. Nearby, there are roughly 100 Jewelry shops in what is called Jeweler's Square, bounded by Samson, Chestnut, Seventh and Eighth Streets, and the shops are both competitive and variegated. A visit to P. J. Cooper, Inc. (by appointment, LO 8–6336), will make you feel like Elizabeth Burton as a liveried chap ushers you past glittering cases where elegantly accented young men will show you anyberyl cat's‐eye necklace to an unmounted moonstone selling for about $1,199,900 less. HISTORY — There is so much history here that it is best to get a complete rundown in advance by writing or calling the excellent Philadelphia Visitors Bureau, 1525 Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pa., 19102 (215‐651‐1200)The bureau has information on a multitude of tours and points of historic interest, The Liberty Bell at Independence Hall, where a local columnist suggested they incarcerate Haldeman and Ehrlichman, is a must, of course, but other less‐famous chunks of history include Elfreth's Alley, a little byway between Arch and Race Streets which has remained virtually unchanged since 1700, or Old Fort Mifflin, which has found employ in some manner in all of America's wars. Near Elfreth's Alley is the house where Betsy is said to have stitched up the first American flag, and a few minutes out of town is Washington's Crossing, Pa., where, among other things, George Washington demonstrated he was a soldier and not a sailor by standing up in a while crossing the Delaware on his way from Valley Forge to Battle of Trenton. Again, there is far, far too much to list—including incidentals like the house where Poe wrote “The Raven” — so get help from the Visitors Bureau. And try not to spend all your time in the hallowed halls. Relax. Buy a soft pretzel with mustard from a street vender. It'll taste terrible, but it's very Philadelphia. They also in vented “hoagies” (hero sandwiches) here, some of which taste as if they were made from the same loaf of bread Ben Franklin toted down the street under his ARCHITECTURE — From Old Swedes' Church at Delaware Ave. nue and Christian Street, dedicated in 1700, to Vincent Kling's Fidelity Mutual Life Building (1972), Philadelphia has a stunning variety of architectural styles and period buildings. The Fairmount Water Works in Fairmount Park looks like the Acropolis; there is Frank Furness's Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts at Broad and Cherry Streets; the (mostly) French Renaissance City Hall, sometimes called the world's tallest gingerbread house (Broad and Market); Frank Lloyd Wright's Beth Shalom Synagogue in Elkins Park; the occasional Saarineh, Pei, and Kahn and literally thousands of fine old Philadelphia residences, seen in stuffy restoration along the narrow streets of the posh Society Hill section. The City Hall tour alone takes an hotir and is worth the time. The VWtors Bureau (see HISTORY) can help with maps and what‐not. FAIRMOUNT PARK—The country's nicest city park, Fairmount Park consists of 4,000 acres that wind along the serene and lovely Schuylkill River through the western edge of the city. Rowers glide across the river's waters the year round and the banks are studded with statuary, including a monument to John B. Kelly, Olympic rowing champion and father of Princess. Grace. A series of elegantly furnished Colonial mansions dot the landscape and are open to visitors (Park House Tours, PO 3–8100). The Philadelphia Zoological Garden, the nation's oldest, has a superb collection of wild animals and featurea a safari monorail ride. A replica of a Japanese home and garden offers tea ceremonies durmg the warmer months. THEATER—There's more legitimate theater in Philadelphia than in almost any other American city outside of New York and there is currently a renaissance in grogress, with the Forrest Theater, the new Locust, the Schubert, the Society Hill Playhouse, the Annenberg Center and others offering pre‐ and off‐Broadway producpons. Among them: Julie Harris in “The Au Pair Man,” Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival, the National Chinese Opera Theater and aimilar fare. Check local listings or write the Visitors Bureau for advance information. MUSIC, DANCE—Eugene Ormandy has the status of royalty in Philadelphia, but the Philadelphia Or. chestra (Academy of Music, Broad and Locust; call PE 5–7378 for concert information) is far from the city's only musical attraction. The Museum of the Philadelphia Civic Center (EV 2–8181) even schedules African folk ensembles. There are scores of other concerts, indoor, outdoor, free and other. wise, on the musical calendar. check local listings. Ror dance, there is the Pennsylvania Ballet Company (PE 5.7378), a newish group of excellent repute, the Philadelphia Civic Ballet (WA 5.4405), which might be found per. forming in a park, a playground or at the Academy of Music, or a number of smaller groups that can be discovered in local listings or through the Visitors Bureau. HOTELS—Center City Philadelphia has ample and excellent accommodations within a brisk walk of Independence Hall and other spots of interest, and most hotels and to the better hotels. The Visitors motels will help you find tours or bus lines to more distant spots. The Bellevue‐Stratford (PE 5‐0700) at Broad and Walnut, is the city's busiest hotel, and an excellent one, although many of the knowledgeable prefer the elegant Barclay (KI 5–0300) on Rittenhouse Square, or the Latham (LO 3–7474) at 17th and Walnut. All charge about $25‐$30 for a double. Substantially lower rates are available at the Adelphia (LO 3‐3000) at Chestnut and 13th Streets. The Holiday Inn (WA 3–8660) at Fourth and Arch, adjoining Independence Mall, compares in price Bureau will provide other choices in town and out. RESTAURANTS — Old Original Bookbinder's (WA 5–7027), on Walnut Street near the Delaware. is the city's best‐known restaurant. A gigantic seafood house, it is often noisy, harried. Some swear ‐ by it, others find it overpriced and unpredictable. Take your chances. Another Bookbinder's, unrelated to the original, is on 15th Street downtown (KI 5–1137). This one is smaller, less well‐known and generally rewarding either for seaor a thick bowl of pepperpot soup. Philadelphians like the homey, plain, old fashioned folksiness of Snockey's (MA 7–9416), a decidedly unpretentious oysterand‐beer house on South Eighth Street. Just a bit more elevated is Kelly's on Ludlow Street (LO 7–4333), which has a rather dizzying collection of oyster plates on the wall. For those of means with a taste for haute cuisine, La Panethere (KI 6.5452) is both elegant and generally excellent. In the same category is the more intimate (seating about 25) Le Bec Fin (WA 2–1319), also expensive but worthwhile. At what might be considered the other end of the scale is the Villa Di Roma, earthy, basic, fluorescent, inexpensive, informal and in the middle of South Philadelphia's Italian Market. The market is a warren of outdoor produce venders, fish stores, meat cutters and what‐not and should be on every visitor's itinerary anyway. The city's tiny Chinatown has several quite good restaurants. One of the better ones is the Imperial Inn on Race Street (WA 5–2485) and its one of the few with a bar. If belly dancers, shishkebab and a very friendly atmosphere is what you crave, try the Middle East (WA 2–1003) for lunch or dinner. MUSEUMS, INSTITUTIONS — A good sampling—more than a day's worth, in fact—of ihe city's permanent attractions is available for a Modest 50‐cent fare on Philadelphia's Cultural Loop Bus. In addition to providing riders with reduced admission fees, the bus lets them junket along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, getting on and off at‐whim. The bus stops at the Franklin Institute and Fels Planetarium (both of which are fascinating for the scientificminded as well as for thotie simply capable of amazement), and passes the Academy of Natural Sciences, the Rodin Museum (largest collection of Rodin works outside Paris), the Philadelphia Museum of Art (one of the finest in the country) and goes on to the zoo. Full information is available at DA 9.4800. A similar loop bus is planned to ferry revelers between nightspots. A complete listing of museums, collections and galleries can be obtained from the Visitors Bureau. Hours vary with the seasons, so check first."
A Different Woman By Jane Howard 413 pp. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co. $7.95.,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/18/archives/a-different-woman-by-jane-howard-413-pp-new-york-e-p-dutton-co-795.html,"Three ‐ quarters of the way into “A Different Woman,” Jane Howard's rambling account of a two‐year talking tour through American womanhood, the author recalls Martin Buber's admonition that we must “relinquish undirected plenitude in favor of the one taut string, the one stretched beam of direction.” Buber's thought occurs to her when she is adrift at Miami airport, afflicted with turista and too much carry‐on baggage, and totally unable to decide which way to fly next in pursuit of the ultimate female rap session. She has complained before of a lack of direction, describing herself as a “hyperactive journalist” of a “coiled, hectic, and flippant” nature. She has also quoted twice, with emphasis, Saint‐Exupéry's cop‐out, “It is the time you have wasted on your rose that makes your rose so important.” From the frequency of such signs in the undergrowth of a most overgrown book, it seems probable that Miss Howard knew what was happening to “A Different Woman” as she wrote it, but was unable to get a grip on any promising direction for it. One reason for this must be inherent in the assignment—go forth and interview women. “Undirected plenitude” and a sizable admixture of wasted time, would be a fair, even a kindly description of the result. At the beginning of the book, speaking of some women she never did manage to talk to, Miss Howard says, “My quest would have been to try to find out more about the texture of their lives, whom and what they loved, what was on their minds, and in what ways they were like and unlike each other and the rest of us; what it is, if anything, that is unifyingly ‘American’ about us.” This staggering purpose is never again referred to, and is rapidly lost in the melee of interviews, conversations, anecdotes, jokes, memories, travel notes, and autobiographical narrative and confession that follow. Miss Howard's gargantuan appetite for chat, and her unflagging enjoyment of the mundane, has produced a book that may baffle the reader with a recurring curiosity as to what the whole thing is actually about. Women's Lib clearly is one theme, but it crops up no more often than would, say, the subject of parental restraint if one were to spend two years interviewing a random selection of children. If you believe that there is one good interview in everyone, and if you can face, with Andy Warhol and with equanimity, a possibly dawning era in which everyone alive can expect to be famous for at least 15 minutes, then you will probably not become impatient with “A Different Woman”. If there is no particular limit to how much you want to know about Tupperware parties in New Hampshire, or the folkways of the upper‐middle female crust in Denton, S. C., or the monthly cost of kitty litter and veterinarian care for 126 cats owned by a certain Linda Wetherill, “A Different Woman” will certainly divert you. Miss Howard's 50 or so interviews are a heterogenous group who obviously can lay no claim to being typical, representative or any kind of pollster's sample for the divination of what Ms. America is thinking, or at any rate talking about, at the moment. This is not altogether a disadvantage from the interviewer's point of view since she may reasonably consider herself disqualified from the sociologist's chore of wresting a few conclusions from the material amassed. This is a do‐it‐yourself project for the reader. Miss Howard is a good interviewer who enjoys talking to women, and most of her interlocutors are unusual in some way. But no more than half a dozen of them have anything particularly memorable to say, and since Miss Howard has the curious habit of rarely giving more than the sketchiest physical description of her subject, her book seems peopled from the beginning with insubstantial wraiths. Perhaps the author's 15 years at Life magazine, where photograph ers did the description, explains the visual vacuum. Interviewees are introduced elaborately enough—often with a lengthy note on the journey necessary to reach them—and sometimes in a manner that can only be explained as designed to please the subject on publication day. “Jinki is Ginny's name when she is home. To her five nieces, one of whom is her namesake, she is in fact known as Big Jinki. She is closest to Kitty, the eldest niece, whose high school classmates voted her the girl with the Best Personality. Now a law student at the state university, Kitty says Big Jinki has influenced her plenty.” Miss Howard says she likes things wholesome, and a happy result of this is an absence of contemporary comparative orgasm discussions, although she does talk to a woman who made a film of her own abortion. There is also a foray to a feminist self‐help clinic where patients are given group instruction in the use of the speculum, but Miss Howard concludes the outing with a remark from one of the unconverted, who says “I've never seen the inside of my ear either, and I don't hold that against the otologist.” There is just one interview in the book where Miss Howard's interests, a footloose, childless career woman concerned with what's happening right now, cause her to miss something extraordinary. She goes to Appalachia to talk to a mountain woman who makes quilts and sells them through a local collective—the first money she has ever been able to earn. This woman has had 12 children and put them all through high school, and she remarks that, at one point, she had six of them under 5‐years‐old to care for single‐handedly. Miss Howard wants to know about the quilts, and about a nearby snake‐handling church. But how does any woman bear and raise six children under the age of 5, and in particular how does she do it in a house without indoor plumbing and with a wood‐burning stove in the kitchen? About a third of “A Different Woman” is autobiographical, and this is generally more successful than the interviews, perhaps because Miss Howard is more interesting, various and candid than most of her subjects appear to be. Particularly good are the sections about Life magazine, where she had a perfect job, as roving interviewer and reporter, for the achievement‐oriented, travel‐hungry experience freak she sees herself as being. About her private life she is painfully honest, presenting it as often characterized by the comic aridity of one suitor, who launched a tentative assault on her person with the words “Pardon my male tendencies.” Full across the middle of the book, and running concurrently with the interviews, is an account of a traveling romance with a dreary painter named Marcus. Together they bicker their way through the Western states, with the nondriving painter sulking in hotel rooms while Miss Howard zooms off, repeatedly, to interview her women. Even the best of the autobiographical sections are interrupted by inexplicable bouts of cutesy‐poo prattle—“Peggy and I had once gone impulsively to Montana, where she had sat on mountain tops with her recorder and played such diverse airs as ‘Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring’ and ‘Hitler Has Only Got One Ball.’ Snowflake and I had spent a week together in adjoining tents at a campground in Jamaica, scraping fresh nutmeg into our coffee and hiking off to beaches.” One coffee klatsch too many perhaps, or an unforeseen toll from two years of jet lag. “In Fort Lauderdale, where our paths once crossed for a day or so, she and I had a binge with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and saw our first exhibitionist, in a parking lot. We talked of cartwheels, which we both wished in vain we could do.” Cumulatively this kind of silliness begins to weaken interest in its author, which is unfortunate because she means to document the smallest details of her life. Trivia, in an interview with a famous subject, has some journalistic “human” value, but when Miss Howard sets out to record her own private routine, the effect is presumptuous. “I love to read my paper in the morning, tearing out clippings as I drink coffee, and separating, with attention otherwise not like me, each segment of grapefruit from its membrane. Some days I read the Lost and Found notices.” Miss Howard refers, almost in passing, to a period at Time‐Life when female employes brought a class‐action suit against the company, charging it with sexual discrimination. She was invited to join the militants, but declined, saying that she had been treated quite decently at Life, and that she had not been “raised to be a rocker of boats.” “I think now,” she says, “that if I had it to do over, I would have joined the plaintiffs.” Perhaps “A Different Woman” is in some way expiatory, a payment of dues. There is a dutifulness about her regular returns to the subject of Women's Lib, and she records very fully the opinions of women who have no hope of private remedies for discrimination, but are convinced of the need to organize, demonstrate and legislate to force a change. Yet she concludes her own statement on the subject with the small assertion that “men need us as much as we need them, and it is urgent for us to figure out how to talk to each other.” Miss Howard is evidently a true believer in the potential of talk, and “A Different Woman” is a monument to her faith. ■"
American Bishops Showing a New Readiness to Take Issue With the Vatican,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/19/archives/american-bishops-showing-a-new-readiness-to-take-issue-with-the.html,"The American Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church are showing an increasing willingness to engage in open disagreements with Vatican officials over what is best for the church in this country. At last week's meeting of the American hierarchy in Washington the Bishops voted to appeal to the highest levels in Rome for authorization to continue using in marriage tribunals streamlined procedures that are in danger of being curtailed by Vatican officials. While accepting a directive from two Vatican congregations to end experimental practices in regard to the age of first confession, the Bishops also voted to send a statement to Rome criticizing the allegedly arbitrary way in which the directive was issued. The tension was evident as the country's 260 Bishops held their five‐day annual policy meeting at the Statler‐Hilton Hotel in Washington. Most of the sessions were open, but several, important issues were discussed in closed meetings. Smooth Until Now National Bishops' conferences were established by the Second Vatican Council of 1962 to 1965 in keeping with the broad principle of collegiality, or shared government, in the church. In general, relations between the American conference and the various Vatican offices have developed smoothly. Last week, however, serious tensions broke into the open, especially over the issue of marriage tribunal reform. Four years ago the American Bishops received authorization to enact a series of experimental reforms for their courts, which grant marriage annulments to. Catholics. Divorced Catholics cannot remarry and remain in the church, but those whose marriages are annulled can. Grounds for annulment, however, are strictly limited. The reforms, which included reduction of the number of judges required and the elimination of mandatory appeals, have resulted in an increase in the number of cases handled from 740 in 1969 to an estimated 5,000 this year. Last year the Bishops requested that the new norms be extended, but the Vatican responsed by giving permission only through July 1., This was widely assumed by canon lawyers to be a sign of dissatisfaction by then Vatican with the number of annulments being granted by American courts. Defeat for Conservative At a closed session Thursday, the Bishops, who have been under intense pressure from the canon lawyers who run the courts to preserve the liberalized procedures, voted without formal dissent to seek an extension of all 23 of the experimental norms. According to sources among the Bishops, the decision was taken after forceful speeches by Lawrence Cardinal Shehan of Baltimore and John Cardinal Cody of Chicago, who urged that the overture be made directly to Pope Paul VI. “It was our way of saying that on this one we want to deal with the top,” one Bishop said afterward. The decision was seen as a defeat for John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, the president of the conference, who reportedly made clear his opposition to the plan but was unable to get any fellow conservatives to challenge the position of the two other Cardinals. Cardinal Krol declined to comment in any way on anything that transpired during the executive session. The other major issue dealt with in secret was first confession. The practice of the Western church in recent decades has been to introduce children to the sacrament of penance immediately before they receive first communion at about the age of 7. In recent years, however, a majority of American dioceses have been postponing penance until the age of 10 or 11 when, it is argued, the recipient is better able to understand its significance. In July, two Vatican congregations abruptly ordered the American Bishops to stop this experimental practice at the end of the current academic year. On Monday, the Bishops decided to go along with the Vatican directive but emphasized that no child should be forced to receive penance as a prerequisite to first communion if the child's parents or priest think it would be wiser to wait. Several Bishops, notably the Mat Rev. Charles Buswell of Pueblo, Colo., expressed resentment at the alleged unnecessary intrusion of Vatican officials in American church affairs. It was widely felt, for instance, that the directive had been issued without any serious effort to consider the pastoral realities of American parishes. The procedural issue was further debated during the closed session Thursday, and, According to numerous Bishops, it was decided to send a report to Rome criticizing the allegedly arbitrary way in which the issue had been handled by Vatican officials. Most Bishops who were questioned agreed that this was the first meeting at which tensions between the American hierarchy and the Vatican had been so strongly and openly expressed. Most, however, seemed to see it as a sign of maturity on the part of the Bishops' conference. The Most Rev. John L. May of Mobile, Ala., for instance, called it “the inevitable working out of procedures” between a new institution and an existing one. Other major actions by the Bishops last week included the following: ¶The Bishops issued a major and carefully prepared pastoral letter urging Catholics to revive public and private devotion to the Virgin Mary, a form of piety that has been in sharp decline since the Second Vatican Council. The 55‐page document was seen as progressive in that it emphasized the Biblical basis of devotion to Mary and emphasized that it took place within the context of the “centrality of Christ.” It expressed confidence that “all Christains share a basic reverence for the mother of Jesus” and appealed to Christians in other churches to reexamine with us Mary's place in our common patrimony.” ¶The Bishops voted 121 to 113 not to request permission from Rome to allow communicants to take the host in their hand during communion instead of having it placed on their tongue by the priest. ¶The Bishops expressed “positive attitude” toward the coming United Nations population year. In stressing the need for family planning, they said that abortion must be “absolutely excluded”as licit means of regulating births, but made no mention of birth control. Also the Bishops for the first time endorsed a consumer boycott of lettuce and table grapes in support of demands by the United Farm Workers for free union elections in California and the Southwest."
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/20/archives/south-carolinas-rep-dorn-to-bid-for-the-governorship-notes-on.html,"After 25 years in Congress, William Jennings Bryan Dorn, dean of South Carolina's Congressional delegation, will run for Governor next year. The 57‐year‐old Democrat, who entered the House of Representatives in 1947 with such freshmen Congressmen as Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy and now holds the position of chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, is the first announced candidate for his state's gubernatorial race. The present Governor, John C. West, also a Democrat, is not eligible for re‐election. • Edward M. Kennedy Jr. “continues to improve satisfactorily” after surgical removal Saturday of his right leg above the knee in an effort to halt the spread of bone cancer, according to a spokesman for Georgetown University Hospital. The 12‐year‐old son of the Senator from Massachusetts was described as “having some discomfort, which can be expected with this type of surgery.” • Leaping to the apparent defense of Maya Plisetskaya, the prima ballerina of the Bolshoi ballet, Tass, the Soviet news agency has denounced as “a dirty lie” an article about her printed in the weekly magazine supplement of The Daily Telegraph in London. The article by George Feller, an American specialist on Soviet affairs, quoted the ballerina as saying no one in the Soviet Union can “take a free breath” immune from secret pressure to lie to conform with official policy. Tass claimed Miss Plisetskaya was surprised and indignant about. the article. • Visit planned: By Princess Margaret and her husband, the Earl of Snowden, to Winnipeg next May, to take part in the Canadian city's centennial celebration. • After 19 years of marriage, John Wayne and his third wife, Pilar, have decided to part ways. By mutual agreement, it will be a “friendly trial separation,” the 37‐year‐old Mrs. Wayne said in a one‐sentence statement issued in Burbank, Calif. Jack Casey, press agent for the 66‐year‐old actor, said the couple would not discuss any details of marital problems. The Waynes were married Nov. 1, 1954. They have three children, Aissa, 17 years old; John Ethan, 11, and Marisa, 6. • A Wallace marrying a Kennedy?.Why, yes, indeed. The date is Dec. 15. The Wallace is Peggy Sue Wallace, 23‐year‐old daughter of the Governor of Alabama, and the Kennedy is Mark Kennedy, a college student she met on a blind date. Miss Wallace says 600 people have been invited to the wedding. and 8,000 to the reception at the Governor's mansion. Mr. Kennedy, an Alabaman, doesn't plan to leave politics solely to the Massachusetts Kennedys, Miss Wallace says, nor the Governor's mansion solely to the Wallaces. “He says he wants to run for Governor one day,” she said. • Back in 1962, Sherri Finkbine was very much in the news. She touched off a controversy over abortion, then permissible in Arizona only to save the life of the mother, by going to Sweden to terminate her pregnancy, because she had taken the drug Thalidomide and feared it had deformed her two‐month‐old fetus. Mrs. Finkbine, now 40, and her husband, Robert, 42, have now filed for divorce in an Arizona court after 20 years of marriage and four children. Mr. Finkbine said it was a mutual decision."
MRS. COOK SEEKS APPELLATE SEAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/20/archives/mrs-cook-seeks-appellate-seat-chances-called-slim-in-bid-for-court.html,"Assemblyman Constance E. Cook, resetting her goal to be the first woman on the state's high court, said yesterday that she had appealed directly to Governor Rockefeller and he had agreed to meet with her to hear her request for appointment. However, sources close to the Governor say the chances of Mrs. Cook, a Republican of Ithaca, are slim because of “two infirmities.” One is her identity as an advocate of the liberalized abortion laws—Which Republican politicians feel would damage the state ticket's chances with Roman Catholic voters next year. The second is her rejection last year by the State Bar Association when she sought an opening then on the same Court of Appeals. Mrs. Cook contends that she was the victim of antifemale bias by the bar association and has said that she will make an issue of this, if necessary, in seeking the latest vacancy on the court. The vacancy was created by the election of Associate Judge Charles D. Breitel as chief judge of the court two weeks ago. The Governor has said that he would like to see a woman on the court. His appointee to fill the vacancy would have considerable advantage when the voters fill the seat next year for a full 14‐year term. A second seat, now held by Judge Adrian P. Burke, whose term expires at the end of 1974, also will be filled by the voters to the next general election. Mrs. Cook Said to Trail Republican sources said yesterday that there had seen some preliminary discussion of having a woman or a black fill the seat. But the initial speculation was that Mrs. Cook was not a front‐runner. “The Governor called me after J wrote to him,” Mrs. Cook said. “He made no commitment, of course, but he seemed very much open to considering a woman for the court.” Mr. Rockefeller has not indicated whom he might be considering. Several months ago, he praised the “distinguished services” of former Supreme Court Justice Bernard S. Meyer of Nassau County, who lost last year as one of three Democrats running for the three open seats. Republicans have said that Justice Meyer would now be on the court except that Joseph F. Crangle, the state Democratic chairman, had negated an earlier cros‐party deal and had run a separate slate in an effort to win all three seats. The seats all went to Republicans in the election. The state Republican chairman, Richard Rosenbaum, said he also had a high opinion of Judge Meyer but would not recommend that the Governor appoint him because, he said, there were “others I would recommend more readily.” Other Republicans had complained that naming Justice Meyer — or any Democrat —would have the effect of rewarding the Democrats for having broken a deal. Lawyer on Wall St. Mrs. Cook has a quiet, insistent style in Albany, hardly the rebel, but in recent years she has been increasingly outspoken on women's rights. She questions the Bar Association's ability to screen, noting that some members wrote to her apologetically after last year's controversy upon discovering that Mrs. Cook was the former Constance Eberhard, the maiden name she used as a Wall Street financial lawyer. “I changed my name when I got married and now I'm discovering that can be a disadvantage,” she said. “But life is tough enough without having to explain to the children why mom and dad have different names.” Mrs. Cook, a 53‐year‐old, sixterm legislator, said that while she had been rejected last year by the Bar Association for having lacked judicial experience, the same group accepted men with similar or less promising background."
HARTFORD SPURNS 3 ABORTION RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/22/archives/hartford-spurns-3-abortion-rules-proposals-are-returned-to-state.html,"HARTFORD, Nov. 21 (UPI) —Connecticut's Attorney General, Robert K. Killian, yesterday rejected three sections of the proposed state regulations governing abortion and sent them back to the State Public Health Council. One of the rejected sections provides that a hospital board of trustees might elect to allow abortions only to preserve the life or health of the expectant mother. Mr. Killian said the provision could conceivably require a hospital to perform an abortion for mental health reasons, which was not covered in the United States Supreme Court decision striking down restrictive state abortion laws. Mr. Killian also rejected as being overly restricive a clause saying that if an aborted fetus showed signs of life “only those measures usually used to support life in a premature infant shall be employed.” The third disputed section involved issuance of life and death certificates. The regulations provide that, after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the physician must issue a birth certificate followed by a death certificate, but that under 20 weeks, only a death certificate need be issued. Mr. Killian said that a birth certificate must be issued in all cases, regardless of duration of pregnancy, followed by death certificate. The regulations were approved by the council several weeks ago and were sent to the Attorney General and the Legislative Regulations Review Committee for further action. All three agencies must give approval before the regulations can become law. Until the regulations are approved, the state has no effective control over abortion."
"The Woman Cooks, the Man Carves...Right? Wrong!",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/22/archives/the-woman-cooks-the-man-carvesright-wrong.html,"Some Thanksgiving that was. Mashed potatoes missing, gravy boat empty. His daughter carved the turkey after her husband had cooked it. Poor grandfather. Instead of a proper New England Thanksgiving, he got his fill of feminism. “He had a fit,” said 40‐year‐old Joyce Slayton Mitchell, recalling the reaction of her father, a retired Ford car dealer, to the first “alternative holiday” buffet in her Wolcott, Vt., farmhouse. In her parents' home, she explained, Thanksgiving means potatoes mashed, pies baked, wild turkeys stuffed and basted by women but carved by “big strong males.” Must it always? Mrs. Mitchell, coordinator of a National Organization for Women task force on women and religion, says members no longer buy “sexist” definitions cd Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas. So this year they're suggesting “alternative holidays” to NOW's 600 chapters around the country—suggesting, mind you, not declaring. Nobody, least of all NOW, would deny to American women their right to make wrecks of themselves between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Religious feminists simply ask: Where is it written that American men shall not share this right? “We assert that a religious holiday should be a joyful and spiritually meaningful experience for women, too,” declared the Rev. Emily Champagne, the alternative holiday project's leader. The 31‐year‐old Unitarian‐Universalist minister and mother, who prefers the pulpit to her Cranbury, N.J., stove, said she believes other women should ponder their seasonal options. “If it huge holiday meal is Important to the family, let everyone join in the planning, preparing and cleaning up,” the Rev. Champagne suggest. It not, perhaps churches and temples could have pot‐luck suppers, with both sexes stirring the pot, of course. A school librarian in Berkeley, Calif., offers a solution Ito the problem of “presents that clutter up our already cluttered lives.” Nancy Ward gave each of her four children $25 last year to donate to charity. “They argued, you know, my charity's better than your charity,” Mrs. Ward said. So, finally, one gave to Humane Abortion, one to Planned Parenthood, one to the United Farm Workers and one to the Berkeley Free Clinic.” As her present, Mrs. Ward got pledge from her husband, William, an economics professor, to wash the clothes every other month. And each family member pledged to cook supper once a week. Thanksgiving doesn't count, though. Today, “on this very sexist of days,” Mrs. Ward said she expects to be behind the roasting pan. “I confess—nobody else has been willing to tackle a turkey,” she went on, adding that all her friends, Christians and Jewish alike, will be basting away. Carol Landes, a Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church elder and the mother of three teen‐agers, abhors “the idea of having 15 different dishes on the table and seeing who can ‐ get sickest the quickest.” At Union Theological Seminary, where Mrs. Landes works as an administrator, there will be a community Thanksgiving today “and my only question is—who's going to prepare it?” Barbara Krasner, a family therapist and an “observant Jew,” expects a full crew cooking in her King of Prussia, Pa., kitchen—five children and her husband, David, “the chief chef.” He's doing the turkey, then? “Well, no, we're vegetarians, but he'll make special goodies.” “In most traditional Jewish families it's the women who do the cooking and the men who lead the prayers,” Mrs. Krasner noted. She and her three daughters “just won't have that in our house.” Up in Welcott, Vt. (where grandfather has reportedly recovered from the first alternative holiday), 18 relatives will be sitting down to another one today. “But it won't be a question of my doing a dinner for 18 relatives,” insisted Joyce Slayton‐Mitchell. As a writer of college guide books, the wife of an anthropologist, the mother of two children, aged 8 and 7—and as coordinator of the NOW task force on women and religion—Mrs. Mitchell's much too busy for all that. Besides, she has “a lot of great aunts and uncles.” One will bring the creamed onions, one the pumpkin pie. And, if the gravy doesn't come through, well, the boat will be empty again. “I have an aunt who runs a beauty shop and never cooks,” Mrs. Mitchell added, with a touch of pride. “She always brings a big bottle of Sootch.”"
Wilson Is Unruffled as Governorship Reports Fly,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/wilson-is-unruffled-as-governorship-reports-fly-caution-is-sounded.html,"Most of the northbound cars jon the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway were racing beyond the emergency 50‐mile‐an‐hour limit last Wednesday morning, but there was Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson, identifiable by the No. 2 on his license plate, working in the back of his limousine that was clocked at a judicious 52 m.p.h. as it kept to the right. There had been reports that Governor Rockefeller might announce in. Albany that day that the time had come for him to step aside for a fresh run at the White House, and finally leave Mr. Wilson free to pursue his long‐acknowledged hope of serving as Governor. But the Lieutenant Governor did not hurry to the capital, for he has been hearing such reports since 1960, and by day's end his sense of political pitch remained finely tuned. Long‐Standing Reports “That kind of speculation has been the greatest indoor sport since Nelson A. Rockefeller was first elected,” Mr. Wilson said with amusement. He asserted that he had received no hint privately from Mr, Rockefeller beyond what the Governor had told the public—that he would weigh his options and settle the re‐election question by the end of the year. Even so, the Lieutenant Governor, who has quietly and devotedly served Mr. Rockefeller for 15 years, more than two full years in time, by one newsman's count, as Acting Governor during Mr. Rockefeller's absences, is able to look ahead at the hypothetical possibilities rather clearly when asked. In an interview last week, as the reports continued to fly, he made the following points: ¶The primary fight among Republicans that some feel would occur should Mr. Rockefeller depart is “a luxury a minority party cannot afford,” and one that could deprive the party of running its statewide success to a full two decades. Even as Mr. Wilson spoke, Governor Rockefeller began hinting more emphatically in a separate interview that the primary would be delayed next year until September. ¶Mr. Wilson expects no easy inside track to a gubernatorial nomination. He says there are a number of possible candidates, including Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, who have.an “ample basis” for seeking the job. ¶“Label” politics can be very misleading when applied to himself. Many term Mr. Wilson a conservative, and one who needs broader appeal if he is to run, Mr. Wilson says, “I am what the Governor is.” For those who need a label, he shrugs and advises “conserveral” — “an economic conservative and a human rights liberal. ¶He is a politician who has never lost an election, including the four statewide successes and 10 previous Assembly victories, and who has served as the most active second exjecutive in the state's history, close to Mr. Rockefeller in most governmental and political decisions. ¶He expects that President Nixon will have resolved the Watergate difficulties by next year, but that, if not, the state elections will prove “a lot tougher” for the G.O.P. task of convincing voters it is not time for a change. Caution Is Sounded In speaking about future possibilities, Mr. Wilson issued a general caution: “No one should ever forget the Governor is the Governor, including the Lieutenant Governor.” Mr. Wilson, who will be 60 years old on Feb. 26, is said to be the longest‐serving elected state official in New York's history — 35 years in the Legislature and administration. He was born in New York City and raised in Yonkers. Mr. Wilson, one of the prominent Roman Catholics in politics, had one of his few public disagreements with the Governor's positions —the policy on liberalized abortion—because of his beliefs. But the array of plaques in his offices here attest to his reputation of having worked all parts of the spectrum for years. He is the Fire Department Emerald Society's Irishman of the Year, says a plaque near the elevator, But he also is recipient of B'nai B'rith's Youth Services Award, according to a citation halfway to the water cooler, and he is the State Optometric Association's “patient and unassuming” visionary and a signed photograph from the Governor acknowledges that “Malcolm” was a chief hidden strategist in the campaign for Federal revenue sharing. When people ask whether his past views might hinder a gubernatorial candidacy, Mr. Wilson's supporters argue that many of his views have since become law. In recent years these include the Governor's more rigid state welfare program and his attempts to curtail state pension expenses. One of the channels by which the Lieutenant Governor could quickly lay claim to the throne is his familiar role as Mr. Rockefeller's alter ego in dealing with the Republican county chairmen. Mr. Wilson's mapper was demonstrated the other day when an aide asked about a certain labor official seeking the Governor's ear. “Route him through me first,” Mr. Wilson instructed. Many Duties Performed As Acting Governor when Mr. Rockefeller was away, he appears to have done, all the separate duties of the top job: appointments, proclamations, the signing of new laws and extradition orders, ordering out the National Guard (for children lost in the woods), even maintaining the executive death watch between court and Sing Sing over an open line when capital punishment was performed. On his desk are separate folders of papers relating to government matters that he handles as a member of the State Cabinet. Aside from presiding over the Senate where his biggest problem appears to have been a spate of stolen a gavels, he has handled various special jobs for the Governor. These include directing the state's role at the 1964 World's Fair, where he cautiously cleared every check he signed in advance with the office of an opposition Democrat, Controller Arthur Levitt; the delegate. hunt in 1968 when Mr. Rockefeller lase ran for the White House, and the job of “trying to persuade” skittish city Republican leaders to accept the Governor's plan this year for “fusion” mayoral ticket led by a Democrat, former Mayor Robert F. Wagner. But it was Mr. Wilson's first job for Nelson A. Rockefeller that established his place at the Governor's right hand. In 1958, he took Mr. Rockefeller on a two‐man statewide swing by car, with no millionaire's trappings, to convert Mr. Wilson's good friends, the Republican county leaders. Mr. Rbckefeller got the gubernatorial nomination and won with Mr. Wilson at his side, and soon after the current sort of reports began. “If it wasn't for Malcolm I wouldn't be here,” the Governor likes to tell audiences. “And if it wasn't for me, Malcolm would be here.”"
State's Abortion Rate Soaring,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/states-abortion-rate-soaring-states-abortion-rate-soaring.html,"NEWARK — She is usually single, white and in her early 20's. Others are 50‐year‐old grandmothers, and some are even as young as 11. That, essentially, is the broad range of the thousands of women who are seeking, and now receiving, abortions in New Jersey since a United States Supreme Court ruling last January. In effect, the Court's landmark decision overturned New Jersey's strict anti‐abortion laws, which had authorized the operation only if the pregnancy endangered the physical or emotional health of the mother. Because there is no mandatory reporting system in the state, the number of abortions actually performed is not known; however, officials in the health‐services field believe it is running into the tens of thousands. Whatever the actual figure, most knowledgeable authorities believe that an abortion — logistically, at least — is now a matter of relative ease for New Jersey women. “We almost went out of business last month because it's now as easy as pie to have an abortion,” said the Rev. John Wightman of the New Jersey Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion. The service, created in 1969, is a statewide organization that counsels women seeking an abortion. Mr. Wightman, a Congregationist minister in Nutley, said that, before the Supreme Court ruling, he would receive an average of 30 tele phone calls a week in Essex County alone. “But in all of last summer, I got only four or five calls,” he noted. Prior to the Supreme Court decision, and even before New York State liberalized its antiabortion laws, Mr. Wightman said, his organization directed most New Jersey women to Puerto Rido, London and Washington. “Because of the cost involved [up to $700 or $800], many women were precluded from receiving an abortion,” he said. “For the low‐income or moderate‐income woman, it was a desperate situation.” An abortion in New Jersey now costs between $150 and $400, depending on whether it is performed in the physicians office or in a hospital: A study by the state's Health Department found that 20;179 New Jersey women had had abortions performed out of the state in 1971; nearly 19,000 of these operations were done in New York City. In 1972, these figures increased by slightly more than 10 per cent. Officials believe that the number of abortions performed within New Jersey in 1973 has greatly increased. And just last month, the State Health Planning Council approved applications for the establishment of the first four abortion clinics in New Jersey. Next Friday, the Planning Council will review three other applications that had been deferred. These clinics, pro‐abortion activists believe, will eventually ease the situation of poorer women. Dr. Robert M. Livingston, an Englewood Cliffs gynecologist active in the movement to liberalize abortion laws, said that “the hospital should take up slack” until the clinics became a reality. Appeal to Hospitals Dr. Livingston, whose application for a clinic was the third one approved by the third one deferred by the claimed that some hospitals were limiting the number of abortions they performed each month. The 140 general hospitals in New Jersey, which include 17 Roman Catholic institutions that do not perform abortions, decide policy on an individual basis. A survey by the Health Planning Council last month found that approximately 50 per cent of the 109 hospitals responding did not abide by the Supreme Court ruling. Many of these hospitals have been subjected to pressure from both pro‐ and antialaortion groups, including protest marchers, threats of economic sanctions (withholding donations and volunteer workers) and court suits, among various actions. Despite the political and social cgntroversies enveloping the subject, abortions are, of course, a traumatic decision for most women. For some, pregnancy can be likened to a family tragedy. Dr. Livingston said he had seen 15‐year‐old pregnant girls “who wanted to have the baby, while their mothers were screaming ‘No! No!’ in the background.” “In such instances, I would not treat the girl if she wanted to conceive,” he added. The gynecologist said that, in the last year alone, he had treated one 11‐year‐old girl, three 12‐year‐olds and six 13‐year‐olds. More typical of those seeking an abortion was a 23‐year‐old single woman from Essex County. She said that she had become pregnant by the young man she had been dating for the last year. “We thought of getting married, but I realized that a pregnancy was not a reason for marriage,” she declared. “I wasn't sure if I loved him. I felt that I would perhaps bear a resentment against my husband and worse, perhaps, a resentment toward our child. “Maybe it was selfish or wrong [to have the abortion], but I felt, and my boyfriend agreed, that it was the fairest thing to do. It wasn't easy.” Married women, some with grown children and even grandchildren, said that they had had abortions because they believed they could not bear the physical or emotional strain of rearing another child. Other women have cited economic reasons: that their husbands were struggling now to support the families. In some instances, the women were working themselves and said they could not afford to lose income. The New Jersey Clergy Service provided the following statistics on the women who had sought its counseling: ¶Sixty per cent were single, 31 per cent were married and 9 per cent were divorced or separated. ¶Fifty per cent were between the ages of 18 and 25, 27 per cent were between 25 and 35, 12 per cent were over 35, 8 per cent were between 16 and 18 and 3 per cent were under 16. ¶Forty‐six per cent identified themselves as Protestants, 41 per cent as Roman Catholic and 7 per cent as Jewish. Six per cent had no religious identification. ¶Eighty‐seven per cent were white and 13 per cent were black."
Insiders Working Outside the Establishment,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/insiders-working-outside-the-establishment-psychiatric-ward-problem.html,"GREAT NECK, L.I.—While some young political activists are swallowing their fire to “work within the system,” a group of their Establishment elders here have quit the system to work from without. The group, Incorporated as the Community Advocates, has quietly sparked successful fights by consumers, clients and patients of a variety of Nassau governmental and social welfare agencies. Their major weapon is the knowledge gained from inside the glass enclosures about how the system works. For Joan R. Saltzman, organizer of the Community Advocates, disillusionment with the county Establishment began in 1968 when, as president of the prestigious North Shore Child Guidance Association, she was appointed to the Nassau County Mental Health Board. “When I put my hand on that Bible in the County Executive's office, and pledged to serve, I really took it very literally,” she said in a recent interview. “Those little commissions have a lot of checkbook power. Psychiatric Ward Problem “The planning, the literal interpretation or noninterpretation of the regulations, affect a lot of people. I was distressed at the inaction of the county in responding to the true needs that exist—everybody knows what they are—because of the bureaucracy. A mammoth system like this needs somebody to heat up the issues.” The county inaction that touched off Mrs. Saltzman's final break was the failure of the Nassau County Medical Center to separate children and adults in its psychiatric ward, while they were housed there for diagnostic purposes. “It's incomprehensible in this century,” she said. “Young boys and senile men, they had all kinds of sex problems, The Mental Health Board, which gave the psychiatric money to the hospital, said every month new facilities were almost ready. We got the same answer in 1967, 1968. . . When I visited there I got so hysterical in the parking lot I couldn't drive home.” Mrs. Saltzman said the County Executive promised her in November, 1971, to have the children removed in 90 days. When they were not removed by February, she declined to help form a quorum to vote on the budget. Soon after, in her fifth year on the board, she resigned, announcing her reason. The following week, she said, the children were removed from the ward. County officials, asked last week about Mrs. Saltzman's account, declined comment. “At that point, it seemed obvious to me, that you cannot get there from within,'” she said. “In February, 1972, I formed a nonprofit corporation to work legitimately and responsibly, to have art office with fund‐raising ability enabling tax‐deductible gifts to he given, to have a charter for action.” The planning director of the Community Advocates, John Frings, a health‐services consultant, had quit his job as planning executive of the Mental Health Board over more general frustration with the bureaucracy, and was free to accept the unpaid post. The group's president, Evelyn Weinstein, a former psychiatric weal worker, said she began to consider using social work skills in a different way when her husband, Jack Weinstein, became county attorney for a two‐year period, and “I got a more intimate look at where the power lies.” Other acquaintances with power or expertise were named to the board of directors, some preferred to be added to the anonymous pool of advisers. Private contributions' provided a small budget to cover the cost of working quarters and a full‐time sec retary. With about 300 members, the group took on its first project. It attempted to reform practices at the county hospital by injecting itself into the accreditation process. The group discovered that the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation would be making one of its regular surveys in the summer of 1972 and that new procedures permitted any interested group to ask for “an information interview.” “In an attempt to open up that very closed institution, we convened a lot of interested people who hear complaints—directors of agencies, black leaders, welfare representatives, antipoverty officials,” Mrs. Saltzman said. The group sent telegrams to the hospital and the accreditation team requesting an information session and was granted one at 8 A.M. of a sweltering August day. “We asked substantial questions,” Mrs. Saltzman said, “like ‘Will you have time to do this in three days?’ We asked questions that are discussed in the joint commissions' own book. They were not happy. They didn't know what to do. One of them said to me, ‘Madam, how did you learn about this hearing?’” One of the women there, Mrs. Saltzman recalled, asked questions like, “Why are people in the abortion room treated like animals? Why are the doors open? Why are the women not properly draped? Why are they called by their first names?” Plans for Action The joint commission granted a one‐year accreditation instead of the usual two‐year certification and recommended improvements, Mrs. Saltzman said. Since then, the group has made plans to convene similar kinds of public information sessions not only in other hospitals but also in nursing homes as well. At the county hospital, it has concentrated its pressure toward getting a representative of the public patients as a member of the board. County Executive Ralph G. Caso declined to comment on the group's activites. Another high official in his administration, which was re‐elected overwhelmingly in the recent election, described the Community Advocates as the administration's “only enemy.” Adrian Cabral, director of the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, to which 156 nongovernmental agencies belong, said he thought Community Advocates had “substantial impact on Long Island.” “There are many agencies in the advocacy business,” Mr. Cabral said, “but there is a significant difference with Community Advocates because it is really independent, not supported by providers of services. They can call things as they see them.” In another Community Advocates project, teams of one white person and one black person were sent to drugstores around the county, with identical prescriptions. The group reported finding that blacks are charged more than whites in the same stores for the same prescription drugs. The findings were turned over to the Office of Consumer Affairs, the county attorney's office, the Human Rights Commission and the state attorney general's office. “This is a function that should have been performed by forces in the county long before,” Mrs. Saltzman said. “A lot of people knew about it. The day after the results were released, we got $200 in cash in an envelope from ‘a group of interested physicians.’ I don't even know whom to thank.” Among the other projects sparked by the Community Advocates are an inter‐professional Child Abuse Committee, a citizens committee to ask a questions about mental health services, a group of relatives of patients recently released from mental institutions to seek transitional homes for them, a group to determine whether an adequate referral system exists for questions from the public on health and welfare, and most recently, a group to propose unconventional ways that revenue‐sharing funds can legally be used by their localities."
Polio Victim Disregards M. D.'s And Safely Has Her First Baby,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/25/archives/polio-victim-disregards-mds-and-safely-has-her-first-baby-not.html,"TORRANCE, Calif., Nov. 29 (AP) — Despite the cautions of doctors, Gail Roszhart and her husband Terry were determined to have a baby—and adoption seemed unlikely. Mrs. Roszhart recalls that her pregnancy was both exciting and frightening. She had been paralyzed from the waist down for 23 years, after being stricken by polio at age 5. Doctors had long ago warned the Roszharts that a pregnancy might create serious respiratory problems because of her weak lungs, and might otherwise be a strain. Not Enough Babies' “I think we hit all the adoption agencies in Southern California,” said Mr. Roszhart, a research engineer. “They gave excuses like there are not enough babies to go around, but they didn't feel Gail was capable of caring for a child and they never investigated and never offered to investigate what she could do and how far she could go,” he said in an interview. The Roszharts started thinking about defying the doctors' advice. When Mrs. Roszhart went to another doctor for his opinion, she learned that the subject was moot; she was already pregnant. “The thing that was impressive,” she said, “is that no one said ‘get an abortion,’” which would have been so easy, and what greater excuse could have than my paralysis?” Two weeks ago, Leigh Anna Roszhart was born, delivered by caesarean section. She weighed 5 pounds 1 ounce and was reported in excellent condition. Dr. Donald Okada of Harbor General Hospital said the pregnancy had been less complicated than expected, His staff prepared a back brace for the mother, and an inhalation therlapy machine was used to help strengthen her lungs. The mobility of the child and the physical restrictions on the mother might cause problems in the future but the Roszharts say they will “take them as they come along and handle each one.” For now the Rosaharts, who have been married five years, are happy to be parents. “I plan to give the baby as much freedom as I possibly can so she doesn't feel restricted by my handicap,” Mrs. Roszhart said."
"SENATE APPROVES 11% PENSION RISE, TAX HELP FOR POOR",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/01/archives/senate-approves-11-pension-rise-tax-help-for-poor-plan-to-ease.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 30—The Senate passed legislation tonight increasing Social Security benefits and, for the first time since the start of the program in 1936, easing somewhat the burden of Social Security taxes on low‐income families. The increase in benefits would amount to 7 per cent, effective as soon as the final version of the law is approved, plus an additional 4 per cent, effective next June. The provisions for relief of low‐income families would apply only to workers who have at least one child living in the same household, and only where the income of the parent or parents is less than $5,600. House Version Differs Rebates of Social Security taxes would amount to 10 per cent of the wages received by the parents or parent up to a total income of $4,000. After that point, the percentage would be reduced, until it reached zero at $5,600. The legislation, which contains many other changes in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, was passed in a substantially different version by the House. It will thus have to go to Foint Senate‐House conference committee, which will work gut the final, compromise version, before it can go to the President for his signature or veto. There have been no clear dgnals from the Administration about the possibility of veto. But in the past, while Mr. Nixon has complained about the size of Social Security increases passed by Contress, he has ultimately signed hem and even taken credit for them. Change to Cost Billions The prospects for a veto this time appeared clearly to hinge on how many of the amendments adopted by the Senate would remain in the version approved by the conference committee. Together, all the senate amendments would add several billion dollars a year to social Security costs, over and above the increase traceable to he basic increase in benefits. That increase would be filanced by increasing the mount of an individual's wages that is subject to the Social Security tax from 10,800 to $13,200. Among three dozen amendnents that the Senate added to he bill are the following: ¶Widows would be permitted to become eligible for Social Security at the age of 55, instead of 60, as at present. ¶An individual could earn up to $3,000 a year and still receive Social Security benefits, and starting at the age of 70 could earn any amount without losing Social Security. ¶Medicare would be made to cover the costs of drugs for the treatment of chronic illness even when the patient was not hospitalized. ¶There would be an absolute prohibition against the paying for abortions under the Medicaid program of health insurance for the poor. There would be no exceptions whatever, such as abortions performed to save the life of the mother, under this amendment, which was sponsored by Senator James L. Buckley, ConservativeRepublican of New York, and adapted by voice vote. The demand for some relief from Social Security taxes for low income persons, has been mounting in recent years as the tax has risen and as income taxes have been cut. Individuals and families with incomes at or below the poverty level have been removed completely from the income taxi rolls under legislation passed in 1964, 1969 and 1971. But the Social Security taxes paid by many such families have risen more than their income taxes have been cut. Many members of Congress wish to preserve the idea that Social Security payments are a right—not a Government handout—because the recipient of Social Security retirement income has Paid for it, Thus, there has been considerable op position to relief from Social Security taxes for low‐income workers. The Senate's action marked the first time that either house of Congress had voted any such flow‐income relief. It was not clear whether the provision, which would actually give back to sonic families more than they paid in Social Security taxes, would survive the conference committee. Before finally approving the Social Security bill, by a vote of 66 to S, the Senate turned down another tax change. This was a modest taxreform proposal, which was defeated after oil industry representatives argued that it would increase the taxes they paid and thus worsen the current fuel shortage by discour aging development of new oil. ‘Minimum Tax’ Controversy What the Senate rejected, by a 46‐to‐37 margin, was a proposed tightening of rules for the “minimum tax,” which is aimed at persons who have large amounts of income that is untaxed, or lightly taxed, under present law. The margin of de feat was considerably wider than the 49‐to‐47 vote by which the Senate rejected essentially the same propqsal last June, before the energy shortage became a matter of widespread concern. Another amendment to the inspired by the fuel shortage would bar the export of oil drilling equipment to countries that restrict the sale of their to the United States. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, led the argument against adoption of the proposed tightening of the minimum tax, which was sponsored by Democratic Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Birch Bavh of Indiana, Edmund S. Muskte of Maine and Gaylord Nelsen of Wisconsin. The minimum tax, as now written, does not apply to an individual until the income he receives that is untaxed under various preferential provisions of the tax law exceeds the amount of tax he paid on his fully taxable income, plus 530,000. ‘A Strange Time’ The proposed altendment; would have eliminated the off ?? ?? lowance, and of other preferences, by 10 per cent. Senator Bentsen argued that now was “a strange time, indeed, to start talking about increasing the tax on those per sons who are trying to increase, our supply of energy.” He also argued that the effect of the amendment on the taxation of capital gains — to increase the maximum possible effective tax rate from 38.5 per ent to 42.35 per cent — would hurt an already depressed stock market. Senator Kennedy replied that there were many other reasons why the stock market was depressed, and observed, that a much larger increase in the capital gains tax went into offect in 1969 “and Wall Street didn't even blink.” Another of today's amendmoots, sponsored by Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, would restore unemployment compensation benefit, to tens of thousands of persons in New York, New Jersey Connecticut and about 20 other states. The Javits amendment would, however, require Legislatures of each state to take action on the modified program of unemployment benefits before its citizens could receive them. Basically, the amendment changed the criteria for eligijnlity of a state for Federal assistance in the payment of unemployment beneifts for a period of 13 weeks beyond the basic 26 weeks. States would become eligible if unemployment among persons covered by the unemployment compensation program—known as “insured unemployment”—reached, 4 per cent. The “trigger” has been 5 per cent. About 3,000 persons a week exhaust their unemployment benefits in New York State, and would be eligible for renewed benefits once the state's insured unemployment rate reaches 4 per cent, which it is expected to do about midJanuary."
Reiner Leaving ‘Dick Van Dyke Show’ After C.B.S. Cuts Love‐Making Episode,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/01/archives/reiner-leaving-dick-van-dyke-show-after-cbs-cuts-lovemaking-episode.html,"An episode of the “Dick Van Dyke Show” already produced for the current season has been canceled by the Columbia. Broadcasting System because it concerns a child's discovery of her parents in the act of love in their bedroom. Carl Reiner, producer of the situation ‐ comedy series, responded to the network's action by vowing never to work again for C.B.S. in a creative capacity; that is, as a producer or writer, as distinct from as a performer. He said he would not return to the show if C.B.S. renewed it for next fall. Work has been completed on all 24 episodes commissioned for this season although only 23 will be broadcast. Called ‘Honest’ Mr. Reiner called the rejected program “honest, tender and meaningful,” and he said that he and Dick Van Dyke considered it one of their best shows for the season. He said the network employed a double standard for permissiveness, allowing “grown up” material in some shows but denying it to others. Robert D. Wood, president of the C.B.S. television network, explained that what Mr. Reiner feels is a double standard is actually, in this instance, the network's judgment that the subject matter is “out of rhythm with the tradition of Dick Van Dyke's kind of entertainment”. “Audiences bring a certain level of expectancy to all programs,” he said. “With ‘All In the Family’ there is a certain expectation that the topic might be menopause, but Dick Van Dyke has wholesome written all over his face and is remembered by people for his Walt Disney roles.” The child's intrusion on her parents love‐making, and the discussions that followed in the episode were regarded by the network president as “anxious material” for Mr. Van Dyke's show. He said he believed that many parents in the audience, would prefer to reserve the questions that arise in the pro gram for their own family distussions. Mr. Reiner's contrasting view. was that the program was truthful and that it might offend only those who did not want children to know the truth about love between husbands and wives. He disputed the C.B.S. contention that the material destroyed the “image” of Mr. Van Dyke and the series. “Who should know better about the image than ourselves, who created it? We want the series and the characters to grow with society, not to be frozen in 1965.” he said. The producer said he believed that the network deleted the episode — which should have been the seventh of the season —because it was afraid of resistance from affiliated stations such as it had experienced with the “Maude” abortion programs and the David Rabe play, “Sticks and Bones.” Mr. Wood denied the charge, stating that the network's willingness to play both controversial shows, knowing that many stations would reject them, demonstrated that C.B.S. did not readily yield to the tyranny of affiliates. On the contrary, he said, the network would be compromising its integrity if it reversed its better judgment on a program issue because a gifted. writer and producer threatened to leave. How the disagreement will affect negotiations between Mr. Reiner and C.B.S. for a proposed television special featuring Mr. Reiner and Mel Brooks remains, to be seen. Effect on Renewal Renewal of the “Dick Van Dyke” series could also be affected by Mr. Reiner's resignation. In television a satisfactory share of the audience is 30 per cent, and the Dick Van Dyke series has been averaging 28 per cent. The program has been competing with the National Football League games on A.B.C. C.B.S. expects the ratings to increase when the football season ends in January, but, if they do not go up substantially, the program's continuation will he uncertain. The availability of Mr. Reiner as producer could make the difference in the network's confidence in the future of the series."
family food fishions furnishings,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/01/archives/feminist-organization-is-fighting-oppression-in-the-catholic-church.html,"Silently at first, and now vociferously, a group of Roman Catholic women, named for the 15th Century saint who was burned to death at the stake, are fighting for the equality of women within the church.Catholic home, even if the woman has an I.Q. of 165 and the man has 125, the woman is still submissive to her husband.” The group is the St. Joan's International Alliance, and the women are led in this country by Frances Lee McGillicuddy, a feisty retired high school French teacher from Manhattan who almost always sports a protest button that says, “Equal Rites for Women.” No, “rites” is not a misprint. You see, the group's uppermost goal is to elevate women to the priesthood. “If you get women into the priesthood, all the other things will follow,” Miss McGillicuddy said recently in an interview, also attended by four other St. Joan's members. “We don't want to go by mini‐steps, such as being allowed to be just deacons. We're for absolute equality in the laity, the deaconate and the priesthood.” St. Joan's, said by its members to be the only Roman Catholic feminist group, was founded in England in 1911 and expanded to the United. States in 1965. But it wasn't until last Aug. 26, on Women's Equality Day, that the group achieved a measure of prominence when it picketed outside of St. Patrick's Cathedral. In what was termed “consciousness‐raising exercise.” members of the group handed out leaflets in protest of a prescribed mass reading that says in part, “Wives should be submissive to their husbands as to Christ . . . as the church submits to Christ, so wives should submit to their husbands in everything.” (Ephesians 5: 21–32). “Catholic women are oppressed more than any other women, with the possible exception of Orthodox Jews,” said Pat Fogarty McQuillan, a St. Joan's member as well as chairman of the Committee on Sexism in Religion of he New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women. “The one difference is in the home,” she added. “The Jewish woman is usually queen of the household; she has the last word. But in Membership figures for the St. Joan's International Alliance are never revealed, and Miss McGillicuddy would say only that the group was an an “autonomous, dues‐paying organization that has members in 24 states and 9 countries.” Wherever they are, the women like to think of themselves as “a thorn in the side of the hierarchy,” and Miss McGillicuddy proudly refers to herself as “a bishop baiter.” Archbishop Leo C. Byrne of St. Paul ‐ Minneapolis. “Catholic women are oppressed more than any other women, with the possible exception of Orthodox Jews.” Chairman of the bishops' Committee on Women in Church and Society, once referred to Miss McGillicuddy as “like a buzz saw.” Besides their protest outside of St. Patrick's, the women have been actively urging passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as conducting an intra‐church project called “Bundles for Bishops,” in which bishops throughout the country are mailed packets of feminist literature. Recently, the group started an Anti‐Defamation Committee, which collects what the women consider to be cases of “discrimination and degradation” suffered by Catholic women. These cases are reported in a column called the “HorrorScope” in St. Joan's quarterly publication, The Bulletin. Complaints filed in a recent “FlorrorScope” include the following: ¶A priest refused to allow the person elected by a religious instruction grotto to read the epistle at an authorized Youth Mass, because the group's choice was a girl. ¶ a meeting of religious teachers, a priest insulted a mother of four who had a degree in theology. “Dear,” he said, “we're discussing theology. Isn't there anything you can do in the kitchen?” “There has always been an antifemale bias among the clergy,” said Adona Maria Perreca, 25, a graduate student at the Bank Street College of Education. “They think of us as mothers raising babies, or else in convents that protect us from the elements and the evils of sex.” St. Joan's members are fond of quoting Galatians 3:28, which says: “There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor freeman; there is neither male nor female; you are all one in Christ Jesus.” Most of the members strongly believe that the Roman Catholic Church's Canon Law generally treats women like children; that the Encyclical Pacem in Terris of Pope John XXIII is their “manifesto,” and that celibacy should be an option for priests. Where St. Joan's members differ is on the issue of abortion. Some members are strong supporters of legalized abortion, while others hack the church's right‐tolife stance. For this reason, the group has no official policy on abortion. Although Pope Paul VI has said that a woman's essential role in life is to become mother, many St. Joan's members are reluctant to point a finger of blame at him. “There is a tendency to blame everything on Rome,” said Miss McGillicuddy, who also serves as St. Joan's observer at the United Nations. “Where we ought to he working is on the local level.” The subject of nuns drew ambivalent reactions from the five women. Although some nuns are members of St, Joan's, other members are critical of teaching nuns on the grounds that they are “unaware” of the “blatant sexism” in textbooks used in Roman Catholic schools. But no matter what the group is discussing, somehow the subject inevitably returns to women in the priesthood. “I have known a lot of young girls and older women who really felt they had vocation to the priesthood,” said Mrs. Walda Hess, 42, of Merrick, L. I., a theology student at Fordham University. “But they felt they would he laughed at and ridiculed if they tried to pursue their goal.” Still, many St. Joan's women seem to feel that women in the priesthood is lust a matter of time, and they point out that an estimated 10 per cent of male priests have defected from the priesthood in the last 10 years; that altar girls are now being used in parishes in Maine and upstate New York and elsewhere; and that women lectors are becoming more common in Roman Catholic churches. One lector, Mrs. Eileen Komuro, 59, gave her own version of the prescribed mass reading last Aug. 26. She told the worshippers at the Holy Child Jesus church in Richmond Hill, Queens, that women should love their husbands, rather than be submissive to them. St. Joan's women are also quick to point out that numerous Roman Catholic seminaries now admit women. And what would these women be called if they someday became priests? “Well, it certainly wouldn't be father,” Mrs. McQuillan said. “We prefer Reverend.”"
"Senate Votes Rise In Social Security, Cut in Tax for Poor",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/01/archives/senate-votes-rise-in-social-security-cut-in-tax-for-poor-senate.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 30—The Senate passed legislation tonight increasing Social Security benefits and, for the first time since the start of the program in 1936, casing somewhat the burden of Social Security taxes on low‐income families. The increase in benefits would amount to 7 per cent, effective as soon as the final version of the law is approved, plus an additional 4 per cent, effective next June. The provisions for relief of low‐income families would apply only to workers who have at least one child living in the same household, and only where the income of the parent or parents is less than $5,600. Rebates of Social Security taxes would amount to 10 per cent of the wages received by the parents or parent up to a total income of $4,000. After that point, the percentage would be reduced, until it reached zero at $5,600. The legislation, which contains many other changes in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, was passed in a substantially different version by Security at the age of 55, inof 60, as at present. ¶An individual could earn up to $3,000 a year and still receive Social Security benefits, and starting at the age of 70 could earn any amount without losing Social Security. ¶Medicare would be made to cover the costs of drugs for the treatment of chronic illness even when the patient was not hospitalized. ¶There would be an absolute prohibition against the paying for abortions under the Medicaid program of health insurance for the poor. There would be no exceptions whatever, such as abortions performed to save the life of the mother, under this amendment, which was sponsored by Senator James L. Buckley, ConservativeRepublican of New York, and adopted by voice vote. The demand for some relief from Social Security taxes for low income persons has been mounting in recent years as the tax has risen and as income taxes have been cut. Individuals and families with incomes at or below the poverty level have been removed completely from the income tax rolls under legislation passed in 1964 1969 and 1971. But the Social Security taxes paid by many such families have risen more than their income taxes have been cut. Many members of Congress wish to preserve the idea that social Security payments are a right—not a Government handout—because the recipient of Social Security retirement income has paid for it. Thus, there has been considerable opposition to relief from Social Security taxes for low‐income workers. The Senate's action marked the first time that either house of Congress had voted any such low‐income relief. It was not clear whether the provision, which would actually give back to some families more than they paid in Social Security taxes, would survive the conference committee. Before finally approving the Social Security bill, by a vote of 66 to 8, the Senate turned down another tax change. This was a modest taxreform proposal, which was defeated after oil industry representatives argued that it would increase the taxes they paid and thus worsen the current fuel shortage by discouraging development of new oil well. ‘Minimum Tax’ Controversy What the Senate rejected, by a 46‐to‐37 margin, was a proposed tightening of rules for the “minimum tax,” which is aimed at persons who have large amounts of income that is untaxed, or lightly taxed, under present law. The margin of defeat was considerably wider than the 49‐to‐47 vote by which the Senate rejected essentially the same proposal last June, before the energy shortage became a matter of widespread concern. Another amendment to the bill inspired by the fuel shortage would bar the export of oil drilling equipment to countries that restrict the sale of their to the United States. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, led the argument against adoption of the proposed tightening of the minimum tax, which was sponsored by Democratic Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Birch Bavh of Indiana, Edmund S. Muskte of Maine and Gaylord Nelsen of Wisconsin. The minimum tax, as now written, does not apply to an individual until the income he receives that is untaxed under various preferential provisions of the tax law exceeds the amount of tax he paid on his fully taxable income, plus $30,000. ‘A Strange Time’ ?? lowance, and of other preferences, by 10 per cent. Senator Bentsen argued that now was “a strange time, indeed, to start talking about increasing the tax on those persons who are trying to increase our supply of energy.” He also argued that the effeet of the amendment on the taxation of capital gains — to increase the maximum possible effective tax rate from 38.5 per ent to 42.35 per cent — would hurt an already depressed stock market. Senator Kennedy replied that there were many other reasons why the stock market was depressed, and observed, that a much larger increase in the capital gains tax went into effect in 1969 “and Wall Street didn't even blink.” Another of today's amendments, sponsored by Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York, would restore unemployment compensation benefits to tens of thousands of persons in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and about 20 other states. The Javits amendment would however, require Legislatures of each state to take action on the modified program of unemployment benefits before its citizens could receive them. Basically, the amendment changed the criteria for eligibility of a state for Federal assistance in the payment of unemployment beneifts for a period of 13 weeks beyond the basic 26 weeks. States would become eligible if unemployment among persons covered by the unemployment compensation program—known as “insured unemployment”—reached 4 per cent. The “trigger” has been 5 per cent. About 3.000 persons a week exhaust their unemployment benefits in New York State, and would be eligible for renewed benefits once the state's insured unemployment rate reaches 4 per cent, which it is expected to do about midJanuary."
G.O.P. Legislature Not Through Yet,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/gop-legislature-not-through-yet.html,"TRENTON — The 194th Legislature ostensibly ended its two‐year session on Thursday evening, when the Senate adjourned. However, there is still some life left in it. This is because when the Assembly quit last Monday night—and the Senate three days later—they did not adjourn irrevocably, or sine die. Rather, they left the door open to come back here to vote on pledging the state's moral credit behind the proposed financing of a sports complex in the Hackensack Meadowlands. The Senate voted for the pledge before it adjourned on Thursday, and the Assembly will be back here tomorrow to conduct a similar vote. Because the next Legislature will be controlled by overwhelming Democratic majorities in both houses, and because the Democratic Governor‐elect, Brendan T. Byrne, does not take office until Jan. 15, Governor Cahill and the outgoing Repuhlican majorities in both houses could conceivably still conduct more business right up to the morning of Jan. 8, or a few hours before the 195th Legislature takes office. Ever since the United States Supreme Court laid down its liberalized regulations dealing with abortion, there has been increasing pressure on the Legislature and the state administration to implement the new rules in New Jersey hospitals and other public agencies that nave been reluctant to comply. The latest breakthrough was reported last week, when Stephen Skillman, the first assistant State Attorney General, ruled that New Jersey must pay for abortions under its Medicaid programs. The amount of money involved to date is relatively small—$79,000—but it represents a significant development in forcing state agencies to facilitate abortions rather than impede them, as pro‐abortion groups charge the state has done. For example, the Department of Institutions and Agencies, which administers Medicaid programs in the state, has refused to pay for any abortions on the ground that such payments were legally questionable. However, Mr. Skillman's ruling has effectively removed those questions. The ruling still gives the state the option to limit the range of abortion services it will provide in the future. As for the $79,000, William J. Jones, the Medicaid director, said: “We're telling clients that we will pay and that their claims will be honored.” When the Federal Aviation Administration proposed constructing an airport in the Hudson County meadows for short‐take‐off‐and‐landing aircraft (STOL), nearby communities reacted with bitter opposition. Ultimately, the Assembly and Senate approved legislation, introduced by Hudson County Assemblymen, requiring approval by local referendum before any STOL port could he built. However, Governor Cahill vetoed the referendum measure last week, contending that such legislation could preclude the state's prerogatives of building an airport anywhere in the state. “Air transportation Is regarded by all planners as a necessary and integral part of a sound transportation system,” the Governor said in his veto message. While he declared that local interests should he protected, he also contended that the “best interests of the state” should not be “frustrated” by local interests. There are few legislators who believe that anything could have changed the record landslide defeat suffered by the Republican candidate for Governor, Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. One of them is Assemblyman Walter C. KeoghDwyer, a Sussex County Republican. While debating the merits of giving Mr. Byrne a $15,000 raise when he takes office next month, Mr. Keogh‐Dwyer told the Assembly last week: “If Charlie knew it was cooling, he just might have tried a little harder.” The Assembly approved the raise, and Mr. Byrne will receive it, making his new salary $65,000 a year. As for Mr. Sandman, he will still have to be content with his $42,500‐a‐year Congressional wages."
Church Removes Statue In Dispute Over Visions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/church-removes-statue-in-dispute-over-visions.html,"Roman Catholic authorities last week directed the removal of a statue of the Virgin Mary from a Queens churchyard in which a 50‐year‐old housewife said she has been receiving visions. Mrs. Veronica Lueken and her followers — some of whom came to the quiet neighborhood by chartered bus from as far away as Boston — had been conducting “vigils” at what they call the “shrine of Our Lady of the Roses” for the last two years. “It is one of the most perplexing problems of my priesthood,” said Msgr. J. Emmett McDonald, pastor of St. Robert Bellarmine Church, 56‐15 213th Street Bayside. “I visited Lourdes and Fatima for my 25th anniversary of ordination,” Monsignor McDonald said. “You're in between — wanting on one hand to promote devotion to Mary and on the other of stopping these demonstrations.” The statue was removed to an undisclosed location. As many as 300 of Mrs. Lueken's followers have gathered regularly around the statue on Sundays and on evenings before major church feast days, chanting the rosary during three‐hour pre‐midnight “vigils.” During the vigils Mrs. Lueken has told her followers of what she describes as messages received from the Virgin Mary warning against “modernism” and humanism, urging penance and sacrifice and predicting dire happenings to New York because of the increased number of abortions under the state's liberalized abortion laws. Early this year the Diocese of Brooklyn appointed four priests, including Monsignor McDonald, to a committee to investigate the matter. The committee concluded that “no supernatural significance could be attached to these assemblies and the reports of miracles.” “We have read her many materials and we have talked to her,” Monsignor McDonald said of Mrs. Lueken. “We have talked to members of her group. I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing supernatural about the claimed apparitions. “Our neighborhood has been inconvenienced and streets blocked,” Monsignor McDonald said. “Some who come are infirm and elderly. We think these people are being deluded. They come with great hopes of miracles and cures.” In recent weeks a diocesan official, the Rev. Vincent J. Powell, read a letter declaring the churchyard “out of bounds for devotional use” to the followers of Mrs. Lueken during three of their “vigils.” The second and third times, Father Powell said, “They just prayed the rosary as I read the letter.” Diocesan officials then wrote Monsignor McDonald a letter instructing him that “the only means left at our disposal is to direct that the statue of Our Lady be removed from church grounds at least until these people can be convinced that they must not assemble there.” The parish council of St. Robert Bellarmine then voted 21 to 1 to have the statue removed, and it was taken away Thursday afternoon. At some future date, Monsignor McDonald said, it may be returned. Mrs. Lueken, who lives at 226‐15 69th Avenue, Bayside, declined to see a reporter because she was “too ill.” A woman answering the door of her apartment refused to answer questions. Followers of Mrs. Lueken, who is known to them as Veronica, are adamant in their belief that she has supernatural powers. “I believe it,” said Mrs. Mary Genussi of Douglaston as she sat quietly in her car saying the rosary near the statue shortly before it was taken away. “This is the place the Blessed Mother chose to bring her people together. She asked Veronica to do this.” The approach of church officials to the situation, according to Msgr. Charles E. Diviney, Vicar General of the Brooklyn Diocese, is that “if it is a genuine manifestation from God, the truth will come out.”"
Abortion Rate in Canada Increases Sharply in '72,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/abortion-rate-in-canada-increases-sharply-in-72.html,"OTTAWA, Dec. 1 (Canadian Press)—Abortions performed on Canadians increased sharply in 1972 to 38,905, from 30,923 in 1971, the Government's Bureau of Statistics reported. The number of abortions represented 11.2 per cent of the live births, compared with 8.6 per cent of live births in 1971. About 6,000 of the abortions were performed in New York State. The abortion rate tended to be highest in the Western provinces, with a total equivalent to 24 per cent of live births in British Columbia, and lower in the East, the rate in Nova Scotia being 6 per cent. The Bureau of Statistics reported that only one mother died as a result of a therapeutic abortion in 1972, compared with six in 1971. It also reported a decline in the number of live births for 1972. There were 347,319, compared with 362,187 in 1974. Illegitimate births also declined to 31,257 in‐1972, from 32.693 in 1971."
BLACK FEMINISTS HOLD PARLEY HERE,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/black-feminists-hold-parley-here-a-nonpriority-cited-curiosity-drew.html,"Black women from across the country — professionals, bluecollar workers, mothers, housewives and students—attended the first black women's liberation conference here yesterday. “Five years ago,” said Mrs. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's Commissioner of Human Rights, “you couldn't have gotten five women to come here. They would have been too embarrassed.” But now, Mrs. Norton said, many women have overcome their fear of appearing divisive by isolating their own needs and goals from the black‐liberation movement and have “stopped being closet feminists.” The three‐day conference, sponsored by the National Black Feminist Organization, began Friday night and is to end Ibis evening. It is being held at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. Some of the women were leaders in their communities, but many of the 300 attending yesterday had first learned about the conference from newspapers or from a friend. “I came because I had a need lo come,” a secretary said. “There was a time when we really cared what black men thought about us, but that no longer matters. We have to do for ourselves.” Curiosity Drew Student Linda Linsey, a student at Sarah Lawrence College, said she was attending out of curiosity but planned to join the National Black Feminists. “I am so full of black women now—I am so happy,” Mrs. Linsey said, adding that at college she was studying a course that “deals only with the images of white women in American culture.” Evelyn Speed said she was happy to hear about the National Black Feminists because she had often been told that joining the white women's liberation movement was “putting down the black movement.” Workshops dealt with such subjects as “black feminists and the labor force,” “sex‐role stereotyping and the black child” and “black women as consumers.” “We are not hung up on Ms., Mt. or Mz.—on labels,” said Representative Shirley Chisholm, Democrat of Brooklyn, who was the main speaker before the women went to the workshops. Mrs, Norton bad introduced Mrs, Chisholm as one black woman who had never been afraid and who had been “a lonely persevering model for all of us.” A Non‐Priority Cited Mrs. Chisholm, who has maintained that sex discrimination has been more detrimental to her career than racial discrimination, said one matter hat was not a priority was “walking up and down in front of a cocktail lounge demanding to be allowed in for two hours a day.” “This,” she said, “is a white middle‐class woman's concern.” In the workshop led by Mrs. Norton, women crowded into the room to discuss abortion, day care and jobs. Mrs. Norton said she believed that the national day‐care bill would not have been vetoed by President Nixon if black women, civilrights groups and white women's rights group had put pressure on Washington. When some of the women expressed doubts about being ?? with the white women's ?? movement, because they thought it “frivolous” or believed that white women had contributed to discrimination toward blacks, Mrs. ?? ?? them and said black women would have to ?? a coalition with white women's groups and with other organizations to get any key legislation passed."
Two Office Buildings Damaged in Explosions,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/04/archives/two-office-buildings-damaged-in-explosions.html,"Two separate explosions and fires damaged two Manhattan office buildings last night, one blast slightly injuring two staff workers of the United States Committee for Justice for Latin American Political Prisoners at 150 Fifth Avenue. The committee shared a third‐floor office in Room 311 with several other political groups, including the Women's National Abortion Council and the Committee for Democratic Election Laws. The blast was caused by a “relatively large explosive device,” said Capt. James Horan of the Ninth Precinct. He declined to comment on possible motives for the bombing, which sent a shower of broken glass from a third‐floor window of the seven‐story building onto 21st Street. Later, a member of the bomb squad on his way to investigate the explosion was killed when the car he was driving struck an abutment on the overpass to the East River Drive at Coenties Slip. He was identified as Officer Vincent Connolly. The two injured workers were identified by the police as Caleb Murdock, 23 years old of 2643 Broadway, and Karen Clahassey, 21, of 228 West 71st Street. They were treated at Columbus Hospital for multiple cuts and bruises. The explosion occurred within 20 minutes of a smaller blast and fire in a sixth‐floor office of a building at 1472 Broadway, at 42d Street, No one was injured in the earlier blast. The Broadway office, which was slightly damaged, was occupied by Turkish American Associates, Inc., an importexport concern. Three building employes told fire marshals that they had smelled gasoline fumes near the door of the office just before the blast. The police said the two incidents appeared unrelated."
Paternalism for the Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/05/archives/paternalism-for-the-poor.html,"That special solicitude the defenders of free choice on Capitol Hill keep showing fur the poor was in evidence last week when the Senate whooped through an anti‐abortion rider to the bill liberalizing Social Security benefits. On motion of Senator Buckley of New York, normally a vehement objector to all forms of governmental mandate over personal or family decision‐making, the bill was amended to establish an absolute ban on any payments for abortions under Medicaid. Even if physicians find such an operation necessary to save the life of the mother, no Medicaid money can be spent to pay for Since Medicaid is restricted to people at or close the poverty level, enactment into law of the Senate measure would mean the birth of thousands of unwanted children, most of them to gruw up on welfare or in institutions for foundlings. Women with means would, as always, encounter little difficulty in having abortions. Unless House‐Senate conferees have sufficient responsibility to knock out the no‐abortion amendment, that choice will be denied mothers too poor to pay."
Southern Conservatives Form National Presbyterian Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/06/archives/southern-conservatives-form-national-presbyterian-church.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec. 5 — Conservatives within the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. founded a new denomination today and named in the National Presbyterian Church. The conservatives, holding their first general assembly here Tuesday through Friday, consist of 75,000 worshipers from 275 churches in 14 Southern and Border states. They elected a leader, Jack Williamson of Greenville, Ala., a lawyer, by acclamation. He had been temporary presiding officer. At last night's meeting, Mr. Williamson said, “Today we raise a fresh, clear banner of the truth of our living Lord Jesus Christ before this watching world.” The 338 delegates, all of them men and all but one white, met at Briarwood Presbyterian Church in Mountain Brook, a Birmingham suburb. Mr. Williamson said the new denomination “shall stand out distinctive in contrast to many false religious societies which bear Christ's name.” The conservatives contended that the one‐million member Presbyterian Church in the U.S., from which they split, has strayed from the scriptures by taking liberal positions on social issues such as abortion, divorce, and women's place in the church. “It has been heart rending” to separate from the church, Mr. Williamson said. Separation from foes is not easy, he said, but separation from fellow Christians is traumatic. The conservatives decided at an Atlanta meeting last May to break away from the church. It marked the most decisive split in three decades of squabbling. The conservatives believe in the authority of the Bible and the Virgin birth and consider the Westminster Confession of 1648 as the authoritative guide to interpretation of the scripture. They oppose the likely merger of the Presbyterian in the U.S., which operates in Southern and Border states, with the Northern and more liberal United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. Congregations represented in the new church are from Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Arkansas, Texas, Kentucky and Louisiana. To a degree, the conservasion of a super‐church, which would include many Protestant denominations, would lead to a church government built around bishops. They felt this tives feared an ongoing discuswould be unacceptable and would lead to a lessening of local congregational authority."
CITY BLACKS GET MOST ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/06/archives/city-blacks-get-most-abortions-lead-with-476-though-whites.html,"More black women residents here than white received abortions in the year ended June 30 1973, although the 1970 Census figures indicate that there are twice as many white women of child‐bearing age as black. During the 1972–73 period black women had 47.6 per cent of 69,776 abortions by city residents and white women had 39 per cent, according to Dr. Jean Pakter, director of maternity services and family planning for the Department of Health. In 1970–71 white women city residents had 47.2 per cent of the abortions and blacks 42.8, and in. 1971–72 blacks began to lead in abortions, with 46.6 per cent to white women's 41.9 per cent. The Poor Accommodated Although black women, as a group, remained relatively unheard from in 1970 during the fight for the state's liberalized abortion law—their needs and wishes obscured by the more vocal advocacy of the primarily white women's rights movement—black women are now taking advantage of abortions in greater numbers for many sociological and economic reasons. In the view of Dr. Pakter and Eleanor Holmes Norton, head of the city's Commission on Human Rights, the availability of safe, legal and relatively low‐cost abortions for everyone in the city is a factor in the steadily increasing number of black women seeking abortions. Before the legalization of abortion in the state, black women who could not afford to pay for safe abortions, either had their babies or resorted to dangerous, low‐cost illegal abortions. Formerly, according to Dr. Pakter, city hospitals reported a “high” incidence of black and Puerto Rican women receiving treatment for poorly performed and incomplete abortions. Now, with 42 per cent of all abortions paid for by Medicaid, Dr. Pakter said, very few black women are admitted for unsuccessful abortions. Likened to “Genocide” Traditional community and black male resistance to abortion are other factors that have kept black women from seeking abortions. When the abortion clinic opened at Harlem Hospital, according to Mrs. Judith Reed, the head nurse there, “we were met with opposition from the community and from individual black men.” “The militant movement was pretty strong, and they thought it was genocide,” Mrs. Reed explained. Some black men, she went on, objected to abortion, and also family planning, because “it was like taking away from them what was produc tive and vital—something they, and they alone, could control.” However, Mrs. Reed said, black women began to go to the clinic after they were introduced to family‐planning counseling, which they received after the termination of any pregnancy. Now 20,000 women a year receive family‐planning counseling at Harlem Hospital, the head nurse said. Although the women's liberation movement does not have major support from black women, Mrs. Reed said, it did help change black women's attitudes toward abortion. “We get a lot of younger women who feel no guilt at all about receiving an abortion,” Mrs. Reed said. As one black woman put it recently at the first conference of the Black Feminist Organization: “We are now making our own decision. If a black woman decides to have an abortion, how is it genocide? It's only genocidal if you are forced.” Many young, black single girls are having abortions at Kings County Hospital, and they are encouraged to do so by their mothers, according to the supervisor of the Brooklyn clinic, Jean Morello. “These are women who had to raise large families all by themselves, and they don't want that to happen to their daughters,” Miss Morello said. Proportionately more black women appear to get pregnant more often than white women. This has been traditionally true, because whites had access to a better contraceptive education and used contraceptives more consistently. However, said Dr. Pakter, the fertility rate of black women has begun to decline with family‐planning counseling. “They have a way to go, be cause the fertility rate was so disproporationately higher to begin with,” Dr. Pakter said."
Poujadism in Denmark,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/06/archives/poujadism-in-denmark.html,"Denmark's election has confirmed a strong trend against the once‐dominant Social Democrats in Scandinavia, but it has also turned up a disturbing tendency by voters to endorse the quack doctrines once hawked in France by Pierre Poujade. The over‐all result is a badly fragmented Parliament, which will make effective government exceedingly difficult and prospects for the near future as cloudy as those in Norway and Sweden. As the Norwegians and Swedes had done in September elections, the Danes rebelled in great numbers against the high taxes required by one of the most pervasive social security and welfare systems in the world. They rebelled so mindlessly as to elect 28 candidates of the Progress party, led by the cynical Copenhagen lawyer, Mogens Glistrup, a millionaire who boasts that he pays no income tax and advocates its abolition. Thus in their very first election, the Progressives (a misnomer if ever there was one) have emerged as the second strongest party in the Folketing, with no responsibility but enormous scope for mischief and obstruction—whether the next coalition is headed by the greatly weakened Social Democrats, who have led most governments for half a century, or one of the three non‐Socialist parties which governed together in a 1968–71 interlude. A coalition of four parties at minimum will be required for a majority in a Folketing of 179 members. Premier Anker Jorgensen has resigned but his Social Democrats, still the largest party despite the loss of a third of its seats, will probably be given first chance to form a new Government. However, its left‐wing partner, the Socialist People's party, also lost heavily, and it will be difficult to secure the cooperation of the new Center Democratic party, made up of Social Democratic defectors. A tide was running against sitting politicians, for all five parties represented in the last Folketing lost ground. Among the ten parties in the new Parliament will be the Communists, with six seats, and the new Christian party, which won seven with its campaign against abortion and pornography. Denmark, up to now one of Europe's strongest democracies, seems headed for a period of shifting alliances and unwonted political instability."
"Osmond Fraenkel, Patron of Liberties, to Be Honored",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/07/archives/osmond-fraenkel-patron-of-liberties-to-be-honored.html,"Osmond K. Fraenkel, who is being honored tonight on his 85th birthday, is a man deeply committed to his pleasures. These include bicycling, swimming in the nude, driving] his Chrysler convertible very fast, eating foods with a high cholesterol content (a lunch of chocolate ice cream for the last 40 years), not owning an overcoat, collecting first editions and fighting and arguing; for civil liberties. It is because of this last pursuit, followed with the same happy gusto as all the others, that the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union are giving the party, at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel, Mr. Fraenkel has served both organizations as general counsel for 36 years. The list of Mr. Fraenkel's causes and clients in these years reads like a syllabus for a course in contemporary American social history. They involved labor unions, racial, issues, academic freedom, they draft, abortion and censorship. There was a book he wrote in 1924 about the Sacco‐Vanzetti case. There was his central role in the defense of the so‐called Scottsboro Boys, the nine black defendants accused in 1935 of having raped white woman in Alabama. There was the unsuccessful appeal of the ruling in which Bertrand Russell was denied the right to teach at City College because of his sexual beliefs, in 1940. There was the case of David Miller, the first of the draftcard burners at the time of the war in Vietnam, and there were briefs arguing that the protection of free speech extended even to Nazis, Communists and Henry Ford, whose right to address his workers was once advanced in court by Mr. Fraenkel. “I guess I have always believed that people should do whatever they wanted to do as long as they didn't hurt anyone else,” said the stocky man, who is described by one of his daughters as looking like “a cross between a Roman Senator and a vagrant.” Among his private clients have been Frank Costello, the late gambler once known as the “prime minister of the underwold,” Harry Bridges, the West Coast longshoremen's union official, and Jerry Catena, the New Jersey Mafia overlord. He said he has enjoyed all aspects of the lawyers life. “I like the structure. I like the research, even the accounting work, which I do myself,” he said. But the greatest rewards have come from the civil liberties work for which he has never been paid. “There you can see continuity,” he said. “For instance,” he added, “back before Roosevelt tried to pack the Court, the Supreme Court was protecting the liberties of business and not peopie.” He sketched out the advances that had come with the appointments of Felix Frankfurter and Hugo Black to the Supreme Court, and later the Warren Court. “Now, with the Nixon court, there is a mild trend the other way,” he said with a Sam Ervin twitch of his bushy eyebrows. “Liberties are being whittled here and there. In any period of crisis, civil liberties are threatened. If we are going to have an economic depression there might be some deterioration. But I'm not a pessimist.” What Mr. Fraenkel said he loved best about the lawyers work was the argument Twenty‐six times he has appeared before the Supreme Court, always without notes. “If you know what you're going to say, why do you need notes,” he explained. “I love the unexpected question from the bench and the intellectual exercise of court.” His Supreme Court record compromises 13 victories and 12 losses, with the decision ‘on his latest case still pending. In that one, he argued the right of a citizen to sue the Central Intelligence Agency to force public disclosure of its finances.

"Two of His Many Clients Honor Fraenkel, a Patron of Liberties",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/07/archives/two-of-his-many-clients-honor-fraenkel-a-patron-of-liberties.html,"Osmond K. Fraenkel, who is being honored tonight on his 85th birthday, is a man deeply committed to his pleasures. These include bicycling, swimming in the nude, driving his Chrysler convertible very fast, eating foods with a high cholesterol content (a lunch of chocolate ice cream for the last 40 years), not owning an overcoat, collecting first editions and fighting and arguing for civil liberties. It is because of this last pursuit, followed with the same happy gusto as all the others, that the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union are giving the party, at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel Mr Fraenkel has served both organizations as general counsel for 36 years. The list of Mr. Fraenkel's causes and clients in these years reads like a syllabus for a course in contemporary American social history. They involved labor unions, racial issues, academic freedom, the draft, abortion and censorship. There was a book he wrote in 1924 about the Sacco‐Vanzetti case. There was his central role in the defense of the so‐called Scottsboro Boys, the nine black defendants accused in 1935 of having raped white woman in Alabama. There was the unsuccessful appeal of the ruling in which Bertrand Russell was denied the right to teach at City College because of his sexual beliefs, in 1940. There was the case of David Miller, the first of the draftcard burners at the time of the war in Vietnam, and there were briefs arguing that the protection of free speech extended even to Nazis, Communists and Henry Ford, whose right to address his workers was once advanced in court by. Mr. Fraenkel. “I guess I have always believed that people should do whatever they wanted to do as long as they didn't hurt anyone else,” said the stocky man, who is described by one of his daughters as looking like “a cross between a Roman Senator and a vagrant.” “I like the structure. I like the research, even the accounting work, which I do myself,” he said. But the greatest rewards have come from the civil liberties work for which he has never been paid. “There you can see continuity,” he said. “For instance,” he added, “back before Roosevelt tried to pack ‘the Court, the Supreme Court was protecting the liberties of business and not people.” He sketched out the advances that had come with the ap pointments of Felix Frankfurter and Hugo Black to the Supreme Court, and later the Warren Court. “Now, with the Nixon court, there is a mild trend the other way,” he said with a Sam Ervin twitch of his bushy eyebrows. “Liberties are being whittled here and there. In any period of crisis, civil liberties are threatened. If we are going to have an economic depression there might be some deterioration. But I'm not a pessimist.” What Mr. Fraenkel said he loved best about the lawyers work was the argument Twen ty‐six times he has appeared before the Supreme Court, always without notes.

Infanticide in Japan: Sign of the Times?,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/08/archives/infanticide-in-japan-sign-of-the-times-daughters-spared.html,"TOKYO—The body of the newborn baby was found in a coin locker at the Ueno railway station here. It was wrapped in a bath towel and stuffed into a paper bag. A note attached to the package read: “Gomen nasai, honto ni gomen nasau” (“I'm sorry, I really am sorry.”). A few days later, another decomposed body of a newborn baby was discovered in the Osaka railway station. In 1970, there were only two such “coin locker incidents,” as they have come to be known, three the following year and eight in 1972. But this year the number has increased drastically—an average of once every 10 days. Moreover, they are only one part of a much larger wave of killing babies or abandoning children in this country. In all, more than 100 babies have been killed this year. In addition, in Tokyo alone there were 119 cases of children being deserted last year. The rate has continued this year. Daughters Spared In Japan, the killing of babies has a history of more than 1,000 years. It became prevalent during the feudal Edo era (1603‐1868) as a means of population control. Farmers killed their second or third sons upon birth in what was called “mabiki,” an agricultural term that originally meant “thinning out.” Usually, the daughters were spared because they could be married off, sold as servants or prostitutes, or sent off to become geisha, or professional entertainers. But in northern Japan alone, between 60,000 and 70,000 cases of mabiki were recorded each year. When Japan began to modernize in the latter third of the 19th century, mabiki was prohibited by law. Moreover, Japan's leaders encouraged population growth as both industry and the armed forces expanded. But after the devastation of World War II, infanticide reappeared, hitting a peak in 1948, when 399 cases were recorded, then decreasing to its lowest point in 1958, when 114 cases were recorded. It then began to rise and has leveled off at about 175 cases a year. Though Infanticide is not increasing at the moment, the patterns, motives and meaning have changed signiticantly. Japan's liberal abortion laws and widespread use of contraceptives (Except the pill, which is illegal here) make population control no longer the cause of infanticide. Many experts attribute contemporary infanticide and child desertions In Japan to rapid urbanization and a resultant drastic shift from the traditional extended family to the nuclear family. A recent government survey shows that 65 per cent of the families in Japan today are nuclear families, and a report on infanticide published this year by the Criminal Sience Club of Chuo University here indicates that eight out of ten infanticides today occur in nuclear families. Hidemi Kamata, who did the main research in the Chuo study, said that “contrary to the widespread notion that babies are killed either by promiscuous married women or cruel stepmothers, they are in many cases victims of their real mothers in nuclear families.” Dr. Takemitsu Henmi of Tokyo University's mental health department said that “as the size of a family gets smaller, there appear many young mothers who lose confidence in their ability to raise children.” His colleague, Eiko Kurisu, explained that a survey of mothers in Tokyo with children from 1 to 3 years old showed that most of them were “overly concerned about comparing their own children with others.” The Chuo University report also concluded that infanticide is likely to occur in a closed family,” where the mother has to spend a lot of time with her baby—without the presence of a third person who might prevent the tragedy. More than half the deaths were attributed to the mother's lack of mental maturity —or, as Dr. Takeo Doi, a psychiatrist at Tokyo University, put it, “the increase in the number of childish parents.” Dr. Doi, who has had clinical experience in both Japan and the United States, is the author of “The Anatomy of Dependence,” an incisive study of personal relations among Japanese. He said the relationship between mother and child in Japan is traditionally very symbiotic. “She (the mother) regards her child as her possession instead of an independent personality, so she feels free to decide the fate of her own child,” he explained in noting that in Japan the infants are more apt to be killed or deserted whereas, in the United States he said parental abuse is more likely. A joint study last year by psychologists in Waseda University in Tokyo and Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. takes a similar view. Women in Tokyo are “far less often involved in assault cases” than women in New York, the study found, but are “twice as many times involved in homicides.” Many of their victims, the study added, were their own infants."
What Has the Court Saved Us From?,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/09/archives/what-has-the-court-saved-us-from-what-has-the-court-saved-us-from.html,"A SURPRISING number of intelligent people have defended the June 21 Supreme Court ruling on obscenity by insisting that it was aimed solely at hard‐core pornographers, and will have no effect on serious artists. Observers who hold this misguided view obviously know little Or nothing about movies. The fact is that hard‐core films will barely be touched by the Supreme Court decision. Since these films are made on very low budgets and can recoup their costs in just a few major cities, they will continue to be produced. Far from being harmed, porno films may even get a boost from the Court ruling. Just as Prohibition put rotgut whiskey at a premium, the Court's obscenity decision will give the sleaziest porno movies an added glamour by forcing them underground. • Serious filmmakers, on the other hand, have been and will continue to be profoundly affected by the Court decision. The ban of “Carnal Knowledge” in Albany, Georgia—a ban upheld by the Georgia State Supreme Court‐‐makes it clear that all filmmakers are potential targets of Justice Burger's ruling, which allows local communities to set their own standards for defining obscenity. The movie industry has got the message. Projects have already been cancelled or altered in the light of the Court decision, and any mildly provocative films going into production are kept under close scrutiny. A few specific examples: Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel “Last Exit to Brooklyn” was to be filmed by Arthur Hiller and financed by a major studio. Intimidated by the Supreme Court decision, the studio backed out. “Cruising,” Gerald Walker's novel about a homosexual killer, had been purchased by Philip D'Antoni (producer of “The French Connection”). After the Court ruling, D'Antoni decided to drop the option. Barry Weitz, D'Antoni's partner, recently said, “Is this the time to do a very strong film like ‘Cruising’? We didn't feel that it was. ‘Cruising’ is one of the best thrillers I have ever read, but it's too much of a risk to put a year into a film and then find that it cannot be shown in all 50 states.” * Martin Scorsese, the director of “Mean Streets,” received a disturbing memo from one studio flunkey in regard, to his new movie “Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,” which begins shooting early next year: “In view of the new Supreme Court ruling on obscenity, and the networks' increasing sensitivity to excessive sex, violence and language, we should cover ourselves with additional lines and/or protection shots wherever necessary... I wish you wouldmake sure that we are protected with alternatives to the objectionable areas.” Enclosed was a five‐page list of pointers on how to shoot various scenes and rewrite various lines of dialogue. One choice admonition read, “Love scenes must show ‘taste’ and not show lovers.” It is now standard practice for directors to be required to shoot two versions of any questionable scenes or lines—one for the major cities, the other for Albany, Georgia (and maybe Albany, New York, by next week) and CBS‐TV. Producers and studio executives freely admit that the Court decision has had an inhibiting effect on their choice of material. Universal's vice president Ned Tanen states flatly: “Anyone who tells you he is not thinking about censorship is not telling the truth. Yes, the Supreme Court decision has an effect when I consider a script. There have been a couple of scripts that I have already shied away from because of the ruling.” Larry Gordon, formerly vice president with American International Pictures and now a producer with Columbia, confirms the devastating impact of the ruling: “The Court decision has had a tremendous effect on my reactions to scripts. There's a spectacular project I'm considering now, a very commercial property which isn't even an X movie. But I am very concerned about the Supreme Court. I am negotiating now on the price. I would have been willing to spend a lot more on it if it had not been for the Supreme Court decision. Now if I can't get it for the price I want, it just isn't worth the risk. I don't know anyone in the industry who isn't being hurt by the Court decision.” Even if the Supreme Court finally rules that a film banned in Iowa or Georgia does have redeeming “literdry, artistic, political, or scientific value,” the fear of a long, expensive court fight is enough to discourage investors. Steve Krantz, the producer of “Fritz the Cat,” “Heavy Traffic,” and the cancelled “Last Exit to Brooklyn,” explains: “Elements of human behavior, whether verbal or physical, which refleet adult look at life ... will be eliminated by the chicken‐hearted concern about what the local censors will do in Albany, Georgia. They may do absolutely nothing in Albany, Georgia, about that film currently being contemplated, but the safe call will be: ‘Why take a chance?’” * Robert Altman, director of “M*A*S*H” and “The Long Goodbye,” testifies to the subtle internal pressures every director faces: “The panic canapos;t help having an effect on you. I was just reading a script that has a sexual scene with a young man and a prostitute—a comic scene. And without even wanting to, I found myself thinking, ‘This is going to be a problem. How am I going to do it? Is it really necessary?’ Of course itapos;s necessary, and it should be done in a very explicit, funny way. But if I do it that way, I donapos;t know if it can be shown.” The self‐censorship that Altman describes may be more insidious than any government censorship. Some films that were in the works and nearing completion before the Supreme Court decision now have an uncertain future. The biggest question mark concerns “The Exorcist,” which is rumored to have cost over $10‐million. Director William Friedkin reports that he has not been pressured to change the film (which recently received an R rating), but he admits that some Warner Brothers executives are concerned about how widely it can be shown. “They feel it could run into problems in some areas, and I think it probably will,” Friedlun confesses. “They have no plans right now to ??old it back from any cities, but they're opening it in about 20 big cities first so that they can gauge the reactions. I think ‘The Exorcist’ will be a bellwether. If it wins a wide audience, that may give the studios courage to handle more ambitious themes with more graphic scenes. If we run into a lot of problems, then there will be an enormous retrenchment.” The full impact of the Court ruling may not be felt for several more months, but one suspects that the Supreme Court intended to intimidate serious filmmakers along with porno filmmakers. It is revealing that in giving an example of material that might be considered to have “serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,” Justice Burger did not mention classic novels or films or paintings, but only cited “medical books for the education of physicians and related personnel (that) necessarily use graphic illustrations and descriptions of human anatomy.” AIP's president Samuel Arkoff, one of the most astute and outspoken of Hollywocrt studio heads, recently told a conference of exhibitors: “Fundamentally, the enemies of free expression are more interested in stifling the important controversial pictures than they are the small, unimportant film . . .The irony is that porno films made on a shoestring will survive because they are so cheaply produced and can earn back their limited cost in a few big cities ...But the serious pictures made on the scale of ‘Carnal Knowledge’ cannot recoup their costs by playing a handful of cities or illicit movie speakeasies throughout the country. These serious, controversial, costly pictures will simply not be pro duced, or if produced, will be so compromised that they will be pap.” Throughout its history the movie, industry has responded to real and imagined censorship threats by censoring itself—with its own voluntary system of “self‐regulation.” Today the Rating Board of the Motion Picture Association of America regulates film content and enforces the obscenity decision for Justice Burger. Studios ask the board to predict any possible Iocal censorship problems and counsel them on how to shape and cut their films for the most conservative areas. In addition, the ratings aid and encourage local censors. The X rating in particular helps community censors to choose their targets; it is an open invitation to vigilante squads. (The X rating is also an aid to newspapers that want to ban movie advertising. Even a new paper as sophisticated as The Los Angeles Times now segregates its advertising for all X‐rated movies; the ads for seriously intended works like “Heavy Traffic” and “Le Sex Shop” are buried beneath as for “Massage Parlor '73” in a separate “adult film” column.) The studios had always been reluctant to accept an X rating; since the Supreme Court decision, they categorically refuse to make anything stronger than an R. “I don't know of a single director who hasn't been told not to make an X film,” Ralph Bakshi (“Heavy Traffic”) reports. This means that the power of the Rating Board is greater than ever. Any film threatened with an X rating will automatically be cut. The drones at the rating office have been cheerfully snipping away under the direction of their master, Dr. Aaron Stern, the industry's resident shrink, who recently announced that he will be leaving the board to become an executive with Columbia Pictures. For example, Nicolas Roeg's “Don't Look Now,” which opens today at the Sutton, was originally rated X because of one startling and beautiful love scene between Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland. In England, where the film is playing intact, one critic said the scene was “destined to become a classic” and called it “the most sensuous and disturbing erotic sequence since Resnais' ‘Hiroshima Mon Amour.’” American audiences will not see precisely the same scene; to win an R rating it has been re‐edited (substituting less graphic footage) according to the specific instructions dictated by chief censor Stern. MPAA president Jack Valenti used to defend the rating system by promising that it would prevent government censorship. Now that government censorship is a reality, what purpose does the rating system serve? Robert Altman, who believes that the rating system should be abolished, asserts: “The rating system actually spawned the acceptance of censorship.” * The MPAA has recently made its own position clear by proposing “model” obscenity laws meant to isolate hard‐coré pornography. The trouble is that laws aimed at pornography invariably affect other films as well. Once serious filmmakers are compelled to accept the arbitrary limits set by legislators or judges, their sexual scenes will all begin to look alike, and decency groups will be justified in asking if the scenes are really necessary. Erotic art, like all art, can be imaginative and original only if artists are free to experiment without restraints. Artistic freedom is simply incompatible with “model” obscenity legislation; there can be no compromise with the First Amendment. The position of the MPAA has been denounced by the American Library Association and the American Booksellers Association, along with the Directors Guild of America, the only group in the film industry that has openly challenged the Supreme Court ruling. Guild president Robert Wise recently declared, “We do not defend the content of porno films, but we do defend the right of filmmakers to produce them and the right of consenting adults to see whatever they choose.” And Stanley Fleishman, one of the country's leading anti‐censorship lawyers, attacks the MPAA position as “an opportunistic, unprincipled position. I think Valenti is dead wrong. The public is ready for laws that say adults should be their own censors. Adults don't want other people setting limits for them and telling them what they can see” In Los Angeles alone, Fleishman points out, over 500,000 people have paid to see “Deep Throat.” It is becoming more and more difficult for prosecutors to win obscenity convictions from local juries. A Los Angeles jury trying “Deep Throat” split 9‐3 in favor of acquittal. In Houston the case against “Deep Throat” also ended with a hung jury. And in the presumably conservative city of Lubbock, Texas, a jury recently cleared “Last Tango in Paris”—to the shock of the local district attorney. The moviegoing audience clearly wants to see more provocative and candid films. “Yet the Supreme Court has insured that sexually explicit motion pictures of better quality will not be made,” Stanley Fleishman comments. “I know many prominent filmmakers, including some Academy Award‐winning directors, who wanted to do films with explicit sexual scenes. Now they will not take the chance. I think all of society would have benefitted from those films. But when society says sex is dirt, the sexual films we get will be dirty films. And it is interesting that Burger's Law and Order Court has encouraged a great deal more lawlessness. Now that sex films have been declared unlawful, the non‐law‐abiding elements in society will take chances that legitimate businessmen canot take.” * In Hollywood films, violence will take the place of sex. Countries, like Italy, that have strict censorship of sexual material begin to specialize in sadism—often with distinct sexual overtones. Stuart Millar, producer of “Little Big Man” and director‐producer of “When the Legends Die,” says, “The Supreme Court ruling is an open invitation to the movie business to go even further into what I consider the real pornography, the pornography of violence.” The industry rating system continues to reward very brutal films with a benign PG rating. On the other hand, Robert Altman's new movie, “Thieves Like Us,” a gangster film with almost no violence on screen, has been rated R for one brief flash of nudity in a bathing scene. “The first thing every human being looks for is a nipple,” a baffled Altman comments. “It's the way we get fed. And to say you can't show that to kids is the most absurd thing I've ever heard” Aside from violence, American movies will probably continue to focus on bland stories of male camaraderie, in the style of “Scarecrow,” “The Sting,” and “Papillon.” Stuart Millar suggests, “My hunch is that the Hollywood censors and studio bosses have never been interested in women and have always been uncomfortable with sex. That is why they have not really protested the Supreme Court decision. The studio heads are now more open in admitting that what they really want are love stories between men.” Is there any hope of overturning or nullifying the Court decision? Stanley Fleishman says: “The states are still permitted to pass less restrictive laws, laws granting complete freedom to adults to see what they choose, and there should be an all‐out effort to get consenting adult laws through the state legislatures.” In California, a group called Freedom of Choice is working to put this type of anticensorship measure on the ballot in 1974. The measure includes protection for minors and guarantees that sexual material will not be thrust upon unwilling adults, but it would eliminate all censorship for consenting adults—the same position advocated by the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography three years ago. The battle is just beginning, as Robert Wise emphasizes: “It will be a long battle, possibly lasting several years.” In his decision, Justice Burger wrote, “There is no evidence, empirical or historical, that the stern 19th‐century American censorship of public distribution and dis, play of material relating to sex in any way limited or affected expression of serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific ideas.” But today, when traditional attitudes toward male and female roles, marriage and family, are under attack, artists must confront and explore these social changes blasting the 19th‐century prohibitions that Burger wants to revive. The money that the industry now spends on its rating system could more profitably be spent challenging local censorship and mounting a nationwide informational campaign to educate the public about the issues at stake. Filmmakers might take a lesson from minority groups like the Right ‐ to ‐ Life movement, which is organizing a march on Washington to pressure Congress to adopt a Constitutional amendment overturning the Supreme Court decision on abortion. Why couldn't the liberal film community press for consenting adult statutes with the same vehemence? Artists may not be activists by temperament, but they can defend the value of their work more effectively than anyone else. They finally need to speak out in the political arena. The battle is long overdue."
Many Companies Revising Maternity Leave Policies,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/10/archives/many-companies-revising-maternity-leave-policies-concerns-revise.html,"Ever since the Federal Government decreed that pregnancy was not unlike a broken leg, many corporations have been struggling to revise their maternity leave policies. According to a survey just conducted by Prentice‐Hall with the American Society for Personnel Administration, sweeping changes are being made though confusion still reigns. According to guidelines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March, 1972, pregnancy and related disorders such as miscarriage and abortion must be treated as temporary disabilities. The analogy to a broken leg was never stated in print but it is often used by staff members trying to interpret the regulations to corporate personnel administrators and aggrieved employes. Pregnant employes must be granted leaves of absence and they are entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority and other benefits when they return to work. Forcing a woman to quit because she is pregnant by granting her an insufficient leave of absence would be considered sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965. But what is a reasonable limit on a maternity leave is still not clear. The survey found that 58 per cent of the nearly 1,000 companies polled had liberalized their policies. An additional 22 per cent plan to make further changes and 38 per cent are considering them. Many concerns that formerly did not do so are now paying accrued sick pay to employes on maternity leave. Some are matching maternity leave allowances to the disability benefits in their group insurance plans and others are tying them to state disability benefit programs. Many concerns have dropped the practice of limiting lengths of maternity leaves. Six out of 10 companies let the individual employe choose the appropriate times to leave and to return to work. Some states formerly had laws prohibiting the employment of women four to six weeks after delivery but some of these laws have been repealed along with other protective legislation that seems to conflict with Title VII. Nine out of 10 companies solve the riddle of how long it is safe for a pregnant woman to work by requiring a medical opinion, usually from her physician. Marital status doesn't matter any more. Fewer than one in 20 of the concerns make maternity leave conditional upon the woman being married. Some companies are treading water on these issues until some legal actions wending their way through the courts are decided."
Governor Bows Out ...,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/12/archives/governor-bows-out-enter-mr-wilson.html,"Nelson A. Rockefeller has been a Governor in the fine tradition of New York State. His years in Albany, particularly the early years, kept unbroken a bipartisan chain of distinction that began more than a half‐century ago with Alfred E. Smith and stretched on through F.D.R., Lehman, Dewey and Harriman. Regrettably, the brilliance of the Rockefeller record has been severely dimmed by his disappointing performante in the fourth term which he plans to walk out on next Tuesday in furtherance of his Presidential ambitions. It was undoubtedly these ambitions—for all his reiterated denial of their existence—that caused him to abandon his lifelong identification with progressive Republicanism and embark on the generally backward‐looking policies that have turned the past three years of his current term into such a decline. It would be unfair, however, to let his crass surrender to political expediency eclipse recognition of the capacity and originality that have been Mr. Rockefeller's notable characteristics and that have generally benefited the people of this state. He was the father of revenue sharing at both the Federal and state levels, a dramatic and useful reform in the structure of governmental fiscal responsibility. Once the White House and Congress had been persuaded of the need for sharing Federal funds with the states and localities, he took the initiative in setting up a pioneering adaptation of the same plan to funnel state funds into the beleaguered cities. The State University is his proudest monument, a refreshing contrast to the vulgarity of the wildly extravagant South Mall complex the Governor built in Albany. In addition to constructing a superb system of higher education, Mr. Rockefeller can take credit for creation of the innovative Urban Development Corporation, which represents an imaginative effort to build new towns and neighborhoods and which has accomplished much despite the throttling effect of white backlash on many of its initiatives. Mr. Rockefeller understood the necessity of state involvement in urban mass transit, including the need to revitalize the collapsing commuter rail systems in the metropolitan area. He has also been, generally speaking, a strong supporter of environmental protection, whether in the fight against water pollution or the effort to protect the Adirondacks. * * * Against these substantial pluses in the Rockefeller record must be put his frequent and disheartening recent retreats in fields where he once ranked foremost—cutbacks in programs to aid the poor through welfare and Medicaid, sponsorship of an unconscionable “lock 'em up and throw away the key” law to deal with drug addiction, severe fiscal short‐changing of the urban areas. The Governor's feud with Mayor Lindsay—a feud for which he must bear a good part of the blame—resulted in callous insensitivity to the needs of New York City, to the detriment of the entire state as well as of this metropolis. Least admirable of all was the opportunistic enthusiasm with which—in his eagerness to obliterate his “Eastern liberal” image—he enfolded to his bosom not only the Nixon Administration but even such ultraconservative G.O.P. candidates as Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr. of New Jersey, whose abortive drive for the Governorship of that state was shunned even by New Jersey's top elected Republicans. Nevertheless, even as he moved steadily toward the right in his political positions, Mr. Rockefeller was capable of occasional brave flashes in support of principle. One such was his veto last year of a highly emotional measure enacted by the Legislature, with applause from President Nixon, that would have repealed this state's model abortion law. And except for the conviction seven years ago of the Republican State Chairman on charges of bribery in connection with state liquor licenses, it must be remarked that there has been an absence of scandal in this Rockefeller administration—a fact' that makes doubly regrettable his reluctance speak out on the mess in Washington. We find little persuasiveness in Mr. Rockefeller's declaration that he is leaving Albany in the belief that he can perform “a greater public service to the people of New York State and the nation” by serving as chairman of two study groups—the Commission on Critical Choices for America and the National Commission on Water Quality. His election for a fourth term represented a commitment to the voters to stay for four years, not to quit whenever it might suit his personal purposes. Mr. Rockefeller's immersion in the challenges of the future may well bring him back to some of the boldness of his earlier years. But, whatever its fruits, this venture into adult education by the Governor hardly excuses desertion of his post. ... Enter Mr. Wilson Governor Rockefeller's exit brings into the Executive Mansion the man who has been waiting restlessly the shadows for fifteen years—Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson. He will now have a year in which to convince his own Republican party and, much more important, the voters of this state that he is the right man direct its affairs. On the basis of past performance, there is no uncertainty about which wing of the political spectrum Mr. Wilson will choose to occupy. Unlike Mr. Rockefeller, he did not have to travel to become a conservative. That has always been his identification, and in the climate that has caused so many progressives to revert to the storm‐cellar of orthodoxy it is scarcely likely that Mr. Wilson will move away from his beginnings. He has the asset of enormous expertise in the intricacies of the state budget, the operation of state departments and the interplay of legislative political processes. But the manifest rivalry between the incoming Governor and Assembly Speaker Duryea, whose aspirations to be the G.O.P. nominee for the top spot next year have been undisguised, may create major problems for Mr. Wilson in trying to establish mastery of the Legislature in the forthcoming session. The citizens will expect both men to pursue their respective ambitions in a way that will not make a casualty of the state's welfare. For New York City there is special urgency in repairing the fractured relationships between this city and Albany. The first test of the new Governor's cooperativeness along that line will be how effectively he works for release of part of the state's surplus to help hold down transit and commuter fares here and in every other urban center."
BRITAIN SUFFERS WIDE BLACKOUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/15/archives/britain-suffers-wide-blackouts-stocks-are-hit-hard-london-and-other.html,"LONDON, Saturday, Dec. 15 —The first blackouts of Britain's energy crisis darkened large areas of London and the rest of the nation last night. Thousands of homes in the southwest, west and north of London were affected. The blackouts began at 10:30 P.M. and lasted up to 90, minutes in places. An Electricity Board spokesman described the area as very extensive and said the blackouts had occurred on a “national scale.” Because of the lateness of the hour, it was impossible to determine immediately how many homes had been affected. One of the hardest‐hit areas was the Midlands, in the center of England, where some 100,000 homes were blacked out. The sudden loss of power occurred at about the time electric blankets and, heaters were being switched on for the night. Stocks Are Hit Hard The blackouts occurred following a day in which Britain began preparing for a winter of austerity amid rising criticism of Prime Minister Heath's announcement yesterday of drastic new measures to cope with the energy crisis. A wave of selling on the London Stock Exchange wiped out many millions of pounds in values and the pound weakened in response to the Prime Minister's proclamation of three‐day work week for most of the nation's industry starting Jan. 1. The public's reaction seemed one of shock coupled with stoical determination to see the crisis through, just as the country managed to survive its last comparable period of economic distress in World War II. But indignation was mounting against the coal miners and railway engineers, whose work stoppages have threatened Britain's power supply by sharply reducing coal supplies for the electrical generators at the same time that oil from the Middle Eart has been curtailed. A butcher in a small town in Kent posted a sign barring all locomotive engineers, miners and power workers from; his shop. “We are fed up with the whole thing,” said the butcher, Michael Frankland. It is too soon to determine, the full scope of the economic; effects of Mr. Heath's measures, but some indications have appeared: ¶Steel production will drop by at least 50 per cent by the end of next week and may decline even further in the new Other Energy News Additional articles on energy appear on following pages of this part of the newspaper, on Pages 33, 39 and in Business/Finance, starting on Page 43. year. “Customers will certainly face shortages,” a British Steel Corporation official said. ¶The steel cutback will hamper food production. F. Dean Swift, director of the Agricultural Engineers Association, said the output of farm machinery and spare parts would be reduced, jeopardizing next fall's harvests. ¶Automobile production will fall sharply, reaching roughly the same level as steel production as soon as steel inventories are exhausted. ¶Retail trade will declio, reflecting not only the three‐day business week but also the sharply reduced spending pow er of the 13 million British workers without a guaranteed weekly income. ¶Unemployment will rise sharply, although no estimate has yet been made of the total loss of jobs. A source at British Steel said the state‐owned cornpany would have to end 100,000 Jobs next month because of the cost of paying five days wages for three days work. ¶At least two days will be cut from the Christmas shopping season, the most vital per‐od of the year for many merchants. Commerce and industry have been limited to a total of only five working days between next Monday and Dec. 31. Behind the Austerity The damage to the economy will depend on the duration of the measures imposed by the Prime Minister to counter widespread disruptions in the nation's energy supply. The disruptions have been caused by work slowdowns in the mines that have reduced coal production 40 per cent and similar slowdowns by railway engineers resulting in cuts in train service throughout the nation. The train curtailments have compounded the loss in coal output by restricting the movement of coal to Britain's electrical power plants. Oil shortages because of the Middle East crisis have further aggravated the situation. The National Union of Mineworkers and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen gave no indication yesterday that they were prepared to call off their job actions. Leaders of other unions expressed acrid criticism of Mr. Heath's austerity measures. Richard Briginshaw, a member of the general council of the Trades Union Congress, described the Government's stand as lunatic, inflexible, and antiBritish. The Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers urged the Trades Union Congress to mobilize nationwide labor support for the miners and railway engineers. And the nation's largest labor group, the Transport and General Workers Union, called for a special union congress to organize action against the Government's policies. ‘We Stand Fast’ No new statement came from the Mineworkers Union, but Emlyn Williams, president‐elect of a regional miners unit in South Wales, charged that Mr. Heath's actions were meant to “alienate public opinion against the miners.” He added: “I would say the proposed crash program is nothing but an abortion and is indicative of the fact that the Government has now come to the end of the road on its economic policy. Whatever happens, we stand fast.” Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson, leader of the Opposition Labor party, charged that Phase 3 of the Government's economic program was “dead” and announced his own program of controls to cope with inflation. Mr. Wilson carefully refrained from making any statement that might be interpreted as encouragement for the miners and railway engineers, whose job actions have embarrassed the Labor party and caused it to lose support in public opinion polls. Political analysts are speculating that Mr. Wilson expects Mr. Heath to call an election while sentiment is running against the miners, although Mr. Heath himself has indicated he plans no such call soon. The state of the economy has raised questions about the degree of support Mr. Heath could expect from the electorate, but it is considered likely that the Prime Minister would benefit from a backlash against the Labor party because of union militancy. Mr. Heath could eliminate the threat to Britain's power supply in a stroke by authorizing the National Coal Board and British Rail, both Government units, to give in to the unions' demands for wage increases. But by yielding to the unions he could cause the collapse of Phase 3 of his program because the miners and railway workers want more than the 7 per cent that the Government considers noninflationary. Inflation is by far the major political issue of the moment. The purchasing power of the British pound has eroded steadily in the face of rising prices. Today the Government reported another big increase in the retail price index for November. Mr. Heath obviously feels that the damage to the economy—and his political fortunes —that would result from unchecked inflation would be worse than the harm done by his emergency measures to cope with the fuel shortage, which he did not directly cause. So the three‐day work week has been announced and a ban on television broadcasting after 10:30 P.M. will be imposed on Monday. The heads of most of the major department stores in London agreed yesterday that they would cluster the five business days allowed between Monday and Dec. 31 from Monday to Friday of next week and would close Saturday and the following Monday, Christmas Eve. They and most other businesses will be closed from Dec. 22 until Jan. 2, unless they can justify exemptions under Mr. Heath's arrangement for essential business to remain in operation. Harrods, a leading London department store, will keep its gourmet food department open while the rest of the store is cold, dark and fenced off, because the Government views food supply as an essential business. Business Loss Expected Robert Midgley, the managing director, said the rest of the store would be closed entirely for 10 days after Dec. 22 and then would close Sunday through Tuesday each week while the three‐day work week was in force. He conceded that the loss of business might be considerable, a factor that contributed to the pronounced weakness in retail equities on the Stock Exchange yesterday. The Financial Times industrial index fell 9.3 points to 305.9 following Thursday's drop of 12.3 points. Panic selling also occurred on the London Metal Exchange, and in foreign exchange dealings the pound closed at $2.3090, down nearly a cent. The financial markets are extremely nervous not only about the impact of the three‐day work week but also about the additional steps to be announced Monday by Anthony Barber, Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Heath said that Mr. Barber would disclose measures to combat Britain's balance of payments deficit, which has been large despite the Government's assurances to Britain's trade partners that it would diminish."

BRITAIN SUFFERS WIDE BLACKOUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/15/archives/britain-suffers-wide-blackouts-london-and-other-regions-are.html,"LONDON, Saturday, Dec. 15 —The first blackouts of Britain's energy crisis darkened large areas of London and the rest of the nation last night. Thousands of homes in the southwest, west and north of London were affected. The blackouts began at 10:30 P.M. and lasted up to 90 minutes in places. An Electricity Board spokesman described the area as very extensive and said the blackouts had occurred on a “na tional scale.” Because of the lateness of the hour, it was impossible to determine immediately how many homes had been affected. One of the hardest‐hit areas was the Midlands, in the center of England, where some 100,000 homes were blacked out. The sudden loss of power occurred at about the time electric blankets and heaters were being switched on for the night. Stocks Are Hit Hard The blackouts occurred following a day in which Britain began preparing for a winter, of austerity amid rising criticism of Prime Minister Heath's announcement yesterday of drastic new measures to cope with the energy crisis.

TV Programer Allows Automatic Station Shifts,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/15/archives/tv-programer-allows-automatic-station-shifts-fast-datarecording.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 14—An automatic television programer that was patented this week enables a set owner to schedule in advance just what the family will see and hear all evening. By pressing buttons, the operator can cause the set to switch stations at specific times for specific periods. Robert L. Moran of Franklin, Mass., an electronics engineer, was granted Patent 3,778,721. The equipment includes a clock, so that channels can be changed on the hour and half hour. Patents of the Week Connection can be made to a recorder, in which programs can be stored for later display, A Walter Cronkite fan who has to he out at broadcast time need not miss the news. The programer has a timer, an electric motor drive and a control panel with buttons to register the owner's selections. The patent illustrates the use of four channels, but the number is not limited. Mr. Moran hopes to sell or license his invention to a manufacturer so that the programers can be built into new sets. He estimates the added cost at $10 for each receiver. Fast Data‐Recording System An extremely fast method of recording information, measured in billionths of second, was patented this week for the International Business Machines Corporation. Patent 3,778,785 was granted to Robert J. von Gutfeld, a staff member at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, N.Y. Data can be recorded on films of semi‐conductor material by using short laser pulses, in the nanosecond range. Tiny areas on the film are changed from a crystalline to a non‐crystalline, or amorphous, state. The changes are visible under special lenses. Experimental use by Dr. van Gutfeld at the center has proved that a large number of “bits” of data can be written in the form of amorphous spots in a short time and in relatively small space. The information can he erased by reconverting the amorphous spots to a crystalline state. Abortions by Prostaglandins A method of using the compounds known as prostaglandins to induce medical abortions was patented this week for the Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Mich. According to Patent 3,778,506, granted to Kenneth T. Kirkton, a staff biologist, the compounds are introduced during the middle third of the gestation period into the fluid that surrounds the embryo. Injection is made through the abdomen, and no surgery is required. The patent gives four exemples of pregnancies that. were terminated in human females by the injections. Other subjects were rhesus monkeys and heifers. The company announced Nov. 30 that, with the approval of the Food and Drug Administration, it was introducing the first commercial prostaglandins in the United States. There will be various uses, including the interruption of pregnancies at selected hospitals. Hair Structure for Wigs Eva Gabor International, Ltd., North Kansas City, Mo., received a patent this week for a wefted hair structure to be used in making wigs, wiglets and hairpieces such as the company sells. Patent 3,777,768 was granted to Josef Scigliano, a stylist and vice president of the company. The actress is chairman of the board. Wefts, as the term is used, are multiple strands of hair. They are attached to lace over a base on the wearer's head in such a way that they can be reversed in direction. The patent points to increased “compatibility” and “stylability.” Production of wigs embodying the invention has begun on an experimental basis. To get a copy of a patent, send the number and 50 cents to the Commissioner of Patents, Washington, D.C. 20231. Design patents are 20 cents each. To reach an inventor or assignee, if the address given is insufficient, write him care of the Commissioner of Patents, being sure to cite the patent number."

Creating a ‘Nixon Court’,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/so-far-the-justices-are-their-own-men-creating-a-nixon-court.html,"Is a judicial counterrevolution under way, a full‐scale retreat from the liberal landmarks of the Warren Court? The question has been in many minds since Chief Justice Warren E. Burger was joined by three other Nixon appointees on the Supreme Court, and it was raised again last week. The occasion was two 6‐to‐3 decisions of the Court that took a broad view of police power to search any person placed under arrest. In the view of many scholarly observers, the short answer to that sweeping question is: “No.” The pattern of the Burger Court's decisions cannot accurately be described as counter‐revolutionary. It is more complicated than that—as life usually is, not least on the Supreme Court. The Burger years have seen a number of decisions, some of them quite dramatic, that extended what could loosely be called liberal principles. These cases alone should explode the notion that the Burger Court has any consistent conservative or “strict constructionist” intention. In the welfare field, for example, the Burger Court has found lengthy state residence requirements for eligibility unconstitutional. That is a considerable further step away from the old view of state power. Wiretapping was the subject of an especially significant constitutional judgment. The 8‐0 decision rejected the Nixon Administration's claim of inherent power to tap in domestic security cases without court orders. Women have won some groundbreaking equal rights claims. Women in the Armed Forces, for examples, now can claim husbands as dependents. On the matter of separating church and state, the Burger Court went farther than its predecessors when it rejected the New York State plan for tax credits for parochial school tuition. Finally, there are the remarkable abortion cases. Whether it was “liberal” for the court to condemn nonmedical state restrictions on abortion is arguable. But no one can look at those cases and say that the Burger court shies from novel doctrine. In comparing the work of the Warren and Burger courts, it may be useful to consider four general areas in which the Warren years saw sharp change: voting equality, race, free speech and the criminal law. Each has distinctive characteristics; and It is in the context of the last of these, criminal law, that the week's decisions on police searches must be considered. The Burger Court has trimmed away a little at the edges of the reapportionment cases, taking a less strict mathematical view of the equality required in legislative districts. But there is no visible possibility that the central doctrine will be abandoned. On race, the present Court would certainly reach the same decision in Brown v. Board of Education as the justices did in 1954. But there are harder problems now, those of black and white relations apart from enforced segregation. The Warren Court might have handled them differently, but there can be simple view of the change on such a complicated issue. In free speech there has been one striking retreat: the Court's decision last June leaving it to localities to say what is obscene. But the justices have recently agreed to take another look at that issue, and they may now recognize some of the June ruling's inherent difficulties. Criminal law is the one area where it is fair to speak of a change of direction. Even here one must be careful not to exaggerate. For example, the Burger Court has taken some steps to enlarge protections of the individual, notably, the 1972 decision finding the death penalty as then administered unconstitutional. Again, the specific issue of police searches has gone through so many twists and turns in the Court's history that it is hard to see the latest as earthshaking. Both Justice William H. Rehnquist for the majority and Justice Thurgood Marshall dissenting (with Justices William O. Douglas and William J. Brennan Jr.) claimed precedent for their view. What divided them was whether to admit as evidence narcotics found when policemen searched two men arrested for totally unrelated offenses, traffic violations. The majority said the police were entitled to make a thorough search of any person taken into custody. The minority would have weighed the reasonableness of any search on the facts of each case, including the officer's fear of a weapon. But beyond the particulars, there Is a mood on the criminal law. A majority of the present Court is reluctant to impose highly detailed constitutional restraints on the police. It has refused to extend the Warren Court's most controversial criminal law decision, the Miranda case of 1966. In the Miranda decision the Court held that arrested persons are entitled to consult a lawyer before being questioned. Some fringe applications of the Miranda rule, notably on the presence of lawyers at police lineups, have been cut back. And looming on the horizon is the possibility of a major change. Early this month the Court agreed to review a Michigan decision that raises more questions about the Miranda rule. Some people think a majority may be prepared to reconsider the whole idea that the Constitution requires exclusion from diminal trials of improperly obtained evidence."
The Fifteen Years of the Rockefeller Era,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/he-started-on-top-and-still-has-confidence-he-can-go-higher-the.html,"“Are you Rocky?” —a small boy stopping the grinring campaigner on the streets of New York. “Yes, sir.”—Nelson A. Rockefeller's reply. “Gimme a dollar.”—the small boy. Right from the beginning, there was the word, “Rocky.” It seemed an amalgam of the ordinary man's wish to clip the awesome name of Rockefeller to mortal size, and to bestow an affectionate designation that Americans reserve for family pets. Mr. Rockefeller began as a favorite in New York and as far as the ultimate poll, the ballot, reveals, he is leaving as, a favorite after four straight victories. He will resign Tuesday, restless as ever, with most people convinced he still wants to be President and is making one final try for the White House. He is leaving behind a vast record of words and concrete, laws and agencies with which to judge whether or not he deserves the promotion. During his 15‐year tenure in Albany Mr. Rockefeller's administrative hallmarks included such major innovations as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which acquired the city's subways and the suburban commuter lines; the extensive use of borrowing—more than $10‐billion worth; the Taylor law's collective bargaining rights and restrictions for public employes; the mandating of zoning and preservation guidelines on a huge scale in the Adirondack Park; and ambitious political ventures, including efforts to influence the choice of New York's mayor. Legalized gambling was extended to include the state lottery‐and off track betting. And even more sensitive areas of public morality were traversed with the easing of the divorce and abortion laws. The Rockefeller style was grand in both failure and success. There was pay‐as‐you‐go budgeting and the universal fallout shelter program that did not survive his early period. There was the State University's phenomenal growth to a front‐ranked institution for 250,000 students that many observers say is his crowning achievement. The Governor claimed success at institutional reform in the mental hospitals and the prisons. But his critics countered by pointing to the notoriety attracted by Willowbrook and its retarded children, and by Attica and the rebellious inmates demanding reform before they were defeated in a hail of bullets. Mr. Rockefeller was quick to respond to public concerns, creating a Task Force on Organized Crime, an Environmental Conservation Department, and a Consumer Protection Board as problems in these areas came to dominate the headlines. Some critics say much of this was largely public relations. The Governor's office presents lengthy rebuttal, citing, for example, the multi‐billion dollar pure waters program which Mr. Rockefeller saw enacted. The Governor was in office long enough to embrace changing approaches to social problems. He admits his attitude on welfare hardened in recent years, and he takes pride in curbing the growth welfare clients through such means as establishing a hard‐line inspector general for public assistance. The narcotics problem provides a typical measure of the Governor's range. He first approached it with a costly treatment program, but then forced harsher penalties through the Legislature as he turned from carrot to stick. In the process he dazzled politicians by obtaining authorization for 100 new judgeships with all their attendant patronage. Mr. Rockefeller, when he was not off moving the national arena, was Manhattan‐oriented. He might fly out of New York City on a mid‐day mission, relaxini, perhaps, with an aperitif. He would return in his customized twin‐jet where he enjoyed a late‐night glass of milk and an Oreo cookie. Even after 15 years, a long time for any public performer to stay fresh, Mr. Rockefeller moved into a crowd with enthusiasm, offering greetings and wide‐angled smiles for all. In private, he never showed disdain after these exhibitions and, in fact, seemed to be recharged by them. Albany, the state capital, he treated as though it were a person in need of a new suit of clothes. He tried to provide this with the South Mall, the huge 96‐acre tract of marbled buildings he has had built across from the capital. He has proclaimed it the most beautiful in America; critics call it the “costliest.” The Governor's politics were pragmatic. Being tho chief Republican officeholder in the state did not prevent him from dealing comfortably with such men as Alex Rose, the Liberal party leader, and Meade Esposito, the Brooklyn Democratic chief. Mr. Rockefeller overcame his background as a privileged multimillionaire sufficiently to woo labor unions with a success that left state Democrats envious. Even when he took a “crackdown” approach as with this year's public pension reform, he accepted the idea of favoring some unions over others. He took the view that his privileged background required more of him. When complimented once for being a good dancer, he replied: “Yes, I had two choices. I could have become a gigolo or I could have become a Governor.” In making his choice, Mr. Rockefeller showed the ability to stir public emotions over the years. There are liberals who claim his finest hour was when he withstood the jeers of the Goldwater convention in 1964; but there are party loyalists lately who appreciate his near blanket defense of President Nixon. Several years ago, the Governor was asked if he could recall the first time he thought about running for the White House. He replied: “Ever since I was a kid. After all, when you think of what I had, what else was there to aspire to?”"
How to Vex the Ex‐Mrs. Rex,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/how-to-vex-the-exmrs-rex-how-to-vex-the-exmrs-rex-harrison-rachel.html,"“Please, whatever you do, don't ask Rachel about Rex Harrison. Evidently, he was quite a monster.”—A friend of Rachel Roberts. THERE'S really no reason to ask Rachel Roberts about Rex Harrison, not any more. For 10 very important years in her life, from the age of 34 to 44, her main claim to fame was the fact that she was Mrs. Rex Harrison, and after the divorce, the exMrs. Rex. Well, not any more. Not after her smash hit on the London stage last year, “Alpha Beta,”, in which she played Albert Finney's shrewish wife. And especially not after her current triumph in two wildly contrasting roles with The New Phoenix Repertory Company, one in the tragic “The Visit,” the other in the comic “Chemin de Fer.” Now people are asking Rachel Roberts about Rachel Roberts again. * “Hello, luv,” she says, cheerfully, as she strides out of her dressing room on a recent Saturday night, a bit hoarse after her matinee and evening performances. Her blonde hair is cropped short, and her upturned nose and Dick Tracy jaw make her strongly resemble her friend, Tammy Grime:. (“Oh, everybody says that.”) She is wearing a brown sweater and brown suede pants, and unlike many women in her profession, she has not starved herself into a bony skeleton. In fact, she lias an honest‐togoodness noticeable stomach, not some concave pit. She hails a cab, and on the way to the Central Park West apartment she temporarily borrowing from Sir, John Gielgud, she talks about what it is like to be on Broadway for the first time after appearing on the London stage, in movies and on television. I had expected a lot of gushy adjectives; I was wrong. “I'm not particularly bedazzled,” she says evenly. “The play's the thing. Before we came here, we were six weeks touring America—on a bus. One can't decry the enthusiasm we had, especially in Boston, where we packed them in for two weeks. We were marvelously received here, too. But one thinks of Broadway in terms of show biz, and I don't exactly like show biz. I suppose Broadway is good for the ego, but it's not your ego that counts. It's the people you play to if you're any kind of artist.” The Gielgud apartment is of the drop dead/House Beautiful genre, with several paintings that all say “LOVE” on the walls and a breathtaking view of Manhattan. “it's the best view I've ever had,” Rachel says, as she stands on the terrace, the lights of distant Fifth Avenue and Central Park South glittering like diamonds in some murky tiara. Rachel moves to a fur‐covered couch, uncorks a bottle of Chianti, and explains how she, a British actress, got two such plum parts with an American rep company. “I went to Cannes last summer to help Lindsay Anderson promote a film I was in, ‘O Lucky Man!’,” she says. “I was only there for eight days, I think. Hal Prince, director of ‘The Visit,’ left me a note at the Carlton, where every body stays, He'd seen me in ‘Alpha Beta’ last year. But I wasn't staying at the Carlton, I was in a little village nearby, St. Paul‐de‐Vence. One night the ‘O Lucky Man!’ crowd was having dinner at this little village and Rex Reed brought me Prince's note. It asked me if I were interested in doing ‘The Visit’ and a Feydeau farce, and Lindsay said, ‘Do it.’ I said, ‘I don't know if I want to—I haven't read either play.’ Lindsay said, ‘You both want to and can.’ So I wired Hal and said, ‘Delighted to accept.’” The two roles are poles apart. In Friedrich Duerrenmatt's “The Visit,” Rachel plays the bitter, red‐haired Clara Zaelianassian, a middle‐aged, much married millionairess who comes back to her impoverished hometown to seek revenge against a man (played by John McMartin) who done her wrong when she was 17. In Georges Feydeau's “Chemin de Fer,” she is the blonde, giggly, empty‐headed Francine, who is in the throes of her first extra‐marital affair. Which part does she prefer? “I honestly can't state a preference, darling,” Rachel says, in her husky voice. “They're so entirely different. The part of Clara is probably the most exhausting. The fanaticism she's got has to be held in check, except for specific moments. Francine says the first thing that comes into her head, which is what French farce is. Even though Francine has a lot of running around and fast costume changes, I'm more tired after Clara. I guess I actually like Francine best. I'm much more like Francine, and it is lovely to hear laughter in the Although Lynn Fontanne played Clara in a powerful 1958 production of “The Visit,” Rachel says that she was not at all intimidated by that fact. “I just didn't have any time to think about it,” she says. “I flew over and went right into rehearsals and costume fittings—both designers were very good girls, I mean, women—and wig fittings. Obviously, there are going to be comparisons among the older generation. Lynrr Fontanne is one of your greatest actresses. But hon estly, one doesn't have time to think of such things. One must fall or fly with it. One must not bring anything but one's own interpretation. I've regrettably never seen the Lunts. I wasn't in your country then. Really, one must put thoughts of comparison out of one's mind and think, ‘What can I offer?’ There is no definitive playing of a part. In my country, so many actors play Hamlet, and you aren't always thinking of how Olivier played the part.” Rachel pours herself another glass of wine and settles back on the couch. She seems in a relaxed mood now, as though she were relieved by the dearth of Rex Harrison questions. I ask her about repertory, and she says it is her favorite form of acting, with films a very close second. “To be a member of a company and to play two plays as we're doing . . . I just love it. It's different, no two ways about it, but it's stimulating. It is ‘the play's the thing.’ If you're playing in a commercial play, you get a lot more money and there's a little pampering. Our company is very democratic—even though they gave me the Number 1 dressing room. We all pull our own weight. People say you're bound to be second fiddle when you're in repertory. Believe it or not, some people enjoy it. “But I like filming very much, too. My personal taste is for Truffaut, Jacques Tati, films with a little bit of social purpose, whether it's comedy or tragedy—something with thought behind it.” Her favorite part of all? Mrs. Hammond, the lonely and bitter widow who has tragic affair with Richard Harris, as a crude rugby player, in “This Sporting Life.” “It's probably the best thing I've done,” she says. “She's the opposite of me, the essence of introversion, of the north country far back, with smouldering passions underneath, a woman who never wore her heart on her sleeve. In other words, the opposite of me. I turned it down three times. I said, ‘I'm too emotional, I'm Welsh,’ and Lindsay Anderson, who directed it, said, ‘I want all you've got inside—I want somebody emotional to play it.’ “Lindsay is sort of my mentor, really. I'm a little tired tonight, but I'm usually quite full of beans, and always longed to play someone a little less vital, if you know what I mean, and he sort of saw in me things wanted to do. I have a lot to thank him for, and I think he's an incredibly marvelous human being.” Her performance in “This Sporting Life” won her a Hollywood Oscar nomination, as well as her second British Academy Award, the first one being for “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning.” Both were made in pre‐Rex Harrison days. Among her other laurels are a Drama Critics Award nomination for playing the mother in “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man‐in‐the‐Moon Marigolds” in Los Angeles and the 1972 London Evening Standard's best actress award for “Alpha Beta,” which has since been made into a film, with Rachel and Finney recreating their original roles. Rachel Roberts quit acting for four years‐`My own choice Yes, this award‐winner is the same woman who gave up acting for four years during her marriage to Harrison, a decision that, she says now, made her “unbearably frustrated.” “It, was my own choice, my own stupidity, and I have only myself to blame,” she says resignedly, pouring her third glass of wine. “I'm sort of a perfectionist, and believe in doing one job well, i.e., being a wife and not spreading my talents in a lot of directions. To have worked during those years would have been falling between two stools. In my frustration, I became a clown rather than a shrew. I apologized for myself by overfriendlíness and clowning around and lacking reserve. All my energy went into compulsive talk and chatter.” Still, she does not believe that her absence from acting in those years of her middle thirties—when most actresses are solidifying their road to stardom—was any kind of death blow to her career. “I could never have played Ophelia anyway,” she says, with a half‐smile. “No, I don't think I was hurt. The living witness to this is now at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre [where she is appearing]. My experience made me grow, and now I have a great faith in acting. I'm also more mature as a human being.” One might think that with those four years of professional frustration, Rachel would be a major supporter of the women's movement. Well, yes. And no. “As far as equality of opportunity goes, yes,” she says. “And equal pay, yes. But biological equality, impossible. I believe in becoming as strong a woman as one can and developing as far as one can. But I have no wish to be a man, or compete with a man. I very much like the difference.” Rachel was born in Lla nelly, Wales, to the Reverend Richard Rhys Roberts, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Rachel Ann, who died recently while her daughter was performing with The New Phoenix Repertory Company in Philadelphia. Rachel did not go home for the funeral. “I went on that night,” she says. “Mother was very thrilled that I was coming to Broadway, very thrilled indeed. She had a stroke and died within 48 hours. She was cremated and I plan to go home when we're done and give her a memorial service.” Rachel had a strict Baptist upbringing, “the kind where you don't even have a glass of port on Christmas Day, which is going too far. You also didn't smoke, didn't dance, didn't wear lipstick, didn't go to the theater.” Rachel went to the theater, however, via the University of Wales, where she took a bachelor of arts degree in English and education, and then to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art on scholarship. Did her religious upbringing have any influence on her life today? “Yes,” she says, “but if I were to be anything, I'd be a Catholic. Whenever I go to church, I go to St. Patrick's. I really do think there's great peace there, don't you? But do they still have that thing about abortion, that thing that if a syphilitic man goes to bed with a virgin, the girl will have to give birth to a syphilitic child? I don't especially like that. But I do believe in God. There are so many arguments that can be thrown at you when you make a sweeping statement like that, but yeah, I do. I also have a great compassion for my fellow human beings, and I feel guilty about judging people.” Rachel has been married twice, first to a British actor named Alan Dobie (“We're great friends”), and then to what's‐his‐face, who is now married to Rachel's one‐time best friend, Elizabeth Harris, ex‐wife of actor Richard Harris. Rachel's current romantic interest is Darran Ramirez, a tall, dark and handsome 30‐year‐old men's clothing designer, whom she met in 1971 at a Hollywood party while making one of the movies that she would like to forget, “Doctors' Wives.” “It's rather chic these days to go with a younger man, isn't it?” she ‐ says. smiling. “The Americans and English are finally catching up with the Europeans. Besides, chronological age is a load of rubbish.” Marriage No. 3, however, seems out of the question. “Oh, I really think marriage is just for having babies,” she says, tugging on one of her large gold earrings. “There are so many taboos involved that are all so insane, such as older women can't marry young men, the color of a person's skin, lesbians and homosexuals. We'll go marching to the grave putting taboos on each other. But while marriage may not be for me, I don't want to say that it's not for you, or the girl next door. Some people need to be Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and some need to be possessed and to have possessions. I need my freedom. “At one point in my life I missed having children,” she goes on, “but no more. If we all had everything we wanted, we'd be spoiled Cinderellas. I went to the WAIF. Ball the other night, and there were so many children who are alone and abandoned there. Sometimes I think about adoption, but it only enters my head, no more.” It is getting well past midnight, and when Rachel looks at her watch and says, “Darren's coming over soon,” I decide it is time to leave. As I put on my coat, she jumps to her feet and says, rather emotionally: “Now you're not going to write one of those ‘The ExWife of Rex Harrison’ articles, are you? Oh, I don't care, I won't read it, anyway.”"
Legality Of Abortion In Clinics Is Uncertain,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/legality-of-abortion-in-clinics-is-uncertain.html,"TRENTON — Despite efforts by the State Attorney General's office to clarify New Jersey's tangled abortion regulations here last week, the legality of performing abortions outside of hospitals in the state is still uncertain. Such abortions are therefore continuing, but on a small scale. Furthermore, the failure by the state's Health Care Administration Board last week to define exactly what constitutes a health‐care “clinic” as distinguished from a private physician's practice has caused confusion. As a result, no progress can be expected on the abortion dilemma for several months, according to a Health Department spokesman. In the meantime, abortions are being done in New Jersey at about half of New Jersey's hospitals for about $400, while the cost in a physician's office runs much less — about $150. Efforts to establish clinics in New Jersey that can perform low‐cost abortions have been stalled by the state's failure to license abortions performed in healthcare facilities. In effect, according to one physician who did not wish to be identified while the state is complying with the United States Supreme Court ruling of January, 1973, that a state cannot interfere with first‐trimester abortions, it is not making the operation either easy or inexpensive in New Jersey. Dr. Robert M. Livingston, an Englewood Cliffs gynecologist who challenged New Jersey's restrictive abortion rulings in March, 1972, or 10 months before the Supreme Court decision, was: elated to learn of the Attorney General's ruling this week that the definition of “clinic” had not been refined to the point where it was legally meaningful. “The definition of the word ‘clinic’ is like trying to define the word ‘obscenity’ legally — it can't be done,” he said. Dr. Livingston, who now operates the only large medical facility in New Jersey performing abortions other than hospitals, has been unable to obtain a certificate of need from the State Department of Health. Without it, no state license can be issued, but under the circumstances its license is needed. Six other applications have been ‐ approved for facilities under construction. The inability or refusal of the state and particularly the Attorney General to resolve the abortion‐licensing activists as working against poor women, since those of some financial means can afford the hospital fees. Dr. Livingston, who does abortions for the poor at less than the $150 minimum, believes that when the emotioncharged climate in New Jersey changes, the state will eventually abandon its efforts to disallow abortions in clinics. Furthermore, though Attorney General George F. Kugler Jr., ruled last week that Medicaid would have to pay for all abortions performed since last Jan. 22, Medicaid officials have declared that they will pay only for abortions performed in licensed facilities. Patients who have abortions in facilities other than hospitals would, therefore, not be eligible for Medicaid payments."
"Look for Cop‐Outs on Prime Time, Not on ‘Soaps’",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/look-for-copouts-on-prime-time-not-on-soaps.html,"WHEN the soap operas were interrupted for coverage of the Watergate hearings, there was a great deal of hilarious TV comment—much of it distinctly antifeminine—about all the poor souls who called the stations to complain. On NBC's 6 o'clock news, Jim Hartz smirked, “Hundreds of calls of complaint were received, many apparently from women.” There are a great many unemployed and underemployed people watching soap operas in this country, and by no means are all of them women. Further, interest in soap operas does not constitute proof of mental torpor. For one thing, soap operas are the only programs on television that do not adopt a patronizing attitude toward women. There are more women doctors, lawyers, writers, judges, nurses, District Attorneys and corporation executives on daytime television than were ever dreamed of on prime time. However, the true point about prime‐time television is that it is insulting not only to women, but to everybody. The soaps offer real evidence that the insult unnecessary. Sure, there's a lot of cliché‐ridden garbage on soap operas. There is also more consistent, serious effort to deal sensitively with the red‐hot issues of the day, from abortion to homosexuality, than is ever seen on prime time, except in occasional documentaries. I think that our almost automatic contempt for the people who watch soap operas prevents us from acknowledging a great deal that is valuable in the programs themselves. And if we have all quite finished snorting and slapping our thighs, perhaps we ought to take a moment to consider whether ridicule is really the brightest response to the soap viewer—even the soap addict. When a popular character dies on long‐running soap, the actress playing the widow receives scores of perfectly straight‐faced letters of condolance on her bereavement. When a priest falls in love with a beautiful parishioner, as happened recently on “The Secret Storm,” the actor playing the priest receives threats, hate mail, letters of inspiration urging him to follow his heart and so on. Obviously it is easy and amusing to make fun of such behavior, but I think it's a cheap shot. The need for vicarious experience is no funnier than pain, frustration, loneliness or old age, and if the soaps ease the pain for viewers in such circumstances, what's the harm? The soaps command an enormous audience. And since their audience is a peculiarly vocal one, they offer an especially sensitive barometer as to what the viewer is ready to accept and tolerate. Yet for all the networks seem to have learned from soaps, their attitude seems to be “take the money and run.” Daily the soaps deal with sensitive issues which prime time treats only in the most melodramatic and superficial way. The soaps are, in fact, approaching something that TV's critics have been demanding for years—using the medium to inform at the same time as it entertains. As an example, I have chosen the subject of rape because I have some particularly clear and egregious illustrations in mind. Recently, on the CBS soap, “The Young and the Restless,” pretty and popular Chris Brooks was raped and her attacker was caught. Her family was depicted as supportive and sympathetic; her boyfriend, far from adopting the attitude that she had been shamed and degraded, hired a quartet to sing under her window a song about love's young dream, in order to demonstrate publicly that he still revered and respected her. Chris is loathe to testify in court, not because she is a weepy or weakwilled female, but because she, like many rape victims, has been subjected to brutal and insulting questions by the police and she knows that going to court will mean being exposed to slander and insinuation by the defense, that it will be suggested that she has only cried rape after the fact because she fears pregnancy, and above all, that her testimony will be given to a roomful of males—judge, lawyers and jurors. In a rap session with two other rape victims, Chris is given a chance to explore her feelings intelligently, to balance her own sense of disgust against the need to prevent the rapist from going free to prey upon other women. It is clear throughout that Chris is in no way at fault, and that she will ultimately make her own decision based upon a mature and rational assessment of the actualities facing a rape victim in our court system. Not the least value of all this is that it airs the need for more women police, judges, lawyers and lawmakers, and that it clearly relays the information that there are already rap groups and rape hot lines available to any of the millions of women in the audience who may have had a similar experience. Compare this with the “Owen Marshall” segment that played on prime time the same night, A young coed is raped and murdered, and her mother's fiancé is accused, largely on the basis of false evidence given by the fiancé's jealous spinster housekeeper, that the fiancé and the coed had been lovers. Right away, notice, our attention is shifted from the victim to the man. Notice further that he is being falsely accused by a neurotic female. Now it turns out that the rapist is not the fiancé, but a bespectacled professor of Elizabethan poetry, and that he has raped two girls before he murdered this one; he was never accused because his previous victims simply left school without mentioning what had happened. Owen's able young assistant goes to interview one of them. The girl's father announces firmly that nothing happened to his daughter, that the fate of Owen's client is as nothing to him, that it (what?) is over now anyway, and will the lawyer please leave them all alone. Throughout, the girl sits looking pained while her father answers questions for her. Suddenly, she speaks, eyes down, ignoring Daddy's scowl. She murmurs, “It was late . . . I went back to school for a book . . . I heard a noise . . . He cornered me . . . Up against the . . . Then . . .” and collapses whimpering in her mother arms. So much for the rapee as natural victim. Later, of course, Owen entraps the real rapist without the girl's help, and in one of those surreal concluding scenes where everyone who is still alive shows up at Owen's office for coffee and a good laugh, somebody mentions that if either of the two previous victims had brought charges against her attacker, the murdered coed might be alive today. There was at no time any treatment of the difficulties facing a woman who accuses a rapist, no suggestion that there are many women who do testify and are publicly insulted for their trouble, no statistics on the number of accused rapists who go free anyway because the law requires corroborative proof of rape of a kind not required for any other crime of violence or larceny. Instead, Owen remarks—get this—“Isn't it odd that in that situation, so many women are so badly advised?” If you think it will make any difference, I'll grant you that “Owen Marshall” isn't the whole of prime‐time television. On Nov. 27, CBS weighed in with a made‐for‐TV movie called “Cry Rape!” which, the press release bellowed, was to deal with “the dilemma of the victim in bringing a perpetrator to justice.” So far, so good, don't you think? Here's what happened. The program opened with an unctuous voice warning us that this mature subject had been handled in a mature way, so that we could for heaven's sake get our children out of the room. Then for a taut, moving half‐hour or so, we saw pretty young Betty Jenner attacked, beaten and robbed in her own apartment by a knife‐wielding rapist/housebreaker. We heard the sly disbelief behind the questions the policemen asked Betty as they drove her to the hospital. We were actually in the gynecological examining room to see her panic and disgust at having the examination witnessed by a policeman. From a discreet angle we saw her on the examining table with her feet in the stirrups; I guess that was the mature part. Anyway, it wa's real, well‐written, ably acted. Then there was a tight, subtle scene in which the detectives questioned the victim as if she were the accused. Betty nevertheless succeeds in identifying police drawing of a rapist who has committed four other attacks in her neighborhood, after which the police go out and arrest the wrong man. Somehow, I can just hear the script conference when they got to this point. “You call this a drama? There's nothing happening here except five women's lives being twisted apart by terror, shame and insult. Let's get a human interest angle.” So there's this delivery boy, see, and he works in the neighborhood and he looks exactly like the real rapist. Three of the five women make positive identifications. There are then two scenes devoted to developing the character of the public defender assigned to our delivery boy, several more scenes developing the boy's widowed mother who has to mortgage her house to raise bail for her son. During the pre‐trial hearing, Betty is viciously insulted by the defense attorney, all well and good, and the other two witnesses change their minds about testifying. One has an unnamed scandal‐ in her past which she can't have “dredged up,” the other has a bullying husband who is ashamed to have her testify and who was introduced wearing, I swear to God, an orange hard hat. In the end, the real rapist is spotted at a car wash by the court stenographer, the police rush to his home and kick down the door and chase hint through alleys and garbage lots firing warning shots at everything that moves. The final scene goes to the wrongfully accused man; he is formally cleared of charges, and when the judge asks him if he will accept the court's apology, he says no. A mature exploration of the dilemma of the victim in bringing a perpetrator to justice ... If you had asked me, would have said that maturity in some way involved a capacity and a willingness to face the real world as it actually is, but perhaps it's sanity I'm thinking of. Anyway, for violence, melodrama, stereotyping and absurd coincidence, I don't see that the soap‐writers have anything on those responsible for “Cry Rape!” Without question, the soaps are often far‐fetched, mawkish, and sentimental. So are “Marcus Welby” and “The Brady Bunch.” Certainly many soap viewers are women who stay home all day, and certainly many of them become pathetically over‐involved in what they watch. But I see no reason why that fact is more intrinsically ridiculous than the passionate involvement of millions of American men in the spectacle of football. Each involves viewers in some kind of challenge, drama and human contact that they need and cannot satisfy in their daily lives. In the meantime, our contempt for the soap addict has obscured the fact that the soaps are the only place on television where you may see adult topics—rape, alcoholism, frigidity, the plight of the professional woman who doesn't want children, racism, sexism, even incest—explored in a dramatic context as if they were problems that involve real people. We are told that we get absurd, trivial programing on prime‐time television because we want it—we aren't ready for anything else. We can't bear ambiguity, we can't acknowledge injustice, can't cope with unhappy endings. All the time I was watching “Cry Rape!” I kept asking myself why we had to sit through all that mistaken identity stuff. If it was a story about mistaken identity, why not be consistent and have the wrong man convicted? if it was really a story about the plight of the victim, why not tell it the way'really happens—catch the right man, bring hint to trial, and then watch him get off scot‐free? Later, just out of curiosity, I called CBS to ask them how the rape trial had come out on “The Young and the Restless,” and guess what: The rapist acquitted. Whoever you are out there, PrimeTime America, I wouldn't take it lying down."
"Physicians Throughout the World Are Studying New, Simple Technique for Terminating Pregnancies",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/20/archives/physicians-throughout-the-world-are-studying-new-simple-technique.html,"HONOLULU, Dec. 19 — A new method of ending an unwanted pregnancy, developed by a psychologist, promoted by women's groups and surrounded by intense medical controversy, is now being studied carefully by physicians throughout the world. The technique, a modification of the standard suction abortion, has many names, among them menstrual regulation, induction or extraction, endometrial aspiration and mini‐abortion. It is usually performed within two weeks of a missed menstrual period, a time when traditional pregnancy tests are often unable to detect conception. According to participants in the First International Conference on Menstrual Regulation, which ended here today, the advantages of the method inelude its simplicity, rapidity, low cost, very low complication rate and the fact that it be performed in a doctor's office by paramedical personnel. “It is something we will be able to bring practically into the rice paddy,” said a doctor from the Philippines, one of 50 countries represented at the three‐day conference, which is sponsored by the University of Hawaii. Menstrual regulation was used under field condtions by paraprofessionals to treat Bangladesh women who had been raped by Pakistani soldiers during the civil war in 1971. The method is expected to be in use in virtually all countries by the end of next year. According to Merle Goldberg, executive director of the National Women's. Health Coalition in New York Which did much to promote the method, menstrual regulation services are now available in 45 states at a maximum cost of $80. The procedures differ from menstrual extraction, promoted by some feminist groups to shorten menstrual flow each month, whether the period is late or not. Doctors here regard the extraction procedure as unnecessary and dangerous. The essence or menstrual regulation is the use of a narrow, flexible plastic suction curette, or cannula, developed by Harvey Karman, a Los Angeles psychologist. This disposable flexible tube, which resembles a soda straw with two openings near a blunt, closed tip, is far less likely to damage the uterus than traditional hard metal curettes, doctors here reported. Flexible cannulas have begun to replace metal ones in suction abortions performed up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, enhancing the safety of the procedures. The cannula is inserted through the cervix into the uterus and attached to a vacuum source—either a low‐cost plastic syringe, a manually operated pump or a standard electric suction pump. The flexible cannula, when used in the early weeks of pregnancy usually requires little or no stretching of the cervical opening, thus minimizing pain and the need for anesthesia, reported Dr. Malcolm Potts, director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London. He said that the vast majority of patients were able to go about their normal activities within minutes of the procedure, a fact that has led to its being known as “lunch‐hour abortion.” To date, studies involving thousands of menstrual regulation procedures performed under a variety of conditions here and abroad indicate that major complications are virtually nonexistent and minor ones occur one‐tenth to one‐hundredths as often as with ordinary suction abortions. Accordingly, said Dr. Alan J. Margolis, obstetrician‐gynecologist at the University of California in San Francisco, it is not necessary to keep elaborate emergency equipment on hand or to do extensive laboratory tests prior to a menstrual regulation procedure. Dr. Richard J. Scotti, who works with Dr. Karman at the Women's Community Service Center in West Los Angeles, said that eight paraprofessionals had been trained there to do menstrual regulation. Paraprofessionals are also being trained at Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh.  Despite these apparent advantages, menstrual regulation remains locked in controversy in some quarters and surrounded by many unresolved questions. The questions raised at the meeting here include the following: ¶Should menstrual regulation be performed on patients who have a negative pregnancy test, or should the women be urged to wait until about two weeks after the missed period (the sixth week of pregnancy) when pregnancy tests are far more accurate? When performed within the first two weeks, about half the women turn out not to have been pregnant. The method is also more likely to fail to end an existing pregnancy when it is performed very early. ¶What, if any, are the longterm complications of menstrual regulation, and how often can the procedure be safely repeated? Women with irregular periods or those who are extremely anxious about the possibility of pregnancy might seek the procedure several times a year. ¶Should there be such a great difference in price between menstrual regulation and other suction abortions performed later in pregnancy? Several doctors — including Dr. Jane Hodgson of Preterm, an abortion clinic in Washington, D. C.—said that the extreme price differential encouraged many women to undergo menstrual regulation when they really did not need it, instead of waiting to be sure they are pregnant. But perhaps the most perplexing question remaining at the end of the conference was what menstrual regulation should be called. While some participants objected to what they regard as a euphemism for abortion, others suggested that the name would have to differ from country to country, depending upon the legal status of abortions and its social and religious acceptability."
A PREGNANCY TEST HAILED AT PARLEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/20/archives/a-pregnancy-test-hailed-at-parley-diagnosis-before-a-missed.html,"HONOLULU, Dec. 19 — A new blood test capable of diagnosing pregnancy even before a menstrual period has been missed was described here today. An Italian pharmaceutical company expects to incorporate the test into a pregnancy testing kit, to be used on a urine or a blood sample and to be available commercially here possibly within a year, according to Dr. Thomas Kosasa, who has developed the test for clinical use. Dr. Kosasa, a research fellow at Harvard University and Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, said that the new test could permit accurate diagnosis of pregnancy up to three weeks earlier than currently possible. He made his presentation to a workshop held as part of an international meeting here on menstrual regulation, a method of ending a suspected pregnancy in the first two weeks, following a missed period. Aid In Mini‐Abortions Physicians attending the conference, sponsored by the University of Hawaii, said that such an early pregnancy test would assist tremendously in selecting patients for this miniabortion technique. Currently, about half of those who undergo it turn out not to have been pregnant in the first place. Dr. Kosasa said that the test could also reveal how far along a woman's pregnancy was. This would help to take the guesswork out of such decisions as when is the best time to perform an abortion and what is the safest method to use. The Harvard researcher has shown that the test can detect conception within eight days of ovulation — about five days before the woman's expected menstrual period. In cases of infertility or artificial insemination, the test could tell the doctor and the anxious patient very early whether conception had occurred. Dr. Kosasa added that the test was also able to distinguish between normal uterine pregnancies and those that develop outside the uterus, called ectopic pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancies are dangerous, and most must be removed surgically. The test utilizes a highly sensitive laboratory technique called radio immunoassay, which uses small quantities of radioactive tracer molecules and a special antibody. Dr. Kosasa said that virtually all large cities had the equips meat and expertise necessary to read the test results. But the test's applicability is currently severely limited by an insufficient supply of the proper antibody. With enough antibodies, test results could be obtained in just two hours, Dr. Kosasa reported. The antibody in question reacts with a part of the molecule of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin, produced by the placenta during pregnancy and only in a few other very rare conditions."
"Wilson, Urging Political Probity, Details His Income",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/20/archives/wilson-urging-political-probity-details-his-income-denies-hatchet.html,"ALBANY, Dec. 19—Governor Wilson dealt with the issues of political probity today by calling for tighter election campaign controls and by disclosing several details of his income. Included in the information made public were some of the payments he received from his law firm during the 15 years he served as Lieutenant Governor. In his first news conference since being sworn in yesterday, Mr. Wilson defended the lawfirm ties he maintained until last Saturday. He said that state law permitted this, that his predecessors had acted similarly and that his firm had never handled matters involving state agencies. Declaring that the “general atmosphere” indicated it would be “useful” to disclose what normally are private financial matters, Mr. Wilson said he earned about $30,000 of his $100,000 income last year from the firm, Kent, Hazzard, Wilson, Freeman & Greer of White Plains. While state law would permit him to maintain the law firm tie even as Governor, Mr. Wilson's office said later that he had chosen to resign because the governorship was “a fulltime job — in fact more than a full‐time job.” His office said the $30,000 earned through his law firm was “typical for recent years.” However, no details were offered on how much Mr. Wilson had realized in total income from the firm during the last 15 years. Denies ‘Hatchet Job’ The Governor was asked about tightening the campaign laws in the light of the concern over the Watergate scandal as well as the indictment last week of state Republican Assembly leaders on electionfraud charges. “I feel that the election laws of our state in all their aspects require amendment at the earliest possible opportunity,” he replied in his measured, deeptoned style. Questioned about widespread speculation among politicians that the indictment of his Republican rival, Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, might have been a “hatchet job” engineered by supporters of Mr. Wilson and former Governor Rockefeller, Mr. Wilson replied gravely: “I would suggest to you that such an observation would not alone be untrue but unjust.” On other matters, Mr. Wilson, who is a Roman Cathodic, said that while he remained personally opposed to abortion, the United States Supreme Court had struck down the imposition of state restrictions in the first three months of pregnancy. Mr. Wilson said any change was up to Congress and “therefore this is no longer a state issue.” In the 40‐minute news conference, he also indicated the following: ¶He does not believe it will be necessary to create many of the 52 remaining narcotics judgeships authorized to implement the new state code on drug‐selling penalties. ¶State budget officials will be able to find enough cash to make the $100‐million loan to localities to preserve subway and commuter fares through April, if the Legislature approves. ¶Whether to seek a change in the June primary—a major factor in next year's gubernatorial competition—is one of the legislative issues he is considering. ¶He is “very upset” at reports of abuses suffered by former mental patients in inferior homes operated by moonlighting state employes and will work to improve conditions so these people receive, “love and compassion.” Energy‐Crisis Holidays Mr. Wilson also declared a holiday for state employes on the Mondays of Christmas and New Year's Eves because of the energy crisis, and said that his office was in constant touch with local officials on Long Island who are dealing with the snow storm damage. He declined to get into political questions such as whether he will run next year, as most observers expect. But he immediately broke that dictum with a broad smile when he was asked whether he had aspirations, as had so many past New York Governors, of running for President. “It will only be to labor the obvious to say that I have no ambition for national office of any kind,” he declared. Mr. Wilson's path to power was cleared by Mr. Rockefeller yesterday when he resigned in what many politicians considered the beginning of another Rockefeller bid for the Presidential nomination. In contrast to the snappier, sometimes playful answers to Mr. Rockefeller, Governor Wilson presented a more measured style, with pensive pauses to recall exact details of some subjects. “I have told you the fact,” he declared when newsmen sought to press him on his assertions that his law firm had stayed clear of state matters. The issue has arisen in the past. In 1964, for example, it was reported that a firm headed by Mr. Wilson's law partners had represented a major liquor wholesaler before the State Liquor Authority in 1962. Reason for 2 Firms At the time, it was emphasized that Mr. Wilson was not a member of the firm involved with the S.L.A. However, he was a partner in an almost comparable firm that used the same address, staff and principals with the addition of Mr. Wilson himself. His partners said then that the two firms had been maintained to avoid any possibility of conflict of interest, and that Mr. Wilson took no part except for occasional advice in telephone conversations. The Public Officers Act allows the law partners of state officials to practice before state agencies, provided that the state official does not share in the profits. In enumerating income from his firm today, Mr. Wilson said no state matters had been involved. Based on his experience, he added, he saw no need to legislate limitations on such business relations. He said he would “certainly take a look at” the current ethics law, but emphasized his view that “a sense of ethics and rightness and morality has got to be within a person.” He said most of his $100,000 in income last year was from his salary of $45,000 and the excess from his expense allowance of $15,000. There was about $30,000 in income from the law firm, plus $11,000 in income from securities, he said. He made charitable contributions of $15,000, he continued, and paid close to $26,000 in Federal income tax and more than $9,000 in state income tax. Real estate taxes on his Yonkers home and a family farm in Oneida County were more than $5,000, Mr. Wilson said. ‘Complete Disclosure’ Asked The chairman of a State Assembly subcommittee holding hearings aimed at getting greater disclosure of government operations said yesterday that Governor Wilson's revelation of his income for last year was a “helpful step in the right direction.” However, he asked for a complete disclosure of all of Mr. Wilson's assets and liabilities. Assemblyman J. Edward Meyer, chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Reforms of the Committee on Government Operations, said that the public's distrust of government “calls for full and complete disclosure, especially by our highest officials.”"
Mrs. Wilson Plans Some Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/20/archives/mrs-wilson-plans-some-changes-time-for-humor.html,"ALBANY, Dec. 19—Governor and Mrs, Wilson will give hack to former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller “as soon as possible” the dozens of pieces of modern painting and sculpture from his collection with which he had turned the Executive Mansion virtually into a modern art museum during his administration. In their place, Mrs. Wilson told a news conference here today, the Wilsons hope to hang changing exhibits of paintings lent by museums around the state under the auspices of the Stale Council on the Arts. “These are Governor Rockefeller's things, and I'd like them to get hack in his hands as soor, as possible,” Mrs. Wilson said as she led about 20 reporters and upstate women's editors on a tour past the Picasso tapestries and hold abstract expressionist canvases that cover the walls of the old mansion's public rooms. She said that Mr. Rockefeller, who left office yesterday, had bought a set of Currier & Ives reproductions as a permanent gift for some of the mansion's smaller rooms. Mrs. Wilson often fell into the habit of the past 15 years and said, “the Governor” when she referred to her husband's predecessor. “I have to keep remembering to say not the Governor, but Governor Rockefeller,” she said at one point with a grin. Mrs. Wilson said that no specific arrangements for the art exhibitions had been made yet, but she left no doubt that her own taste ran to the more traditional. “I'm sure these paintings are beautiful,” she said after looking for a few moments at “Three Color Space,” a large painting by Helen Frankenthaler in the dining room. “They don't really have any meaning for me.” The news conference actually a tea with tea and coffee poured from a silver tea service — lasted nearly two hours, and Katharine Wilson showed herself to be a poised veteran of 32 years of marriage to a politician. She was warm, relaxed and quite often funny, as when she commented on her husband's disclosure earlier in the day that their home telephone in Yonkers had a listed number. Time for Humor She said that her husband had insisted on the public number, and that over the years she had become so tired of answering crank telephone calls that, “I've told Malcolm T'm just going to call up the telephone company, find out the salary of an operator and demand that he pay me the same salary.” Mrs. Wilson said she had found her husband's swearing‐in as Governor yesterday “a very emotional moment.” “If I were the sort who wept over things, I'd put my head down on the pillow and have a good cry at the enormity of it all,” she said, “Malcolm's wanted to be Governor for so long, I feel we've both been blessed. Because only female reporters were invited to the news conference, the after noon tea very nearly became a tempest in a teapot within the predominantly male Albany press corps. Mrs. Wilson said that she had not meant to exclude men, but that her staff had drawn up the guest list at the suggestions of some local women's page editors. However, Mrs. Wilson said that she did not think a gathering for women only was such a bad idea after all. “Men are more limited,” she said, “Whenever they call me up, they're always pressing me on whether Malcolm is going to run for another term, or when he's going to change his stand on abortion, things I will never talk about in public. Women are more interested in the whole picture—the house, history, not only politics.” Mrs. Wilson said that because her husband was away so much while their two daughters, Kathy and Anne, were growing up, “I had to make a life for myself and find my own interests.” “I feel women have an enormous amounte to contribute and in the broad, big picture we are often ignored,” she added. She also made it clear, however, that she sees herself as a traditional wife whose “principal function in life is to be supportive of my husband.” She said that in an argument not too long ago—“I'm Irish; I get hot under the collar”—she had exclaimed: “Oh, Malcolm, you're nothing but a male chauvinist.” Then, she said, she stopped and asked her husband, “What does chauvinist mean, anyway?”"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/23/archives/the-region-in-summary-a-new-governor-prepares-to-run-for-governor.html,"Governor Malcolm Wilson has offered a preview, of how he will run his new administration and his undeclared campaign for a full term: with emphasis on fiscal conservatism, a respect for political pragmatism and a talent for ideological flexibility. His emerging style manifested itself on the following issues during a press conference last week: • On drugs,, he used former Governor Rockefeller's narcotics program as an opportunity to stress his own fiscal conservatism and discreetly disengage from some of his predecessor's policies. Mr. Wilson said he didn't think it would be necessary to create many of the 52 remaining judgeships—at more than $600,000 for each court part in New York City where most would be located —authorized for the tough narcotics law engineered by Mr. Rockefeller. • Mr. Wilson, a Roman Catholic, said that while he is personally opposed to abortion, the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down state restrictions removes abortion as a state issue. • On the politically vital issue of state aid for mass transportation, the new Governor is confident that budget officials will be able to find enough state money to loan New York City $100‐million to preserve the subway fare at 35 cents at least temporarily. Politically, a unified Republican front was very much on Mr. Wilson's mind. Along with his recent chief, the new Governor led the applause, at a State Republican Committee meeting, for Assembly’ Speaker Perry B. Duryea. Along with five others, Mr. Duryea pleaded not guilty recently to charges of violating the Election Law stemming from an alleged scheme to siphon votes from Democrats to help insure Republican control of the Assembly. Mr. Duryea was Mr. Wilson's most serious rival for the Republican gubernatorial nomination until the indictment. As for Mr. Rockefeller, who is expected to make one final bid for the Presidency, he turned to a group of well‐wishers after Mr. Wilson's inauguration, flashed his famous grin and said: “I'm free!” Betting the Trots: More Rig Than Meets the Eye? The billion‐dollar harness racing industry, shaken by a race‐fixing scandal at two New York tracks, now faces the problem of reassuring the bettor he is risking his money on an honest race. The tentative conclusion of experts is that there is no foolproof system to monitor the conduct of a trotting race. The fixers, according to a Federal indictment, included some of the top drivers in the country. In more than three months this year, they allegedly made $3‐million at Roosevelt and Yonkers raceways rigging the superfecta races, in which a bettor must pick the first four finishers in order. The superfecta has been banned at New York tracks since April 13. According to one specialist, there seems little likelihood that even expert observers can determine the intent of a driver. In harness racing, a horse can go offstride without design and a driver may be boxed in and slowed down without connivance. It was the suspicious betting patterns at Offtrack Betting Corporation parlors, rather than any behavior at the track, that first prompted a year‐ long federal investigation. The result was the indictment of 28 men, including three of the nations top four money‐winning harness drivers, Del Insko, president of the National Association of Harness Drivers, William (Buddy) Gilmour and Carmine Abbatiello. The others named were mostly those who had placed bets and cashed winning, tickets. Federal authorities said the ring arranged that certain horses would fail to finish among the first four, or that a certain horse would finish in an agreed upon position. By limiting the possibilities, the ring was then able to buy multiple tickets on the remaining horses in combinations at a minimal cost. Despite the concern of many harness tracks about a crisis of public confidence, many fans responded to the scandal with fatalism, appearing to accept fixed races as part of the game. Half‐Fare Results Are Not Half Bad The first results of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's two‐ridesfor‐the‐price‐of‐one experiment seem to show that where the need for public transportation is great, many more people are eager to take advantage of cheaper fares, but where ridership is marginal, even bargain prices fail to lure many additional riders. The M.T.A. reported that last Sunday, when it tried the half‐fare experiment, 42 per cent more people rode the subways, 90 per cent more were on buses and 54 per cent more on the Long Island Rail Road in comparison with the previous Sunday. However, there were only small increases or actual declines for Nassau County bus lines and the Harlem, Hudson and New Haven lines of the Penn Central. M.T.A. officials said that although a single week is no basis to draw conclusions about the experiment, observers at various stations saw many more families traveling than usual, despite poor weather. It was not clear if the weather acted as an incentive for people to leave their cars at home, or if it was a deterrent, preventing even more people from using the plan. Crime and Public Officials: 1 Week While thousands of civil servants worked honestly and effectively last week in the city and state bureaucracies, there were several developments that did little to restore public confidence in government: Norman A. Levy, on leave as president of the City Tax Commission, and John R. Fratianni, on leave as deputy commissioner of the City Purchase Department, were convicted of scheming to fix 2,000 parking tickets. Louis A. Reiter who was dismissed in 1970 as director of the $135‐million Municipal Loan Program, was convicted of extortion, bribetaking and the acceptance of unlawful gratuities growing out of a swindle in the city's alum rehabilitation loan program. Frederic S. Rice, the city's tax collector, who took a leave of absence from his job last month, was indicted on charges of filing “false and fraudulent” state income‐tax returns. William H. Steinman, 65, an assistant administrator to State Controller Arthur Levitt and a veteran of more than 40 years in municipal service, was indicted for attempted bribery, conspiracy and grand larceny in an effort to gain lenient treatment for a criminal defendant in Brooklyn. ...Jack Schwartz and Harriet Heyman"
"As to Violence, This Family Feels That TV Goes ‘Too Far’",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/23/archives/as-to-violence-this-family-feels-that-tv-goes-too-far-abhors.html,"The Howard Ettinger family, a very middle class foursome from Peter Cooper Village, came face‐to‐Tube this fall with what has been called television's most permissive season. There, by the luminescent glow in their spacious and colorful two‐bedroom apartment, the Ettingers have encountered violence and sex —rape, abortion, male homosexuality, and at least one lesbian psychiatrist. And just last night, they learned that Edith Bunker had a lump In her breast. The lump (benign) was removed, and Edith, we assume, will return to being her lovable “dingbat” self next week on the Columbia Broadcasting System's “All in the Family.” What do the Ettingers, this typical middle class family, think about the new permissiveness? Have they written protest letters? Have they boycotted sponsors of controversial programs on this traditionally “family” medium? Have they kicked in, the picture tubes of their two television sets? No. But there are certain subjects that the parents object to, certain areas where they think television has gone “too far.” And when this happens, they order their two daughters, Helaine, 11, and Lois, 8, both students at the United Nations International School, either to turn off the television set or watch another program. Abhors Violence “Violence—that's my main restriction — violence for violence's sake,” said Ella Ettinger, the wife and mother of the household. “When we happen to read or hear that a program will be violent, we ask the girls not to watch it. I say something like, ‘That program is a real must‐miss.’ ” She said she would also object to their watching a program that included a rape scene, one in which criminals were portrayed sympathetically, or one that had gratuitous sex. Mr. Ettinger added that he wouldn't approve of his children watching on television such movies as “In Cold Blood” or “Fuzz” (in which teen‐agers set fire to a derelict.) But both parents strongly agree that no matter how much they disapprove of a particular program, they think the networks have the right to show it. And when asked how they would reply if a pollster asked them whether they regarded the current crop of television fare as too permissive, both quickly replied: “No.” According to a recent nationwide poll commissioned by TV Guide, almost 40 per cent of those questioned said they think television is a lot more open and frank than it should be. In addition, almost two‐thirds said they think there's too much violence on television, and 41 per cent are sure that too much time is devoted to shows dealing with sexual topics. “I want the girls to see as much of the real world as tastefully possible,” said Mr. Ettinger, 45, who owns and operates the Cleaners 57 dry cleaning establishment at 356 East 57th Street. “The kind of world they're growing up in is so different from mine. Their mobility is restricted because of the crime situation — they don't go anywhere without us so I would like TV to bring them as much reality as possible. When you don't have reality, that's a distortion.” In the TV Guide poll, 55 per cent said they think there should be a rating system for television programs similar to that for movies. The Ettingers count themselves among the 31 per cent who disagree with such a plan. “I find that ratings in movies don't meet my standards, either,” Mrs. Ettinger said. “Violence is usually acceptable, and nudity is not. I have such a thing about violence.” The parents have made rules, not always strictly adhered to, as to when their daughters can watch television. Generally, these hours are from 7 to 9 P.M. during the week, but it is not uncommon for the girls to stay up until 10 or 10:30. On weekends, they are allowed to watch until 11. Allowed to Watch Each member of the family has a different favorite program. Mr. Ettinger's is “Maude,” and last year's controversial abortion episode was not censored in the Ettinger household. “I know my mother would have been shocked if she knew what I was letting the girls see,” Mrs. Ettinger admitted. “But Howard and I both favor abortion, and we were delighted that the network presented it.” Helaine, a sixth‐grade student who gets top grades, cut in: “Oh, that show didn't shock me. I thought it was kind of silly.” Mrs. Ettinger's favorite program is “Mary Tyler Moore,” in which recent episodes have dealt briefly with menstruation, The Pill, and the fact that Mary may have stayed all night with one of her boyfriends. “I think she's a swingy lady,” said Mrs. Ettinger, fulltime housewife. “I have no objections to that show.” Found Show Funny Helaine's pet program is the soon‐to‐be dropped “Adam's Rib,” television's bone to the women's movement. It features a pair of married lawyers (Ken Howard and Blythe Danner) who are often seen cavorting in bed together. “It's a funny program but not so that I can't understand it,” Helaine said. “It's not like ‘All in the Family.’ That show is more adult than I am.” “You can say that again,” added kid sister Lois. Lois's favorite program is “The Waltons,” the Depression era family series, where the father and mother have been known to display nighttime affection for each other. Mr. and Mrs. Ettinger said they saw nothing wrong with letting their daughters see programs that show a couple in bed, (Carl Reiner, producer of the “Dick Van Dyke Show,” recently announced he was leaving the show after an episode was canceled by C.B.S. because it concerned a child's discovery of her parents in the act of love in their bedroom.) Sees Nothing Wrong “It would not be desirable personal experience, said Mr. Ettinger, “but I would see nothing wrong with having the girls see two people in bed together on television.” At this point, Lois interjected: “Oh, we always see our parents in bed together. Nothing's wrong with that.” The Ettinger family also has a list of most‐hated television programs. Mrs. Ettinger can't stand the late movies shown on A.B.C's Wide World of Entertainment; Mr. Ettinger used to leave the room whenever anybody watched the now‐defunct “Bridget Loves Bernie,” and the two girls can't bear to watch cops‐and‐robbers shows a la “Mannix” and “Barnaby Jones.” “I don't see any point to those programs,” said Helaine, tugging on her long dark hair. “The star is always going to win the case eventually, and I just don't like to see people getting hit over the head all the time.” Mr. Ettinger, who is Jewish, said his objections to “Bridget Loves Bernie,” which received numerous protests from Jewish groups because it dealt with the intermarriage of a Jewish cab driver and a Roman Catholic school teacher, were not based on ethnic or religious considerations. “I just thought it was a lousy program,” he said. “Nobody came off well in that program, especially the writers.” Helaine: “The Jewish mother and father were both definite stereotypes, always crying and trying to make you eat good.” Mrs. Ettinger: “But the Catholics came out the worst of all. The mother was stupid and the father drank all of the time.” The family has seen a number of programs that dealt in one way or another with homosexuality in the last year. The girls were allowed to watch these, and the whole family had praise for the highly acclaimed made‐for‐television movie, “That Certain Summer,” about a male homosexual trying to explain to his young son about his relationship with another man. “In school, everybody knows about that,” Helaine said, with a nonchalant wave of her hand. “It's when two men love each other, or two females love each other. I liked the program, but it sort of confused me. It's not what I expected a homosexual couple to be like. I thought they would be a little more affectionate — like my parents are.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/25/archives/letters-to-the-editor-the-war-powers-act.html,"To the Editor: Senator Eagleton asserted in a Dec. 3 Op‐Ed article that the new War Powers Act is a dangerous law which confers broad new powers on the President and reduces the Congress to a “secondary role” in the decision to commit armed forces to hostilities abroad. I respectfully disagree. The Senator contends that the act delegates away the Congressional power to declare war by specifically authorizing the President to commit the armed forces to hostilities without the prior consent of Congress. If past Presidents had not already in fact freely exercised the power to make such commitments independently, I would agree with the Senator. History shows, however, that Congress had already delegated this power away a number of years ago. The War Powers Act attempted to bring the expansive Presidential exercise of war powers within some acceptable boundaries that both recognized the demands of global foreign policy and reaffirmed the Congressional constitutional responsibility for taking the nation to war. The act does permit the President to act unilaterally for a period of sixty days (ninety if troop safety considerations require it). But unless the Congress ratifies his action, his provisional authority to commit the troops expires automatically at the end of sixty days. However, if at any time the Congress disapproves of his action, it may, by the passage of a concurrent resolution, require the immediate disengagement of troops. Past Presidents exercised their power to act independently without any specific statutory authorization. Under the War Powers Act there is not only a time limit on the President's powers but also a statutory procedure whereby the Congress can require the disengagement by a simple majority vote in both houses. Attempts to define specifically the powers that the President possesses for future situations unnecessarily concedes power the Congress should be retaining. The act as now drafted avoids this pitfall. It not only places time restrictions on the President's use of force without the prior consent of the Congress, but it also makes the grant of authority conditional, subject to Congressional approval. This provides that the Congress is able to review all of the actions of the President, not just those actions which fall outside a statutory definition. Such a result seems fully consonant with the intent of the Constitution. PIERRE S. du PONT U.S. Representative from Delaware Washington, Dec. 14, 1973 To Save Fuel To the Editor: With our current energy crisis, it seems to me that a great deal of electricity, and therefore oil, coal and natural gas, could be saved if people were reminded of their ability to help. If radio and television stations were to announce hourly a reminder for people to check and see if there were any unnecessary lights or appliances on, we could save a worthwhile amount of power. If only 10 per cent of New York's eight million people turned off one 100‐watt light, Consolidated Edison would save 80,000 kilowatts. If this were to happen all over the country, the saving would be tremendous. The amazing thing about this is that it wouldn't cost anything and would do much to alleviate the wasted use of energy. I am sure that after a few months people would become deaf to these announcements, but until then the savings would be tremendous and worthwhile. JON J. BLOOMBERG New York, Dec. 4, 1973 • Energy: A Storm Alert To the Editor: Despite its inconveniences, the sudden gasoline shortage is not all a misfortune. It exposes reality. Momentarily, we have the highhanded ukase of Mr. Shultz and Co. that gas should be priced out of reach of the average citizen, the arrogant blocking of highways by the truckers and the usual Presidential impotence to act with intelligence. But the restrictions will diminish air pollution, encourage development of better sources of energy—the sun, the tides, the winds—as well as the chemical treatment of refuse and the safer use of atomic energy. It will discourage the lobby‐inspired subsidy of motordom, particularly trucking and excessive flying (why air‐freight, for example?) in favor of existing and handicapped rail and public transportation. It will slow down immoderate suburbanism and help restore living where the work is. It will necessitate ample bus transportation, as it exists in every civilized country but ours, and it will stimulate more home life and better neighborliness. It will instruct government that it can no longer afford to discriminate recklessly against, or insult, lessfavored nations abroad. Above all, it will teach us the folly of the unparalleled wastefulness of our era in the overexploitation of resources and teach us to distinguish between necessity and extravagance. It is time to take in sail, and since our leaders have for years been indifferent to storm warnings, the storm itself now alerts us. ERNST BACON Orinda, Calif., Dec. 9, 1973 Unwed Mothers To the Editor: Fatigue, the Washington malaise, or clever manipulation by Senator Buckley may explain the swift passage of the Senate amendments to H.R. 3153. They cannot excuse such cavalier disposition of the lives of thousands of needy girls and women who are still treated as the “invisible poor.” [Editorial Dec. 5.] The bill, as amended by Senator Buckley, would deny to poor women the right to abortion services from Medicaid. When seen against a background of studies such as Kinsey's, in which a sample of unmarried pregnant white girls showed that only 5 per cent resulted in out‐of‐wedlock births, the racism of such legislation is apparent. It is evident as well in the absence of white children available for adoption and in the unmet need of nonwhite children for adoption. This same bill would impose on states the duty to compel unmarried mothers to identify putative fathers and cooperate in prosecuting them for support. Refusal to do so would result in removal of the mother from the budget and the making of payments for the child only to a third party. The right of the mother, having sole custody, to decide what is in her child's and her own best interest concerning a biological father who has neither recognized nor supported his child would thus be denied. Nothing in law today prevents an absent father from recognizing his illegitimate child, providing support or seeking the right of visitation. Therefore, neither the rhetoric about concern for the child's right to receive, support or to inherit from the putative father nor about concern for the rights of the biological father can obscure the true targets: amelioration of tax burdens and punishment of unmarried poor mothers without due regard for the interest of the child. There is no justification for “social” legislation that will impose further discriminatory practices on poor girls or women and their children. Earlier legislation denying assistance to families, when an unemployed father was in the home, forced many fathers to desert so that their families could receive necessities for life. Is a similar approach now to cause children to be deserted by their only caring parent as violation of the right to privacy is made part of the price exacted for aid? Senator Buckley may be blind to the right of a child to be wanted by at least one parent. I hope the Senators concerned with the essential rights of children and the poor will now turn their efforts to correcting the destructive features of the present bill in conference. “Denial and coercion” must nor become the new name of the social welfare game.

Defending Rationing To the Editor: As an economist, I was somewhat taken back by the one‐sidedness of the Dec. 11 letter from thirteen members of the economics department faculty at Princeton University. Although I agree with their statement that “any rationing scheme would necessarily be extremely complex, cumbersome, slow, inefficient and costly,” I do not agree with the remainder of their comments. Indeed, the disadvantages of relying on the price mechanism may outweigh the costs of rationing. I doubt that the Princeton signers could present conclusive proof that rationing under the price system would result in any less “lost employment production and consumer welfare” than would any other so‐called “arbitrary” rationing scheme—even the price mechanism would have the effect of denying energy to some sector of our economy. Government rationing at least offers the attractive advantage of allowing policy‐makers to select, “arbitrarily” or otherwise, who would be denied energy, thus minimizing the total intpact of the shortage on the economy. The price mechanism allows no such flexibility, and the result would be that less essential goods and services (i.e., the private aircraft industry) continue to exist amid a shortage (which is not to say an absence) of more essential goods and services (i.e., food production). [Editorial Nov. 27.] I was also surprised that the Princeton writers failed to point out that a gasoline tax would be regressive in one sense, even while being mildly progressive in the sense they cited. As Senator Mansfield, among others, has noted, a high gasoline tax would be a significant burden on lower‐ and middle‐class commuters without transportation alternatives and others who must drive to live while being a negligible burden on wealthy pleasure drivers; the mere fact that such a tax burden might be lightened by a tax advantage does not help the lowincome driver who must pay for gasoline weekly but cannot collect his tax advantage until April of each year. Finally, I take issue with their concluding comments. Certainly it is true that “if . . . demand exceeds supply, the remedy must limit someone's consumption,” But, unlike the price mechanism, a rationing system would not result in “only the consumption of others” being curtailed. A rationing system allows some kind of equitable distribution to all users; the price mechanism, on the other hand, allows big business and wealthy individuals to consume disproportionately the limited fuel available at the expense of small business and less fortunate individuals. I believe that limiting consumption by a combination of higher taxes and government rationing, while admittedly less efficient in some sense than higher taxes alone, is the more equitable alternative. (Capt.) KENT E. KRAUS Instructor, U.S. Military Academy West Point, N. Y., Dec. 11, 1973 The Super‐Minister To the Editor: The world has been witnessing the sorry spectacle of Sheik Ahmed Zaki al‐Yamani's becoming the Foreign Minister of such formerly sovereign nations as Great Britain, France, West Germany, Japan and Italy, among many others. Let us hope that he, does not replace Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State of the United States of America. MURRAY ROCKOWITZ Flushing, N. Y., Dec. 11, 1973 • Scotch for Truman? To the Editor: In his Dec. 8 Op‐Ed article, Robert Sherrod gives a more accurate account of the Wake Island meeting between President Truman and General. Douglas MacArthur than did Merle Miller—at least in my recollection, since as Ambassador at Large I was in the party which was at the meeting. I venture to say this although I. agree with Sherrod as to “the fallibility of old men's memories.” But no one who knew Harry Truman will believe Sherrod's statement that the President “sipped his Scotch neat . . .” Harry Truman always drank bourbon and called for “a spiash of branch water” with it. PHILIP C. JESSUP Norfolk, Conn., Dec. 10, 1973 • The Ultimate Donation To the Editor: If the United States would give a substantial estate inheritance tax exemption to people who donate their bodies to medical research such as to the American Kidney Fund, the Eye Bank and the Heart Association, it would finally be giving to a worthy cause. Just think, isn't this more important than or at least equal in importance to works of art, buildings or other material items which now receive tax exemptions? I feel many more people, to protect their families financially and medically, would become contributors to the most wonderful asset we have, health. The Government would finally be making an all‐out effort on behalf of medical science. FREDRIC H. GOLDIN New York, Dec. 12, 1973"
GREEN BERETS AID PHILIPPINE ISLAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/26/archives/green-berets-aid-philippine-island-give-birth-control-devices-and.html,"MANILA, Dec. 25 (AP)—A Jesuit group in the Philippines has accepted an $82,000 American grant to promote birth control in Asia. The grant comes at a time when Roman Catholic bishops here have been Circulating a letter assailing a campaign to persuade couples to use contraceptive devices. The bishops' stand is in line with Pope Paul VI's reaffirmation in 1968 of the church's opposition to the use of contraceptives. The Rev. James B. Reuter, secretary of the Jesuits Engaged in Social Communications in East Asia, says, however, that the two groups are not necessarily in conflict. Sterilization Is Feared “We are frying to promote family planning on a voluntary basis in an effort to head off the possibility of involuntary sterilization, which is objectionable to us,” said Father Reuter, who is also the head of the Jesuits' office for mass media in the Philippines. He will direct the program, which is made possible by the grantirom Family Planning International Assistance, a division of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. According to the Jesuit group's description of the project, Which is to be conducted throughout Fast Asia, its “unifying goal will be to influence clerical and lay leaders in each country and to move family planning from its present position as an activity on the pehiphery of the church into the mainstream of Catholic action.” The emphasis will be to legitimize the involvement of Catholics in family planning programs,” it is added. ‘Methods Outside Man’ In the pastoral letter the bishops said that while the church did not want “unlimited procreation of children, we are worried about the current massive campaign to talk couples into accepting a number of mechanical and chemical contraceptives, which are but external means of control.” “We deplore the fact that all these methods depend on something outside man or on some external artificial control,” the bishops added. Although the Philippine population is at least 80 per cent Roman Catholic, the Government, backed by the United States Agency for International Development, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and private agencies such as the Ford Foundation, has begun one of the largest birth ‐ control programs in the world. The population, estimated at 43 million, is growing at a rate of about 3.3 per cent annuallly, a pace unmatched in Asia except Pakistan: The bishops are also worried abode possible forced sterilization. Their letter said, “There has been adopted as the principtal solution to the population program massive conception control through the artificial contraceptive approach. “This approach has followed a common pattern of development in countries where it has been aspoused. The patterns show an escalation from the less radical to the more radical measures of sterilization and abortion. Affluent Societies Blamed The bishops' letter blamed affluent societies, such as the United States, for scarcities that have inspired birth‐control programs. “When a people constituting 6 per cent of the world's populatitin consume 40 per cent of its goods, the scarcity suffered by the 94 per cent is not due to their large number,” it asserted. “When confronted with a family that is unable to care for the children, the accusing finger, should not always be pointed at the family. When the structure of the community encourages affluence of a few at the expense of the many, destitute families are victims rather than culprits. And what is true of families is also true of larger communities, of regions and of nations.” In its project outline for the grant, the Jesuit group conceded, “To date, however, the Catholic Church in Asia has not supported family planning.” A New Catholic Role It added: “Asia appears ready for a major change in the Catholic involvement in population programs, Its focal point is the Philippines, where the strong position of the Catholic Church will be a major factor in determining the attitude of the church toward family planning in Asia.” The program will use films, television, radio and pamphlets in trying to affect attitudes among church leaders in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, South Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which was formerly Ceylon. Although the Jesuits' proposal makes no mention of methods of family planning, one of the conditions of the grant requires a report on “the amounts of contraceptives by type and quantity used and on hand at the end of each quarter and grant year.”"
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/28/archives/letters-to-the-editor-to-meet-the-energy-crisis-need-for-new.html,"To the Editor: There are about a million long‐haul trucks operating on our highways today. These tractor‐trailer rigs move about 22 per cent of our freight. They do so while consuming almost ten billion gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline—about 10 per cent of that sold commercially. At the same time, trains move almost 39 per cent of our intercity freight and do so on considerably less energy. In fact, the U.S. Department of Transportation says that it takes more than four times as much energy to move freight by truck than by rail. At a time when truck drivers are blocking highways as blackmail, shouldn't we be looking toward our railroads to cut energy demand? A recent D.O.T. report shows that we can reduce diesel fuel use 35 per cent by shifting half the intercity trucking to rail. This country need not yield to trucker blackmail. As Richard Nixon said recently, each of us is going to have to bear some burden of the energy crisis. He certainly didn't exclude the trucking industry. BRIAN T. KETCHAM New York; Dec. 11, 1973 To the Editor: Now that there is official recognition of an energy crisis—in plain talk a fuel shortage—it may be possible to put an end to one type of urban insanity that causes enormous waste: the artificially induced mass traffic jams created by toll collections on bridges and throughways. Imagine the incalculable waste that has been occurring over the years in fuel, time and tempers by the sometimes miles‐long bumper‐to‐bumper vehicular back‐ups on the major river crossings. And the present administration has even contemplated installing toll gates on additional river crossings such as the 59th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. I can't imagine anything more counterproductive. Surely, we can design more intelligent solutions to these sources of city revenue. For example, a general tax on all vehicles calculated to equal present toll gate income. Better yet, a vehicle tax sufficiently high to discourage needless ownership and use of automobiles. Of course, the necessary complement to such a policy requires serious improvements in efficient and comfortable public transport. I have long believed that the sub The Times welcomes letters from readers. Letters for publication must include the writer's name, address and telephone number. Because of the large volume of mail received, we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters. ways and buses should be totally free to all riders and could even include special cars for metropolitan freight delivery. Such a policy could be subsidized by intelligent, progressive taxation sufficient to cover operating, maintenance and capital improvement costs. If greater rationality and longrange planning for mass urban transport is forced upon us by the present and anticipated fuel shortages, the energy crisis may in the long run be a good thing. RAYMOND C. LERNER Flushing, N. Y., Dec. 4, 1973 ● To the Editor: In response to a putative energy crisis we ara rushing headlong into a number of rash actions. The country is about to shift to year‐round daylight saving time; that daylight will be saved at the expense of school children's lives, as forgetful young children waiting for school buses in the dark run in and out of streets. (Integration or not, there is no way children in many suburban and country districts can walk to school—and is walking in the dark any safer?) Yet there is no evidence of energy saving from daylight savings. Children will be exposed to danger for the sake of a symbolic gesture. More recently, our new energy czar proposes to cut down street lighting —another step toward highway carnage. Yet we have not taken some other concrete steps that would save energy with more bearable costs—a nationwide Sabbath closing law for stores for example. (In Florida and elsewhere, seven‐day store operation, all year round, is common.) The more drastic step of rationing could also, I think, find acceptance. Every day additional gruesome inanities flow out of Washington. Daylight savings and reduced street lighting are just two of the latest. One shudders in anticipation of what might follow. (Asst. Prof.) DANIEL R. FREDLAND Florida State University Tallahassee, Fla., Dec. 14, 1973 ● Need for New Systems To the Editor: May I suggest a postscript to the thoughtful recent Op‐Ed comment by Henry Ford 2d. Mr. Ford points out that: “For all its flexibility, the car is not the best possible way to get to or move around in very busy places. For all its efficiency in carrying large numbers of people along busy corridors, mass transit is not flexible enough. This leads to my final conclusion. What we need . . . are new kinds of vehicles and systems designed to carry people quickly, conveniently and efficiently where neither cars nor conventional transit can do the job as well.” Another “final conclusion” is possible: What we need is to guide urban growth into “busy places,” which means walking downtown centers, and clustered housing developments, which means attractive housing on smaller lots, terrace apartments and the like. Then many, many more trips will become feasible by the “new systems” we really need in addition to the more efficient autos Mr. Ford promises. JOHN P. KEITH President, Regional Plan Association New York, Dec. 14, 1973 • For a Total Ban On Leghold Traps To the Editor: Your Nov. 27 editorial outlined many of the reasons why The Humane Society seeks a total ban on the use of the vicious, barbaric and nonselective steel jaw leghold trap. The trap slams shut with bonecrushing impact and holds the victim in a vise‐like grip. Many animals in pain or terror chew or twist off their legs to escape. Far too many are “nontarget” species, such as dogs, cats or waterfowl. The record of the Humane Society of the United States, New Jersey Branch, and the files of the Humane Society of the United States in Washington also contain reports of children and adults who accidentally triggered these devices while walking in wooded areas; they speak first‐hand of the shock and pain inflicted. Why do our citizens not put an immediate stop to use of such an inhumane device? With all the pressing injustices that need correcting in today's world, cruelty to animals is still very far down on that mythical list of wrongs to correct. Some people simplistically equate concern for animal abuse with a total preoccupation and empathy only for the animals. Such is not the case. Compassion and respect for animals ennobles one's own self‐respect for dignity. An attitude of compassion for animals brings forth a desire that that same respect and regard be accorded our fellow man. The leghold trap must be one of the most sadistic devices civilized man still uses to torture his fellow creatures. It is vicious, Totally banning its use, and manufacture, could indeed he “one giant step for mankind.” W. J. O'HARA Executive Director Humane Society, New Jersey Branch Elizabeth, N. J., Dec. 12, 1973 Abortion Law: ‘Inhumane’ To the Editor: Admittedly, Governor Rockefeller has some significant achievements to his credit. However, I was utterly appalled to read the editorial of Dec. 12: “Nevertheless, even as he moved steadily toward the right in his political positions, Mr. Rockefeller was capable of occasional brave flashes in support of principle. One such was his veto last year of a highly emotional measure enacted by the Legislature, with applause from President Nixon, that would have repealed this state's model abortion law.” What “principle” could possibly justify the deliberate destruction of human life? How could Governor Rockefeller's veto possibly be considered “brave”? If reverence for life is “emotional,” then perhaps emotion is our most urgent need today. As a citizen of this state, as well as a human being, I am profoundly ashamed of the liberal abortion law of New York State. To call 't a “model abortion law” defies comprehension. Is it not in ??ality a model of inhuman disre >>ard for the gift of life? The United States faces many crises: integrity of its leaders, energy for every day living, among the mist current needs However, I strongly believe that no crisis is as urgent as the decline in reverence and respect for life. Could this possibly be a root cause for many of our other problems? If we have deplored the atrocities against life that were committed during wars, particularly in World War II, can we possibly be blind to the similar directions our own country is taking, especially in regard to the tragic Supreme Court decision which supported abortion? Sister KAREN THERESA GAUBE Amsterdam, N. Y., Dec. 13, 1973 Services, Rents and Fuel To the Editor: The New York City Office of Rent Control has threatened to reduce the rents in apartment houses in which the landlord is not supplying sufficient heat in full compliance with the law. This despite the fuel‐oil shortage and the skyrocketing of prices to almost double those of last year. On the other hand, the city recently announced that because of a cutback in their gasoline supplies, it would be forced to curtail essential public services as much as 20 per cent. It seems to me that if the city reduces apartment rentals for diminution of services to tenants, then the landlords should demand that the city reduce their real‐estate taxes for failure to provide such essential services which the city should provide to property owners and tacpayers under the law. LEON BERKULE New York, Dec. 7, 1973 Root Cause of Army's Poor Discipline To the Editor: I am in complete agreement with Mr. Lawlor's observation (Letters, Dec. 10) that “the volunteer army probably could not effectively respond in the event of an immediate outside military threat to our country.” However, I cannot accept one of the two fundamental reasons to which he attributes this condition, namely that “the Army's disciplinary system has been diluted to such an extent that any semblance of discipline is an impossibility.” This is a typical statement expressed by the military which places the blame for lack of discipline on our civilian “misinformed lawmakers” who, according to Mr. Lawlor, have “bound the hands of the Army's leadership and in doing so negated the most important element of any Army: discipline.” Such a theory is sheer nonsense and serves only to shift the blame to individuals who have no significant effect on discipline. The blame for this lack of discipline should be placed where it truly belongs — on the shoulders of the Officer Corps of the Armed Forces. I am a Trial Counsel (prosecutor) at Fort Dix. From my personal observations of the operation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, it appears that no one's hands are bound in any manner whatsoever as to preclude the maintenance of good order and discipline. What is causing this lack of discipline is the extremely poor quality of leadership of the Officer Corps, and the unwillingness of the Officer Corps to accept the responsibility for this lack of discipline and take appropriate corrective measures. Discipline is a function of leadership. Where effective leadership exists, discipline will also exist. Leadership is not the ability of superiors to enact severe punishment upon their subordinates for breach of regulations. This is “negative leadership” — leadership which produces a type of pseudodiscipline based on fear of punishment. The eventual effect of this type of leadership is the lack of discipline which surfaced during the Vietnam era and continues in today's Armed Forces. “Positive Leadership” is the ability of the superior to influence the actions of his subordinates so that subordinates react out of a loyalty toward and a willingness to perform well for their superiors, even under the most rigorous conditions such as those which exist in combat. This is the only truly effective type of leadership—yet positive leadership is almost nonexistent in today's Armed Forces. It does not exist because the leaders of today's Armed Forces are unwilling to insist upon utilization of this more difficult positive leadership. Discipline will not be produced by revising an already effective Uniform Code of Military Justice. What is imperative is Congressional scrutiny of, and effective action to correct, the dishonesty, inefficiency, and poor quality of leadership presently existing in the Officer Corps of today's Armed Forces.

"Abortions, Legal for Year, Performed for Thousands",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/31/archives/abortions-legal-for-year-performed-for-thousands-supreme-court.html,"A 30‐year‐old divorcee who was eight weeks pregnant entered the brightly colored offices of Women's Health Seryices, an abortion clinic in downtown Pittsburgh, and withir three hours had had an abortion, rested in the clinic's recovery room, paid the $150 fee and gone home. A year ago the procedure would have been illegal Pennsylvania and in almos every other state, but today almost a year after the Su preme Court ruled that abor tions are legal, similar scenes are being played out in clinics and hospitals in virtually every part of the country. The sweeping change that has resulted from the Court de cision has removed much the social stigma associated with the operation and has taken abortions out of the backrooms of the illegal abor tionist and brought them into the mainstream of moderr medical care. While there are few officia figures on the number of lega abortions performed since Vic Court decision, interviews conducted by The New York Times in a dozen major cities disclose that teas of thousands of abortions are being performed in cities where a year ago it was impossible to obtain the operation. Used False Names “Before the decision, women would come, begging for abortions,” said Marilyn Cringer, counselor for Arkansas Woman's Rights, an abortion referral agency. “Many used false names, and most were extraordinarily concerned over our confidentiality.” “Now, when women cal!, they feel that an abortion is their right,” she added. “We. don't have to assuage their guilt. Women just want the facts—where they can go for the best and least expensive abortion.” The Times survey also indicates that in some states roadblocks, such as restrictive state laws and high prices, still exist for women seeking the operation. However, in most cases, legal abortion facilities can he to‐und in a neligilberilig state, only a few hours' drive away. The Supreme Court ruled last Jan. 22 that all state laws that prohibit or restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy are unconstitutional. The Court also ruled that abortions after the first three months ate also legal but are subject to limited state regulations. For All But 4 States The decision, in effect, overruled laws in all but four states — Alaska, Hawaii, New York and Washington, which already had liberalized laws. Since the decision, there has been a decline in the number of abortions performed in these, states. New York City, where the operation has been legal under a liberalized law since 1970, recently released a report that showed that more than a half million abortions had been performed since the law was enacted. In the year from July 4 1971, to June 30, 1972, before the Supreme Court ruling, 228,094 abortions were performed in the city. In the following year, when the decision was handed down, the number of abortions declined by 15 per cent to 196,224. 22 Clinics in Detroit According to the eity's Health Services Administration, the decline resulted in part from a decrease in the number, of out‐of‐state residents who' sought abortions in New York. Atlanta, which until January was subject to Georgia's stringent anti‐abortion law, now has seven abortion clinics, some of which are performing 100 cases a week. Almost all of the city's hospitals, except for the Roman Catholic ones, are also performing them. Detroit, which serves as an abortion center for much of the Middle West, has 22 abortion clinics and referral agencies listed in the telephone direc.. tory. The average cost for a first trimester abortion at the clinics is $150, while the hospitals charge an average of $350. Second trimester cases can run as high as $1,400 at the hospitals. Not Challenged Until the Massachusetts anti‐abortion law was struck lown by the Supreme Court, most women from the state melting abortions would come New York. This year, the Viassachusetts Depat tment of ?ublic Health estimates that 10,000 women will get aborions in Massachusetts. Most )f these abortions will be perormed during the first three nonths of pregnancy, the agency says. In some states, however, the situation' has not changed despite the Court decision. Arkansas, for example, enforces a state law specifying that abortions may be performed only if the pregnancy “threatens the life or health” of woman. A pro‐abortion group in Little Rock refers its clients to clinics in Dallas or Kansas City, Mo. To date, the Arkansas law has not been challenged ?? court, but an attorney genera ruling has declared it unconstitutional. “It's just easier for a person to go out of state than it is to go through the legal hassles involved in a court case,” an abortion counselor in Little Rock explained. Half Do Not Comply In Virginia, the 1973 session of the state legislature refused to make the Virginia law conform with the Supreme Court ruling. Instead, the General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Court to reconsider its decision. “The General Assembly's action had a chilling effect on doctors and hospitals around the state,” said Mrs. Shalom DuBow, director of the Virginia Civil Liberties Union. “In Virginia, there is still the attitude that abortion is immoral. The General Assembly reinforced that.” After the Court ruling was issued, Virginia's attorney general, Andrew P. Miller, issued an advisory opinion that the state's medical profession should be guided by the Supreme Court ruling rather than by the state's restrictive law. As a result of the conflicting rulings by the state legislature and the attorney general, about 50 per cent of Virginia hospitals still do not comply with the Court ruling. Mrs. DuBow said the state's Civil Liberties Union was seeking a test case to attack the state law. In almost all of the states in which such suits have been filed and ruled upon, the courts have ordered compliance with the supreme court ruling. Hasn't Heard of One In Pennsylvania, a Federal judge ordered the state Depart;ment of Social Welfare to pay abortion costs for those on public assistance. And in Florida, a judge ruled unconstitutional a provision of the state law that required the consent of the patient's parent or spouse before an abortion could be performed. Another apparent effect of the ruling has been to put the illegal abortionists out of business. In Dayton, Ohio, which has a clinic that performs 200 abortions a month, law enforcement officials could not remember the last time an illegal abortionist was apprehended. In Tacoma, Wash., where liberal law was approved in 1970, a state health official said she had not heard of an illegal abortion in several years. “They probably would be less expensive legally,” she said. National organizations that have taken major stands on the abortion law have redirected their efforts in the year since the Court decision. The National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws, known as N.A.R.A.L., has preserved its acronym but has changed its name because the laws have already been repealed. The organization, which was in the forefront of the fight to legalize abortion, is now called the National Abortion Rights Action League. It now concentrates on preserving and enforcing the new laws. The National Right to Life Committee, which tor many years supported the status quo, is now seeking to change the slaw. The group plans to push for a constitutional amendment, in Congress and in the state legislatures, to guarantee the rights of a fetus, thereby nullifying the supreme Court decision."

Hundreds of officers who normally ride in the cars were assigned to foot patrol for the night. The department expects delivery of January's allotment of gasoline to begin today. The severe cutbacks are temporary, it said. [1:6–7.] On the eve of a new administration in New York City, some top members of Mayor Lindsay's cabinet have warned that the impact of Federal policies on the city is equal to, and possibly greater than, that of City Hall. The officials cited the tenfold increase in Federal funds to New York City in the last decade—to $1.7‐billion annually—as well as the effect of Federal policies in areas as diverse as mortgage rates, tax incentives and highway construction. [1:2–3.] New Jersey's Governor‐elect, Brendan T. Byrne, plans to call a special session of the Legislature immediately following the Legislature's usual spring session to deal with school financing and tax reform. Mr, Byrne, who takes office on Jan. 15, said in an interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times that he intended to move as quickly as possible to comply with the State Supreme Court's order to restructure school support in New Jersey.

16 Christian and Jewish Groups Form Abortion Rights Coalition,https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/31/archives/16-christian-and-jewish-groups-form-abortion-rights-coalition.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 30—Sixteen Christian and Jewish religious organizations have formed a National Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights “to safeguard the right of women to use individual freedom of conscience in deciding whether to seek an abortion.” 16 Christian and Jewish Groups Form Abortion Rights Coalition Ray M. S. Tucker, associated with legislative activities of the National Council of Jewish Women, is chairman of the new group. “Abortion is a highly personal decision, one that should be determined by an individual's conscience, not by the dictates of church or state,” she said. “The option of safe and legal abortion must continue Ito he made available. “We will work vigorously to prevent adoption of any amendment which will prohibit the performance of safe legal abortions and will fight efforts to nullify the Supreme Court decision of last year.” Members of the coalition are the Division of Social Ministries of the American Baptist Churches, B'nai B'rith Women, the Washington office of the Church of the Brethren, Catholics for a Free Choice, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Unitarian Universalist Association, the National Council of Jewish Women and the Board of Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ. Also, the Council for Christian Social Action of the United Church of Christ, the Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, the Women's Division of the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church, the Church and Society Unit of the United Presbyterian Church, U.S.A., the Women's Program Unit of the United Presbyterian Church, the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods and the Unitarian Universalist Women's Federation."
"Abortions, Legal for Year, Performed for Thousands",https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/31/archives/abortions-legal-for-year-performed-for-thousands.html,"A 30‐year‐old divorcee who was eight weeks pregnant entered the brightly colored offices of Women's Health Services, an abortion clinic in downtown Pittsburgh, and within three hours had had an abortidn, rested in the clinic's recovery room, paid the $150 fee and gone home. A year ago the procedure would have been illegal in Pennsylvania and in almost every other state, but today, almost a year after the Supreme Court ruled that abortions are legal, similar scenes are being played out in clinics and hospitals in virtually every part of the country. The sweeping change that has resulted from the Court decision has removed much of the social stigma associated with the operation and has taken abortions out of the backrooms of the illegal abortionist and brought them into the mainstream of modern medical care. While there are few official figures on the number of legal abortions performed since the Court decision, interviews conducted by The New York Times in a dozen major cities disclose that tens of thousands of abortions are being performed in cities where a year ago it was impossible to obtain the operation. “Before the decision, women would come begging for abortions,” said Marilyn Cringer, a counselor for Arkansas Woman's Rights, an abortion referral agency. “Many used false names, and most were extraordinarily concerned over our confidentiality.” “Now, when women call, they feel that an abortion is their right,” she added. “We don't have to assuage their guilt. Women just want the facts—where they can go for the best and least expensive abortion.” The Times survey also indicates that in some states roadblocks, such as restrictive state laws and high prices, still exist for women seeking the operation. However, in most cases, legal abortion facilities can be found in a neighboring state, only a few hours' drive away. The Supreme Court ruled last Jan. 22 that all state laws that prohibit or restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy are unconstitutional. The Court also ruled that abortions after the first three months MC also legal but are subject to limited state regulations. The decision, in effect, overruled laws in all but four states — Alaska, Hawaii, New York and Washington, which already had liberalized laws. Since the decision, there has been a decline in the number of abortions performed in these states. New York City, where the operation has been legal under a liberalized law since 1970, recently released a report that showed that more than a half million abortions had been performed since the law was enacted. In the year from July 1, 1971, to June 30, 1972? before the Supreme Court ruling, 228,094 abortions were performed in the city. In the following year, when the decision was handed down, the number of abortions declined by 15 per cent to 196,224. According to the city's Health Services Administration, the decline resulted in part from a decrease in the number of out‐of‐state residents who sought abortions in New York. Atlanta, which until January was subject to Georgia's stringent anti‐abortion law, now has seven abortion clinics, some of which are performing 100 cases a week. Almost all of the city's hospitals, except for the Roman Catholic ones, are also performing them. Detroit, which serves as an abortion center for much of the Middle West, has 22 abortion clinics and referral agencies listed in the telephone directory. The average cost for a first trimester abortion at the clinics is $150, while the hospitals charge an average of $350. Second trimester cases can run as high as $1,400 at the hospitals. Until the Massachusetts anti‐abortion law was struck down by the Supreme Court, most women from the state seeking abortions would come to New York. This year, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health estimates that 40,000 women will get abortions in Massachusetts. Most of these abortions will be performed during the first three months of pregnancy, the agency says. In some states, however, the situation has not changed despite the Court decision. Arkansas, for example, enforces a state law specifying that abortions may be performed only if the pregnancy “threatens the life or health” of a woman. A pro‐abortion group in Little Rock refers its clients to clinics in Dallas or Kansas City, Mo. To date, the Arkansas law has not been challenged In court, but an attorney general ruling has declared it unconstitutional. “It's just easier for a person to go out of state than it is to go through the legal hassles involved in a court case,” an abortion counselor in Little Rock explained. In Virginia, the 1973 session of the state legislature refused to make the Virginia law conform with the Supreme Court ruling. Instead, the General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Court to reconsider its decision. “The General Assembly's action had a chilling effect on doctors and hospitals around the state,” said Mrs. Shalom DuBow, director of the Virginia Civil Liberties Union. “In Virginia, there is still the attitude that abortion is immoral. The General Assembly reinforced that.” After the Court ruling was issued, Virginia's attorney general, Andrew P. Miller, issued an advisory opinion that the state's medical profession should be guided by the Supreme Court ruling rather than by the state's restrictive law. As a result of the conflicting rulings by the state legislature and the attorney general, about 50 per cent of Virginia hospitals still do not comply with the Court ruling. Mrs. DuBow said the state's Civil Liberties Union was seeking a test case to attack the state law. In almost all of the states in which such suits have been filed and ruled upon, the courts have ordered compliance with the Supreme Court ruling. In Pennsylvania, a Federal judge ordered the state Department of Social Welfare to pay abortion costs for those on public assistance. And in Florida, a judge ruled unconstitutional a provision of the state law that required the consent of the patient's parent or spouse before an abortion could be performed. Another apparent effect of the ruling has been to put the illegal abortionists out of business. In Dayton, Ohio, which has a clinic that performs 200 abortions a month, law enforcement officials could not remember the last time an illegal abortionist was apprehended. In Tacoma, Wash, where a liberal law was approved in 1970, a state health official said she had not heard of an illegal abortion in several years. “They probably would be less expensive legally,” she said. National organizations that have taken major stands on the abortion law have redirected their efforts in the year since the Court decision. The National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws, known as N.A.R.A.L., has preserved its acronym but has changed its name because the laws have already been repealed. The organization, which was in the forefront of the fight to legalize abortion, is now tailed the National Abortion Rights Action League. It now concentrates on preserving and enforcing the new laws. The National Right to Life Committee, which for many years supported the status quo, is now seeking to change the law. The group plans to push for a constitutional amendment, in Congress and in the state legislatures, to guarantee the rights of a fetus, thereby nullifying the Supreme Court decision."

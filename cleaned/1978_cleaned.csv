Whither . the World?,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/01/archives/whither-the-world.html,WASHINGTONIf you try to draw up a balance sheet on the condition of the world at the beginning of 1978 a cheeky and even reckless exercise you can at least be fairly sure of some things to put on the credit and debit sides of the line On the good side 1977 was the least turbulent year of the decade and there was more discussion of international cooperation between independent national states than in many years Some progress was made in arms control even in population control and despite the present difficulties between Israel and Egypt substantial gains were made toward a Middle East compromise Also an argument could be made not only that there is now movement toward greater understanding between the races and the generations but that the last quarter of the century may somehow manage to avoid the spectacular worldivide wars and economic tragedies of the first threequarters Even so there is a widespread feeling that something fundamental is missing that the nations are only beginning to recognize the changing nature of world problerhs without really getting the measure of them or seeing the dilemma between nationalism and world order Harlan Cleveland of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies expressed a growing anxiety this way The outside world to which we are reawakening after our long preoccupation with Vietnam Watergate stagflation abortion busing welfare and jobs now looks more than ever uneconomic unjust ungovernable lawless leaderless and lethal He acknowledges that America is regaining its confidence and that it remains the main hope for the creation of more secure world but doesnt like what he sees on the debit side  Robert McNamara president of the World Bank seems to see the problems in much the same way For example  The world of the last years of the 1970s already has a population of over four billion the largest number of human beings everalive at the same timeit will double in the next 40 yearsand despite some reduction in the rate of growth Mr McNamara regards this fact as an even more dangerous and subtle threat to the world than thermonuclear war for it is less subject to rational safeguards     It is clearly a world of increasingly dangerous weapons which are costing all nations according to Mr McNamara 350 billion a year while half of the population of the earth goes to bed hungry every night  It is also a world in which the industrial nations and the Communist nations are increasingly in conflict over ideology or trade or energy or what to do with the multinational corporations of the free world and have no reliable institutions to deal with these new problems of the computer and Nuclear Age  What is going onat the turn of another year however is perhaps third attempt by the United States to use its influence to avoid wars of all sortsblood wars civil wars racial wars trade wars and ideological wars Ideology is out of date President Carter said when he got to Poland on his long journey and he is nowflying around the world like a modern Paul Revere crying not that the British but that chaos and confusion are coming unless the nations change their ways He is saying vaguely and haltingly that the world is going thrbugh another phase of intellectual revision and that the ideals of Wilson and Roosevelt for greater unity in the world are beginning to be discussed again Put another way he is saying what H G Wells said 77 years ago onlynot so eloquently The urgent needfor a great creative effort has become apparent in the affairs of mankind is manifest that unless some unity of purpose can be achieved in the world Unlegs the ever more violent and disastrous incidence of war can be averted unless some common control can be imposed on the headlong waste omans limited inheritance of coal oil and moral energy that is now going on the history of humanity must presently culminate in some `sort of disaster    But what Jimmy Carter is not saying is that maybe there is not enough flexibility in the political world today to deal with its human and economic problems that there is a fundamental conflict between the goals he seeks in the Middle East in Europe Africa and Asia so long as nations merely talk about interdependence and insist on their national independence and rights to do what they please The President has however made a start He is a politician and not writer It was easy for Wells to say that it was inconceivable if people would think steadfastly that there could be any world order without fundamental limitations on national sovereignty But most people are not thinking steadfastly about this and it will probably take years before they lose the delusive comfort of belief in political  nationalism and commercial protectionism So as usual the balance sheet wont really balance The credits are not bad at the end of the old year but the bills are coming in
O'Neill's Record as Speaker Draws Praise,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/02/archives/oneills-record-as-speaker-draws-praise-some-personal-rebuffs-loss.html,WASHINGTON Jan IFriends and foes both Democrats and Republicans generally agree that 1977 was a very good but not unblemished first year for Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts Alhough I dont agree withthe substance the performance is nonetheless impressive said Representative John J Rhodes of Artzpria the conservative  House Republican leader Hes been a superb Speaker said Representative William S Moorehead a moderate Democrat of Pennsylvania a 20year veteran of the House and chairman of a key banking subcommittee Hes brought cohesion to the Democrats a more diverse group than any Speakers had to deal with If theres been any surprise said RepresentativeJohn B Anderson of Illinois the House RePublican whip its that hes exhibited the strength and determination that he has Hes been a very strong Speaker Even RepresentativeRichard L Ottinger a Democrat of Westchester who as  a leader of a group of maverick liberals was an early critic of the now says Hes provided the leadership the House needs without what many of us feared was going to be a heavy hand His colleagties on Capitol Hill believe that to a large extent he has been president Carters mentor on the legislative process and a generally liberal influence on the Administration RAMP Personal Rebuffs Tip helped the President understand the role and prerogatives of the Congress said Representative Benjamin S Rosenthal Democrat of Queens His colleagues give him credit for getting the Presidents energy package through the House almost intact for enactment of a tough code of ethics for the threevote margin with which the House conformed to President Carters decision to cancel future funds for the Bi bomber although he failed to parsuede the House to rescind unused funds for the aircraft for persuading the House to vote additional Social Security taxes and for yielding to public pressure by initiating a broad investigation of House members who may have been involved with Tongsun Park the former Korean intelligence agent who has been indicted for bribing members of Congress He also has taken lumps however and one of his most personal rebuffs was the Houses rejection of a proposed package of managerial reforms that would have placed the chambers housekeeping personnel under his jurisdiction Some members expressed fears that Mr ONeill who repeatedly demonstrated his ability and willingness to use power would amass too much additional power if the measure were approved Loss of Committee Posts On the opening day of the session Mr ONeill consolidated his power over the entire House by shoving through in precisely one hour two dozen rules changes The changes were designed to weaken the already decimated 143meniber Republican contingent by limiting the use of quorum calls and other delaying and obstructive tactics that are the major weapons of a badly Outnumbered minority The rules were rammed down our throats complained Representative Millicent Fenwick Republican of New Jersey expressing the consensus of the indignant opposition To persuade the House rules committee to bring the ethics code to the floor Mr ONeill gently reminded the committee members after a stormy meeting that each of them had been appointed by the Speaker and that their terms expired at the end of the session Nor was this an idle threat Other members of other committees who had been at odds with the Speaker were not reappointed not becalise they had been opposed to me but because they didnt put their pride in their pocket and have the guts to come to ask me to remain on the thing Mr ONeill said When the ethics code reached the floor the Speaker made it clear that it was a vote that would count when members Sought committee appointments campaign funds legislative help and other favors controlled by Mr ONeill Nor did the Speaker take any chances with the Presidents energy package Mr ONeill appointed an ad hoc select committee to deal with the legislation which crossed jurisdictiOnal lines Every Democratic member of that committee was therefore indebted to him Before each major committee vote during the marking up of the bill the Democrats caucused and were bound by the majority decision which reflected the Speakers views Many members believe that the ad hoc committee set a precedent for future complex legislation While he had a bad energy bill he sure as hell got it through the House and he did it in jig time Representative Rhodes said not without admiration If he has any problems in the next session it will come from being too intention getting Carter programs passed intact Some members criticized the Speaker for not playing an active role in one of the most controversial issues that had confronted the Congress Federal funding ofabortions for low income women He was very weak on the abortion issue Representative Anderson said There were other Catholic members of the Houk like David Obey [Democrat of Wisconsin] who saw the need to compromise An awful lot of time was wasted marching up and down the hill Others believe that the Speaker played a key behindthescenes role in searching for a compromise Indeed oneshortlived compromise was struck in his office with Mr ONeill in attendance although he disclaimed both authorship and support Tip has an extraordinary sense of what can and cannot be accomplished here said Representative Rosenthal the principal author of a consumer protection bill that was shelved by Mr ONeill for lack of votes He also has the interests of the members at heart Hell never try to push a person into trying to do something if its against his personal interests His style of leadership is reminiscent of that of Jacob Arvey the onetime Chicago Democratic leader who defined politics as the art of putting people under obligation to you In this connection the Speaker interceded with President Carter to obtain a Federal appellate judgeship for the brother of Representative Gunn McKay Democrat of Utah Mr McKay asked whether he considered himself indebted to Mr ONeill and the President replied I suppose its like your wife bakes a cake youre not disposed to kick her in the face Critics complained that it was a blatantly political intervention in what the President had pledged would be the merit selection of judges Help on a Judgeship Closer to home the Speaker played a large role in persuading the Administration to continue production of the F18 a controversial and expensive Navy fighter plane whose engines are produced at a General Electric company plant in Lynn Mass in a neighboring district His constituents are among the 5000 persons employed in the plant Im doing my job representing my people Mr ONeill said in explanation Toward the end of the session the Speaker helped orchestrate actively lobbied and made moving appeals on the House floor on behalf of legislation supporting the Presidents position on the B1 bomber and increased Social Security taxes Republicans complained that on same occasions the lobbying continued after the allotted 15minutes for a recorded vote Ive had to demand that the well be cleared because he was down at the well twisting arms after time had elapsed Mr Rhodes recalled Without exception the Speakers colleagues attributed his success to an easygoing often generous style in his personal relationships with the members Tips been very effective because hes got the good will of most of the members said Representative James J Delaney Democrat of Queens and chairman of the House Rules Committee The New York TimesGeorge Tames Thomas P ONeill Jr pauses from paperwork in his Washington office

Text of Carey's'State of the Stat Address posing Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/05/archives/text-of-careys-state-of-the-state-address-proposing-new-round-of.html,Following is a transcript of Governor Careys State of the State Address to the joint houses of the Legislature in Albany yesterday as recorded by The New York Times I have the honor to present to your honorable body my fourth message on thedondition of our state Today I stand before you with the confidence formed of ourcommon experience of the past three years As guide to our futurd we have an obligenon to seek the lessons of these three years In 1975 this government and other governments of our state were the captives of our creditors We caught the eye of the nationbut from high places we heard views of doubt talk of default and disaster We faced reality We made the hard choices and won the time to carry forth a plan for our own redemption Those were grim days But we are New Yorkers and we knew there would come a good day In 1976 accepting austerity in acc Ordance with our plan we shouldered our burdens and balanced our budget To a state that had no credit credit was restored Those were days of struggle and sacrifice But we are New Yorkers and we planned for a better day Last year I told you had been through thd worst of times We were now able to plan for more than mere survival We dare not and we did not discard those careful constraints on the cost and size of state government that securedour new condition Instead we carefully assessed the causes of our old condition and we moved in a new direction That charted course has taught us that the future of this state lies not in needless public spending but in privategrowth 1977 Tax Reduction Cited The tax reduction we achieved in 1977 was a sign and symbol of the new direction for the people of this great state and now as New Yorkers we can do more than plan We can produce and provide for better days and better years Therefore today call upon you to join me in a common commitment Let us make 1978 the best of years for our people Let us produce for the people no larger government than their needs require Let us produce the means for greater growth in jobs and income for our people Nothifig less is worthy of this great state In 1978 I intend to work with you to achieve the next round of annualized tax reductions for our people Let us build further on that cornerstone of less taxation These are the lessons of the past three years Throughout these times we have shown we could put aside partisanship and work together for the future of the people of New YorkyOu here in the Legislature and thosein labor and management in the publicand private sectors Those who responded to the call for a common commitment are reSPonMble for our accomplishment Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak and I together want to thank you and each of those who helped for your critical effort No matter how difficult the times we did not neglect our responsibilities to the people We built a record of achievement We saved the largest cityof otinstate We showed that Albany is the ally of every local governMent We helpect those localities in severe distress as we always will Nive showed by our example that dividends come from a credibly balanced budget We achieved constitutional amendments for court reform we put people back to work through accelerated construction prOgrams We reformed the management of our Welfare and Medicaid programs We acted through executive order and legislation to protect and extend the rights of women and all those who suffer discrimination in our society We improved the best and most comprehensive health care system in the nation Gratification Is Voiced We did all these things together and for that we are stronger We did them well anctfor that we are gratified And we did much More We made our own decisions and we won the right to shere the rewards of a more certain future In three years we have come from crisis to confidence because we are steadfast in crisis and dedicated in renewal have won the right to wear what the poets call the befitting emblem of adversity We are New Yorkers and for us survival is not enough We know that in the human condition there has to be a better waya better way to earn a better way to build a better way to learn a better way to care There is nothing more important to the people of our state than the means to provide for themselves When government taxes people beyond reason it unjustly reduces real wages and impairs the economy My goal is to continue to reduce the level of taxation in New York and return money to the people Lower taxes are an indispensable imrt of our plan for a better life for all New Yorkers The executive budget d will present to you on lan 17 will continue tax reduction within the context of a credibly balanced state budget rst I will propose a reduction in the personal income tax of 500 million This will increase the income of individual taxpayer These tax cuts are in addition to the 200 million reduCtion in the personal income tax we achieved together last year Second I will propose that the temporary surcharges on corporations and hanks be eliminated for 150 tax sayings I will alsd propose a series of new measures that will result in a of 100 million in the tax burden carried by business and industry in our state With these proposals we will make New York a more attractive place for business and a better place to work These reductions are in addition to those we enacted last year which returned 55 million to industries critical to New York This program is the reSpit of three years of planning and effort We have moved from the billiondollar spending increases of past years to annual reductions in the cost of government We have moved from the bidden budget deficit of thd past to a balanced budget and to the achievement of major tax reliefover two years This is a better way for New Yorka fulfillment of our plan for our future It is a relief that will multiply several times stimulate our economy and protect the jobs of our people But there is more to be done There are other ways for government to spur economic development This year I will propose funds for the Urban Development Corporation to build and lease new facilities for business I will propose funding for essential economic development projects These will include a runway extension of Stewart Field a containerport at Red Hook in Brooklyn a coal transshipment center at Buffalo and port improvements in Albany Oswego Ogdensburg The best ambasssador for New York State is Lieutenant Governor Krupsak I urge her to continue her efforts to build and rebuild New Yorks regional economies and provide more jobs Energy Program Planned because i recognize mat the availability cf reasonsably priced energy is essential to our economic survival I will propose an energy master plan fbr New York compatible and consistent With our environmental concerns We wit explore ways to advance resource recovery technology in order to convert waste materials to power generation We will continue our support for tourism in our state and 1977 was the best year in history I said here last year that I would take every possible step to insure that the facilities for the 1980 Winter 010 pies will be in place on time and they willbe Agriculture is basic to New Yorks economy and New Yorks family farrns are basic to agriculture This year we will expand our efforts to preserve our valuable farmland and market farm products Millions of people now know that Grown in New York means_the best there is bhatise our programs have succeeded As we rebuild oureconomy wenUtt be mindful of the housing needs of our citizens ComMunity partidipition in the preservation of our neighborhoods is essential I will propose additional funds for this effort Financial institutions must participate in this process We must end recrliningDiscrimination by geography is no less Abhoreni to me than any other forin of discrimination I will not tolerate it I will Submit legislation to stabiliZe tablish a mortgage guarantee corporation and to offer tax credit for lending institutions making investments in innercity areas I want more of the Money of New York deposited invested in New York State I will submit legislation to stablize our state and municipally assisted middleincome houSineprograms through a longterm financial commitment by this state The Problem of Crime The quality of our tile is dependeut on freedom from the fear of crime We must provide a system of public justice that is swift and sure Our courts too often have been reduced to shabby marketplaces where rape and robbery cases are bartered Too often violent criminals are put back on the streets where they commit other crimes The police are frustrated because arrests are often little more than a ritual Stiffer penalties for crinie Ortlie one part of that answerbut not the whOle answer It is foolish and deceptive to argue that ourcourts will be made more effective only by _legislating greater penalties Rather we must do the tough work of improving and perfecting the day to day administration of criminal justice Those who commit rape murder armed felonies arson and other crimes of similar violence must be The targets of swift and sure justice We have al ready created new courts and a special detainee program to provide speedy prosecution in criminal cases The success of this program is dramatic The conviction rate has been 85 percent the median sentence has been 10 years the number of trials held in these nine courts have been alniost double the normal rate These results when multiplied throughout the state will deter crime This ear we will add 20 new trial courts throughout the state to proVide swift justice for those who commit violent crimes High priorities will be gven to offenses against the elderly and infirm Our intensive attack against violent crime will be t xpanded upState and downstate We will make New York safe again On numerous occasions I haVe spoken plainly of my opposition to the penalty of death I understand that the level of criminal violence in our society leads to a desire for vengeance But it is my belief that the state must not make its laws a vehicle for ultimate and irreversible vengeance I want strong sanctions against the worst crimes I will propose legislation to give a jury the power to impose life sentences withoutparole on those convicted of crimes ofviolence resulting in death Those vicious criminals will never again be free to prey on innocent people The rights of our citizens to safety in their homes and on their streets Will only be assured when all elements of the states criminal justice system function consistently andeffectively That is Why r have inane unrelenting efforts to secure court reform efforCs our people approVed on our last election day 1 again propose that you Present for the peoples approval merit seledtion of wellqualified judges to all courts of the state and establishment of a single statewide trial court Services for Children The strength of our society also deprids on our success in meeting the needs of Children To fail to meet these needs is to waste our future That Ts not the way of a compassionate soeiay and that is not our way in New York I have directed the newly formed Council on Children and Families to develop specific proposals for early intervention to help children achieve their full potential I will submit legislation to give us added flexibility in pioviding services to children with special needs and to control the placement of children in outofstate facilities This year I will propose a formula to increase substantially the states share of local public school expenditures for severely handicapped ehiriren I will request funds for special education for the learning disabled children with disabilities that are difficult to diagnose such as dyslexia or brain damage Particular attention must be paid to the problems of children who need special help to benefit from regular classroom instruction This year I will propose anew program designed to respond to the special needs ofthese children inurban and rural areas As I have said before we must find a better way to support the statessystem of public schools This year I will again propose changes in our educationaid ancrI will recommend increased assistance to those poorer districts most in need of help Education Savings

state tuition assistance program I Will also Submit legislation Ati establish a Parents and Students Savings Plan kir both parents and students alike to enable them to Meet the cost of education Through the PASS Plan we can provide incentives for Parents to plan for their childrens education and help thetri avoid thecrushing burden ofcollege expenses Later this session I will deliver my third State of the Health Message will propose expansion  of ambulatory care programs and continued efforts to redirect our health care capabilities I want to assure religious and other groups that their rights to adequate and convenient access to maternity care will not be impaired I look forward to another yearofcooperative efforts to find better ways of health care for all of our eitriens Meeting the needs of our nearly 3 Million senior citizens is a criticial concern of thii administration As part of my program for tax relief and to help the elderly maintain their homes T will propose special tax reductions for lowincome elderly individuals and families threatened by rising property taxes This propertytax circuitbreaker for the elderly tidill be available to both renters and homeowners and means better days far elderly New Yorkers We will increase state funds to encourage community services for the elderly Will ask for your support for increases in BSI Isupplementai security income] payments to individuals for senior eitizens who require care in in stitutions Many citizens are concerned about the movement of mentally ill patients into community settings I will propose

programs TheSe pedple from otter families and the neighborhoods heed understanding and Compassion and I hdpe you will join Me in a special effort to encourage community acceptance of these people who need our help Through careful and prudent Managerrient at the state level we haVe assured savings for local governments We have reduced ineligibility rates fox public assistance recipients and low ered Medicaid costs This means say ings for our counties and for New York City LaSt year local governments received general assistance frem the state in the form of revenuesharing emergency aid to our cities This year I propose to continue and fully fund both these programs and use a share of Federal countercyclic al assistance to fund h new program of to counties with demonstrated needs I Will also recommend additional local assistance increases including funds to assume onehhlf the share of local court costs and funds for new programs of municipal street improve ments To help save New York City his Legislature Created the Municipal As aistance Corporation and the Emergen dy FinanCial ControlBoard Both agetf cies have worked well You charged me along with other officials with theconduct of the affairs of the Contra Board By the terms of the statute the Control Board will expire this year We must work together with the new city administration to establish a successor agency The city has made much progress and under its new leadership it should not fail to regain its health and balance its budget as this jstate has done That action by the city should entitle it to access to the credit it needs in the long term As I have done before I will see to it that neither New York City nor  any other locality of this state does not fail because it is our job to secure  this state against the impact of any insolvency With modest Federal aid we did that in 1975 and since that aid is clearly needed again I will fight to secure that aid Lists Challenges Met Three years ago we challenged the tired and dangerous assumptions of the past Because we did we can look ahead today to our year of opportunit ties and we can issue newchallenges for the future We challenge the idea that our political syStem cannot provide swift and sure justice for nals We must reduce crime in New York State and we will win that challenge We challenge the idea that government and management and labor cannotwork together toprovide jobs We will win that challenge to provide work i for every willing person in New YorkState We challenge the cynicism that says humane and compassionate programs for the sick disabled and needy Cannot be wellmanaged We will do the job of healing in this state with care and compassion and without waste Let no one challenge that We challenge the idea that govern ments always get larger and cost morrs For three years and now a fourth wc haye fought that challenge In this fourth year we will win  We have met these challengeS and more Fifty years ago today Gov

the city and promised I will fight to secure that aid The Best of Years Asked Mr Carey made his fourth annual State of the State address to a joint session of the Assembly and Senate in the refurbished Assembly chamber and called on the legislators to let us make 1978 the best of years for our people The speech served both to outline the Governors program and to some extent his campaign

from the two Republican legislative leaders Warren M Anderson of Binghamton majority leader in the Senate and Perry B Duryea Jr of Montauk LI minority leader in the Assemblyboth of whom want tochallenge Mr Carey for the Governors post But since both men have proposed major tax reductions of their own their attacks centered on the idea that it was the Republicans not Mr Carey who had first recognized the need for tax cuts to spur the states economy and that the Governor was actually removing taxes that he had imposed earlier in hiS term Other Propsads Made Mr Carey also suggested the following in his address today In an effort to defuse legislative demands for a death penalty he will pronose giving juries the power to impose life sentences without parole for certain crimes of violence resulting in death The Governor first endorsed this remedy during an argument with a 70yearold woman in a Brooklyn center fora the elderly after ridiculing it when it was proposed by Senator Roy M Goodman RepublicAn of Manhattan Scorning courts that have too often been reduced to shabby marketplaces where rape and robbery cases are bartered at any cost Mr Carey said he would add 20 courts

less abhorrent to me than any other form of discrimination the Governor declared I will not tolerate it He pledged to form a South Bronx Task Force to coordinate rebuilding that hardhit area and he

illprepared to take rare of them Education Aid Proposed As aides had outlined earlier Mr Carey also said he wouldpropose a revised plan for educational finance coupling increased aid to education with a formula that would eventually hold down education costs and favor poorer centralcity school districts In addition he outlined proposals to strengthen the Department of Socia Sekvices care for hardtoplace children to strengthen the same department procedures for monitoring fraud and abuse by permitting the matching of ridVate payroll information with Welfare rolls and to expand counseling services for pregnant teenagers who want to have babies rather than abortions The details of Mr Careys tax proposal were unclear and will await his presentation of the budget on Jan 17 The 500 million

enacted last year for a total reduc tion of about 1015 billion over two years While there is general agreement over the need for a tax cut the shape of it how much to business how much to individuals

those in the 20000 to40000 income bracket the people state officials believe make the decisionsron whether businesses stay in or leave New York State But Arthur J Kremer Democrat of Long Beach and chairman of the Assembly Ways and MeansCommittee said that it would be difficult  to get anything but an even across theboard personal income tax cut through that chathber Other skirmishes are

Abortion Standoff Prompts House To Weigh Limit on Riders to Bills,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/06/archives/abortion-standoff-prompts-house-to-weigh-limit-on-riders-to-bills.html,WASHINGTON Jan 5  Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr has asked the House parliamentarians to study the feasibility of a rule change to keep appropriations bills free of policymaking riders such as the ban on Medicaid abortions that tied up 61 billion for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare The House Democratic Study Group informed its members today that it had initiated a similar study and the Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd said that if the House produced a suitable provision the Senate might follow suit The studies were prompted not only by a fivemonth stalemate on the abortion issue that imperiled the salaries and programs of the two Federal agencies but also by indications that opponents of abortion were preparing a rider to the 110 billion defense appropriations bill that would ban Federal funds for abortions for the 102000 women in the armed forces as well as hundreds of thousands of female dependents Representative John Brademas of Indiana the House Democratic whip asked about the feasibility of a rule change said I know the Speaker is concerned about the problem and has asked the parliamentarian to look at it a statement confirmed by the Speakers aides The matter has come up in at least One leadership meeting and concern was expressed Mr Brademas said Both Sides Use Tactic He pointed out however that liberals had used riders to appropriations bills to cut off financing for the Vietnam War and to cancel funds for the supersonic transport while conservatives have attached antibusing and antiabortion riders Mr Brademas said that although an agencys funding should not be tied up over a single emotional issue where programs are permanently authorized and not subject to automatic consideration there is often no other way to raise some issue Representative Abner Mikva Democrat of Illinois chairman of the Democratic Study Group said in todays memorandum to the groups members Impetus for such a change has been generated by riders dealing with highly emotional issues such as abortion plus an overall increase in the number of amendments barring use of funds for a specific purpose or program Representative Herbert E Harris IJ Democrat of Virginia said that he had drafted a rule change that would basically prohibit any amendment to an appropriation  bill that did anything but increase or decrease the amount of an appropriation Opponents of policymaking riders to appropriations bills point out that unlike other legislation they are not subject to hearings or committee deliberations Proponents of such riders say that they resort to them only because all other avenues are blocked Only Effective Mechanism We would much rather have an up and down vote on the substantive issue said Representative Romano Mazzoli Democrat of Kentucky a foe of Medicaid abortions If we could get to the main event you could cancel all preliminary bouts In the event of a rules change Mr Mazzoli said youd get rid of the only effective mechanism for the House to deal with life and death questions Mr Mazzoli confirmed that before adjournment last month a group of Congressmen opposed to abortion had discussed attaching a rider to the defense appropriation bill Such a rider would counteract criticism that abortion opponents had sought to prevent only the impoverished from having abortions It also would serve notice that abortion opponents would sooner or later seek to attach riders to all appropriations bills I would suspect that when the bill comes to the floor well have someone offer an amendment said William Cox spokesman for the National Committee for a Human Rights Amendment which played a leading role in lobbying the ban on Medicaid abortions Were interested in shutting off the use of Federal funds for abortions whenever they are used
AN EXILE IN HIS OWN CITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/08/archives/an-exile-in-his-own-city-lindsay.html,On this day of all days John Lindsay has a right to be gloomy Outside his office window the rain swept by vicious winds has left Rockefeller Center deserted Once hailed as an urban messiah then blamed by New Yorkers for the citys fiscal collapse John V Lindsay is a political nonperson in his own big apple brother with whom he is extremely close is in the midst of a terrible losing battle against cancer which will last another six weeks In the city around him his city the voters are in process of deciding which of the men who have lately taken regular potshots at him will be their next Mayor He is he thinks developing a head cold But John Lindsay insists John Lindsay is feeling just grand Some weather isnt it he asks smiling I hear that at some polling places people are applauding the voters who take the shortest time in the booths He throws back his patrician head and lets out a short laugh Not that theres much to vote for anyway Lindsay leans back in his chair A lot of people had a hard time voting this morning Five or six of them came up to me and said God I wish you were running At least then Id have something to vote for He pauses and smiles Of course I dont let that get to me flattery isnt harmful unless inhaled He laughs again No Lindsay doesnt let that kind of talk get to him He remains at base politician and deep down he knows what every other serious politician in this area knows that John Lindsay is almost certainly finished It has been this way for almost four years Though God knows Lindsay has always had his enemies he feels the bottom truly fell out for him during the fiscal crisis when there was an excess of pointing fingers and far few targets to point them at Lindsay found himself under attack not only by the press and a host of ambitious politicians but by his successor who had himself presided over the citys collapse The extent to which the criticism is justified is arguable Certainly on paper Lindsay appears to have had shortcomings as a fiscal manager during his second term in office the citys shortterm debt grew from 7473 million to 34 billion and municipal labor contracts reached unprecedented levels some charge because Lindsay was pushed around by the unions But Lindsays supporters argue that it is utterly unfair to judge Lindsay  a gogo Mayor in a gogo economic period  by postcrisis standards He is says Norman Mailer who campaigned for Lindsay in 1965 and ran to replace him four years later the most maligned man in New York Hell adds former Lindsay aide Jay Kriegel five years ago all the socalled budgetary gimmicks were being called genius It wasnt Lindsay it was the times Beame ran in 73 on a platform of adding 4000 cops Lindsay himself will reel off statistics all day to back up his contention that he was not merely competent but a superior administra But in the end the facts whichever way they fall matter hardly at all In politics Lindsay is fond of saying the perception is the reality and John Lindsay is thought by hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of New Yorkers to have been a Mayor of spectacular ineptitude That fact was seized upon by most of the contenders in this years mayoral race Spurred by a TimesCBS poll which indicated that fully 20 percent of the citys registered Democrats identified John Lindsay as the major cause of the financial crisisputting him well ahead of the banks the unions and Abe Beame as chief culpritthey outdid themselves in an effort to disassociate themselves from him Mario Cuomo once a proteg of Lindsays launched frontal assault on Ed Koch with a commercial that had Kochs face slowly dissolving Dorian Graystyle into John Lindsays Not that Koch also a onetime Lindsay ally was about to let anyone stick him in the exMayors corner His campaign motto  the words that may have gotten him elected made very sure of that After eight years of charisma and four years of the clubhouse why not try competence Now in his office Lindsay grimaces ever so slightly as the words are repeated The phrase was coined by David Garth once one of Lindsays closest associates That was a cheap shot he says quietly He pauses then manages a smile But I really dont think it did Koch much good He pauses again I know for certain that the Cuomo thing backfired badly And may have destroyed him I heard from Matty Troy in Queens that people out there were just infuriated Lindsay swivels his chair away from his desk stretches out his long long legs and grins And thats the middle of cop country Youll never hear a bitter outburst or a dirge of selfpity from John Lindsay At 56 his face deeply lined his sandy hair turning gray and thinning noticeably he is at last more statesmanlike than boyish  would probably no longer be named as he once was by London scandal sheet the worlds sexiest man  but some things about John Lindsay will never change Even more than most politicians a species with an innate sense of the discreet Lindsay has always kept his emotions under lock and key The guy didnt spend all those years at St Pauls and Yale and in the Navy for nothing says David Garth He believes unequivocally in biting the bullet stiff upper lip and all the rest of it Everything about the man bespeaks his breeding from his rigid almost noble bearing to the crisp tailoring of his pinstripe suits to his custom often appealing sometimes disconcerting of easing uncomfortable moments with his sudden laugh Lindsays laugh at such moments is like that of a fop in a drawingroom comedy a contrivance that begins and ends in his throat It is that laugh along with Lindsays tendency toward blandness in his speech and the fact that he is so unnaturally attractive that have led more than a few casual acquaintances to conclude that he is a man of limited depth In fact there is a lot more there John Lindsay wears his geniality like armor says one former aide To have been shunted aside as he has been is like a knife twisting through him lie calls me every time theres another attack adds Richard Aurelio Lindsays former campaign manager and Deputy Mayor I get the impression that it hurts him very very deeply Lindsay blames what he sees as superficial press coverage of his role in the fiscal crisis for his current problems and he has made it a policy in recent months to decline quickie interviews Sixfootfour former Mayors apparently make easy targets he says with his laugh But over the course of hours and days by his side it becomes clear just how much he misses public life and how very vivid his private anguish must be He rarely acknowledges that of course but it crops up constantly in small indirect ways in his habit almost a reflex of straightening up and smiling when he senses he is being looked at in his slighting references to the politicians he feels have used him badly and most especially in the distant vacant look that comes to his blue eyes when the talk turns to what might have been It is hard now to recall the breadth of the initial expectations for John Lindsay but they were nothing short of awesome When he first ran for Mayor in 1965 a striking 43yearold Congressman who the previous fall had rolled up a staggering 72 percent of the votes in his district in the teeth of the Johnson landslide he was instantly embraced as an urban messiah Hes fresh and everyone else is tired went Murray Kemptons memorable phrase and most of the media picked up the beat The Lindsay campaign is the most important political operation in America today rhapsodized Newsweek in a cover story the first chapter of The Making of the President 1972 He was a free spirit discerning and discriminating wrote Walter Lippmann the sage of sages As of now the future lies with Republicans like Lindsay And endlessly perhaps inevitably came the comparisons with the Kennedys most especially with the newly martyred President At Lindsays very appearance said Newsweek womens eyes glaze and mens faces glow as they havent since John F Kennedy nn campaigned in New York Lindsay is even handsomer than Kennedy added Time in its cover story Like Kennedy Lindsay is an avid yachtsman an exNavy officer a sometime Sunday touchfootball player a reader of Ian Fleming novels And on and on But the press was wrong Ian Fleming notwithstanding John Lindsay had little in common with the Kennedys where their idealism was tempered by the hardest brand of hardboiled cynicism his was right out of the civics textbooks where they were masterful political infighters as at ease with machine politicians as with civilrights activists he preached that governmental affairs should be conducted in the cleansing light of day From the very beginning the backroom types snickered at John Lindsay If you elect a matineeidol Mayor Robert Moses is said to have remarked youre going to have a musicalcomedy administration Though now a dozen years later most journalists agree that the Lindsay administration ended up no more open than most at the outset there was something genuinely naive about young Mayor Lindsay this Mr SmithCometoNewYork who seemed to believe that everything was a moral crusade The power brokers against whom he so routinely inveighed may have tried to laugh him away but inside they seethed and Lindsay was quickly made to pay for his presumption the transit strike that began five hours after he took office effectively shut the city down Lindsay  or Lindsley as Mike Quill president of the TWU and presumably one of the power brokers delightedly called him consistently struck a note of moral outrage but in the end after 13 agonizing days he was forced to swallow a contract far more generous than any his predecessors had granted At the beginning the public as measured by the polls sided with their crusading Mayor but his aloofness his air of moral rectitude his difference quickly caused an erosion of his support He was elegant where the rest of us had a piece of vulgarity in us is how labor leader Victor Gotbaum puts it From the start he was a madetoorder whipping boy The transit strike set the tone for Lindsays early relationship with the citys bluecollar unions and by extension with the entire class they represent as crippling strike followed crippling strike this tall haughty WASP Mayor increasingly came to be regarded by the citys ethnics as an enemy someone who had no interest in their lives But more than anything else it was the perception almost a given in certain communities that Lindsay was giving the city away to the blacks that made the breach irreparable In fact Lindsay did have enormous compassion for the citys minorities race was the burning issue of his time and he felt an overriding responsibility to face up to societys more blatant inequities Hed come back from Police and Fire Department promotion ceremonies recalls former Lindsay Corporation Counsel Norman Redlich and hed say Dammit Ive been to too many of these damn things where all the faces are white  partly through his actions to change that partly as a result of the great physical courage he displayed in walking the citys worst streets at the very worst moments New York was virtually the only major Northern city whose ghettos did not burn during those tumultuous years Pollsters working on behalf of one of 1977s mayoral aspirants were surprised to discover that John Lindsay would still carry black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods today But in much of the rest of New York the dislike of Lindsay was so intense that as someone put it at the time it would if bottled bite through steel In 1969 when it came time for Lindsay to run for reelection his people came up with a plan to deal with that The polls showed people thought he was an arrogant sob recalls former Lindsay speechwriter Jeff Greenfield so we knew the guy had to be humbled The linchpin of that strategy to which a prideful Mayor put up only token opposition was the famous 1 made mistakes commercial Thanks to it and to Lindsays extraordinary good fortune at being pitted against two candidates far to his right he sneaked in with a bare 91 percent of the votes Not that politically speaking Lindsay was chastened by the experience Perhaps the most instructive episode of his second term in assessing Lindsay as both a politician and a human being was his disastrous run at the 1972 Democratic Presidential nomination A Democrat only seven months with no base of support  fittingly the LindsayforPresident Committee started not in New York but in Los Angeles  his strategy was built entirely around the Florida primary that conservative state a George Wallace stronghold would be his first contest the one where he would have to score impressively if he hoped to continue John Lindsay ran true to his conscience in Florida  in a race that would have done Miguel de Cervantes proud He ran for busing for the right to abortion against gun control and he got slaughtered picking up a bare 8 percent of the Coincidentally that was just about the approval rating Dr Gallup awarded him back at home a few months later when he was mulling over whether or not to seek a third term as Mayor Thus it surprised almost no one when pronouncing his tenure at Gracie Mansion the best eight years of my life he stepped aside Lindsay likes to say now that he left office with flags flying and insists that had it not been for the fiscal crisis hed have lived happily ever after politically There is it would seem more than a bit of selfdelusion in this Indeed there was a time whenLindsay himself probably wouldnt have said it Ill come out either for you or against you he is said to have offered Al Blumenthal a contender in the race to succeed  him whichever helps more Still it is true that he was sent off with a series of emotional thankyou parties and a spate of favorable newspaper editorials But Lindsay left something else in his wake too as he departed for what he refers to as a yearlong sabbatical abroad as large and implacable a store of political enemies as any local politician in memory The political system hates a maverick is how former Lindsay press secretary Tom Morgan accounts for it because one mans independence threatens them all But clearly the antipathy has as much to do with the lack of give in John Lindsays personality as in his politics There was a real sense of discomfort in his personal relationships says Richard Aurelio his political Deputy Mayor I always had to smalltalk people  give em the wink and the elbow in the ribs  to compensate for Lindsays standoffishness It wasnt arrogance really it was a kind of WASPish haughtiness None of that would mean much of coursepolitical enmities are nothing newif it werent for the fact of the fiscal crisis Suddenly two years later when he desperately needed support Lindsay who had always lacked the ethnic base most politicians in the city count on was also without powerful political allies As he tells it he was dumbstruck by what happened There he was he says coasting along in his law practice doing his weekly reports for ABCs Good Morning America making more money than hed ever made considering a run for James Buckleys Senate seat when suddenly everything blew up around him I just couldnt believe the public would swallow it he says evenly When I was Mayor got away with dumping things on Wagner for about two weeks and after that the press wouldnt allow it He laughs I just couldnt believe the double standard Lindsays position on the fiscal collapse is unequivocal As long as I live I will insist wouldnt have let it happen We would have acted quick Decisively He pounds his open hand twice on his desk That was our way to confront problems headon to do anything that had to be done And I mean anything  massive layoffs cuts in services anything It wouldve been a bloody show but there was no alternative He leans back in his chair But Abe  He smiles grimly When he was Comptroller Id say to him Abe what color is this he indicates his leather attach case sitting on the desk before himand hed say Gimme a couple of days to think about it  Lindsay glances out the window Hey it looks like its clearing up out there That should bring a few more voters out He falls silent for a moment and studies his knuckles A lot of people felt I should have fought back One of my brothers was just furious that I took it all lying down But knew that if I were going to make a fight of it I would have to give up my law practice and marshal all of my people and work at it full time And I knew Abe had control of the press Every time I called a press conference he would have hit back He smiles It wouldve been a real cat fight But all of that is old news and Lindsay knows it He waves a large hand absently through the air as if that will make it all disappear You know something I gave a talk in Canada the other day in front of 2000 urbanists the keynote address It made a very big splash in the Toronto press But theres never two inches about me in the New York press unless I stub my toe He laughs The media here wont take you seriously unless youre a political threat But whenever I travel in the rest of this country or abroad Im always amazed by how interested people are in finding out whats in my head Lindsay glances at his watch and presses a button on his desk A moment later his secretary Irving OppenheimOppie to everyoneappears at the door Oppie who is 4 feet 11 inches tall and 65 years old who talks like a refugee from a George Raft film and types faster than almost anyone was rescued by Mayor Lindsay from a deadend job at the morgue and he is eternally grateful Yeah boss he says now in his nasal growl what can I do for ya Its almost 7 oclock says Lindsay You ought to be getting home Yeah boss I just wanna finish up a couple of things Oppie closes the door Good old Oppie says Lindsay Hes got only two vicesoverwork and tall women onethird his age He laughs Lindsay rises walks over to a closet in the corner takes out a pair of rubbers and sits himself in a straightbacked chair I suppose itll be Koch he says pulling on the left one though I dont know my predictions are always so wrong He picks up the second rubber and smiles Im only glad Im not running Its a pleasure not have to fret all day He yanks on the rubber and rises You know despite everything I feel pretty bad for Abe Hes very bitter He takes a bulky battered white trench coat from the closet and puts it on I spoke to him after he lost the primary and he was just bewildered He didnt know what hit him Lindsay removes a floppy tweed hat from the closet and pulls it down tight on his head In his hat coat and rubbers he looks like a big kid bundled up by his mother I know how he felt When I returned from my sabbatical the phone was ringing off the hook Youve got to run for this they told me youve got to run for that  He laughs Then this financial thing hit and suddenly all around there was silence He turns off his office light and takes a few steps down the corridor Oppie he calls back Yeah boss If anyone needs me Ill be at the Century Club I should be home around 9 to call the winner  According to press accounts when Lindsay places his congratulatory call to Ed Koch the Mayorelect surrounded by supporters makes a throatslitting motion with his finger and otherwise indicates he is less than thrilled to have this particular caller on the line Lindsay loyalists are appalled How dya like that asks Oppie later That guys got no class at all But John Lindsay himself is more sanguine Thirtyfive hours after the phone call aboard the 8 AM shuttle to Washington he closes a book removes his reading glasses and eases his seat backward Oh he says I never know whether to believe what I read in the press But its true a lot of my friends were madder than hell My sisterinlaw called and said Why does Koch have such antipathy toward you I could only repeat what GladstoneI think it was Gladstonesaid when he was told someone was saying unkind things about him Thats very odd I cant recall having once done the man a favor  He laughs Lindsay is heading to Washington on assignment for the Good Morning America program for which as he is always quick to point out he works on only a parttime basis Im a fulltime lawyer he says I do this only because I enjoy it That he clearly does Like almost everything else on the show Lindsays filmed reportson the Osmond family or artist Georgia OKeeffe or the opening of the King Tut exhibitare invariably upbeat but in this case the correspondent is having almost as good a time as he appears to be In conversation Lindsay will go on endlessly about his various interview subjects even does a credible imitation of Oral Roberts responding to a question about his sex drives  John there is a big difference between admirin and desirin  Of course John Lindsay has always had a soft spot for show business as Mayor he regularly socialized with theatrical celebritieswas known to exchange dirty jokes which he relishes with some of the biggest names in townand once made a sudden memorable appearance in the Broadway musical Seesaw extending its run by months But Good Morning America offers him something else too it has enabled this veteran of a thousand evening newscasts to remain somewhat in the public eye without exposing himself to the lacerating fire he seems so readily to attract Lindsay has come under public attack even in his capacity as a lawyerfor his work on behalf of clients in Iranand he is clearly sick of it Though some of his extracurricular activities like the film Rosebud in which he played a cameo role and the novel he published last year have been disastrously reviewed though he sees every critique as an ad hominem review of me though he feels obliged to exercise extreme caution in choosing his vehicles turning down for instance the role of the almostassassinated politician in Taxi Driver the emotional stakes in the media world are much lower There are times in fact when Lindsay contemplates chucking everything to work full time in television at the moment a trio of William Morris agents are negotiating on his behalf with public television and ABC News about a possible series of hourlong documentaries from Europe a project that offers Lindsay the not unpleasing prospect of spending most of But Lindsays project today is much more modest  he is to interview one Gary Myers a Republican Congressman from western Pennsylvania who is quitting after just two terms in the House I dont know much about the fellow says Lindsay except that hes a member of the bluecollar caucus He puts his reading glasses back on to examine the one piece of research material ABC has provided him about Myers a fuzzy Xerox of an article from The Washington Star The thing is unreadable Lindsay holds it at arms length then raises his glasses to his forehead and studies it from a distance of two inches After five minutes he has gathered only one solid piece of information from the page that on leaving Congress Myers intends to return to his old job as a steelplant foreman So he lays it aside and reopens the book hed been reading Musical Chairs by Schuyler Chapin the former head of the Metropolitan Opera I find this book fascinating he says You should see what that guy went through managing that place with people sniping at him all the time They had massive deficit problems Massive He shakes his head Chapin is a very unbitter man doesnt have a shred of bitterness in him but its clear that he was very badly used A group of unknowledgeable people were looking for scapegoats Lindsay smiles Very interesting When Lindsay arrives at the Myers suburban Virginia home in a Ford rented at Washingtons National Airport the place is already in chaos the soundman lighting man and cameraman have been there almost an hour and the living room is a clutter of equipment tangled wires and bulky bodies The Congressman an earnest young man done up for the occasion in a green tweed suit surveys the goingson from a corner I understand youre a member of the bluecollar caucus says Lindsay making small talk Myers shakes his head No you must be thinking of Ozzie Myers the dockworker Lindsay makes a note on sheet of paper I see I have a reserved attitude about joining organizations says Myers His wife Elaine sidles up beside him I dont know how great Im going to be at this she says sheepishly Im pretty nervous Lindsay smiles Just enjoy it thats the main thing Whatevers in your head just let it go The filming begins a couple of minutes later Gary says that he is leaving Congress to devote more time to his family Elaine says that she supports whatever Gary feels is best Lindsay keeps the proceedings moving crisply getting what is probably the best out of both of them See that he says to Elaine afterward you were great Youll get an Emmy Award for this Its always this way The best interviews we get are those where people are just themselves We had a fantastic interview with Barry Goldwater  because hes reached the point where he doesnt give a damn what he says He was completely himself Whatd he say asks Elaine Oh every other thing he said was just appalling If itd been the old Barry Goldwater it wouldve made headlines It did get some press says his producer listening nearby We did it around the time Nixon went to China as a private citizen and Goldwater said he should stay there The Myerses laugh Yeah says Lindsay with sudden intensity it got a little attention But my point is if hed said it a few years earlier it would have been a scandal The moment they write you off as a serious threat they stop paying attention to you Its as if youre invisible Myers taken by surprise by this declaration looks at him quizzically Lindsay catches his eye and laughs Great piece of film though A year and a half ago the Lindsays got themselves a house in one of the less fashionable parts of the Hamptons Seventenths of an acre owned jointly by John V Lindsay and the Bowery Savings Bank says Lindsay smiling Its where we go to forget the other nonsense Mary Lindsay spends endless hours there puttering around in her little vegetable garden and her husband gets enormous pleasure ditching his pin stripes for jeans and showing off his not inconsiderable manual skills last summer with a neighbor he constructed a dock But in the end of course there is no real escape from the other nonsense Late on a bright Sunday afternoon in November three days after Thanksgiving which also makes it three days after John Lindsays 56th birthday  he sits in a soft chair beside the fire in his living room working on his second Budweiser and a sandwich made of leftover turkey John Lindsay is feeling good he has just returned from a fivemile bicycle ride through quiet windswept streets and a twomile jog along the deserted beach and his face beneath tousled hair is flushed But abruptly in the midst of a quiet reminiscence about his postmayoral year in Europe Lindsay eases the conversation in a new direction You know we could tell over in Paris just by reading The International Herald Tribune that New York was heading for disaster The danger signals were there but no one over hereincluding the press was picking up on them Mary Lindsay who has been in the kitchen rewrapping the turkey skeleton in tinfoil returns to the room in time to hear her husbands remark I dont understand the way the press has acted at all she says plopping down in a chair across from Lindsay During the fiscal crises reporters we knew would tell John privately that what was going on in City Hall was just a joke Id say Hell why isnt that in the  Lindsay shakes his head Well if Id run and been elected for a third term we wouldnt have reached that point in the first place I almost wish I had But I was just so exhausted  Sure concurs Mary after eight years of innovations and new ideas hed run out of steam People forget that Roosevelt Island was Johns idea And closing the park to traffic on Sundays And OTB I walk into Grand Central now and I dont know whether to buy a train ticket or a horse ticket John Lindsay glances at his wife and smiles There is it is said a bond between these two nearly unique among political couples Independent strongwilled as disarmingly blunt as her husband is circumspect Mary Lindsay has always bridled at being cast as an ornament on a campaign platform but  with her nononsense good looks and an ease with people that dazzles her husband  she has nonetheless been a powerful political asset If Jacqueline Bisset is Hollywoods idea of Jackie Kennedy June Allyson might well have been cast as Mary Lindsay But beneath the good cheer there is a touch of steel Mary has always been Johns fiercest advocate his most intractable defender the one person able to rekindle his enthusiasm when his spirits have started to flag Over the course of his career Lindsay has had a series of political Svengalis  Bethuel Webster the lawyer who fanned his early interest in politics former Attorney General Herbert Brownell who brought him into government Robert Price who managed him to the mayoralty Richard Aurelio who ran his abortive Presidential campaign  but Mary has always had as much nutsandbolts influence with him as any of them when most of his senior staff urged him to quit the Presidential race after the Florida debacle it was she who persuaded him to persevere the origins of Lindsays fallingout with Price whom he once described as my dearest dearest friend remain unclear but some insiders insist that it was Mary upset by Prices receiving so much press attention who initiated his departure from the administration once after negotiators for the United Federation of Teachers left a latenight mess at Gracie Mansion for Mary to clean up Lindsay decreed that henceforth meetings with the group would have to be held else I dont know why the press let Beame get away with it says Mary now in the living room of the house in the Hamptons We always knew that Beame was trouble Hes stubborn pigheaded obdurate He couldnt run a toy train much less the city She pauses But he was this sweetlooking wizened old man so they pinned it on John They fall silent Lindsay stares out the window at the early evening sky burning a brilliant pink On the lawn the Lindsays little terrier Tar runs around and around in circles I dont know he says finally maybe I should have gotten out when I had the chance when I could have had Bobby Kennedys seat after he was killed The only reason I didnt was that I felt I had an obligation to all the superb people Id uprooted and brought into government He pops the last of his turkey sandwich into his mouth and washes it down with beer But I was wrong In the end nobody thanks you anyway He laughs If you want gratitude get yourself a dog Well says Mary itll be interesting to see what happens with Koch Her husband smiles mirthlessly Yes well see He pauses Ive been very decent with Koch sent him letters made phone calls saying Reach out were here to help you Dont divide the city even more So far theres been no response Thats really unbelievable says Mary Well Ive learned a hard lesson he continues If Koch is going to behave like the others and try again to put off the problems of the city on me this time I wont sit still It seems to me hes already trying to do that says Mary At least he did in the campaign Well this time Ill go public and very hard In what form Im not sure but I guarantee youll see some fire Lindsay shakes his head Its so asinine he adds contemptuously Its so easy to talk tough Hell theres some that thought I was pretty tough Lets see if he walks the streets of Harlem at I in the morning in the middle of a potential riot says Mary Then Ill believe it Why is there this personal antipathy between the two of you he is asked I have no idea says Lindsay Jealousy snaps Mary Johns attractive and sexy hes neither She stands up and heads for the kitchen A moment later she returns with a bowl of salted peanuts Ill tell you one thing she continues emphatically a lot of people would like to see John Lindsay back in government Hes desperately needed I look at whats going on in Washington and  She winces Theres just no leadership in this country Lindsay nods slowly There is not it turns out much love lost between the former Mayor and the current occupant of the White House Lindsay met Jimmy Carter only once on a courtesy call to the Georgia Governors mansion during Lindsays Presidential bid in 1972 and things went very badly indeed Lindsays former press secretary recalls that Carter lectured him told him that New York City had to learn to pull itself up by the bootstraps as Atlanta had done  while we knew that Atlanta wasnt in much better shape than we were According to one source after Carters election to the presidency Lindsaywho has a keen interest in foreign affairs angled for a top post in the State Department Lindsay himself acknowledges that he was pushed for an ambassadorship to France by his old boss former Attorney General Herbert Brownell no offers of any kind were Mary Lindsay sits back down in her chair A lot of people think we need John back in poilitcs she continues On Thanksgiving we were walking back from playing tennis under the Queensboro Bridge and there was a young man in a Con Ed hole All we could see was his head Hey John he called boy do we ever need you back We hear it all the timefrom workers policemen even dear old cabbies Lindsay smiles wanly Yeah but according to CBS and their polls people think differently Mary slices the air with her hand I dont give a hoot what they say She smiles Excuse my language But I dont believe most of what they put on television much less those polls She turns to her husband Youre the best example of how much polls are worth in 1965 you won as a Republican in New York City Lindsay has no response to that just takes up a handful of nuts and stares straight ahead Well he says at last if people swallow this kind of stuff maybe theyre getting what they deserve Were certainly getting more and more mediocrity Mary rises again How about some sherry sweetheart Yes thank you He watches her retreat toward the kitchen then goes on It seems theres mediocrity everywhere just a total lack of leadership Look at the economy Its almosthe laughslike my book The reference is to Lindsays novel The Edge a political thriller set in the very near future with the country in the throes of economic chaos and wanton lawlessness The book published in early 1976 was less than enthusiastically receivedSeven Years in May one reviewer called itbut the critics were looking for the wrong things Beyond the unlikely plot twists beyond the labored prose was something far more intriguingJohn Lindsays perception of himself The central character in the book is a courageous young Congressmanthe kind who routinely wades into hostile crowdswho risking first his political future and then his life prevents the nation from sliding into totalitarianism Yes Lindsay acknowledges there are a lot of real people in there The attorney general in the book is based on Herb Brownell And his assistant is modeled on Lee Rankin my first corporation counsel And the Congressmans assistant is Pat Vecchio who was my chief of security at City Hall And soon And the Congressman himself Lindsay smiles It was no picnic being Mayor There was always the threat of violence bombs guns knives But I dont think I ever backed away from the moral tests the tough onesthe Civilian Review Board or school decentralization Mary returns and hands him his sherry in a mug It is dark outside now and the only light in the room comes from the fire But today he continues softly well there doesnt seem to be any moral leadership We just seem to be drifting And there are times I feel very frustrated because I cant do anything about it He turns to his left and suddenly that familiar profile is silhouetted against the fire He lifts the mug slowly to his lips and takes a long sip But I suppose people dont realize how bad things are He pauses Except maybe for that guy in the hole on Thanksgiving that one lonely guy calling out Come on back we need you  And John Lindsay chuckles quietly to himself
PROBLEMS OF A PROBLEM SOLVER,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/08/archives/problems-of-a-problem-solver.html,Just a few steps down the hall from President Carters Oval Office is the study where he likes to read in the stillness of evening or early morning against a musical background of Beethoven or Bartok It is an ample rather formal room furnished in brocades At the end of President Carters first year it is clear that he has chosen to rush into decisionmaking at the cost of projecting a clear vision of the American future fine old woods Over the fireplace large oil portrait of Rosalynn and Amy faces him Behind his maple desk the President has mounted a handsome wellpolished flintlock rifle handcrafted by a Georgia friend Snapshots of his mother Lillian and brother Billy peer over a huge globe This is where Jimmy Carter has made some of his most trying decisions Last June for example approaching a decision on the B1 bomber he was caught in a political cross fire The military brass and political conservatives urged him to produce 244 bombers for the 1980s Liberals pressed him to scrap the B1 in favor of domestic social programs He met with both sides and called for memos from the Pentagon the State Department the National Security Council staff and other agencies Then he retired to his study to pore over the memos jotting down his personal reactions As if he were back at Annapolis doing a staff study he wrote out the pros and cons on a yellow legal pad  47 arguments in all Neatly in the margin he assigned numerical weights to each A modest pro argument got two points a crucial con argument five At the bottom he computed the totals The arithmetic went against the B1 So did President Carter To Hamilton Jordan the Presidents chief political aide the B1 decision epitomizes the best of Jimmy Carters first year in office He was boldly redeeming a campaign pledge making his own fresh mark on an old problem forging a clean decision that broke with what Jordan derisively calls the Washington tradition of the downthemiddlesplit on a tough issue What is more revealing that legal pad with its orderly calculus of 47 arguments captures Carter at what members of his inner circle say is his favorite part of the Presidency  problemsolving As one aide remarked He does not agonize over decisions He calculates solutions Above all Jimmy Carter is a problemsolving President and that essential cast of mind explains many of his strengths and weaknesses as a leader and some of the successes and setbacks of his first year in office It underscores what he has chosen to emphasize and what has suffered from relative neglect But his rush into decisionmaking and problemsolving has taken such precedence over vital political functions that Mr Carter has paid Hedrick Smith is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times price  never more obviously than on the energy program So far in office this slim blueeyed farmerbusinessman has taken more pains to construct what he likes to call comprehensive solutions for nagging national issues than to negotiate their paccage He has been less a political dreamer social reformer or legislative leader than an engineer a manager Robert McNamara in the White House Carters an engineering officer protege of Admiral Rickover observed Energy Secretary James Schlesinger who spent days personally working out the energy program with the President Rickover has to know how every single engine or pump works Carter is that way He looks upon government as machinery to be improved to be lubricated Thus it has become clear that when the President speaks of reform  welfare reform tax reform etc  he projects not so much an urge for social revolution as the drive for renovating and remodeling Government programs For example when Joseph Califano Secretary of Health Education and Welfare was asked which experience most captured the spirit of the Carter Presidency he passed over such big items as welfare or Social Security I remember how the President reacted when I told him that we were cutting down paper work by consolidating the number of forms HEW requires from schools and other institutions Califano recalled You report something like that to the President and he says Im very proud of you Im going to mention that at the Cabinet meeting  What has surprised and disappointed most of Washington is how much Carter the technocrat has so far overshadowed Carter the politician This has produced a kind of executive leadership frustrating and puzzling to Congress and the country Jimmy Carter first surprised and impressed the professional pols in 1976 with the cold cocksure methodical manner with which he stalked the Presidency The surprise of 1977 was that Jimmy Carter was actually not the master politician they had imagined There had been a magic in his campaign And in his first months of office with his informal stroll with Rosalynn and Amy down Pennsylvania Avenue and his telephone callin show he had fired the imagination of ordinary folk In office he communicated a fresh beginning He quickly struck contrasts with Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford emphasizing principle showing intellect Ostentatiously he undid the secretive ways the embattled atmosphere the imperial pomp Since Ford had been cautious unpretentious conservative Carter sought to be bold assertive dynamic Where Nixon was inaccessible Carter was open Where Ford lowered expectations Carter lifted them Indeed that became a central problem As Vice President Mondale belatedly conceded President Carters exaggerated aspirations and his profusion of proposals invited inevitable disappointment Press Secretary Jody Powell gibed that a more cynical and experienced politician in the White House would have tried less gotten less and been given better marks Actually as Presidential first years go Carters was not so bad People forget that Truman Eisenhower Kennedy and Nixon were all criticized after their first 12 months for inexperience difficulties with Congress and inadequate results Among recent Presidents only Lyndon Johnson building upon the political sympathies aroused by Kennedys assassination escaped firstyear disenchantment In the past year Carter set a new tone at the White House In Jody Powells apt phrase he depomped the trappings of the Imperial Presidency And with 21 press conferences and 16 meetings with outoftown editors he made good on a campaign pledge to run a more open Administration Carter has nurtured the dramatic flowering of direct negotiations between Egyptian President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Begin He has recovered from a false start with the Russians and is now making headway on arms control Thanks in part to Carter pump priming the economy has grown a respectable 5 percent though the President has chosen the long slow approach to fighting unemployment With roughly 2to1 majorities in both Houses he has compiled a moderately productive legislative record that compares favorably with that of all but few other firstyear Presidents this century Congress passed his economicstimulus package approved refinancing of Social Security set up an Energy Department raised the minimum wage and farm price supports and gave him authority to reorganize the Government But it blocked his proposals for election reform a consumerprotection agency and healthcost containment and forced him to Carter keeps in touch impressing aides with his grasp of details and principles compromise on cutting back water projects it cut 9 out of 30 he proposed More important it stalled on his energy program for an entire year Welfare reform faces rough sledding in 1978 and Carter has had to trim plans for tax reform in favor of tax incentives to accommodate Congress and the economy Yet whatever the actual record Carters year ended with an awkward loss of lan and momentum He has found the politics of governing far different from those of getting elected Surprisingly Carters most crucial shortcoming in office has been his failure to project an aura of national leadership and to define his vision of the American future He has shown the feistiness of Truman without Lyndon Johnsons uncanny mastery of the legislature or the charisma of Kennedy His unraveling  and it may be temporary for he can recover in 1978  began in late summer with the Bert Lance affair It not only distracted Carter and his Georgia intimates from other more important affairs but ate away at the Presidents credibility with the public Politically his handling of the affair looked inept More broadly he has been hurt by the public impression that a President who campaigned promising to end stalemated government has spent a year at loggerheads with Congress Carter himself has chafed at the deadlocks At one breakfast with the Democratic leadership of Congress he declared in frustration that it would be a devastating blow not to pass his energy package by the end of 1977 because it would look as though a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress could not work together He was right The sense that he was ineffectual with Congress undercut public confidence Carters popularapproval rating in the Gallup poll sank to 56 percent  lower than the yearend rating of any elected President since Eisenhower By late fall the Harris poll found that a majority of people said that while they considered President Carter wellintentioned they wondered if he had the basic competence for the job They felt that he suffered from inexperience and failure to follow through The President himself sensing the problem joked about his poor relations with Capitol Hill Someone he said advised him to treat Congress as he had treated the Georgia legislature It didnt work he quipped They treated me like the Governor of Georgia Many of Carters problems are not of his making After Watergate and Vietnam Congress resists domination and the nation is wary of inspiration As a result of reforms power in Congress is so widely dispersed that a President can no longer strike his bargains with just a few barons The political parties are fragmented and the country has little stomach for confronting tough social issues Moreover compared with the KennedyJohnson years far more people today ask whether big government can provide solutions or whether big government itself is the problem We are in an awkward period where the country is out of sync Jody Powell observed The Republican years that should have been a period of consolidation and catching our breath didnt work out that way We didnt do a lot on the big problems welfare energy taxes and so on But we didnt catch our breath either We spent a lot of our national will and energy on the war and Watergate So now that we have arrived at a time when we need to face these problems we have not accumulated the necessary reservoir of will and determination When you get an activist President whos determined to tackle these problems hes got  weve got  a tricky problem summoning the public energies Perhaps Carters keenest lesson is the one that every new President comes to learn the limits of his power Carter must have learned this early because one day last summer he was in such a good humor that his secretary Susan Clough asked what had lifted his spirits Oh he replied I sat down this morning and thought about it and decided this job was hopeless Now that I know its hopeless I feel better Little problems like the White House mice have proved as intractable as big ones When a couple of mice scampered across the Presidents study one evening last spring an alarm went out to the General Services Administration housekeeper of Federal buildings Some weeks later another mouse climbed up inside a wall of the Oval Office and died The Presidents office was bathed in the odor of dead mouse as Carter prepared to greet visiting Latin American dignitaries An emergency call went out to GSA But it refused to touch the matter Officials insisted that they had exterminated all the inside mice in the White House and this errant mouse must have come from outside and therefore was the responsibility of the Interior Department Interior demurred saying that the dead mouse was now inside the White House President Carter summoned officials from both agencies to his desk and exploded I cant even get a damn mouse out of my office Ultimately it took an interagency task force to get rid of the mouse Like other Presidents and despite little background Jimmy Carter has been drawn to foreign policy where he feels more sovereign He has backed away from some early overly optimistic efforts to open relations with Vietnam and Cuba to stop West Germany and France from selling nuclear reprocessing technology to Brazil and Pakistan or to push the Soviet Union and other countries on human rights Carter sorely misjudged the Russians with his first armsreduction proposal but has recouped by accepting more modest aims and a slower negotiating schedule now a new arms agreement seems likely in 1978 His forays into Middle Eastern diplomacy were similarly marked by inexperience his repeated slips of tongue and his occasional insensitivity to domestic political reaction Again Carter has recovered and by pursuing a publicly aggressive peacemaking strategy he has contributed to the surprising breakthrough into direct EgyptianIsraeli negotiations But success or failure with Congress will be the ultimate touchstone As one Cabinet officer observed to have clout with Congress a Chief Executive should have obvious political coattails so that members benefit by cooperating with him Carter not only contributed almost nothing to the 1976 victories of Congressional Democrats but he ran a weaker race than most He has compounded that problem by omitting many of the little political niceties that boost other politicians stock Flying West in late October Carter took several members of Congress with him At one point he told Senator Dick Clark an Iowa Democrat that a White House study showed that on recorded votes Clark was the Administrations closest supporter in the Senate Given this record Clark was astounded when the President speaking at a JeffersonJackson Day dinner in Des Moines never mentioned Clarks name though he faces a tough battle for reelection in 1978 Thats a hell of a way to treat supporters said one astonished Senator Its no way to build alliances on the Hill And there are plenty of similar stories As an outsider who has worn a political chip on his shoulder Carter has had particular difficulty in forging Congressional alliances His most ardent important and loyal champion is House Speaker Thomas P Tip ONeill Jr In the Senate Hubert Humphrey has been his most valuable ally In public the White House speaks warmly of Senator Robert Byrd the majority leader but one senior Senator remarked Thats an uneasy relationship  Byrd never really lets them know where he stands Hes his own man After his rather highhanded and insensitive beginnings Carter makes sure to be accessible to Congress But as one high Administration official conceded The President does not have an easy personal relationship with many people on Capitol Hill He has that Southern manner He smiles and makes polite conversation but he does not draw people into intimate relationships Hes a very private person underneath that politeness The Presidents lack of legislative strategy has also been crippling Floundering in his glut of proposals ONeill and Byrd begged him for weeks to set priorities Other leaders complained about erratic White House tactics bemoaning the fact that a bill that was top priority one day was not even mentioned by the President at a news conference the next day Vice President Mondale conceded in a yearend interview that some Carter proposals had suffered from fratricide as he put itthe concept in missilery where you fire too many missiles too close together and they kill each other off It was as if the President with his problemsolvers mentality felt he had done his job working out solutions and assumed the legislative process would happen automatically As one leading Congressional Democrat remarked Its that engineering attitude  he studies them carefully puts together the most rational package and sends it to us The unspoken assumption is that it ought to move ahead of its own weight because the program was the result of a rational decisionmaking process Youd think hed know that he has to pay more attention and work harder for his pet projects  energy welfare reform the Panama Canal Treaty The energy program is the prime example of a proposal that suffered from poor legislative preparation and bad followthrough Publicly the Administration argues that there were inherent difficulties in passing such a controversial program given regional economic and philosophical conflicts in Congress and the country Privately some high officials also assert that the package was prematurely rushed to Congress because of Carters insistence on meeting a preset deadline and then was mishandled along the way Although some advice and information were sought from Congress in the early drafting of the program there was no real effort at consulting key members on the actual package Carter and Energy Secretary James Schlesinger played it so close to the vest that other officials had to pry their way into the process of policy formulation In unveiling the energy program the Administration also came across as uncertain and illprepared On television on April 18 President Carter proclaimed the moral equivalent of war on energy projecting changes in the American life style Two nights later addressing Congress he backpedaled and said no real sacrifices were necessary His momentum was quickly dissipated Although badly cut up in House committees with the gasolinetax proposal stripped away the energy program ultimately emerged fairly intact thanks to shrewd parliamentary organizing by Speaker ONeill But the White House overconfident and unsophisticated about the Senate again let momentum slip away while the oil and gas lobbies organized We were all kind of happy and patting ourselves on the back for what we did in the House and they were getting their act together conceded a senior White House official While Carter and his top aides were distracted by the Lance affair and the hoopla over the Panama Canal Treaty the energy bills were gutted by Senate committees But the most disastrous gaffe was to kill the filibuster against deregulation of naturalgas prices by liberals sympathetic to the White House By Oct 1 several felt their situation was hopeless and agreed that since they were delaying Administration efforts to bring the energy package to the Senate floor they would end their filibuster if President Carter thanked them and gave them an honorable way out Senator Dale Bumpers an Arkansas Democrat telephoned the President who is reported to have agreed with their scheme He later called back to say that since Schlesinger would be on Issues and Answers on Oct 2 he would make the Administration statement It never came Instead without advance warning to the liberals Vice President Mondale collaborated with Senator Byrd the majority leader in killing the filibuster The liberals feeling doublecrossed were furious Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota was so mad he called the President a liar Feelings were Later it was the President who was mad After he canceled his projected foreign trip in late November to be on hand for what was expected to be the decisive HouseSenate bargaining on energy legislation the Senators took a long Thanksgiving recess Carter had to cool his heels at Camp David He was really steamed up about it said one of the Democratic leaders who met with him on Nov 30 He got his ego out on a limb and he didnt like being left hanging that way But in Congress some faulted the President for not having been tougher on the Senators By early December President Carter was more vigorously knocking heads together but not before another contretemps with the liberals irked by what they took to be Schlesingers premature public willingness to compromise on several key issues Carter repaired that damage but was unable to resolve the basic deadlock thus suffering what he acknowledged was the major failure of his freshman year Some of Carters legislative sagas have had happier endings He and his aides came off looking rather well in the final bargaining over the huge new tax bill aimed at propping up the Social Security System That was largely the work of Speaker Tip ONeill Frank Moore the White House Congressional liaison chief and HEW Secretary Califano Ultimately Carter gave ground on two important points  his proposal that at times of high unemployment the Social Security System tap general tax revenues and another proposal that employers pay a higher Social Security tax rate than employees The last battle came on an amendment by Senator William Roth Jr a Delaware Republican to add a 250 incometax credit for college tuition Califano and others wanted the Presidents agreement to veto threat if that were not removed from the bill Tip called me Califano said and wanted to be sure the President was on board with the arrangement we were then trying to make to get the Roth amendment off the bill called the President and we talked it through for 15 minutes He said If you and Frank Moore are in agreement go ahead It was quite a contrast with the Johnson years [when Califano worked in the White House] Then the Secretary of HEW would not have gotten through to the President He would have talked with me or Larry OBrien Either we would have made the decision or it would have taken longer to get a decision from Johnson But with Carter the access is easy and hell make a quick decision for you The threatened veto worked and the Roth amendment was dropped As that case indicates Carter has been unfairly charged with inflexibility Both in domestic and foreign policy he has been more ready to compromise and adjust than his Georgia ma fia predicted When his first armscontrol package was brusquely rejected by Moscow he tried another approach When President Sadat of Egypt began his solo diplomacy upsetting the scenario the initial American reaction was peeved and wary But fairly quickly Carter shifted and backed Sadat With Congress he has made even more compromises When he ran into unbeatable opposition he backed off from his 50 tax rebate Originally he balked at higher spending by the Labor and HEW Departments and higher farm price supports Ultimately he accepted both On his efforts to kill the 30 water projects he settled for nine But he is not a natural bargainer On the contrary both his own entourage and Congressional leaders say that he is uneasy with the horsetrading and back slapping integral to Congressional politics The President has an almost patented smile and a charming manner but the negotiating style of Jimmy Carter the problemsolver is almost the opposite that of Lyndon Johnson the master persuader Lyndon had spent 25 years on the Hill before he became President observed Jim Wright Jr another Texas Democrat who is now House majority leader He was familiar with the rules written and unwritten and the mores and personalities of the legislative branch whereas Jimmy Carter has not had that experience Also the problem is that Jimmy Carter wants to be Mr Clean He has an instinctive aversion to patronage He does not like to indulge in quid pro quo Im not a critic of the President I want to help him But this is just part of his being a reformer and his wanting to be above the nittygritty of politics I think he came to office thinking there was something a bit corrupt and sordid about the political giveandtake of Washington Carters young Georgians put a different cast on it Jimmys a realist said one He knows that you dont get things done without bargaining But its not something that comes easily Nor is he easy to contradict or to turn around once his mind is set His breakfasts with the Congressional leadership are described as pretty candid but few people oppose him headon Hes a prickly guy about criticism said one leading Democrat It depends on who gives it to him If it comes from Tip ONeill he knows this is his champion and hell take it But its different from Byrd He does not confront the President directly What Byrd does is articulate the problems of achieving something that the President wants But Tip can take him on headon I remember on one issue the President saying Ill be glad to call soandso on that and Tip saying Mr President you stay the hell away from that And everybody laughed because the chemistry is right between Tip and the President But you cant imagine Bob Byrd doing that Most newcomers to his official circle describe him as openminded while weighing a decision On welfare reform Carter initially took a hard line on holding spending at current levels After the first briefing by HEW Secretary Califano who proposed considerable increases Carter is said to have declared Hell Joe if its going to cost more leave it like it is But eventually Califano and other senior advisers persuaded the President to earmark several billion dollars more for welfare reform Similarly over the past few weeks Carters top economic advisers have gradually talked him out of attempting major tax reform next year and into settling instead for a major tax cut with a modicum of reform Carter can be sticky One high official recalled a meeting last spring at which about 10 of Carters top economic advisers White House aides and Vice President Mondale were unanimously opposed to the antiinflation program They found it too weak As Jack Watson Jr the Cabinet Secretary went to get the President this official said Vice President Mondale ducked out and put Treasury Secretary W Michael Blumenthal in charge of setting out the groups views to Carter After listening the President said somewhat coldly Well if thats what you have decided that doesnt leave me much to do Then he forcefully set out why he felt he should go ahead after which several participants abandoned their earlier position telling him that he had misunderstood So you see said this official some people find it hard to disagree with him and make it stick Like other Chief Executives Carter finds it hard to admit mistakes more than most he hates to reverse himself Some of the most painful discussions I have had with the President have been over decisions he has already made said one highlevel aide He does not like to be asked to reconsider decisions Once this official took the responsibility of holding back some Presidential instructions overnight because he thought they were mistaken The next morning he called the President to reopen the issue His first reaction was Ive already decided that  the official said and I told him Well you wouldnt want me to go ahead if I thought it was wrong would you And he softened and we argued for about 20 minutes When the aide finally persuaded Carter to change the decision the President himself sensing how rare that was commented Mark that one down as one for you That doesnt hapstiffnecked Georgia pride marked Carters long refusal to let budget director Bert Lance go despite politically damaging controversy over Lances former banking practices Carters entourage insists that Carter was motivated primarily by loyalty to an old friend and by the conviction that Lance was being hounded unfairly and had right to his day in court He also seemed to display prickliness about having his own judgment questioned for having picked Lance originally without knowing more about Lances bank overdrafts or various investigations into them For all his graciousness and winning Southern charm Carter has a tendency to give a political cold shoulder to those who have given him too much dissenting advice He simply stares at you or ignores you completely for a while one Cabinet Secretary said Others speak of Carters icy look One potentially serious consequence is that toward the years end some Cabinet officials were talking more bluntly to each other and occasionally to the press  about fundamental problems than they dared to talk to the President himself In his own relations with the press Carter has been careful  and successful so far  to avoid the acrimonious feuding that plagued the Nixon Administration though at times he has privately chafed over what he considers unfair coverage As he rather candidly told James Reston he finds some degree of complete irresponsibility and some absence of integrity some deliberate distortion Carter has been particularly touchy about articles containing inhouse criticism of him his top aides or his Cabinet so touchy that his entourage even the Vice President is now extremely skittish about telling little human anecdotes about Carter that might reflect unfavorably on him Several aides described the President as having been downcast one day because of a long Washington Post article criticizing Frank Moore his Congressional liaison chief Another time Carter was so angered by a Chicago Tribune article sniping at Cabinet members that he was ready to fire off a letter to the editor Jody Powell stopped him and persuaded the President to let him write the letter instead But the article that caused Carter to smart most was one by James Wooten in The New York Times last April 24 It described the President as a leader who tends to be brusque with dissenters to intimidate subordinates to retreat into solitary decisionmaking and to cling to power rather than decentralize it as he promised in his campaign Powell who has been remarkably effective in his handling of the press got in such a choler about that piece that he launched a Nixonian witch hunt questioning 20 White House aides about whether they had talked to Wooten Later when the heat had subsided he tried to pass this off as his own personal anger not Carters But other White House officials said the President had taken it hard To one who tried to humor him out of his funk by poking fun at the article Carter shot back It wasnt funny Carter has made a show of reestablishing Cabinet government with his weekly Monday Cabinet meetings which some aides and Cabinet members regard as timewasting But Carter evidently likes them as a means of monitoring Government operations and as a forum for conveying his thinking to his Administration Although he has restored to the Cabinet Secretaries the authority to manage their own departments he has held at the White House the real policyraking authority Most of the talk about Cabinet government groused an influential Cabinet member is lip service Not since Eisenhower he contended has any President truly delegated authority to the Cabinet As one subCabinet official suggested the real problem is that the White House and Cabinet have contradictory notions of Cabinet government The Cabinet Secretaries think it means that they develop their programs and present them to the White House and they both go forward together to Congress this woman said The White House sees it the other way around  as developing its programs getting them through Congress and having the Departments implement them Another high official remarked that while domestic programs were actually developed jointly by the White House and Cabinetcentered task forces the flow of fundamental ideas has come from the White House  basically from Carters campaign and that so long as this was so Cabinet government would not Surprisingly for all his concern about organizational efficiency Carters White House staff is almost unstructured As other Democratic Presidents have Carter resists appointing a chief of staff Evidently he prefers to play that role himself with the result that his White House suffers from disorganization confusion and duplication of effort Even more striking in the Carter White House by comparison with those of Kennedy and Johnson is the dearth of aides outside of Stuart Eizenstat his domestic adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski his nationalsecurity adviser and economist Charles Schultze who are primarily concerned with the substance of policymaking Its almost a clich for Presidential aides to laud the Chief Executives own expertise but in Carters case the praise comes also from career bureaucrats who having seen several Administrations are deeply impressed with Carters brilliance To a person they are dazzled by his mental sharpness and his knowledge of of the intricacies of arms control farmprice supports line items in the defense budget and the cost of inspecting faulty dams All remark about how closely he reads memos sending them back with his handwritten comments As a policymaker Carter comes across as a loner With the forced departure of Bert Lance and with the refusal of his old political crony Charles Kirbo to take a job in Washington President Carter is without a close Washington confidant and peer with whom he can privately chew over the issues Jimmy Carter is the kind of man whose strength comes from within rather than from associations said one Cabinet official He organizes himself He organizes his ideas He does not have a large substantive staff around him which is organizing the Government for him Thats a weakness The most prominent of them is Stu Eizenstat who is 20 years younger than he is Its a different kind of relationship than youd have between a Kennedy and a Sorensen or a Larry OBrien or between Nixon and Mitchell or Ehrlichman or between Eisenhower and Sherman Adams Those were men who knew each others minds without any gap in age and who shared the same assumptions Jimmy Carter does not have that kind of peerfriend around him Some of the people in his Cabinet are disappointed with his privacy and reserve You know in some ways he is as private a man as It is also characteristic of his Administration that it does not have any towering dynamic or even controversial figures in the new Cabinet such as a Dulles an Acheson a McNamara or a Kissinger Now the more influential Cabinet figures are Schlesinger at Energy Califano at HEW Cyrus Vance at State and Harold Brown at the Pentagon But none compete with Jimmy Carter for Washingtons attention In December 1961 writing of John F Kennedys freshman year James Reston commented The President started this year talking as if he could create the stream of history now he knows that mortal men can merely navigate it Much the same could be written about Jimmy Carter whose mistakes have been those of inexperience innocence and idealism and who now shows the seasoning of his first year by talking of the lessons he has learned As he told a news conference he sees the danger of overheating popular expectations and says he plans to slow the pace of his legislative initiatives in 1978 In another forum he expressed new appreciation for the accumulated expertise in Congress indicating that he recognizes the need to consult more seriously with key members He has also revealed that Vice President Mondale has worked out an agenda for 1978 to insure that priorities are better set and and the legislative calendar more realistic than in 1977 It is less clear whether the President sees his organizational problems at the White House and the need to form a network of alliances with the politically crucial power structure of the Senate His aides keep saying that a breakthrough in the Middle East on arms control or on the Panama Canal Treaty would restore momentum in 1978 But all these are politically perilous issues that could suddenly turn dramatically against the President as easily as for him Most significant it is unclear whether Carter the problemsolver understands that his greatest shortcoming so far has been his failure to rouse the nation with the lift of a driving dream or the thrust of eloquent rhetoric Surprisingly given his skill on the political stump he has not used the White House effectively as a bully pulpit If there is one area that see the biggest failure it is exactly in that area concedes Jody Powell We havent clearly enough articulated that overarching unifying theme or presentation of what were about or the way were approaching things We spent so much time in getting under way on the Administrations work that we did not spend enough time in explaining it in an understandable way to the public But this is more than a problem of public relations It is a matter of Carters articulating a clear vision of the American future As candidate and President Jimmy Carter has avoided political labels and ideological pigeonholes He has won favor with the informality and openness of his Administration but even living in the goldfish bowl of national publicity he has frustrated those who want to know him and his Presidential philosophy more precisely Im not sure there is a generalized political philosophy said one close aide If you want to know where Jimmy Carter stands tell him what the problem is and what needs to be solved His first years decisions reflect an amalgam of attitudes  neither traditional Democratic liberalism nor privateenterprise Republicanism His ambivalence frustrates not only constituencies that want to capture him but members of his Cabinet In short for all his celebrated decisiveness Jimmy Carter has still not jelled as President Nor is this unusual Around the end of Kennedys first year James MacGregor Burns the Presidential scholar from Williams College wrote that there was not one President Kennedy but four  the rhetorical radical the policy liberal the economic moderate and the institutional conservative The four Kennedys he argued were incompatible and the Kennedy Presidency would not take on political momentum until these contending personalities were fused Jimmy Carter is similarly contradictory In the Burns formula he is a rhetorical populist a programmatic moderate a fiscal conservative and an institutional liberal In personal terms he can be warmhearted and icyeyed He can speak with compassion about unemployed black youths in cities and yet coldly remark that life is unfair to explain his opposition to Federal financing of most abortions for poor women mostly urban blacks He is constantly trying to split the differences between his conservative urge to balance the budget by 1981 tight as a tick is the way Jody Powell described him and the political pressures inside and outside his Administration for a more expansive welfare program a more generous farm bill a higher minimum wage and a broader assault on the nations urban problems He vacillates between a Republican belief that the Federal Government should do less and the private sector more and the modern Democratic faith that Government intervention is needed to solve pressing social problems Carters inner contradictions come out most sharply on economic policy He frustrates the political right by speaking out against inflation but then accepting or promoting inflationary programs that help produce what Treasury Secretary Blumenthal calls the lowest level of business confidence in some time He feuds privately with Arthur Burns the conservative chairman of the Federal Reserve Board about the impact of higher interest rates on the economy and then publicly makes peace with Burns to pacify business  only to replace him in the end risking new corporate worries He shifts away from tax reform to tax cutting to spur the business investment But on the left he seesaws on minimum wages or spending on urban policy aggravating labor the blacks and liberals Typically he has finally endorsed the HumphreyHawkins bill that sets a national target of 4 percent unemployment by 1983 But in so doing he has disarmed the bill by striking out the provision to make the Government the employer of last resort and by adding loopholes that will let him balance off job creation with fighting inflation Theres an inherent tension between [his] urge to reform and the need to expand the economy through business investments said one Cabinet member He is still imbued with the notion that he must redeem all his campaign commitments added another and hes still not ready to admit that some of these things  like 4 percent unemployment and 4 percent inflation and a balanced budget are

Abortion Opponents’ Tactics,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/11/archives/abortion-opponents-tactics.html,When the United States Supreme Court legalized abortion five years ago on Jan 22 1973 none of us who had struggled so long for abortion rights could have predicted that this issue would soon polarize the nation The debate for years had been reasonably calm One often enjoyed the dedication of the opposition Even when I announced after publication of my book Abortion in 1966 that I was referring women seeking abortions to qualjfied doctors this open testing of the laws produced amazingly little anger or harassment in some 2500 cases But in the last year or so the antiabortionists have injected a level of rage and often streetgang tactics that seem close to madness They recently raided a Planned Parenthood clinic in Norwich Conn forcing their way past the staff in an attempt to seize records of abortion patients They chained themselves to the furniture at a Washington DC clinic obstructing further treatment until the police could dismantle the furniture and remove the chains Opposition to abortion has now become the spearhead of political fanaticism It has been used to unify a new political coalitiona rightwing group drawing on the constituency of George Wallaces American Independent Party which polled almost 10 million votes in 1968 Situated largely in the South the Midwest and strongholds of Roman Catholic conservatism like Suffolk County L1 this coalition revolves around all issues presumably posing a threat toThe American family Phyllis Schlafly for example a primary opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment also campaigns against abortion Antiabortion groups were conspicuous at her recent antiERA rally in Houston Many of the opponents of gay rights in Florida also coordinate the attack on abortion rights At an antiERA rally in Tallahassee the Florida Stop ERA president lashed out at school busing as well The emergence of this coalition centered on opposition to abortion has enabled the Roman Catholic hierarchy to assert an authority in politics that frequently eluded it in the past decade It lost its campaign against birth control even among its ewn parishioners years ago It has had minimal success with stopping divorce reform and gaining public funding for parochial schools But opposition to abortion gave Catholic officials sorely needed links to powerful allies like former Congressman John G Schmitz the American Independent Party Presidential candidate in 1972 There were new religious allies the Mormons Orthodox Jews and above all Protestant Fundamentalists The strength of this religiousrightwing alliance has opened a route to the White House A delegation from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops had no trouble obtaining an appointment with President Carter to present its case against abortion By contrast the Religious Coalition on Abortion Rights representing a majority of Protestant and Jewish organizations has sought in vain to see the President for months The traditional harrier between church and state under the First Amendment has been further threatened by the Catholic bishops financial contributions to the antiabortion campaign Over 900000 was contributed from January 1976 to March 1977 to the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment the front group seeking to combat the Supreme Ceurt decision on abortion Half this amount came from scores of Roman Catholic dioceses20000 from the archdiocese of New York the same from the diocese of Wheeling W Va 16000 from the diocese of Hartford Conn All these dioceses are taxexempt While taxexempt religious organizations now have some latitude in political contributions never before has ene church under orders from its leadership financed a political campaign to the extent of half its funds Nothing has jolted the hierarchy more than the split in Catholic attitudes on abortion A Lou Harris poll in November 1976 showed that 52 percent of Catholics approved the Supreme Courts legalization of abortion with 39 percent opposed While about half of all Catholics disagree with official dogma the hierarchy puts increasing pressure on its hardcore faithful On the fifth anniversary of legalized abortion the immediate losers from the rise in fantaticism are the poor The longrun victim may be the First Amendment The Catholic hierarchy has misjudged the commitment of most Americans to abortion rights The free choice to bear or not to bear a child has become as fundathental to American rights as free speech and free press Any further threat to abortion rights and to separation of church and state could bring the freechoice majority to adopt tactics as extremist as those of the antiabortion minority

appeared in newspapers in the metropolitan area do not seem extraordinary but they would not have been placed at all prior to a ruling last year by the United States Supreme Court The first two advertisements are for dentists and the third is for a lawyer The Supreme Court ruling last June 27 found unconstitutional a ban on advertising by lawyers Since then lawyers in New York and around the

to provide a service he certainly should have the right to tell people what the service will cost Some dentists object strongly to their colleagues advertising cutrate prices One of them is Dr Errol Lader a West Islip LL dentist who said that the cutrate dental offices kept prices down by using materials of lesser quality and by employing techniques not universally accepted Advertising tends to put dentistry in the category of a business he said Dentistry is a step above a businessIt is a profession To this Dr Homer responded If its not a business why then do they give management courses in dental schools Dr Horner also defended the quality of his work My dentures are as good as any made in any other office he said The difference in cost is that other dentists charge whatever the traffic will bear Dr Horner charges 125 to 150 for each tooth in dentures Dr Lader called 350 a reasonable price More Advertising in Suburbs At this point most of the advertising by professionals seems to be concentrated in the suburbs One apparent reason is the lowerpriced advertising in smallercirculation suburban newspapers another is that because the population is spread more thinly in the suburbs it is more difficult for professional just starting out to build up a large practice quickly without some kind of notice For example in Westchester County the American Denture Service advertises in local

people in need of dental work who have stayed away from it because it was always too expensive The groups prices are lower than those charged by most dentists Dr Meyer said and he predicted that the advertising would meet with success in higherincome areas as well We live in the age of the consumer now and were all going to have to change our approach Deluged With Calls One dentist who was willing to use a highercost New York City newspaper for his advertisements was Dr M David Isaak who has spent up to 3000 each for fullpage ads in The New York Post Dr Isaak who also has a practice in Jersey City opened an office called the Denture Center on East 29th Street It has a laboratory and 10 dentists We were deluged with calls mostly about costs Dr Isaak said I cannot measure the impact because this is a new office but there was no way we could have started such a successful practice without advertising It otherwise would have taken 10 years to build up a practice of this size He added We dentists have been overcharging our patients especially for dentures It is unconscionable to charge such high fees This is not a luxurypeople cannot eat without their teeth Of all the professions physicians seem to be taking the least advantage of the New York ruling One who has advertised is Dr Andre Nehorayoff an obstetriciangynecologist whose office is in Flushing Queens Medical Society Cites Stand Dr Nehorayoff advertises in The Village Voice that he performs abortions for 150 and says that advertising will hold medical costs down He said that he had cleared his advertisement with bis county medical society before placing it although the medical societies are still wrestling with the question of how doctors may advertise After the New York Regents adopted the rules permitting physicians to advertise their services and prices Dr Lawrence Essenson president of the New York County Medical Society said The Medical Society of the County of New York believes that information should be available to the public to enable them to make an informed choice of physician However our society is adamantly opposed to solicitation of patients in the public media as

Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/19/archives/hers.html,DAN WAKEFIELD the novelist who developed the idea for a new television series called James at 15 resigned from the show last week because the network would not tolerate a euphemistic reference to birth control in an episode depicting the young heros loss his virginity Mr Wakefield wanted the boy to ask the girl if she was responsible before intercourse This formulation is really a euphemism for two much more common euphemisms that have echoed in the ears of girls for generations Is it safe and Are you prepared Even the word responsible was considered too strong a dose of reality by the NBC network censors Ralph Daniel vice president of broadcast standards said the network wanted the act to be spontaneous In a statement that 5night have come straight through the looking glass Mr Daniel explained that our concern was that the series didnt appear to be condoning a sex experience without consequences The day after the young people go to bed they begin to worry about pregnancy and they find that there is an emotional distance between them The early euphoria is gone and they experience worry and remorse That becomes their punishment This episode would be funny if it did not epitomize the callousness and irrationality that have hampered the development of a reasonable public policy toward the people who suffer most from spontaneous sex teenaged girls and the babies they bear There is an obvious philosophical connection between network executive who finds it necessary for teenagers to suffer the punishment of worrying about pregnancy and Congressmen who cut off Medicaid funds for abortions    Sunday Ls the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and I find the occasion a sad reminder of the high hopes for more humane and rational policies that accompanied the case Like most women in their 30s and 40s public opinion polls show that women over 50 have more negative attitudes about abortion I was relieved by the decision and especially hopeful about its impact on the young Five years ago I could never have believed that a craven Congress under pressure from a wellorganized and wellfinanced minority would have effectively removed the right to abortion from girls who are young andor poor Even when a girl comes from a welloff family being young in this society usually means being poor in terms of ready access to cash I recently interviewed an official in the Department of Health Education and Welfare who advanced the proposition that no one is too poor to raise 175 for a clinic abortion He is wrong One of the worst memories of my life concerns an attempt to raise the fairly modest sum of 300 for a friend who needed an illegal abortion when we were both 17 I was able to help only because I had a job a newspaper reporter that paid me an unusual amount of money for a teenager While I was waiting for my friend to emerge from the abortionists office I saw another girl turned away because she had only 200 She begged be allowed to raise the additional 100 after the abortion but the abortionists assistant said no have often wondered what happened to that girl as I now wonder what will happen to young girls who can no longer obtain abortions at free clinics At the time of the Supreme Court decision I believed that abortion was settled as a legal and political issue and that the demand for abortions would be greatly reduced within the next few years by effective sensible contraceptive and sex education programs for teenagers I was of course wrong on all counts I had not reckoned with the power of people who are unwilling to face the reality that teenagers of all races and family backgrounds are having sex and having it at an earlier age than the children of previous generations Last year girls between ages 10 and 18 gave birth to about 250000 babies More than 13000 of the births were to girls under 14 An overwhelming majority of these girls art unmarried and incapable of earning a living They run a much greater risk of dying in childbirth than women in their 20s and their babies run a much greater risk of serious birth defects or of dying in the first year of life The birth rate has risen for girls in this age group while it has fallen for youngwomen above age 17    The silly imbroglio over James at 15 is all too typical of the attitudes that have contributed to the steady rise in teenage pregnancies during the 1970s In Fairfax County Va an affluent suburb of Washington the school board finally approved a controversial sex education programwith the provison that any discussion of contraception and venereal disease be forbidden Theres a big myth thet sex education doesnt work that it doesnt have any impact on the behavior of kids says Dr Marlene Hendricks medical director of a highly regarded youth center in Manhattan called The Door for Alternatives In the cases where sex education doesnt work its for the same reason any education doesnt worktheres something wrong with the way the subject is being taught When people want to avoid the subject sex of course sex education wont work Insofar as public policy is confused rather than callous it certainly reflects the private confusion of Americans about sex I recently had a dramatic indication of this in my own life when the 16yearold daughter of a friend came to me and asked me to take her to the doctor for a diaphragm My first reaction was a flat You re too young My second reaction was If youre really old enough to have sex why didnt you just go to the doctor by yourself Then I thought about my first visit to a gynecologist at the age of 18 There was no sympathetic adult in my life and I had to lie and say I was engaged in order to get birth control pills The doctor asked me pointed questions about my intended wedding date and made it clear he thought I was tramp How could I possibly condemn my daughter or anyone elses daughter to going through the initiation rites into womanhood in the same loneliness and fear that I did I couldnt because I am a woman who remembers what it was like to be a girl But I did forget the way it wasit only for a momentin my kneejerk reaction that 18 and not 16 was the proper age for a girl to begin her sex life If I could forget it is easy to see the magnitude of the task women face in trying to change the minds of men like President Carter and HEW Secretary Joseph Califano But it is a task we must accomplish through political pressure and privaet persuasion unless we want the continuation of public policies that promote punishment and remorse as the proper response to teenage sex Because the punishment is greater than young women bear

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/21/archives/letters-westway-and-the-mta-double-injustice-to-men-abortion-and.html,To the Editor Largely overlooked in the seesaw battle on Westway is the position of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority its role and performance At issue here is whether to undertake Westway a real estate and superhighway complex which will take a decade or more to build or to construct quickly a West Side arterial road coupled with a citywide program of subway modernization financed by a masstransit tradeoff The public has a right to expect the MTA to be a masstransit exponent Since it runs our subways and buses it should provide at the very least at an early stage of debate a factual basis for the public to judge the amount of jobs to be created by masstransit projects the nature of those projects and the effect of their completion on the entire masstransportation system Its failure to do so is a powerful argument for meaningful consumer representation on the MTA board While the MTA chief may not have the heart to buck the Establishment the public should not be denied the basic facts it needs to reach a consensus and the MTA is in the best position to provide them for mass transit Further a principal reason for union and contractor opposition to the masstransit tradeoff is the belief that the MTA cannot spend the money fast enough to create enough jobs or complete major projects and that it is hostile to private contractors The entire situation calls for a careful investigation of why this condition exists and how it can be remedied Masstransit modernization is more job intensive has the potential of greater minority employment and would be a greater benefit for the majority of our citizens If it succeeds in bringing riders back to the system it could help stabilize the fare It would be ridiculous to undertake a massive makework project such as Westway because a bureaucracy cant perform work and its board has failed to be responsive to the public need for facts JOEL HARNETT New York Jan 12 1978 The writer is former chairman of the City Club Double Injustice to Men To the Editor In all the discussion about the funding of the Social Security system I have yet to see in print any mention of one aspect of it that is actuarily unsound allowing women to qualify at 62 while men must wait until they are 65 In almost any insurance company rate book you will see that rates for men and women differ because women live approximately five years longer than men Thus women who wished to retire with a specific income at 65 would need higher cash reserves than men because the funds would be needed for a longer time The basic method for creating guaranteed cash reserves is from premiums But for men to pay the same premium as women while allowing women to start collecting benefits three years earlier instead of five years later is a double injustice to men And the very small death benefits dont materially change the picture ANDREW T WOLFSON Westport Conn Jan 15 1978 Abortion and the House To the Editor I must take issue with your December 27 editorial Mr Califano Operates on the Law which contains several inaccuracies As a member of the House of Representatives I participated in the debate on the language finally adopted and established legislative history of Congressional intent of the Michel amendment to the HEWLabor appropriations On Dec 6 1977 I questioned Representative Michel on the intent of his proopsed language or except for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest Found on page H12652 of the Congressional Record of Dec 6 1977 Mr Michel stated that the word abortion is not included in the phrase medical procedures for rape and incest The intent of the House is clear that medical procedures do not include abortion Secretary Califano is quite correct in Ms preliminary guidelines and I am sure that the release of the official guidelines will result in the application of Congressional intent on this matter HAROLD L VOLKMER Member of Congress 9th Dist Mo Washington Jan 9 1978 Of Love and Kisses To the Editor Every time I read a bit of mishmash leaked from the pen of Barbara Courtland the same two thoughts pop into my head This is too good to be true and Shes got to be joking Fortunately for those of us who enjoy a good laugh and unfortunately for those who let her dangle them over the moonlit pit of frigid desire she is not joking But it would be unconvincing if I were to lay ambush to her primrose path simply because I did not agree with her There is enough objective weakness I risk overstating the obvious in her writing to mull over without resorting to her corseted opinions Her style is the perfect stuff from which reactionary literature is fashioned It leaps chasms of logic it disappears into shadows it trips over its slippered feet In reading My Lips are Sealed [OpEd Jan 5] I found four places where she contradicts her main idea and then two more places where she contradicts these contradictions which unhappily do not correct the original contradiction Oh woe is us To cite but one example we are told that kissing is unknown to the Japanese as a token of affection and then that kissing has always been part of romantic love The issue threatens to degenerate into one of semantics but such brash infidelities should not and must not be tolerated in a civilized society such as ours If I were not a lady Madame Courtland I would plant a big sloppy one right on your smacker ELIZABETH G EDWARDS Milford Conn Jan 6 1978 The Better Cabbies To the Editor Mayor Koch will need all the help he can get to bring this city back to its peak Heres one suggestion the first of many to improve life in the city Our taxi service needs a shot in the arm I suggest Mayor Koch invite some representatives of the Taxi Commission or equivalent from that most civilized of cities London London cabs are always in great shape and London cabbies are even better The people who run that show may not be able to turn New York taxi riding into a London experience but they should be able to improve our lot to some extent One quick suggestion Cabs are now required to display their registration and the drivers chauffeurs license on a lighted dashboard That light rarely works and even when it does it is difficult to read any information on those cards Why not require that those licenses be placed on the partition between driver and passenger so that a passenger who has need to complain about or even compliment a driver will be able to do so effectively LAURENCE SHIFF New York Jan 11 1978 Business in the Battle Against Unemployment To the Editor I can think of no more encouraging New Years message than the news that our unemployment rate has dropped to below 7 percent as reported in the front page of The Times on Jan 12 It must however be noted that the percentage drop does not appreciably change the massive unemployment in the ghettos of the United States It is for that reason that the story by your Leonard Silk on the same day which announced the formation of a prestigious committee of top businessmen to deal realistically with unemployment is of much greater significance The newly established Committee of Economic Development has made an analysis of the effects of unemployment on every aspect of our social and economic life The tone of its announcement leaves one with the impression that it is not going to develop studies to prove the obvious The committees premise is clear and understandable    this country cannot justifiably deny its citizens the opportunity to work for an adequate income and to be free from the desperation and frustration that frequent or longterm unemployment bring President Carter might well look to this group for guidance as to his future policy on unemployment His Administration would then abandon attempts to water down the provisions of the HumphreyHawkins bill It is refreshing to hear business representatives reject the concept which I first heard in 1968 that unemployment is necessary to reduce inflation The bold fact is that between 1968 and 1978 unemployment and inflation have kept pace with each other The extraordinarily high percentage rate of unemployment in the poorer sections of our city and the consequent rise in crime result in 100 percent fear among all of our citizens The lpercent increase in the suicide rate as a result of unemployment reflects an increase in the cost of mental health care And so it goes The Committee for Economic Development places the cost to the nation for unemployment at 200 billion a yearand that is more than our economy can bear PAUL ODWYER Pearl River NY Jan 13 1978 To Guard an Empress To the Editor It occurs to me that organizations such as the Asia Society should bear some of the police costs incurred when their affairs openly invite protest demonstrations such as those attending the dinner honoring the Empress of Iran If the United States State Department is party to the invitation of such figures then let the Federal Government also share in the expense of maintaining civil order Lectures from Administration and Congressional figures on the need for stringent economies in our municipal government do not fall on receptive ears when New York is obliged each year to spend millions of dollars on police overtime and related costs incurred in the production of pseudodiplomatic extravagances RICHARD F L CARLSON New York Jan 13 1978 Let Us Not Play Into the Hands of Madmen To the Editor Mr Templemans plea [letter Jan 6] for capital punishment pulls at our heartstrings with its recounting of painful incidents but it is selfcontradictory The first contradiction is the idea that we may make these values [of human life] concrete by executing people We might as well make our repugnance for vandals concrete by smashing their furniture The second contradiction is to maintain that The Timess position on the lack of deterrent effect is not central to the issue but to conclude with a snapshot of the criminal mentality thinking it may as well add murder to robbery because the penalties are the same Clarence Darrow pointed out in his autobiography that it is not the severi ty of the penalty but the sureness of being caught that deters a criminal Let us all vow to be vigilant and offer the police all possible help Let us not play into the hands of criminals and madmen This was done with Gary Gilmore The Times published excerpts from Gilmores love letters showing that he wanted to be executed so that he could be reincarnated as a better person If Mr Templeman really wants capital punishment let him mingle with the toughs often found applauding and hooting outside the jail when it is carried out He may rethink his position when he considers the stimulation being given to the fantasies of his new companions PETER D NOERDLINGER Boulder Colo Jan 6 1978 On Making a Stamp Stick To the Editor The planned introduction of smaller postage stamps should be accompanied by an improvement in quality of the glue Otherwise it is proposed that the use of Scotch tape and safety pins be legalized JAY L CHURCHILL Dover NJ Jan 13 1978

"It's Carter's Budget, but Congress May Impose Its Own Ideas",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/its-carters-budget-but-congress-may-impose-its-own-ideas.html,WASHINGTON  Tomorrows release of President Car ters first real budget after weeks of debates appeals and ritualistic leaks will be seized on as the occasion to comment on his Presidency It will be measured against his many promises and goals and will tell much about how an Administration of militant outsiders has learned to cope with submit to or subdue the inertia and momentum of Washington But those are essentially shortterm questions When the Presidents 500 billion budget for the fiscal year ending Sept 30 1979 arrives at Capitol Hill at noon it will become the centerpiece of two larger more profound issueswhether Congress can really consider the budget as a whole and control spending and whether Congress can make the decisions says it wants to make about setting economic policy and establishing national priorities After a spectacularly good start in 1975 and 1976 that Congressional determination began to waver last year Without new resolve in 1978 the effort is likely to lose its authority and wind up not as policymaking but as accounting The Congressional budget process is the only recent Congressional reform instigated from the White House and probably the only significant achievement of President Nixons foreshortened second term Congress took him more seriously when he shouted budgetbusters than when he proclaimed I am not a crook So in 1974 it passed the Budget Act under which the House and Senate Budget Committees ponder not only the Presidents proposals but also the recommendations of other Congressional committees By May 15 those recommendations must be translated into spending and revenue targets by concurrent resolution and only then may spending bills go to the floor The targets exert a powerful influence on the levels of appropriations bills more powerful by iate spring than tomorrows proposals from President Carter Final firm spending ceilings are set by Sept 15 and all appropriations bills must be passed by Oct when the fiscal year begins That is how it is supposed work and how it did work in 1975 and 1976 And clearly the process restrained Federal spending though the 10billionayear estimate of saving by Senator Edmund S Muskie Maine chairman of the Senate Budget Committee may be too high But last year three appropriations bills were not passed until much later and the abortion debate kept the appropria tion for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare unsettled until December Even more important the targets began to lose their force Farm bill spending though it now has the farmers angrily unsatisfied  exceeded them Disaster relief laws were amended generously with littlethought to the budget limits and the revenue targets were cavalierly dodged by the Senate Finance Committees version of the energy tax bill As Representative Barber B Conable Jr a senior Republican on the House Budget Committee put it budget committee members are discovering Were not a panacea were just another part of the power structure Representative Robert N Giaimo chairman of the committee argues that while Congressmen support the basic idea of the Budget Act and its goal of trying to deal with Federal spending as a whole instead of one bill at a time last year their discipline flagged and once a bill looked appealing his colleagues were off and running in their old ways Some key players in the budget drama contend the process cannot stand still that a stationary target will not survive the Congressional shark attack One of them is Dr Alice M Rivlin director of the Congressional Budget Office The only economist in the history of the Brookings Institution to work all the way up its ladder from research associate to senior fellow she had headed the budget office since its creation The office provides the glue for the budget process It does Congresss own scorekeeping of continuous reports on how much the Government is spending and taking in credible cost estimates on legislation independent assessments whether a program can work and policy studies of the costs and advantages of various choices in policymaking from different sets cf foodstamp rules to alternatives for nuclear destruction Last years most noted effort was a study showing that the Carter energy program would not produce the savings it promised As some of the controversies she has stirred reflect Dr Rivlin sees her job as more than that of a technician and she has sought to help shape the process And so last week she urged in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee that Congress adopt budgetary targets for five years in advance Such targets would not be binding and could be reviewed each year but the process of setting the targets would compel the Congress to consider the future consequences of precent actions Last fall she had put it this way If youreALying say to hold down future retirement costs in the defense budget most of the reforms that would do that would lead to higher costs in the first year So if youre only voting on the first year you dont do that The comment notes the realities of Congress Mr Muskie and Senator Henry L Bellmon Republican Oklahoma welcomed her proposal and the Senate committee at least is weighing seriously a try at multiyear targets this year Like many budget issues the idea may have more trouble in the more partisan House where twoyear terms leave less room for reflection But Mr Giarno too has promised careful consideration of the multiyear approach The idea also gets support  though not necessarily support that helps it in a Congress increasingly jealous of its independence  from the Carter Administration W Bowman Cutter associate director of the Office of Management and Budget said longerterm planning was necessary from both sides Last year the Administration occasionally gummed up the Congressional effort notably when Defense Secretary Harold Browns loobying for higher Pentagon targets helped defeat the first resolution in the House Mr Carter insisted the Administration found the budget committees work vital Everyone else in Congress looked at a bill in terms of either a geographic or an interestgroup constituency he said while only the budget committees looked at the whole pie and then asked of specific proposals Does the damn thing work and Is there an alternative that will do it cheaper A process in which the Administrations budget becomes only one of a number of recommendations is not always happy one But since the Carter Administration at the urging of Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr has all but abandoned its only constitutional weapon to balance the budget the veto it needs all the allies it can get That makes the budget process a partner worth some sacrifices Adam Clymer is a New York Times reporter who covers Congress
Abortion and Teen‐Age Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/abortion-and-teenage-pregnancy.html,CINCINNATIIn seeking common giound on the divisive issue of abortion most people seem able to agree at least on this Abortion is not desirable in and of itself Even those who are generally favorable to abortion tend to present it as an unattractive but sometimes necessary solution to problems Therefore it is worth asking what problenis abortion is seen as solving and what other possibly better solutions might be available High on everyones list of such problems is teenage pregnancy which is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States What if anything can be done to reduce teenage pregnancies The answer seems obvious to pragmatic minds Pregnancies are prevented by contraception If we increase contraceptive information and services for teenagers we shall be well on the way to cutting down on the number of pregnancies and so reducing the need for teenage abortions Is a dissent in order In speaking to this issue a Catholic bishop is likely to be accused of special pleading am not making an argument here about the morality of contraception My point is that the case made by those who argue for more contraception as a solution to seenage pregnancies and so to that degree to abortion is faulty on its own pragmatic terms There is good reason to doubt that more and better contraceptive information and services will make major inroads in the number of teenage pregnancies We already liveand have lived for many yearsin a contraceptive culture one that is in which contraception is taken for granted Contraceptive information is widely disseminated and readily available So are contraceptives If sexually active teenagers do not practice contraception it is not because they lack opportunity But the counterargument goes we havent been getting through to them Despite our best efforts teenagers in increasing numbers are getting pregnant What to do Obviously more of the same So now the push is on for massive contraceptive indoctrination of the nations teenage population Through the schools Through television and radio advertising if the rules and customs of the broadcasting industry can be breached Thus the twin problems of teenage pregnancy and teenage abortion will be solved Perhaps But it does not seem very likely More contraceptive indoctrination of teenagers seems at least as likely more likely I would say to have the same result that the contraceptive indoctrination of recent decades has had It will motivate them to precocious sexual activity but by no means to the practice of contraception In which case the solution will merely have made the problenil worse What is the alternative I believe there is one but I do not think it is easy It certainly does not have the attractive but delusoiy simplicity of more and better contriception It amounts to turning thingi around and instead of telling teenagars that they cah have sex without consequences telling them the truthThere is no such thing as sex without Consequences whether thete be emotional physical socialor all three It amounts in other words to telling them early what they need to know anyway Sex is not merely for fun or for the expression of transitory af fection It is an enriching and serious business between mature people who are emotionally socially and even economically able to accept the ecinsequences of which pregnancy is tardly the only one  I agree that mnre education of teenagersindbctrination if you willis needed But I believe it rshould be education in Such things as family values a healthy and integrated acceptance of sexuality stability in marital relationships a sense of obligation toward other persons and will ingness to accept the consequenqes of ones actions In other words it should seek to help them grow up as sexually mature adults There is no reason to think more and better contraception will do this This approach is a formula for short changing young people truncating development of their einotionaland yes their sexuallives is a cheap solution that will not Work and bier if did Work would not meet the real developthental needs of teenagers searching for their sexual identity What I am suggesting admittedly in the most general terms is a very large order It would not be easy at any time It is particularly difficult at a time When the fruits Of but contraceptive Culture bitter as they are are widely accepted as Staple far So much so that conventional wisdoms proposed solution tb the conspicuous failure of moreandbettercontracm tion ismore and better contracep tion Abortion is a very serious problem But from a certain perspective it is only the tip of the iceberg beneath which lie some very strange ideal about sex and sexual responsibility If the apparent consensus that abor tion whatever else it may be Is a good thing leads us to address these matters seriously it Is possible that we shall hegin to find authentic tions not only to abcirtion and its causes but to other elements of our present cultural malaise If we seek solutions instead in more of what hashelped bring our problems to theif present dimensions we are likely to find our last state worse than our first
THAT WOMAN IN THE WEST WING,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/that-woman-in-the-west-wing-costanza.html,Properly reverential a group of White House visitors stared into the Oval Office nodding appreciatively as the only woman member of President Carters senior staff pointed to Harry Trumans The Buck Stops Here sign atop John Kennedys old desk Suddenly what almost never happens happened The President himself unexpectedly stepped from his private inner office The visitors gasped Jimmy cried Margaret Midge Costanza in Being the first female Assistant to the President has not cowed Midge Costanza Irreverent and witty as ever she invites controversy as she goes about her job as Jimmy Carters official listener to the public mock despair Dont you understand Im only giving the 5 tour When Jimmy Carter invited Miss Costanza to be his window to the nation as Assistant to the President for public liaison he probably never anticipated just how irreverent a breeze would sometimes blow through his executive offices He may not always find it refreshing but he tends to grin and bear it in public at least Others around him are visibly less comfortable with her candor and wit Zbigniew Brzezinski for one Soine weeks ago the Presidents national security adviser was waiting impatiently for a staff meeting to begin But President Carter who attends the Monday morning meetings was not inclined to dispense with a favorite ritual  hugging and kissing the females present in this case only Midge Costanza Noting Mr Brzezinskis expression of vague disapproval as she went into her clinch Miss Costanza blithely suggested that while she and the President were occupied Mr Brzezinski might go find a foreign country with a problem to solve The somber foreignpolicy expert sputtered that there arent any breaking up the audience and in due course the embrace No one is exempt from Miss Costanzas breezy retorts not even royalty as a Middle Eastern prince visiting the White House discovered when he told her he was disappointed to see her in dress having heard she always wore pants The disillusionment was mutual she countered Im disappointed you dont have a robe on And she was equally quick when explaining the role of various women in the Carter Administration to some visitors from abroad Introducing one of them Miss Costanza gushed Imagine She is in charge of the Presidents schedule every day Then with touch and timing that apparently are instinctive she added And into the night as far as I know When the laughter subsided Miss Costanza professed concern that she might become an international incident Midge Costanza the only woman ever to hold the title of Assistant to the President is not an international incident  yet But around this tiny feisty darkhaired woman of seemingly limitless energy and a propensity for throwing caution to the wind swirls more controversy than surrounds anyone else  or everyone else  on the White House staff Early on in her tenure Miss Costanza occasioned widespread muttering on the part of several of her White House colleagues by organizing a wellreported meeting of women in the Administration who opposed President Car ters stand against use of Federal funds for abortions But she and he never discussed the meeting save for a brief encounter in the corridor of the White House that went like this MISS COSTANZA Did you get my memo PRESIDENT CARTER Yes Did you get mine Miss COSTANZA  Yes Midge Costanza had drafted a memo outlining the opposition of the women to Mr Carters position the President had replied briefly reaffirming his stand Some time later after publicly calling or Bert Lance to resign as director of the Office of Management and Budget she herself gave the Administration a bad press when it was revealed that some months earlier she had staged a political fundraiser to pay off debts owed chiefly to herself  from her unsuccessful race for Congress in 1979 Worse she failed to report the event to the Federal Election Commission by the deadline established by law though she had given notification that she would file late reducing the issue to one of technical noncompliance Several Republican Congressmen quickly demanded that she resign And not too long ago she alienated the clergy A Roman Catholic priest was less than amused when Miss Costanza confided to a dinner audience that he had spent the better part of an hour with his hand on her knee But there is a side to Midge Costanza that does not command the headlines She is considerably more than a standup comic though she undeniably is that and a good one too despite occasional lapses of taste Her mind is as keen as her sense of humor Her candor wins approval even from those opposed to her views Jody Powell the Presidents press secretary and close adviser who admits to sharp differences of opinion with Midge finds her openness preferable to having someone running around and undercutting policy on the sly However whenever the headlines take a negative turn the questions begin Just who is Midge Costanza Followed by Whatever possessed Jimmy Carter to appoint her And then What the hell does she do in the White House anyway In her own words Midge Costanza is the person in the White House you talk to when you want to get a message to the President Her deft handling of individuals and organized groups who wish to get a message to the President is widely recognized and appreciated within the Carter inner circle Says Robert Nastanovich her former deputy Midges outstanding attribute is her ability to sincerely identify with people and to insist that their views whatever they arebe treated with respect Certainly a broader spectrum of American society seems to have found its way into the White House some of it for the first time She has listened to claims of discrimination from the National Gay Task Force Why shouldnt `There are really two Midge Costanzas  one can joke laugh and carry on The other is harsh cool afraid uncertain Shes brutal with the staff She pops off I This is their Government too to poet Allen Ginsbergs philosophy on food and to demands of Women Against Tuna Industry Regulations WATIR that steps be taken to preserve the porpoise She has also met at the White House with the American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities the National Swimming Pool Institute the American Israel Public Affairs Committee the United States Chamber of Commerce and with Marjorie Bear Dont Walk and a delegation of Indians Also with both sides on the abortion issue as well as with representatives of organizations both opposed to and in favor of amnesty and the Equal Rights Amendment all issues on which the outspoken Miss Costanzas pro views are wellknown When anyone questions her objectivity she disarms them by saying You are not here to give me a message You are here to give the President a message Faithfully Miss Costanza prepares memorandums for the President on the opinions expressed and the remedies sought by these She works 15hour days and frequently sevenday weeks She and her staff of 10 four males handle 1500 pieces of mail a week on the average During one sevenday span the total topped 5000 There are from 200 to 250 telephone calls each day Not only can President Carter not see or talk to all of these individuals or groups neither can Midge Costanza Many are referred to the departments or agencies of government most directly concerned with their problems Miss Costanzas staff members confer with others She herself meets with groups or individuals whose concerns are both urgent and current 1 try to work in concert with the Presidents timetable or the legislative timetable In other words if your concern is tax reform and the President is about to send legislation to Capitol Hill youll probably be able to see Midge Costanza But if the President shoves tax reform to the back burner someone with an ax to grind on welfare reform or energy will have a better She rarely  almost never  verbally delivers a report of one of her meetings to the President though hers is the senior staff office closest to his In fact other than running across him occasionally in the corridors or meeting with him as part of a group Miss Costanza has little direct contact with the President That situation has provoked whispers  some of them quite loud  that the President is vexed with the woman in the West Wing that her presence was never intended to be more than window dressing in any event and that her widely publicized bloopers have converted her into an embarrassment Jody Powell insists that the relatively sparse personal contact between Mr Carter and Miss Costanza stems from the fact that Midge does not impose herself If she needs to see the President shell see him Another member of the White House staff who is himself harshly critical of Miss Costanza and regards her appointment as a mistake also doubts that Mr Carter is down on her She was with them early he says The President trusts her But how often does he turn to her for advice Since the first two or three weeks not often insists a Carter aide No decision is ever delayed or deferred until she is consulted No one ever asks What does Midge have to say In another Administration one in which she was not so clearly the outsider she could be excellent Recently Mr Carter appears to have moved however belatedly to deflect some of the negative speculation swirling around her Miss Costanza was guest of the Carters at Camp David over Thanksgiving She has attended three White House state dinners and has an open invitation to sit in on the regular weekly Cabinet meetings she rarely has time And when a sustained siege of pummeling in the press was capped some weeks ago by a particularly downbeat story in Newsweek suggesting that Brother Billy and Midge Costanza were the Presidents two greatest crosses Mr Carter summoned his assistant to his office for minute and then spent an hour and 10 minutes praising her work and suggesting that when her bad press gets her down she need only compare it with his He later was in the forefront at surprise 95th birthday party for her in the White House Miss Costanzas understandable delight with these reassurances underscores the insecurity some associates sense in her although she herself professes  too strongly  to being perfectly secure Being aboard early is a litmus test with any political organization Midge Costanza made her fealty to Mr Carters Presidential aspirations known in 1979 when he really was Jimmy Who and when any friend at all in the cold cruel North was a treasure One with political savvy and connections such as Midge Costanza possessed was a downright jewel When she met Jimmy Carter two years before the election that landed both of them in the White House Miss Costanza was trying to cap a long career in the realestate business and local politics by winning a seat in the United States Congress She was Vice Mayor of Rochester NY at the time By rights she should have been Mayor Traditionally the City Council member elected with the greatest number of votes had been chosen Mayor But in what she refers to as her first runin with sexism she was named Vice Mayor by council members who received fewer votes than she did For years she had been private secretary and administrative assistant to John J Petrossi a prominent Rochester realestate developer but she had always dabbled in politics and had a wildly varied career in civic service She had been a member of the advisory committee of the Rochester Red Wings Baseball Club director of the Community Chest member of the Italian Womens Civic Club and the Hudson Avenue Businessmens Association She was also secretary to the Rotary Horse Show Committee and a member of the Rochester Chamber of Commerce To drift into politics from such roles was not only natural but almost inevitable Miss Costanzas energy attracted the notice of Rochester Democrats who placed her on the 22nd Wards executive committee whence she advanced to membership on the Monroe County Committee and then became its vice chairman she was a member of the state committee in 1967 and a member of the National Democratic Committee in 1972 In 1964 she headed Robert Kennedys Senate campaign in Mon Her 1973 City Council race was her first and it was a sufficiently heady experience that during her first year on the job she sought and succeeded in winning the Democratic nomination for Congress in New Yorks 35th District She lost the election to the Republican incumbent Mr Carter whose Presidential aspirations were not then taken seriously outside his own small circle was heading the Democratic National Committees Congressional campaign arm in 1974 and one of his many stops was for a campaign appearance in Rochester with candidate Midge Costanza He impressed me so much she says I told him Remember me if you decide to run for President  Mr Carter had no difficulty remembering his New York State support at that stage In 1975 Jody Powell telephoned Miss Costanza and asked Do you still feel the same way She did and Mr Carter had a chairperson for his New York campaign She later shared the role with William vanden Heuvel Miss Costanza was the obligatory woman among those who seconded Mr Carters nomination in July 1976 and when he won in November she was an obvious prospect for a key appointment But she insists I did not expect a position in the Administration was moved and awed to the point of tears when he called [on Christmas Day] and asked me to be an Assistant to the President I had been planning to continue in business and as Vice Mayor That sounds naive Campaign workers who do not aspire to an appointment if their candidate wins are rare if nonexistent But there is reason to believe Miss Costanza She is still in such awe of the White House and so astonished to find herself there that it is at least conceivable that she never regarded herself as sufficiently educated she never went to college to qualify for a key position in the Government let alone in the White House But there she is the outermost member of the Carter inner circle of senior aides the only woman the only Roman Catholic the only ethnic the only nonGeorgian Says she as she fingers through three folders of unanswered telephone calls in a chaotically cluttered office I love what Im doing here call it a job not a position a responsibility not a title Im not afraid to lose it But when leave I want to be the same person who walked in Im not gonna change I gotta be me She is fully aware that she has detractors within and outside the White House people who think the President would be well advised to get rid of her People either like me the way I am or they dont But Ill tell you one thing what they see is what they get Theres no mystery about me Others see her differently According to a White House insider There are really two of her  one can joke laugh and carry on The other is harsh cool afraid uncertain Shes brutal with staff She pops off Yet this source concedes that shes all over the place Everybody thinks he should see the President She handles a lot of them and does it quite well But theres a shrillness a crisis atmosphere to her operation Shes the fire department And shes too busy to get organized Mr Nastanovich her former deputy agrees that organization is not Miss Costanzas strong suit She lets meetings run on and on She drives too hard But Mr Nastanovich refutes the contention that she is anything approaching brutal to her staff Midge Costanza is a good solid demonstrative boss devoted to her job and to the President She makes the same demands on her staff that she makes on herself Mr Nastanovichs departure after only seven months on the job occasioned rumors that he could not tolerate the highhandedness with which the office was run Not so he insists I was not pursuing a Government career I agreed to only a limited period of service Of her inhouse critics Miss Costanza says I dont know who they are so I dont know that theyre in a position to judge I dont feel there is a move within the White House to get me I have a job to do like they do I dont feel that Im put upon or treated differently She concedes that the members of the socalled Georgia Mafia have been friends for a long time and that they are together officially and socially very often while she does not But in no way does that affect me Miss Costanza who lives alone she has never married has had virtually no recreation since moving to Washington Says she I was the best putter in upstate New York but she has not lifted a golf club or a tennis racket or a deck of cards or even a novel since she began her demanding White House regimen The only visible pleasure she allows herself is cigarettes which she smokes nonchain and nonfrenetically They seem to relax her She rents a condominium in Washingtons Foggy Bottom for 1170 per month about which she is quite defensive Its a luxury apartment she concedes More luxury than need and more luxury than can afford But I had to have a place in DC I had to have a building where I could park get home after midnight And had to have a place that was functional The 2000squarefoot condominium is all of that It contains six rooms in all including two bedrooms is decorated in earthy colors with modern paintings on the walls Miss Costanza who furnished it obviously loves it even though she spends little time there She has a stereo and stacks of records mostly rock and ballads I dance very well to either she says You know what I am At heart Im a romanticist Im in love with life Then thoughtfully she adds Im more sensitive than people think I am She does very little besides work and make speeches For exercise she occasionally walks to the office a mile and a half away No family members are close by her mother and father a retired smallbusiness man live in Rochester and neither her sister nor her two brothers live in Washington She does little unofficial reading She has never been to Sans Souci Washingtons most famous restaurant but has dined at Nick and Dotties a quite unfashionable eatery next door Once she had dinner at Le Bagatelle the only truly fourstar restaurant she has visited Most often she eats in the White House mess at her desk or at home Her friends include Carol Bellamy president of New Yorks City Council actress Shirley Maclaine Jean OLeary the gay activist leader Sue Holloran of the Agency for International Development and Representative Shirley Chisholm Her best male friends appear to be John G Heimann U S Comptroller of the Currency and veteran New York politician Howard Samuels Her schedule obviously precludes her seeing a lot of any of them but they keep in touch 0 What drives Midge Costanza Is it limitless political ambition learned at the feet of her equally driven boss And whats next for her Speculation in her home state has focused on a likely bid to become Governor or United States Senator in the notsodistant future Firmly she insists I dont plan to run for office in New York I dont plan ahead Somewhat wistfully she adds I dont know how long the President wants me to serve him But she makes clear that she has no plans to leave unless he asks her to Right now she is delighted  no enthralled  to be working for Jimmy Carter I would lie down and die for that man if thought he was right she declares But would she erase a tape for him He wouldnt ask me to Those points established Miss Costanza goes on to rule out a future race for Governor but not for Senator I am not qualified to be Governor of New York she says flatly not that thats stopped anybody in the past I am qualified to be a United States Senator but at the moment Im not interested Why is she not qualified to be Governor Her answer is that Im a good administrator But that good Besides we have a good Governor Midge Costanza is certifiably a liberal She is comfortable with the resolutions passed by the National Womens Conference which she addressed When the President phoned her in Houston for a report on the conference she told him Its so great here Im on such a high I know the drug and alcohol council [sic] will declare it illegal She concedes that juvenile delinquency and womens issues are her major concerns On the stump she often is forced to defend her salary 56000 a year  which many regard as too high Listen she tells audiences you are getting a bargain I have no dependents I have no deductions Im not paying interest on a mortgage I do not own a home Thus her takehome pay she claims is only about half her salary No one questions that she works hard and long That is why she was particularly stung over the harsh criticism of her New York fundraiser which netted about 21000 approximately 17000 of which was owed to herself She claims that that amount is far more than she could afford to sink into a political campaign even her own and that the rent for her condominium and the necessity of buying furniture when she moved to Washington made her financial position particularly precarious Nonetheless staging what has become known as Costanzas Extravaganza is the most serious example of bad judgment that can be leveled against her The 500perperson fundraiser was held in New York last April with Vice President Walter Mondale and Miss Costanza herself as the drawing cards The event was approved  in advance  by the White House Her Congressional campaign had ended more than two years earlier and there was no prospect of another one soon But by then of course she was widely known as a key member of the White House staff However since Miss Costanza has no role in awarding Federal contracts or in other money matters the White House said it had no plans to screen the donors To the demand of House minority whip Robert H Michel of Illinois and other Republican Congressmen that she resign because of the fundraiser she snapped Ridiculous Of Michel who like all Congressmen is no stranger to fundraising she commented He ought to be ashamed of himself to be using something like In discussing the furor with a reporter in her White House office she still did not seem to grasp that even though there may have been nothing actually wrong about the fundraiser there certainly was the appearance of something wrong  people shelling out money in the hope of gaining access to someone at the White House I have never received a single phone call from anyone who was at the fundraiser says Miss Costanza except for Howard Samuels who helped arrange it And you know what he wanted He wanted to take me to lunch There is no reason to doubt her But in the wake of five years of unremitting scandals in campaign financing and purchased Government favors many people do 0 Miss Costanza has her ardent supporters Kentucky Governor Julian Carroll wrote President Carter that she was superb in an appearance before the Democratic Women of Kentucky Midge has the great capacity of conveying your warmth and conviction to a crowd After she spoke to a similar group in Florida Mollie Brilliant the organizations president observed The very air sparkled with [her] vitality Television star Sally Struthers wrote to her With you I know we women have more than a foot in the door in our Government The last is a matter of dispute by those who regard her as a token woman in the White House with no particular clout Still it is a matter of record that after a 2 PM meeting last Oct 26 with a group of women concerned with tax reform Miss Costanza had a memo containing their recommendations on the Presidents desk by 5 PM He flew off to Plains Ga at 6 PM and in a statement on tax reform released the following day the President had incorporated some of the precise language as well as some of the recommendations in the memorandum But such triumphs are hardly personal More than anything they prove that the President does pay attention to the socalled powerless people who meet in the White House with Midge Costanza Speaking of Miss Costanzas performance generally Jody Powell says Shes doing a good job Shes not perfect any more than the rest of us are If you are active you are going to make some mistakes When you look at Midges mistakes look at everybody elses around here I had to publicly apologize  to a United States Senator for one of mine A recent incident suggests Midge Costanza may not be so out of sync with the rest of the Carter Administration as is generally supposed At a meeting in the Roosevelt Room in the White House she rambled on with effusive praise for Vice President Mondale preparatory to introducing his deputy press secretary Maxine Burns When at last she got around to Miss Burns and asked her to take a bow a Costanza aide Jane Wales announced that Maxine Burns was not present  that she was in fact not even in Washington It is almost unthinkable that a person of Miss Costanzas rank would be allowed to make such a fool of herself But staff failures of such magnitude are not uncommon in the Carter Administration The difference with Miss Costanza is that even though like most of her cohorts she seems unable to surmount the problems of organization she is able to put the best possible face on them After Miss Waless embarrassing declaration Midge Costanza blanched for a few seconds But quick as ever she recovered and introduced Jane Wales to the audience saying As of this minute you may be able to hire her Waves of laughter erupted A staffworker disaster had been converted into a publicrelations triumph No one in the White House is more adept at such conversions than Miss Costanza Since the Carter Administration seems certain to remain mired in its inexperience and ineptitude for some time it is probably a good bet that Midge Costanza with her resiliency and recuperative powers will be around for a
Ecumenism and the'Abortion Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/westchester-opinion-ecumenism-and-the-abortion-issue.html,TODAY marks the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court landmark decision that struck down laws forbidding abortion except in very limited circumstances such as the endangerment of a mothers health For all practical purposes the Courts action permitted abortion almost on demand even though the accompanying legal brief allegedly increased the restrictions on full liberty proportionately as the chronological term of pregnancy progressed The Courts declaration caused a furor Proponents if complete freedom for women to have abortions on demand were dissatisfied with what they judged were the Courts specious arguments supporting the stated abridgements of total liberty Prolife supporters were outraged by the Courts abrogation what a few called its criminal action Middleoftheroaders were caught between some admonishing the Court for being too liberal others declaring that the decision was ideologically sound but practically faulty The spectrum of positions in the debate predictably transcended denominational and interfaith lines among American religious believers As time passed it became clear that abortion was not just a Roman Catholic issue as the media often implied On one hand numerous Catholics supported the Courts legal decision while remaining quite definite about the immorality of abortion On the other hand significant numbers of Protestants Anglicans and Orthodox outpaced prolife Catholics in vigorously denouncing the Courts action For example Dr Mildred Jefferson a physician and an active member of the United Methodist Church became chairman of the national prolife movement and expressed the sentiments of many other Methodists who opposed the Courts decision During the last five years a host of myths about who supports or opposes the Supreme Court decision have fallen ingloriously before the facts It would be far easier if all Catholics were antiabortionists if all Protestants were proabortionists if all Jews supported the Supreme Courts decision if all Orthodox Christians denounced the Courts criminal action Fortunately such is not the case and the hard facts supported by national polls simply will not evaporate The issue of abortion and abortion laws thus remains a primary ecumenical concern one that not only separates the churches and faiths from one another but also creates divisions within the churches and faiths For example the official position of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops notwithstanding a majority of Roman Catholics according to several recent polls strongly favor laws allowing women to obtain abortions after private consultations with a personal physician If the polls are correct the Catholic bishops confront the uncom fortable reality that a majority of their constituents do not support the official position Before them the bishops have the perhaps impossible task of persuading most Catholics that the hierarchical position is both reasonable and commendable If anything the positions on both edges as well as in the middle of the abortion debate have hardened considerably during the last five years Things appear at an impasse But some recent events inspire both hope and confidence that ecumenical progress can be made in the abortion dilemma Abortion should not be the chief ecumenical issue among the Christians of North America but Christians themselves have made it such I suggest because of their sin their failure to understand the Gospel properly their inability to engage in genuine dialogue with one another their lack of real prayer for one another No one else is to blame but Christians clergy and laity alike in all the churches In some places though Christians are beginning to tear away their ideological blinders They are beginning to realize that the old idea of original sin is not some weird biblical story but rather an undeniable reality that one theologian has called the only empirically proven Christian doctrine Confession and sorrow for our often willful reaffirmations of the already sinful human situation is thus an absolute prerequisite for ecumenical advance If I am sinless and righteous then my position on any issue logically will be correct There is no need for me to admit that some truth might lie elsewhere then only in myself Such a purist stance is both unbiblibical and unChristian but numerous Christians including some church leaders act as if the opposite is true And despite advances in biblical studies religious education and heology all too many Christians still insist on using the Bible as a kind of spiritual shovel with which they unearth myriad proofs to support any number of basically political positions In doing so they ignore the revelation that the Bible is not some lifeless thing but the living word of God a word that both inspires persons to godlike desires and judges the imperfections inherent in their actions Sometimes Christians also fall into the spiritual error of taking the law not the spirit of the Testaments as their guide in life Such a preference has turned some Christians into the very antitheses of the persons they are divinely intended to be according to almost any reading of the Bible They become unloving unkind unforgiving unbending unjust It is no surprise then that these unbiblical Christians are unable to speak authentic words of love and accomplish genuine acts of justice one to the other No wonder the parties to the abortion issue can not [engage in] dialogue with one another Not only do such persons refuse to speak genuinely to one another but also they find the suggestion that they should pray together about issues like abortion simply ludicrous How can they pray with the enemy Precisely To be faithful to the biblical spirit and its evident injunctions Christian should indeed must pray with and for the enemy Indeed it is time for Christians on all sides to cease being mere ideologues about abortion and start becoming persons of true prayer in every situation and on every issue confronting them in life That is why a number of recent developments in ecumenical relations are encouraging in regard to the abortion issue At a recent ecumenical conference on abortion sponsored by the Graymoor Ecumenical Institute  the participants moved collectively from tenseness and distrust to openness and respect for one another even though they did not totally agree in the end The conference proceeded without strident denunciations in rcopactful friendship and with much prayer No impressive consensus was reached but most of the participants went away friends at least friendlier than before they had met together in dialogue and prayer Across the continent in Los Angeles some Jews and Christians recently gathered in dialogue and prayer to work on a joint statement entitled Jewish and Roman Catholic Reflections on Abortion and Related Issues By no means an absolute consensus the statement outlined the various positions that can be taken on abortion by Catholics and Jews In the end the Jews were able to say that they abhor the infringement of liberties of individuals or institutions and the imposition of civil penalties on those whose ethical and religious codes prohibit their involvement in any fashion in the performance of abortion The Catholics were able to conclude that their opponents were people of good will and were not setting out deliberately to do evil If the Graymoor and Los Angeles experiences could be duplicated in thousands of places around this country abortion would I believe eventually recede to its propernot primaryposition on the ecumenical agenda What better time to begin such a reconciling process than during this years Week of Prayer for Christianmight I suggest religiousUnity  The Rev Charles V LaFontaine SA an Atonement Friar is editor of

Snow Cans Gov. Rockefeller's Disaster‐Prone Year in West Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/snow-caps-gov-rockefellers-disasterprone-year-in-west-virginia.html,CHARLESTON W Va Jan 21Another natural disaster fell on John D Rockefeller 4th this weekend chilling his first anniversary as Governor of West Virginia with a record snowfall that reached more than 40 inches in some parts of this mountainous state With the snow still coming down this afternoon Mr Rockefeller called the National Guard to duty in the most distressed counties Not even his most virulent critics blame the 40yearold Democratic nephew of Nelson A Rockefeller for last years freeze emergency and flood disaster or for this paralyzing snowfall It is the Rockefeller manner of executive response managed smoothly in this roadand airportclosing crisis that has grated on the nerves of an apparently large number of voters who last year viewed the urbane millionaire as something of an immigrant crown prince almost tourist attraction Last winter Mr Rockefeller went on statewide radio to warn gravely of a snow emergency that never materialized prompting the Welch Daily News to run a spoofing headline Welch Repels Rockefellers Killer Snowstorm Then without warning came the prolonged freeze and fuel shortage In the spring after the worst flooding in Appalachia since white settlers arrived there were ansry complaints that Mr Rockefeller was not paying enough attention to recovery efforts Mr Rockefellers status in West VirginJa has seesawed From his election defeat in 1972 he went to an overwhelming 68 percent victory in his second bid fot the governorship in 1976 from an approval rate of 68 percent in a Charleston Gazette poll last April after the flood crisis had been dealt with by his state police commander he received favorable responses of 502 percent this week in a poll by the Charleston Daily Mail The Daily Mail which Mr Rockefeller pointed out in an interview here is Republican said that its random survey of 350 West Virginians had revealed that most voters doubt he could be reelected imernor if an election were held now The gubernatorial election of course is three years off But the leading opposition figure here former Gov Arch A Moore Jr whose combative style of partisanship is regarded as being motivated equally by Republican ideology and antiRockefeller animus is running this year for the United States Senate seat of Jennings Randolph the 75yearold Democrat who with the Senate majority leader Robert C Byrd is the copatriarch of West Virginia Since Mr Randolph is almost certainly unbeatable if he stays well the belief here is that Mr Moores campaign is actually aimed at bruising Mr Rockefeller and his assumed interest in a future Senate seat or even a shot at the Presidency Asked what he is saying these days about his alleged ambitions to spring from the State House here to Washington Mr Rockefeller replies instantly Nothing Mr Rockefeller has been haunted by the fear of looking to West Virginians like a politically ambitious outsider who is merely ridgerunning his way to national power so much so that he is still rationing his interviews with outofstate newsmen who always ask him that question He said he had turned down two recent invitatiow to appear on network television questionandanswer shows This week however he spoke to reporters for The New York Times and for Time magazine and last month he gave an interview to a visitor from The Washington Post A television program that he did appear on last fall may have proved the worth of a conscious Rockefeller policy of insularity by stirring a gratuitous dispute here over the Governors personal wealth a gossipy tidbit that he has been talking about disclosing for years On NBCs Meet the Press last September Mr Rockefeller made the financial disclosure seem imminent but he seemed to hedge when he came home It was October before he revealed a net worth of 197 millionhis wife Sharon a daughter of Senator Charles H Percy of Illinois has about 750000 in her own rightand in the interim he had to grapple repeatedly with the state house press corps What is your net worth right off the top of your head the Governor was asked at one impatient predisclosure news conference here last fall A lot more than yours my friend was his reply When Mr Rockefeller periodically ex hibits a patrician or curt manner the sting seems to last As a candidate a year ago he was full of firmly drawn plans to overhaul the states roads among the narrowest and most serpentine in the country and to abolish the sales tax on food Governor Rockefeller has so far accomplished neither and even with monolithic Democratic majorities in the Legislature that convened here 10 days ago the outlook is for more resistance to his proposals not less Necessity has brought him to propose increases in the state taxes on gasoline and cigarettes He told an interviewer that he had had to trim 15 million from his budget this year because of the United Mine Workers strike now in its 47th taxeating day It is sapping the coaldominated general economy here at the rate of 500000 a day Mr Rockefeller had predicted the economy would boom because of increased dependence on coal Critics have also noted that the candidates goodgovernment promises sometimes seemed to be contradicted by the Governors controversial patronage appointments He rescinded a move to extend state Civil Service merit protection to more employees Mr Rockefelled made his break with environmentalists as he did with advocates of gun control and of legalized abortion after his 1972 loss to Mr Moore The break was completed when the Governor joined in lobbying Congress for provisions in the 1977 Federal strip mine control act that encouraged a technique called mountaintop removalthe bulldozing of entire hilltops full of coal into adjacent hollows to create level new town sites in mining areas where housing and flat land for it are in critically short supply In what he told a visitor was one of his major gains of his first year Mr Rockefeller announced in November plan to spend 10 million in state money to buy thousands of stripminelevelled acres in Mingo County over the next 15 or 20 years for resale to the developers of up to 20000 new homesites That figure is double the current Mingo County housing stock which is composed heavily of mobile homes and trailers If the mountaintop scheme worksif there are houses in 1980 when he must run again and more of them in 1984 when the twoterm limit on the governorship here means he will be looking for another jobMr Rockefellers claims to innovation and managerial skill may look more credible to West Virginians
Study Finds Cities Losing Health Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/connecticut-weekly-study-finds-cities-losing-health-battle-study.html,AN 18month study the first of its kind in Fairfield County has found that a shocking gap exists between the health care available in Bridgeport Norwalk and Stamford and the services in their 11 surrounding towns The study by the Southwest Connecticut Health Systems Agency suggests that money probably is a principal factor in the healthcare gap it says exists between the cities and the towns in its area The 11 towns generally have a higher socioeconomic level according to the study The towns are Greenwich Darien New Canaan Westport Weston Wilton Fairfield Monroe Trumbull Easton and Stratford The study incorporates the first proposed health systems plan prepared by the Southwest Connecticut Health Systems Agency in response to a mandate of the National Health Planning and Resource Development Act of 1974 The proposed plan is contained in 700 singlespaced pages accompanied by 95page summary Public hearings on the contents of the massive document are scheduled to be held Wednesday in the Bridgeport City Halls Common Council Chambers on Thursday in Stamfords Davenport Ridge School 1300 Newfield Avenue and on Friday in South Norwalk at the Health Systems Agency offices 20 North Main Street All hearings are to start at 730 PM Among the recommendations contained in the report are A reduction of hospital admissions by performing all possible tests and procedures on an outpatient basis and reduction of surgery requiring hospitalization by expanding day surgical programs with up to 15 percent of all hospital procedures being performed on an outpatient basis by 1982 Reduction of obstetrical beds from 94 to 7077 in the Bridgeport area and from 90 to 5965 beds in the StamfordGreenwich area The addition of 44 to 50 beds for shortstay psychiatric care mostly in the Bridgeport area and the establishment of 16 beds in the Stamford area for shortterm treatment and evaluation of alcoholics Possible employment of nursemidwives nursepractitioners and physicians assistants Legislation supporting the concept that abortion and familyplanning services should be made more easily accessible and that familyplanning services should be expanded Discussing the report and its recommendations Eugene G Michael executive director of the agency said that was intended to be used for guidance on how to spend money and make choices The agency has the power to decide how funds from the Federal Department of Health Education and Welfare are to be spent in the region After the public hearings are held Mr Michael said the plan will be revised and adopted by our board of directors It will then go to the HEW regional office in Boston where it will be reviewed Once it is approved it will be used by our agency as a blueprint for changes in the healthcare system over the next several years The agencys report found that the health gap between the areas cities and its suburban towns covered all age ranges A pattern emerges as one advances through the total mortality rates for various age groups and other healthstatus indicators the report said Inevitably it appears the health of persons living in the three cities of the Southwest Connecticut Health Systems Agency is inferior to that of the areas suburbanites Statistical variance between the suburban towns and the city of Bridgeport in particular is remarkable it pinpoints the need to focus special health planning attention on the Bridgeport area The overall infantmortality rate for the region in 197074 according to the study was 170 deaths per 1000 live births against 160 statewide a regional drop from 182 in the 196971 measurement period Bridgeporttin the more recent period had an infant mortality rate of 200 per 1000 live births Stamford 192 per 1000 and Norwalk 155 per 1000 These rates the report observed must be contrasted with the 122 per 1000 infant mortality rates of  Darien Greenwich New Canaan Weston Westport and Wilton An infant mortality rate of 120 per 1000 live births is the suggested goal for the entire region which is also the goal suggested by the Department of Health Education and Welfare as a national goal Upper middle age 4569 mortality rates the report said again emphasize the healthstatus gap between Bridgeport 1250 per 100000 and the suburban towns 631650 per 100000 The total mortality rate for Connecticut as a whole is 946 per 100000 The report said that in the upper middle age group the mortality rate for heart disease was especially noteworthy In Bridgeport it was 447 per 100000 as against ttie overall state rate of 311 per 100000 The rate for the southwestern suburban area was half that of the state Dindy K Harris coordinator of governmental relations for the Fairfield County Medical Association which has 1400 members said that the county medical association shares the widespread public concern over the rising cost of health care and clearly recognizes the need for effective regional planning While the association does not support the concept of government intervention in the delivery of health services as mandated by Congress Mrs Harris said it does realize the necessity for physician involvement in the planning process of the Health Systems Agency The HSA has statutory power to change the way in which physicians practice medicine and consumers receive health care Observing that one of the proposed plans stated prime concern is containment of costs Mrs Harris went on to say However there is no evidence in the report of a recommended curtailment of costs in any section of the plan other than acute inhospital services Massive increases in services in all other areas ranging from alchoholism and home care to environmental control and family planning are recommended without detailed documentation of need utilization or projectedcosts Diverting proposed savings from cutbacks in acute hospital care cannot begin to offset the expenditures of millions upon millions of dollars which would be incurred if all these recommendations were implemented Costs for these services and facilities would have to be borne by the consumer through fees for service tax funds or insurance premiums The Southwest Connecticut Health Systems Agency was organized by the Federal Department of Health Education and Welfare in April 1976 to be responsible for health planning and resource development in the three cities and 11 towns extending from Greenwich to Stratford The region has been designated as Connecticuts Health Service Area 1 It is one of five that cover the state and 205 across the country all contiguous to one another The Southwest Connecticut unit is a private nonprofit agency governed by a 30member board of directors of which 13 are providers of health care and 17 are consumeroriented The consumer members included elected public officials representatives of labor and industry and spokesmen for elderly lowincome and minority groups in the area Among the provider members are representatives of hospitals longterm care institutions physicians professional schools healthinsurance and allied health professionals The Health Systems Plan according to the report constitutes the Southwest Connecticut agencys statement of desired achievements for improvement in the health status of area residents and in the health systems serving that population The plans sponsors hope to accomplish its longrange goals within five years
A Turning Point in the Career of Shirley MacLaine,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/a-turning-point-in-the-career-of-shirley-maclaine-frumpy-fringe.html,When Shirley MacLaine visited Havana recently for a special screening of The Turning Point that made it the first American film to have been shown officially in Cuba in 17 years she encountered Cuban women whose response to the film was very much like her own They told me We dont understand your part  she recalled  Why did the character you play give up her work to get married Fidel is very strong about womens rightstwo years ago they made it part of the Cuban Constitution that men have to do 50 percent of the housework there So the idea of having to choose between a family and a career seemed as peculiar to them as it does to me I could never even be attracted to a man who would expect me to stop working Telling me not to work is like telling a 747 not to fly Back home in her New York apartment in a living room quietly dominated by a photograph of her kissing President Carter Miss MacLaine outlined the process by which she had come to understand Deedee The Turning Points character who ruefully abandons her career as a ballerina to raise a family My compatibility with this part is nil and this is one of the discussions I had with Arthur and Herb in the beginning for about a week she said referring to Arthur Laurents the screenwriter and Herb Ross the director I would have had the baby and come back to work it wouldnt have been any problem in my mind at all But they made me realize that Deedees decision had been made 20 years ago when you couldnt even get an abortion and when the choices were very limited I began to see that that was the way she would have felt about it then Besides incompatibility notwithstanding the role of a housewife had its hidden advantages for Miss Maclaine She needed to gain 15 pounds a feat she remembers accomplishing over the course of six very happy days And the frumpiness of the character had another fringe benefit It was very nice feeling to get up at 6 each morning and be all set to go at 610 Before the opportunity to make The Turning Point came along Miss MacLaine hadnt made a film since The Possession of Joel Delaney and she had more or less decided to stick to Broadway and to television It wasnt her politics or her outspokenness that had caused trouble For all those years when I was on the enemies list and out of favor with Nixon and everybody knew it I dont think that I didnt work because of that I didnt work because I didnt get good scripts and because the films that Id done didnt make any money But when the right script finally did come along she was still quick to question those aspects of it that disturbed her She says she insisted strongly for example that some changes be made in the films climactic fight sequence that provokes audiences to nervous laughter at the sight of Miss MacLaine and Anne Bancroft slugging it out in evening gowns When the argument occurs and all that emotion builds up until theres nothing to do but to hit each other theres a natural transition to the fight But how we were supposed to fight was the problem In Arthurs script he had us hitting each other over the head with our bags Thats the part that worried me I was very concerned that it would look like a catfight So the handbags were scrapped but staging the fight still posed problems I had had a fight with a man physically but never with a woman Miss MacLeine said Anne had But I didnt have anything to draw on And shes very thin and fragile while Im a big girl and very strong so I was afraid of hurting her We talked about it a lot and finally she said Just do It Ill take care of myself She did tooshes a lot stronger than she looks The scene in which the two women slap each other heartily was the last one filmed We finished at 3 in the morning said goodbye and that was that Still Miss MacLaine wasnt sure she would have been able to go through with the scene had not an extra line of dialogue been added at the last minute In that line Miss Bancrofts character Emma acknowledges that she really did sabotage her friends career many years earlier by persuading Deedee that having a baby would help her hold onto her husband The audience had to know that there really had been something bugging Deedee all of these years that she had had a legitimate complaint After those slight adustments were made there was only one plot point that continued to befuddle Miss MacLeine the 1 Ithhour admission that both Deedee and her husband played by Tom Skerritt chose to have a child as a way of showing their friends that he another dancer was not a homosexual Frankly I still dont understand why its there Miss MacLaine asserted But Herb and Arthur just said leave it in It was explained that that was a problem in the ballet world even though my attitude was so what if it was It wouldnt have mattered to me Miss MacLaines own early experience with balletI didnt even know who was President when I was in the ballet company I only knew about my toe shoes and how many pirouettes I could do that weekmakes her especially appreciative of Mikhail Baryshnikovs showstopping dancing in the film When youre dancing on film theres something about the way the shutter works in the camera that keeps it from accurately recording the speed with which you move So in order to dance on film with the kind of energy the naked eye would see he had to dance above and beyond the kind of energy he has on stage just to make it look like stage performance Mishas very smartI think hes seen himsef on television a lot and he sees theres something wrong One of the great things Im so proud of with this film is that weve captured his dancing forever so that when he gets to be 50 well still have this film Theres another hour and a half of it lying around somewhere on the studio floor Miss MacLeine the author of two autobiographical volumes is currently writing a novel and hoping to find a script thats a really funny serious dramatic identifiable adult love story where the people dont get married but still love each other She hasnt found one yet so she isnt sure what her next film project will be But shes dead certain that it wont be any of the stories that have come her way since Julia and The Turning Point proved that women could be big news at the box office Im getting a lot of scripts with women starring together but theyre things like caper pictures she said Instead of the guys going in and stealing the diamond the girls do it Its horrifyingwhat theyre doing is putting all us women back into the Paul NewmanRobert Redford buddy syndrome Theyre starring the women together now just like they starred the men together for five years But they still cant figure out what to do with adult men and adult women on the screen And starting a serious discussion about feminism in Hollywood is still the quickest way to empty a room out there Frankly I think theyre making a big mistake But thatll change as soon as a picture about women cleans up and shows them theres money to he made Really thats Hollywoods only criterion
"Sex Education: Resisted, Needed",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/long-island-opinion-sex-education-resisted-needed.html,THE Island with a relatively high socioeconomic population is comparatively welleducated or at least educationally concerned Yet it has not addressed itself to a lack of sex education and the fact that this may be linked to a high incidence of sexrelated problems The time has come to reverse the rise in teenage pregnancies A report from the Nassau County Health Department indicates that more than 70 percent of the 3600 live births to women under 20 years old were out of wedlock in 1976 and for every live birth there were two abortions Also to be confronted is an epidemic proportion of venereal disease among young people the Nassau Health Department says and private studies have pointed to growing numbers of adults who are sexually dysfunctional It is time to dispel mistaken ideas about contraceptive devices It is time to establish sound communication about sexual matters within families and educational institutions The need for sex education as a part of the total education of a publicschool student has been acknowledged from the United States Department of Health Education and Welfare down to the New York State mandate for a Strand III Mental Health Component containing sex education In spite of these directives we have found a lack of or poor sexeducation programs to be the general rule in public schools on the Island For many years community groups have resisted sex teaching in the public schools One excuse has been that there are no qualified educators But now sex education for professionals abounds There are many highly qualified sex educators right in our midst With careful and intelligent curriculum planning with close attention to religious and family concerns within each community effective sex education is certainly possible It seems to us after having spent several years in sex education that fear blocks our ability to function effectively fear expressed by administrative parental pressures to restrict the content of sex education fear by religious leaders of lowered ethical or curricular standards fear by parents of the moral character of the teachers or of their ability to present the material and fear that they will teach sexual techniques that equate knowing with doing All of these fears must be confronted if the opposition to sex education is to be reduced As parents we must realize that young people speak to one another to older brothers and sisters to friends and sometimes even to us This too has not changed since we were teenagers Movies television and magazines add to the quantity but not the quality of information they receive about sex Some of this information is very accurate and of high moral quality some is very misconceived The rest tends to be highly exaggerated Short of putting our children in a plastic bubble we can no longer protect them To believe that we can prevent them from seeing and hearing about sex is a delusion that will cause more harm than good It is important that we communicate our knowledge experience morals and concerns that these with huge dose of constructive peeroriented education under the guidance of a sexeducation professional be a larger part of their total education than that which they can receive in the street It is the responsibility of parents to encourage school systems to incorporate sex education into the total educational process As parents it is to our advantage to establish a partnership with the professional sex educator in our school sharing our fears and values expressing our ideas and listening to theirs Peer learning by sharing feelings and values often brings comfort and trust Under the guidance of a sex educator in a formal school setting many of the more confounding issues can be brought to the surface and aired The result in the words of a panel of the World Health Organization should be an integration of the somatic emotional and social aspects of sexual being in ways that are positively enriching and that enhance personality communication and love The teacher and parent can achieve this goal if they are willing to take responsibility for it and to work at it After all sexual health is but one small part of general health and it also requires exposure treatment and preventive medicine through education We cannot deny that our children are sexually active from the moment they are born Their sexual gender is determined at fertilization and their sexual identity develops very shortly after birth We accept them as either male or female Yet their ability to accept themselves and to function intimately with another human is not innate but must be learned Sex education begins in the cradle and ends only in death If we are to grow and change our sexuality must change also 
MORE CONSERVATIVES SHARE ‘LIBERAL’ VIEW’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/more-conservatives-share-liberal-view-poll-shows-many-on-right-are.html,Ila Conner of Indianapolis thinks of herself as a conservative I dont butt into peoples business she said I dont go out and barhop I dress conservatively That is hardly what one would expect from someone who calls herself a political conservative But at a time when the American people are thinking of them selves as increasingly conservative and when a political shift to the right is widely perceived a look beneath the surface at political attitudes discloses a landscape dotted with Americans who do not use the words and concepts of politics the way the experts do In the latest quarterly New York TimesCBS News poll of political attitudes taken earlier this month it was found that most selfstyled conservatives are as ready to accept breadandbutter concepts like jobs for all who want them as are selfstyled liberals But on political issues she favors urovernment payments for abortions Government efforts to provide jobs and lowcost medical care She also thinks that the Government should regulate factory safety Support for that idea and for seeing Ihat lowcost medical care is available has increased dramatically over two decades just as more and more Americans were deciding that the label conservative fit them hest Mrs Conner a homemaker was among the 42 percent of those interviewed in the poll who classified themselves as either moderately or very conservative Oirly 23 percent said that they were moderately or very liberal Twentyseven percent said that they were middle of the road and eight percent did not know where they fit The survey showed a sharp increase in the number of selfdescribed conservatives compared with an identical question posed 14 years ago by the Gallup Poll for two political scientists Lloyd A Free and Hadley Cantril but the level has remained steady with surveys taken in the last four years by the Roper Organization The TimesCBS poll also found more respondents26 percent to 18saying that their views had become more conservative than more liberal in recent years But while numbers like these have beer used to support the idea that the public is moving to the right politically that analysis is deeply undercut by the great variety of definitions of liberal and conservative offered by Mrs Conner and other respondents and by the patchwork of liberal answers given by selfstyled conservatives and conservative responses from those who call themselves liberal Only about half the 1599 respondents said that them could offer any definition and while conservatives often suggested definitions based on attitudes toward government spending and liberals emphasized distinctions of open and closed minds in approaching national problems the answers were extremely varied OLeary Abraham a Little Rock Ark cafeteria worker said Liberal only means fairnessI feel it means justice He called himself a liberal and said that he supported job programs and lowcost medical care but thought that marijuana should be banned and that handguns should not be controlled Ray Klotz a broadcast engineer in Moore Okla said that liberals want to make a lot of changes for the sake of change while wanting not to change for the fear of changing something is the conservative approach He said that he was middle of the road and his other answers supported that characterization The pattern of the public perceiving itself as more conservative than its views on concrete issues would seem to justify las been observed by public opinion analysts since at least the mid1960s But he distance appears to be greater now specially on issues with breadandbuter economic meaning On more emotion11 issues like marijuana however the lifferences are sharper and the selfdecribing labels of conservative or liberal eem to be more relevant But the current appeal of the conservalye label was not shown only by the omparison with the Free and Cantril tudy of 1964 when only 30 percent of hose surveyed called themselves modertely or very conservative Two Categories Were Added It also was reflected in a comparison with the October 1977 TimesCBS poll In that survey respondents were offered only three categories and 21 percent called themselves liberal 44 percent moderate and 28 percent conservative With the five choices offered this time many of the moderates appeared to have slid off toward moderate conservative but not toward moderate liberal With this scale employed there was clear tendency for respondents with more education and higher incomes to describe themselves as liberal Democrats were also much more inclined to identify with the liberal labels than were Republicans Age and race also mattered with younger respondents and blacks more frequently adopting a liberal label but there was no significant regional variation The poll did show that while some issues attained a surprising consensus there were others that produced markedly different responses from selfstyled liberals or conservatives The social issues of the 70sabortion marijuana and pornographydo stimulate broad disagreements between liberals and conservatives as do more abstract formulations of traditional public issues such as whether domestic spending should be increased or whether the Government regulates business too much That last issue presented a more conservative result than in 1964 Then only 42 percent of the public agreed with the statement The Government has gone too far in regulating business and interfering with the free enterprise system while 39 percent disagreed This time 58 percent agreed while 31 percent did not That increase may simply reflect the objective fact that recent legislation dealing with the environment pensions and occupational safety has greatly increased the regulation of business But the too far element was judged very differently by liberals and conservatives In the most polarized group of responses found in the survey 45 percent of the liberals and 67 percent of the conservatives agreed with the statement The polarization disappeared when one specific type of regulation was cited on the question Should Government set safety standards and require changes in job conditions if it thinks theyre harmful or should each factory set its own rules Overall 67 percent of those polled agreed and the difference between conservative and liberal support was slight Seventythree percent of the liberals agreed and so did 66 percent of the conservatives The poll also found agreement across the quasiideological spectrum on the need to provide job training for minorities61 percent overall And it revealed similar agreement this time in opposition on the idea that jobs should be saved for minorities Only 35 percent of those surveyed support the concept Most liberals wanted to restrict the sale of handguns and conservatives were evenly split on it Overall 51 percent of the respondents said that there were guns in their homes But while most liberals thought that the Government should not ban marijuana or adult access to pornography most conservatives wanted marijuana prohibited and they were about evenly split on adult pornography The respondents perhaps because of the saccharin controversy split almost evenly on whether the Government should ban foods and drugs it considers harmful or just issue warnings Fortysix percent supported bans and 50 percent warnings In one indication of social change 66 percent of the respondents said that they approved of giving sex education courses in schools and discussing birth control in those courses In 1965 only 46 percent of the public took that view according to Gallup While there were some clear conservativeliberal patterns they rarely seemed to attain a philosophical level as would have been the case if large numbers of respondents for example consistently argued that the Government should concern itself with or stay away from regulating marijuana pornography factory safety and guns
THE LITERARY VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/22/archives/the-literary-view-books-about-to-be-books.html,THE weather outside may be frightful but as far as the book business is concerned it might as well be spring Though it is still January the spring book season  which runs from February through June  is now upon us With the publishers chorusing their usual optimistic spring song the critics practicing their sour notes and the public lending half an ear well forge ahead with a rundown of the highlights of the season Publishers are by nature optimistic or they wouldnt be publishers but this years positive thinking has been stoked by the lingering afterglow of Christmas just past when sales ran considerably ahead of previous years In the words of Kay Sexton of the B Dalton bookstore chain Extremely successful  the biggest Christmas in our history Which was echoed by Tom Paynter of rival Walden Books Excellent  one of the most gratifying within memory Christmas sales were buoyed by the current popularity of fantasy and science fiction titles across the board from Tolkien to Close Encounters of the Third Kind in paperback Some of the books in the genre however are good gift items eg Gnomes The Hobbit and may steal softly back to the land of makebelieve whence they came after Christmas Readers cannot live by fantasy alone As it happens the most highly visible titles on the spring schedule are mired in the shifting sands of contemporary history  reality shall we say Richard M Nixons memoirs for one which are now firmly scheduled for May A counterblast to Mr Nixons version of Watergate will appear well before his book is out H R Haldeman his once loyal lieutenantH is publishing next month his recollections of what happened under the title The Ends of Power The David Frost interviews with Mr Nixon which angered Mr Haldeman so much that he vowed to tell all in his bookwill also be out in book form under the title Trial by Television And a study of the NixonKissinger foreign policy by Tad Szulc The Illusion of Peace will appear in April Mr Nixons book deals with much more than Watergate however and covers his entire career in over 500000 words The 1100page book will retail for a stiff 1995 but Harold Roth chairman of Grosset  Dunlap the publisher says the price is a fair one given the size of the book and what it contains a history of America since World War II as encapsulated in Mr Nixons career The first printing will be in the 125000150000copy range at least by present thinking No one is saying whats in the but for sheer material no other writer matches Mr Nixon this season The suppressed historical material Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has been unveiling in The Gulag Archipelago has moral import however equaled by few books of our time In The Gulag Archipelago Three he brings his great tragedy of a people to a close This final volume scheduled for March consists of three parts describing notable attempted and successful escapes from Soviet prisons a gallant rebellion by 1000 prisoners which lasted for 40 days before it was put down by superior force and the sufferings of the Russian peasants impressed into collectivization programs Another voice from inside Russia is heard with a purely personal story that of Olga Ivinskaya who was Boris Pasternaks mistress for the last 14 years of his life and the model for the character Lara in Dr Zhivago Her autobiography A Captive of Time will be published in March A first in the growing body of dissident literature is marked by the appearance here also in March of a novel entitled The Coldest Winter in Peking The author is a former Chinese Government official who uses the pseudonym Hsia Chihyen his narrative describes the lives of a crosssection of Peking citizens during a threeday attempted coup detat Bearing the official rather than the samizdat imprimatur for a change is Leonid Brezh nev a portrait of the chairman prepared under the auspices of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR The book is noteworthy in that an American publisher Simon  Schuster made the initial approach to Mr Brezhnev who a couple of years later presented them with a book to which he has apdiplomatic foreword Another book by a foreign statesman signed up over a year and a half ago has taken on added urgency with the onrush of events in the Middle East This is In Search of Identity by Anwar elSadat which is being rushed out in April by Harper  Row and will have an epilogue covering Mr Sadats talks with Prime Minister Begin who is represented in biography by Israeli journalist Eitan Haber in May All this traffic in underground and aboveground manuscripts from home and abroad must keep the CIAs book review division if they have one busy Facing the conventional reviewers who are cleared only up to John le Carre is former CIA chief William Colby whose Honorable Men detailing his career in the Company and also defending its actions will be out in April The moral shadowworld of espionage has also re claimed the attention of Graham Greene who anticipated the whole contemporary genre of disillusionedspy novels by Le Carre And others in his early entertainments Mr Greenes new novel out in March is called The Human Factor and concerns a colorless British spy torn by conflicting loyalties Gore Vidal summons up apocalypse in his new novel Kalki although the setting is Katmandu and the hero an American who claims to be a reincarnation of an ancient Hindu deity and has destruction on his mind the time is the future and the prolific Mr Vidal is expected to continue his bestselling ways In a season in which major works of fiction are rather sparse James Joness last novel Whistle may bulk large Mr Jones thought of the novel as the third in a World War II trilogy including From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line He was unable to complete the last two chapters before his death but he called in his close friend the writer Willie Morris and gave him his notes and instructions for completing the book The novel is about a group of wounded GIs who return to World War II America to recuperate and party in the city of Luxor a

Complacency on Abortion: A Warning to Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/23/archives/complacency-on-abortion-a-warning-to-women.html,At a weekend teachin to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion an overflow crowd of 350 women were urged to rejoin the abortion struggle or see their rights further eroded Our most immediate threat is in Albany where the legislators are going to vote on cutting off Medicaid payments said Frances Nathan executive director of the New York State chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action League NARAL I urge you all to write to Governor Carey and tell him You are the most important man in New York on this issue  The spectators including a handful of men were attending what was billed as a teachin on abortion rights Saturday afternoon at the WBAI studios 359 East 62d Street But the meeting had more of the atmosphere of pep rally to try to jolt proabortion women out of the complacency that many movement leaders think has set in since the Supreme Court decision in 1973 Noreen Connell president of the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women which sponsored the meeting said one of the main reasons it was held was to voice strong protest to the passage of the Hyde Amendment by Congress which denies poor women the right to use Medicaid funds for abortion Last year 300000 women used Medicaid funds for abortions she said How many of these women would now be dead or mutilated and how many unwanted children would have been born if Medicaid funds were not available Over and over again the speakers warned about the wellorganized wellfinanced antiabortion movement in the country and how coat hangers would come out of the closet and back alley butchers would be back in business if abortion again became illegal Ellen Willis a Journalist and a New York delegate to the recent National Womens Conference in Houston predicted that the issue of abortion rights would become as key an issue as Vietnam Referring to the Hyde Amendment she said This is a dual attack on women in general and on the poor And it could divide women because middleclass women will still have the money to pay for abortions Miss Willis called for a longrange strategy against the antiabortion conservative backlash which would include a strong grassroots feminist movement to protect political and social rights Evelyn Reed an anthropologist and author of Womans Evolution denounced what she called the unholy alliance of the Catholic churchs male hierarchy the Ku Klux Klan the Mormon Church and the John Birch Society all reputed leaders in the antiabortion movement They would rather have us maimed and killed by illegal abortions than allow us control over our own bodies she said Denise Fuge executive vice president of NOW said the antiabortion movements latest tactics were disrupting abortion clinics harassing women attempting to get abortions and chaining themselves to clinical equipment Alice Chapman a national board member of NOW from Connecticut said that in her state where almost all Federal funding for abortions has been cut off Medicaidfunded abortions dropped from 148 in September 1976 to 9 in September 1977 and from 155 in October 1976 to 14 in October 1977 The tragic thing is that more than onethird of the women seeking Medicaid abortions in Connecticut are teenagers she said They are children having children and we cant allow them to have back alley abortions The only male speaker Dr Christopher Tietze of the Population Council commenting on the safety of abortion said there were three deaths for every 100000 legal abortions in this country compared with 15 maternal deaths for every 100000 births Although the spectators at the meeting seemed unanimous in their support of abortion rights there was some disagreement when the discussion turned to sterilization abuse  a controversial subject of special interest to minority women in the womens movement Dr Tietze in fact was asked by Miss Connell to conclude his speech when he complained that a much larger number of men and women will not be able to get sterilizations if proposed Federal guidelines  including a 30day waiting period  go into effect NOW favors the 30day waiting period so women would not be coerced into being sterilized Miss Connell explained Later in the question and answer session one woman asked angrily how some of the speakers could justify abortion on demand but not sterilization on demand Its my body and no one elses she said Its the slight inconveniences of 30day waiting period versus the danger of many instances of abuse replied Dr Helen Rodriguez a pediatrician and a member of the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse Frankly I would choose to inconvenience the few

Funds to Help Pregnant Teen‐Agers: An Idea Emerges and Gets in Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/24/archives/funds-to-help-pregnant-teenagers-an-idea-emerges-and-gets-in-budget.html,WASHINGTON Jan 23Last April the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Joseph A Califano Jr saw some statistics on teenage pregnanciesone million one of every 10 female teenagers get pregnant every year When Joe saw those numbers they just dazzled him recalled Laura Miller one of his assistants That moment was one small link in a chain of events that culminated today when President Carter sent his budget to Congress Included was 142 million for programs that would help prevent teenage pregnancy or help young women if they became mothers In a budget of 500 billion the teenage pregnancy program represents an infinitesimal fraction of the total But case study of how and why that money wound up in the budget provides some insights into the decisionmaking process that produced the first budget solely drawn up by the Carter Administration It is a study of how political and financial factors conflict and balance out of how bureaucrats and vested interests fight for power and how the zeal of a few committed people can carry an idea a long way Teenage pregnancy and motherhood was gaining public attention long before Mr Carter took office Outside the Government the Alan Guttmacher Institute had published a powerful booklet called Eleven Million Teenagers a reference to the number of youngsters who were sexually active This booklet which has circulation among professionals and public officials contains the startling statistic that impressed Mr Califano Moreover it adds that 600000 young women between 15 and 19 carry their babies to birth pregnancy is the most common reason for young women dropping out of school teenage mothers face far greater ricks of unemployment welfare and divorce the younger a woman is when she gives birth the poorer her family is likely to be Within the Government the Department of Health Education and Welfare had a variety of programs dealing with the problem from family planning to child health and Medicaid In June 1976 the department evaluated those programs and found them to be ineffective They didnt recognize the distinctive needs of teenagers for confidentiality or lowcost services since many have no independant income one department official said There was also a great need for counseling young people who were entering the wonderful world of sexuality for the first time When the Carter Administration took office the problem received immediate attention Since Mr Carter and Mr Califano both opposed the use of public funds to finance abortions they were under strong political pressure to produce a alternative to deal with unwanted pregnancies Peter H Schuck Deputy AsSistant Secretary of Health Education and Welfare said There is no question that their position on abortion vastly increased the incentives to address the problem in Other ways Another Administration official added Our earliest concern in part reflected our concern over abortion but the more we looked into it we saw that the problem far transcends abortion Another major factor was the attitude that Mr Califano had when he took over his Cabinet post I think the Secretary has a real burden for young people noted Miss Miller his assistant Maybe its because he has three children of his own Moreover noted another aide when Mr Califano ranked all department programs in order of importance he placed priority on preventive efforts not cures Curbing teenage pregnancies thus fit two of his major concerns As he started educating himself on the problem Mr Califano fired questions at his staff members Of the one million pregnancies he asked Miss Miller last spring how many involved girls under 15 The answer30000 a significant number By all accounts Mr Califano was also influenced by his close friends Sargent and Eunice Shriver who have been deeply involved in the issue through their work with the Kennedy Foundation The foundation finances a project In Baltimore that focuses on the needs of teenage parents for postnatal care job counseling and help to continue their education From the beginning then there were two motives behind Administration thinkingpolitical and practical and the practical divided into two issues preventing pregnancy and helping youngsters who for whatever reason get pregnant and decide to have their babies The first specific demonstration of this concern came last February when the Carter Administration revised the 1978 budget it inherited from President Ford About 30 million in extra financing was added to such programs as family planning project grants and community health centers By May Mr Califano asked Mr Schuck one of his deputies to look into the issue more deeply Mr Schuck in turn assigned James Steinberg a Yale law student who was working temporarily at the department Mr Steinberg reported back that there were about a dozen separate and uncoordinated efforts addressing different aspects of the issue and that each was largely ignorant of the others existence In early June Mr Schuck conveyed the report to the Secretary and on June 13 Mr Califano asked him to set up special task force that would produce specific policy recommendations The task force eventually included about 50 people ranging from specialists in the department to experts on Congress and outside consultants Public hearings were held in July and Mr Schuck recalls that he was particularly struck by a delegation representing The Door a community center for teenagers in Manhattan Mr Steinberg went for a visit and his report was impressive They had created a real community in which hardcore innercity kids seemed to come alive and prosper said Mr Schuck Family planning was not really the focus it was really a teen center but it pulled in kids who wouldnt be caught dead in a family planning clinic The Door Mr Schuck said helped plant the seeds for the concept that was now emerginga comprehensive program that would cut across the various problems plaguing teenagers group that is often confused and frustrated by bureaucracy On Aug 4 the task force produced a weighty decision memo for Mr Califano outlining 11 packages that contained different policy options Its clear preference was for the most ambitious package which would attack both pregnancypreventive and postnatal care for young mothers In midAugust the department heads met for a showdown with Mr Califano Here each agency would argue for its favorite causes and the process of winnowing out for the next years budget would begin When the dust had cleared the teenage program had tentatively won the Secretarys approval But the battle was hardly over The key to the next round was what i is known in the trade as the Band This is the range of expenditures between the current years spending total and the ceiling for the next year as determined by the Office of Management and Budget The trick was to get a high enough priority rating from the Secretary to get ones program into the Band If the rating was too low the program fell below the band and stood little chance of success At this point other interests started to make their voices known For instance under one proposal the new program would combine several existing j programs including one juvenile justice administered by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration The LEAA started calling its friends on Capitol Hill to head off the move Senators John C Culver Democrat of Iowa and Birch Bayh Democrat of Indiana let it be known that Health Education and Welfare should keep hands off and the idea was dropped Other members of Congress were very supporting Mr Califano met regularly with Senator Edward M Kennedy the Massachusetts Democrat who has a long standing interest in the problem Representative Paul G Rogers Democrat of Florida the Houses expert on health matters approved a proposal to extend Medicaid benefits to teenagers and even offered to hold hearings on the bill In the end Mr Califanos commitment made the difference The Secretarys interest substitutes for a lot of other things noted Mr Schuck An issue acquires a momentum of its own which under other circumstances might be provided by outside pressures On Sept 15 the new program was included in HEWs budgetary proposal but when it reached the Office of Management and Budget it ran into new snags We were very skeptical at the beginning of the process said one budget officer We didnt think it was thoroughly described We all agreed on the problem but we couldnt agree on a solution In particular the budget office did not want a new program with a new budget line We felt strongly that to the maximum degree possible existing progams should be used the budget officer ex plained We wanted to hold the proliferation of new programs and offices to a minimum Meanwhile the domestic policy staff in the White House got into the act According to seyeral accounts the White House was concerned about the political issue and President Carters promise to find an alternative to abortion Something new shiny and visible was needed went the argument not just a revamping of existing programs On the first goaround at the budget office the new program was virtually knocked out An appeal was filed with James T McIntyre Jr the acting budget chief but when his Mediation could not resolve the impasse Mr Califano took up the issue with President Carter in December Finally a compromise was reached The new program would be approved but would get only 60 million a good deal less than requested A second new piece of legislation would expand Medicaid to cover teenagers while they were pregnant and after they gave birth at a cost of 18 million Many of these youngsters do not qualify now because they do not meet state requirements The final 64 million would go to existing programsfamily planning community health centers research and trainingon the understanding that the additional funds would be aimed toward teenagers Now the issue enters a new stage Two bills will be drafted and sent to Capitol Hill and the proposals could face opposition from several quarters Many antiabortionists who demonstrated their political power in the last session of Congress oppose the use of public funds for birth control In the end the proponents of the new plan feel that the plight of the pregnant teenager speaks for itself Arthur A Campbell is quoted in the Guttmacher booklet as having said The girl who has an illegitimate child at the age of 16 suddenly has 90 percent of her lifes script written for her Her life choices are few and most of them are bad

Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/26/archives/hers.html,IT IS NO news that many women are defecting from the ranks of civil libertarians on the issue of obscenity The conviction of Larry Flynt publisher of Hustler magazinebefore his metamorphosis into a bornagain Christianwas greeted with unabashed feminist approval Harry Reems the unknown actor who was convicted by a Memphis iury for conspiring to distribute the movie Deep Throat has carried on ohs legal battes with almost be support from women who ordinarily regard themgelves as supporters of the First Amendment Feminist writers and scholars have even discussed the possibility of making common cause against pornography with adversaries of the womens movementincluding opponents of the equal rights amendment and right to life forces All of this is deeply disturbing to a woman writer who believes as I always have and still do in an absolute interpretation of the First Amendment Nothing in Larry Flynts garbage convinces me that the late Justice Hugo L Black was wrong in his opinion that the Federal Government is without any power whatsoever under the Ccinstitution to put any type of burden on free speech and expression of ideas of any king as distinguished from conduct Many women I like and respect tell me I am wrong I cannot remember having become involved in so many heated discussions of a public issue since the end of the Vietnam War A feminist writer described my views as those of a First Amendment junkie    Many feminist arguments for controls on pornography carry the implicit conviction that porn books magazines and movies pose a greater threat women than similarly repulsive exercises of free speech pose to other offended groups This conviction has of course been shared by everyoneregardless of race creed or sexwho has ever argued in favor of abridging the First Amendment It the argument used by some Jews who have withdrawn their support from the American Civil Liberties Union because it has defended the right of American Nazis to march through a community inhabited by survivors of Hitlers concentration camps If feminists want to argue that the protection of the Constitution should not be extended to any Particularly odious or threatening form of speech they have a reasonable argument although I dont agree with it But it is ridiculous to suggest that the porn shops on 42d Street are more disgusting to Women than amarch of neoNazis is to survivors of the extermination camps The arguments over pornography also blur the vital distinction between expression of ideas and conduct When I say I believe unreservedly in the First Amendment someone always comes back me with the issue of kiddie porn But kiddie porn is not a First Amendment issue It is an issue of the abuse of powerthe power adults have over childrenand not of obscenity Parents and promoters have no more right to use their children to make porn movies than they do to send them to work in coal mines The responsible adults should be prosecuted just as adults who use children for backbreaking farm labor should be prosecuted Susan Brovinmiller in Against Our Will Men Women and Rape has described pornography as the undiluted essence of antifemale propaganda I think this is a fair description of some types pornography especially of the brutish subspecies that equates sex with death and portrays women primarily as objects of violence The equation of sex and violence personified by some glossy rock record album covers as well by Hustler has fed the illusion that censorship pornography can be conducted on a more rational basis than other types of censorship Are all pictures of naked women obscene Clearly not says a friend A Renoir nude is art she says and Hustler is trash Any reasonable person knows that But what about something between art and trashsomething say along the lines of Playboy or Penthouse magazines I asked five women for their reactions to one picture in Penthouse and got responses that ranged from lovely and sensuous to revolting and demeaning Feminists like everyone else seldom have rational reasons for their preferences in erotica Like members of juries they tend disagree when confronted with something that falls short of 100 percent vulgarity In any case feminists will not be the arbiters of good taste if it becomes easier to harass prosecute and convict people on obscenity charges Most of the people who want to censorgirlie magazines are equally opposed to open discussion of issues that are of vital concern to women rape abortion menstruation contraception lesbianismin fact the entire range of sexual experience from a womans viewpoint Feminist writers and editors and film makers have limited financial resources Confronted by a determined prosecutor Hugh Hefner will fare better than Susan Brownmiller Would the Memphis jurors who convicted Harry Reems for his role in Deep Throat be inclined to take a more positive view of paintings of the female genitalia done by sensitive feminist artists Ms magazine has printed color reproductions of some of those art works Ms is already banned from a number of high school libraries because someone considers it threatening andor obscene Feminists who want to censor what they regard as harmful pornography have essentially the same motivation as other wouldbe censors They want to use the power of the state to accomplish what they have been unable to achieve in the marketplace of ideas and images The impulse to censor places no faith in the possibilities of demoeratic persuasion It isnt easy to persuade certain men that they have better uses for 195 each month than to spend it on a copy of Hustler Well then give the men no choice in the matter I believe there is also a connection between the impulse toward censorship on the part of people who used to consider themselves civil libertarians and a more general desire to shift responsibility from individuals to institutions When I saw the movie Looking for Mr Goodbar I was stunned by its series of visual images equating sex and violence coupled with what seems to me the mindless message a distortion of the fine Judith Rossner novel that casual sex equals death When I came out the movie I was even more shocked to see parents standing in line with children between the ages of 10 and 14 I simply dont know why a parent would take a child to see such a movieany more than I understand why people feel they cant turn off a television set their child is watching Whenever I say that my friends tell me I dont know how it is because I dont have children True but I do have parents When I was a child they did turn off the TV They didnt expect the Federal Communications Commission to do their job for them I am a First Amendment junkie You cant OD on the First Amendment because free speech is its own best antidote

H.E.W. SETS OUT RULES ON AID FOR ABORTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/27/archives/hew-sets-out-rules-on-aid-for-abortions-for-victims-of-rape-foes-of.html,WASHINGTON Jan 26The Federal Government will help finance abortions for improverished women who are victims of rape or incest provided they or anyone reports the crime within 60 days to a law enforcement or public health agency Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare announced today The new regulations interpret compromise legislation enacted last month after a bitter fivemonth stalemate between the Muse in which a majority wanted to forbid any Federal financing of abortions unless the Mothers life was in danger and the Senate which sought a more liberal measure Senate conferees had originally sought Medicaid financing of any abortion that was medically necessary The House conferees refused to go along with that term calling it deliberately vague The regulations under which the law will be carried out pleased the supporters of the original Senate position and drew criticism from the author of the ban on Medicaid abortions Regulations Reflected Legislation We worked hard in the last six weeks not to write liberal or conservative policies but policies that reflected the legislation said Peter Libassi general counsel of the department who directed nine lawyers in writing the regulations They will take effect in 12 days The legislation prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions for lowincome women with three exceptions abortions when the mothers life would be endangered or when severe and longlasting physical damage in the judgment of two physicians would result frott her giving birth and for such medical procedures that are considered necessary for the victims of rape or incest provided the crime was reported promptly The legislation gave Mr Califano leeway in determining what constituted prompt reporting of rape or incest who was required to do the reporting and the meaning of the phrase medical procedures Hyde Preferred Seven Days Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois the author of the ban on Medicaid financing of abortions said that Mr Califano had been too liberal in allowing 60 days for the reporting of the crime One of the reasons for the reporting requirement is to eliminate fraud Mr Hyde said Therefore I would have preferred a report no later than seven days after the incidence of rape or incest However Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts who opposed the ban said that the regulations were consistent with the intent of Congress The regulations give the nation a more reasonable and more humane national policy on abortion than we had last year Mr Brooke said I commend the Secretary for issuing his regulations promptly as required by Congress A law that took effect in July 1977 forbade any use of Federal funds for abortions though it was not fully enforced for months because of court challenges Before that the Department of Health Education and Welfare helped lay for about 11 million Medicaid abortions a year Officials said today that they had no idea how many would be the law Secretary Califano who opposes abor1 tion said My personal views are of no relevance to the legal duty of interpreting what Congress intended and writing regulations that embody that intent He said that he had enlisted the aid of the Justice Department in promulgating the regulations A report accompanying the regulations explained why victims of rape or incest or anyone with knowledge of those crimes was given 60 days to report them to a law enforcement agency or public health service The 60day period it said was arrived at by balancing the competing in terestof providing sufficient time to permit victims of rape or incest to make reasoned decisions as to how and whether to report these incidents with the necessity to protect against fraudulent reporting An HEW spokesman said the report need not name or describe the assailant or provide the details of the incident not even its date it must say only that the incident took place within 60 days of the date on the report and that the woman named in the report was the victim Because the law uses the general term rape rather than forceble rape any pregnant girl under the age of consent would he considered to have been raped the spokesman added The report said The department has Concluded that Congress intended that anyone may report on behalf of the victim The regulations defining health service agencies to which the crimes could be reported said they would include New York Citys municipal hospital system for example but would exclude abortion clinics and any facility whose principal function is the performance of abortions The Department believes that permitting reporting to abortion clinics would be inconsistent with the concept of rigorous enforcement the report said Mr Califano turned to the Justice Department for a determination of whether the phrase medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest included abort ion Attorney General Griffin B Bell replied in a memorandum that taking into consideration the Congressional debate on the subject it was his opinion that the phrase medical procedures included abortions The HEW report defined medical prOcedures as encompassing any medical service including an abortion per formed for the purpose of preventing or terminating a pregnancy arising out of an incident of rape or incest The 62page report made frequent reference to the Congressional debates For example Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican whip was quoted as saying in a House debate Pregnancy is a fact which cannot obviously be known until the raped victim has missed her first period So it seems to me that prompt embrates a period that is at least in the 30day range
A New York Youth Center Inspiring Policy in Washington Budget planners cite The Door's program as a model for dealing with teen‐age pregnancy.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/27/archives/a-new-york-youth-center-inspiring-policy-in-washington-a-good-place.html,All Tina was looking for was a place to stay but that was hardly all she needed Her mother who had abused her since childhood had thrown her out of the house Tina was pregnant and unmarried wanted no more to do with the young man responsible and she was deeply depressed not to mention destitute And so like thousands of other teenagers she went to The Door A community center for youths from 12 to 21 The Door helped Tina find placement in a maternity home and get on welfare She also received free medical care throughout her pregnancy prenatal and postnatal counseling and free contraception as well as additional assistance getting back into school and finding a job Today Tina attends Queens Community College holds a steady job and glows with pride when she talks about her son Adjusting to the sometimes harrowing responsibilities of single parenthood was difficult she said My mother didnt speak to me for two years she wouldnt even answer my phone calls I didnt have anybody to talk to or to help me at all I was scared all the time all alone just me and this little kid Id feel like I was going crazy So what I used to do was call The Door and one of the counselors would talk to me and come over sometimes so I could go out for a couple of hours And The Door has a fantastic mothers group which helps a lot It allows us to talk about how it is to be a young mother and to get feedback No one puts you down for being single everyone is in the same predicament I love The Door Theyve helped me so much There are other places I guess but theres no place like this one Apparently the Carter Administration thinks so too judging by the evolution of the budget President Carter sent Congress this week When Secretary of Heath Education and Welfare Joseph Califano was developing policy recommendations on teenage pregnancy an HEW task force was especially impressed with representatives from The Door and their ideas on meeting the needs of hardtoreach adolescents The Door acknowledged deputy assistant secretary Peter Schuck helped plant the seeds for the concept of comprehensive services that is now emerging as part of the answer to a very large problem One out of every 10 female teenagers gets pregnant every year a total of one million It was statistics like these and the inadequacy of existing programs to deal with them that six years ago led a dozen idealistic young professionals from various fields to conceive of the solution that became The Door It was not enough they reasoned to provide isolated services like family planning the teenagers running the greatest risk of pregnancy were the very ones who werent well enough informed or sure enough of their goals to seek out such help To reach the innercity kids most in need of various kinds of assistance You have to throw a very broad net explained Dr Loraine Henricks the centers medical director and one of its founders Thus began The Door which started out in borrowed quarters in a drug rehabilitation center and now consists physically of a hornlike old department store at 618 Avenue of the Americas Its 55000 square feet have been broken up into all sorts of different areas Theres space for photography graphics sewing and weaving jewelry making a theater a dance studio gymnasium pottery and sculpture workshops videotape equipment vocational and educational resources a health center with its own pharmacy and lab legal counseling mental health services nutrition education carpentry and electronics pregnancy evaluation and counseling and abortion referral Through these offerings all free The Door reaches people like Ramona and her boyfriend Juan Juan was originally referred to the nonprofit center by his school which despaired of the 13yearolds chronic truancy and drug and alcohol abuse In the three years since Juan has become a regular denizen of The Door where he dealt with his initial difficulties and is now receiving additional tutoring for a severe reading problem But in the meantime he had fallen in love with Ramona and brought her along She was interested in The Doors dance studio although shed been sexually active for some time and was using no contraception she believed 15 was too young to get pregnant so she didnt have to worry After she got to know the staff at The Door they were able to persuade her to start using birth control Ramona is no longer leaving her childbearing future in the hands of fate Every day 400 such young people spend time at The Door While many become regulars the center sees 2600 different teenagers every montg and provides up to 12000 individual services A Good Place to Go Its reputation has spread almost entirely by wordofmouth teenagers tell their friends its a good place to go and they make their way in from all five boroughs and from every kind of background although the majority are black and Hispanic Boys come for karate lessons and end up getting treatment for advanced syphilis and gonorrhea Or a girl might come in for legal help in getting on welfare and its obvious shes six or seven months pregnant and we find out shes never seen a doctor Once we have her coming in we can make the bridge to get her into our medical care programs said Charles Terry an attorney who is one of The Doors founders as well as its legal counsel It can be very hard for teenagers to say I need to see a psychiatrist But here they can come check the place out and do something nonthreatening like jewelry making for a week a month even six months until they trust us enough to ask for what they really need The question of trust is a crucial one for teenagers Mr Terry added Particularly in the area of health and sexual issues the confidentiality offered by The Door is a vital reason why this program often succeeds where otherparticularly those requiring parental permissionmay fail While HEW cites The Doors successes as a model for other programs professionals come from everywhere from San Francisco to Saskatchewan Canada to learn how to pattern their own organizations after The Doors model The center is currently working with the Mexican and Venezuelan Governments both of which are trying to start similar programs So is this a success story with happy ending Hardly Although The Door celebrated its sixth anniversary this week and although its services and resources have grown over the years to the present milliondollarayear budget put together from Federal state and local monies its financial status has continued to reel from one critical loss to another The funding situation is disastrous reported The Doors director Dr James Turanski who goes around muttering over the 300000 educational and vocational grant the center lost in December and the 200000 health and manpower training one expiring next summer and wondering which services to cut back The Doors provision of free birth control is all that stands between many 15yearolds and pregnancy and a lifetime on welfare the 200 balanced meals served free each day may be the total nutritional intake for povertylevel teenagers Continual Financial Crisis So much of our energy has to go into maintaining the funding instead of the creative work we should be doing in developing the programs complained Dr Turanski We are in a state of continual financial crisis While The Doors administrators cast about desperately for private or corporate support to beef up their financing their commitment to continue doesnt waver the needs they serve are too urgent There are some kids whose pregnancy youll never prevent because their selfdestructive actout is too strong acknowledged Dr Henricks And just by putting services within reach and taking away the financial and consent barriers even that will only reach the kids who have arrived at the consciousness I dont want to get pregnant because I have something else to do with my life But in the middle is this huge group of kids who are ambivalent They think they want to finish school but they play Russian roulette with pregnancy because they feel such a lack of opportunity for the future because they have family problems because they have so little other fulfillment in their lives and they think a baby might give it meaning In order to reach those kids we cant just dispense pills We have to deal with their sense of depression the lack of other sources of gratification in their lives the fact that theyre doing marginally in school their need to have a place to go where they feel as though theyre worth something Thats what we try to provide
H.E.W. SETS OUT RULES ON AID FOR ABORTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/27/archives/new-jersey-pages-hew-sets-out-rules-on-aid-for-abortions-for.html,WASHINGTON Jan 26The Federal Government will help finance abortions for improverished women who are victims of rape or incest provided they or anyone reports the crime within 60 days to a law enforcement or public health agency Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare announced today FOES OF BAN PRAISE STEP LowIncome Women to Qualify for Medicaid if Crime Is Reported to an Agency in 60 Days The new regulations interpret compromise legislation enacted last month after a bitter fivernonth stalemate between the House in which a majority wanted to forbid any Federal financing of abortions unless the mothers life was in danger and the Senate which sought a more liberal measure The regulations under which the law will lie carried out pleased some supporters of the latter and drew criticism from the author of the ban We worked hard in the last six weeks not to write liberal or conservative policies but policies that reflected the legislation said Peter Libassi general counsel of the department who directed nine lawyers in writing the regulations They will take effect in 12 days Leeway in Prompt Reporting The legislation prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions for lowincome women with three exceptions abortions when the mothers life would he endangered or when severe and longlasting physical damage in the judgment of two physicians would result from her giving birth and for such medical procedures that are considered necessary for the victims of rape or incest provided the crime was reported promptly The legislation gave Mr Califano leeway in determining what constituted prompt reporting of rape or incest who was required to do the reporting and the meaning of the phrase medical procedures Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois the author of the ban on Medicaid financing of abortions said that Mr Califano had been too liberal in allowing 60 days for the reporting of the crime Hyde Preferred Seven Days One of the reasons for the reporting requirement is to eliminate fraud Mr Hyde said Therefore I would have preferred a report no later than seven days after the incidence of rape or incest However Senator Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts who opposed the ban said that the regulations were consistent with the intent of Congress The regulations give the nation a more reasonable and more humane national policy on abortion than we had last

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/29/archives/letters-us-activities-abroad-the-environmental-factor-on-the-state.html,To the Editor A Jan 19 news account describes the Department of State as leading an embryonic movement by several Federal agencies to oppose application of the National Environmental Policy Act to international activities of the Government An unidentified department lawyer was quoted as saying that 1 the statute does not require Federal agencies to prepare environmental impact statements on activities whose effects would occur in foreign countries and 2 any such requirement might be seen as unwarranted intrusion in matters subject to the sovereign authority of other governments Both statements appear to be based on misconceptions First as to the coverage of the statute Section 102 which contains the requirement for environmental impactstatements lays this obligation on all agencies of the Federal Government and states that it shall be discharged to the fullest extent possible The intention of Con gress that the statute should apply tc US actions abroad and their impacts abroad was brought out in the hear ings and debates that preceded passage The administrative practice of Government agencies has accepted application of the statute in cases where the Federal activities and their impacts were located outside the United States Agencies having international programs such as the Departments of State and Defense and the Agency for International Development have reflected this in their regulations and a number of Government agencies have prepared environmental impact statements on activities carried out abroad or having impacts abroad The few court cases that have considered the question have held that NEPA applies to major Federal actions and their impacts regardless of location The assertion of unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of another country is a figment and chimera There is no question of imposing US environmental laws or standards on another country The function of an environmenial impact statement is to illuminate the environmental consequences of an action so that the US Government and another government or gov ernments affected will have the best available environmental information and evaluation before deCisions are made Particularly if a foreign government does not possess resources for making an environmental study it should welcome the availability of such a study financed by the US In some cases where a US agency Is contemplating a project abroad it may propose joining with the foreign government concerned in making an environmental evaluation that will be important to both Protection of the global environment is a responsibility that cannot safely be procrastinated The United States has taken a lead among the nations that deserves to be carried forward Center for Law and Social Policy Washington Jan 20 1978 To the Editor There is less than three cents worth of wheat in a  loaf of bread If you eat a loaf of bread per week for one year  you have paid only 156 for all the wheat used in those loaves If farmers gave away their produce your food bill would not go down Bread prices did not fall one whit when wheat dipped overnight from 5 to 2 per bushel We are pleased to note that your paper is investigating the reported corruption in the Philippines Should you do on with your probing you will undoubtedly find a scene comparable with the Korean rice deals and extending over most of the countries of the globe which purchase or receive United States farm exports Food you eat is the most important necessity taking precedence over energy and defense in our daily lives Agriculture is the nations largest industry Since agriculture no longer purchases 20 percent in equipment and supplies the steel industry has been crippled Auto sales have fallen 10 percent since the farm strike began and agribusiness no longer purchases cars pickups and trucks in vast numbers most farms and ranches keep at least five or more vehicles Agriculture pays 51 percent of the property taxes in most regions and is now threatening to halt payments This country cannot kill off its most important producers without suffering the awful consequences The persons responsible for putting agriculture in this precarious position ought to be sought out and brought to justice to halt their machinations and to protect the food supply of the nation We sincerely hope the press which in our judgment is the one and only safeguard the nation has left to depend on will continue to expose those factors threatening the American way of life Bigfork Mont Jan 20 1978 To the Editor Payments by recipients of Medicare are nominal However note the threat on the reverse side of their bill If you do not pay on time you can later reapply under somewhat severe terms If you da not pay on time for a second time you will never again be eligible for Medicare 1low outrageous Presumably the elderly come under this program Sometimes the bill is not received Perhaps you are physically or mentally incapable of mailing the small payment on time Or a computer fouls up To so threaten a possibly helpless or otherwise besieged elderly citizen for a small amount which the person would willingly pay is a disgrace Even a multiple mugger or murderer is not similarly threatened It would seem that the crime of living over 65 is the worst offense you can commit thanks to our legislators A Suggestion Why not permit recipients to pay in advance for a year instead of quarterly New York Jan 18 1978 To the Editor The charges leveled by Lawrence Leder in his Jan 11 OpEd effluvium Abortion Opponents Tactics are wrong headed but ultimately correct and this should be acknowledged Catholics do constitute the backbone of the prolife movement and the action performed in defense of the sanctity of life such as those described by Lader reflect a new militancy whose object will eventually be to correct other of recent years mistaken developments besides the legalization of abortion Organizations like ours exist to encourage the trend because the nation simply cannot endure if the values and sentiments of the Christian majority continue to be divorced from the public life Is there a conspiracy as Leder intl mates Yes but unlike others it is quite open Everyone knows Our Lord enjoined us His followers to take over the world President Catholics for Christian Political Action Washington Jan 11 1978 To the Editor One of the easy jokes for years was the deriding of Hubert Humphrey over his zeal for talkinga joke that Humphrey himself enjoyed telling about himself The usual rejoinder of his friends was that he had so much to say But not nearly enough has been said about Humphreys other great zeal He was a magnificent listener but the listening was almost always done when no microphones or cameras were present and no reporters to tell others about it I will never forget one particularly memorable occasion It was back in 1965 when I was serving both as assistant director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and as special assistant to the Vice President in connection with his responsibilities in the antipoverty effort I had asked Mr Humphrey to join us at a meeting of our Community Representatives Advisory Committee This was a group of about 20 men and women all of them very poor who had been named from their respective antipoverty program boards around the country We had been told that the Vice Presidents schedule was very rough that day but that he had himself insisted on at least dropping in for about five minutes When he arrived the meeting was in progress Chairing the meeting I suggested we stop the discussion and hear some words from the Vice President No he said please proceed I want to hear what these folks have to say We had been getting brief reports from each of the committee members The reports continued An Oklahoma Indian describing living conditions on his reservation A black woman from a Chicago ghetto A white woman from the Cleveland Hough area An old man from a former textile town in New England Mr Humphrey had placed his hands on a table and was leaning forward to hear every word Occasionally he would ask questions He wanted to know as much as possible about each of them and they soon knew that he wanted to know After a halfhour he motioned to his aide and then whispered in his car When I said Id understand if he had to leave he retorted Relax I wouldnt miss this for anything I just changed my schedule He stayed for two hours He was a mighty good listener He had a third earhis heart Washington Jan 17 1978 To the Editor Social Security payments are commonly referred to today as taxes There is reason to consider this deplorable The word taxes arouses hostile and fearful attitudes Social Security was and is meant to provide people with income after they retire When they buy insurance for this purpose from private companies the payment becomes a premium Those payments come out ofthe individuals income just as Social Security payments do Why one form of such payments against the hazards of old age is embraced as highly desirable while the other is an obnoxious tax escapes logical thought The point has further import Social Security constitutes a broadly based almost universal effort to prevent the deprivation degradation and poverty to avoid going on welfareof the Great Depression of the 1930s Along with unemployment insurance part of the same program Social Security has done much to prevent these sufferings in recent economic depressions because such a large group pays into it If young people today moan about Social Security payments they might benefit from knowing that many of us older ones made our contributions because we understood the consequences of not having such a program Social Security contributes greatly to the general welfare on this account For this reason all wage and salaried emplogees including government employees and legislators ought to pay into the fund Social Security brings a humane concern into an economic system which all too often lacks heart The time has come to stop calling Social Security payments taxes and see them for the very beneficial foresight they represent Jamesburg NJ Jan 15 1978 To the Editor I find it difficult to understand how the roof of a modern building such as Hartfords Civic Center can collapse Indeed there was a heavy snowicewater loadbut such loads are predictable and are or should be taken into account by the firm that designed the roof Or is it conceivable that an unplannedfor load buildup occurred because of iceclogged drains a goof so monumental as to be discounted Certainly the

1976 Survey Finds Teen‐Age Pregnancy Rose 33% in 5. Years,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/31/archives/1976-survey-finds-teenage-pregnancy-rose-33-in-5-years.html,Nearly one in 10 white girls aged 15 through 19 has had a premarital plegnancy according to the results of a 1976 national survey released yesterday This represents a onethird increase from 1971 to 1976 in the premarital pregnancy rate among white teenagers The authors of the surveytwouseciologists from Johns Hopkins University said that the increase in premarital pregnancies could be attributed almost entirely to a greater incidence of premarital sexual activity which also increased by onethird since a similar survey they did in 1971 Only one in five teenagers who became pregnant without intending to had used contraception to prevent it the sociologists Melvin Zelnik and John F Kantner reported in the current issue of Family Planning Perspectives a journal published by an affiliate of Planned Parenthood Nevertheless the authors said contraceptive use among white teenagers has nearly doubled since 1971 The new survey involved a national sample of nearly 2200 teenagers white and black married and single not including those living in college dormitories A similar sample of more than 4000 women was interviewed in 1971 The authors of th two surveys cautioned that certain of the data gathered on premartial pregnancies among blacks was questionable because black teenagers tended to report incorrectly how they dealt with their pregnancies Many more than actually said so for example had their pregnancies terminated by abortion the survey authors said Based on the survey among the approximately 10 million teenage girls aged 15 through 19 about four million had had premarital sexual experience and more than 1 million had become pregnant one or more times as a result Fortyfive percent of the white teenagers who became pregnant before marriage and who did not marry after con ceiving had their pregnancies terminated by abortion according to the findingsIn the 1971 survey the comparable figure was 33 percent of outofwedlock pregnancies terminated by abortion Twentyseven percent of white teenagers who did not marry gave birth as against 44 percent surveyed in 1971 Of those having liVe births the more recnt survey showed that 88 percent kept their babies as against 72 percent reported in 1971 There was also a change in the proportion of pregnant teenagers who married during the pregnancy Among white teenagers interviewed in 1971 more than half who became pregnant married beforq the baby was born But by 1976 only a third chose marriage over an abortion or illegitimate birth Among blacks who became pregnant outofwedlock in both surveys fewer than 9 percent said they married before giving birth

Fair Rules for an Unfair Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/31/archives/fair-rules-for-an-unfair-abortion-law.html,Health Education and Welfare Secretary Califano has done his duty He has interpreted the nations unfair abortion law fairly The recently issued regulations will continue to discriminate against the poor by strictly limiting their access to Medicaid abortion funds But this misguided social policy is the creation of a misguided Congress not of the Secretary On several controversial issues Mr Califano and his lawyers have performed admirably hacking their way through a thicket of ambiguities in the law that passed a bitter and divided Congress in December after months of heated debate Medicaid hinds will now be allowed for the victims of rape or incest if they report the crime within 60 days to a public health or lawenforcement agency The report may be madeby letter or in person by the victim or someone who knows her HEW will not check the veracity of these reports The doctors who must certify the severe physical health problems of women seeking abortions for reasons other than rape or incest will not be secondguessed by other doctors These regulations are an effort to prevent fraud in a humane way as Congress intended There are however a few weaknesses in the regulations The 60day reporting deadline for rape or incest should be lengthened in the few eXceptional cases involving very young girls too frightened or too ignorant to tell anyone they may not realize they are pregnant until the deadline has passed The laws reliance on local officials in cases of rape or incest also ought to be modified Such officials are to receive reports of these crimes and must acknowledge them in writing so that a woman may qualify for Federal Medicaid abortion funds But what if the local official isas many areopposed to abortion By merely throwing a victims report in wastebasket or losing it in a drawer an official could block a womans chance for Medicaid funds The victim could reapply to a Federal health agency if she were sophisticated enough and had the time But it would be better merely to require a woman to prove to Medicaid that she had filed a timely report of rape or incest without requiring an acknowledgment from a public official So far Mr Califano has proven himself an agile administrator by preparing regulations that reflect Congressional intent in the controversial abortion legislation The next challenge for the Secretary will be to enforce the regulations fairly guaranteeing access to Medicaid abortion funds to anyone entitled to them
Fritz Mondale at 50,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/01/archives/fritz-mondale-at-50.html,WASHINGTON Jan 31Vice President Walter F Mondale was 50 the other day a very dicey time of life This is the age when even the most successful politicians know what means to be middleaged or caught in the middle halfway between home and Washington between responsibilities to their parents and responsibilities to their children between their political dreams and their disappointments But this is not exactly true of Fritz Mondale At 50 he still looks like an assistant to Coach Bud Grant of the Minnesota Vikings and unlike most Vice Presidents of this century he gaining influence after his first year in office rather than losing it The more he does the more he asked to do He was assigned the main task of helping President Carter avoid the legislative confusion of 1977 and define the priorities for 1978 He was asked by the President to supervise the work of Mike Blumenthal of Treasury and Charlie Schultze at the Council of Economic Advisers on the selection of a successor to Arthur Burns as Federal Reserve Board chairman He recently made a long trip into the West to listen to the farmers and every other influential group with grievancea formidable taskand he has just been in Canada and in Mexico talking over a variety of difficult problems with our neighbors All this plus presiding over the last melancholy journey of his old buddy Hubert Humphrey has not been easy but the rest of 1978 is likely to be even more difficult For this is an election year and in addition to the Senate and all his other duties he has been pulled off to be out in the states trying to maintain the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate or at least to minimize their losses in next Novembers elections This will clearly change his role In Mr Mondales first year he has been the principal assistant to the President and a spokesman for Mr Carter on Capitol Hill which he knows probably better than any other member of the Carter Cabinet But once he takes to the road to elect Democrats and defeat Republicanswhose votes the Administration needs to put over the Panama Canal and strategic arms treaties welfare and health security programs among othershe will obviously have to do some fancy openfield running Mr Mondale doesnt seem to he too anxious about this dilemma He works out of a little cluttered office in the White House down the hall from the President with a fiercely loyal and almost too protective staff but he still so surprised by what has hap pened to him and his family in the last few years and by his unexpected success that he just takes things as they come with remarkable confidence Hes is one of the lucky onesoriglnaiiy appointed to the Senate and then rescued from his own disastrous Presidential campaign by Jimmy Carter who believed in Fritz Mondales character and had the odd idea that Vice Presidents could be useful Mr Mondale nas made this transition without forgetting who he is or where he came from He has moved from his old simple middleclass house into the new VicePresidential residencea Victorian monstrositywithout losing his sense of humor or proportion or his sense of wonder about how it all happened He is probably going to have a hard time this year not only with the Republicans in Congress but also with the liberal Democrats who resent President Carters retreat from welfarestate programs and rely on Mondale to uphold the liberal principles of Humphrey and the New and Fair Deals But Mondale at 50 is not the same as Mondale at 40 and the last years of the 1970s are clearly not the same as the decades of the 30s through the 60s He notices that Minnesota may be very liberal on economic issues but is very cautious about social issues involving the family the church abortion and crime He is troubled by the avoidable controversies of the Carter Administration over Bert Lance and particularly over the Marston case but he is fiercely loyal to Mr Carter and irritated by the efforts of his liberal friends to change the Presidents style Leave him alone he says his character is more important than his style He will adapt to the political realities without losing his moral authority Meanwhile Mr Mondale is getting more training for the Presidency than any other Vice President in this century and as he goes through the 1978 Congressional campaigns he will clearly pick up a lot of ious for the campaigns of the future Politicians dont always measure birthdays by years but by Presidential campaigns In 1981 Mondale will be 54 and in the campaign of 1984 he will be 57 still young enough to be serious candidate for his partys Presidential nomination He doesnt talk about this of course He remembers with regret Hubert Humphreys long run for the White House his near miss and the sadness of his defeat But in a way Mondale now stands where Humphrey stood almost a generation ago as the leading candidate of his generation and his party for the Presidency and how he handles his new and difficult responsibilities of 1978 may very well determine his political future
Personal Health,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/01/archives/personal-health-doityourself-pregnancy-tests-have-advantages-but.html,Jane E Brody THE women of ancient Egypt the records say drank a concoction of pounded watermelon mixed with the breast milk of someone who had borne a son If they vomited it was considered evidence of pregnancy And according to Hebrew scriptures women whose feet sank deeply into soft ground were presumed to be with child Fortunately for the women of the 20th century pregnancy testing today is a lot less messy and a lot more scientific riot to mention far more accurate And the science of pregnancy testing has been refined to the point where women may ba able to diagnose their own pregnancy or lack thereof using doityourself tests purchased at a pharmacy Clearly there are adVantages to a selftest that is reliable and easy to use One is simple reassurance Women who are anxious about a possible pregnancy can find out one way or another Promptly without waiting for a doctors appointment Such women might Include those with irregular periods those whose periods have not returned after stopping oral contraceptives those with infertility problems and those who do not want to be pregnant If a woman wants an abortion she can arrange for it promptly and if she is early enough she can have the simpler and less costly procedure of menstrual extraction to terminate the pregnancy For the woman who desires pregnancy a selftest can help protect the baby by prompting the woman to start proper prenatal care during the first month of pregnancy when the risk of damage to the fetus is greatest Despite such advantages some experts question the advisability accuracy and economy of selftests for pregnancy and warn of the need in many cases to follow them up promptly with a visit to a physician Modern pregnancy testing was born in 1928 when two German gynecologists introduced the socalledAZ test in which urine from the woman was injected into immature female mice the woman was pregnant dissection of the animals ovaries four or five days later would show they had matured In 1932 two Americans reported that a similar injection of urine into rabbits could show results in only 48 hours But the more expedient rabbit test was hardly ideal Rabbits were expensive animals to sacrifice for every woman who sought chemical confirmation of pregnancy Later tests were introduced using far cheaper animalsrats and toads injected with the urine or blood of the womanthat yielded results in a day or less Another test used the woman as the less animal After taking estrogen and progestogen for three to five days she would get her period within a week if she was not pregnant It is now known that this test can damage the fetus and should not be used The animal tests relied on the action of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin HCG produced during pregnancy by the placenta starting about two days after the fertilized egg becomes attached to the wall of the womb This same hormone is the key to the newer lab tests that in recent years have almost entirely supplanted pregnancy tests in animals The lab tests which use test tubes or slides rather than animals are based on the principles of immunologyspecifically the interaction between HCG and antibodies that have been prepared to react with the hormone If done about two weeks after a missed period these immunological tests can give within a few hours highly accurate determinations of the presence or absence of pregnancy A newer more intricate and more sensitive test for HCG called radioreceptor assay was developed several years ago at Cornell University Medical Center Using radioactive materials it can detect the HCG of pregnancy with better than 99 percent accuracy one day after a missed period But it requires special training and costly equipment The simpler albeit less accurate and more delayed immunological method for detecting HCG forms the basis of pregnancy test kits that can be used by women themselves without a doctors prescription or an intervening laboratory The only such test currently marketed in the United States was introduced nationally last week by WarnerChilcott Called EPT for early pregnancy test it costs about 10 and is intended for use nine days or longer after a missed period At that time the company claims if the test result is positive the woman can be 97 percent sure she is pregnant If it is negative theres a one in five chance that she may in fact be pregnant and she Is advised to repeat the test a week later if she still hasnt gotten her period The test involves placing three drops of urine into a test tube containing special chemicals Water is added the tube shaken and then set in a holder where it must remain undisturbed for two hours Formation of a ring in the tube indicates pregnancy It seems quite simple However according to Dr Lorrin Lau of Johns Hopkins University there are limitations to a woman doing her own pregnancy test Most would be doing the test for the first time and are less likely to do it correctly than someone whos done hundreds of tests Secondly Dr Lau said Pregnancy testing is a very emotional event and people dont do as well as they might They have a hard time following even relatively simple instructions Theyre so eager to knowlhe results thatthey dont Wait the two hours and once they disturb the test they get a confusing result Dr Lau who developed a simple pregnancy test has found that even medical students and their wives have difficulty doing their own pregnancy tests accurately He added that studies in Canada where doityourself pregnancy tests have been sold for years show that few women trust the results of the tests they do themselves Many go to the pharmacist to have the test repeat ed Its a false economy he remarked The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology says it has no objections per se to overthecounter pregnancy tests as long as the directions for use are clear and the woman is advised to see a doctor if the results warrant it A doctor incidentally can diagnose pregnancy on the basis of physical exam withOut a chemical test at about two weeks after a missed period If the woman is pregnant and wants to be the doctor should examine her for potential complications and advise her about proper diet and avoidance of drugs cigarettes and alcohol If she doesnt want to be pregnant she should seek an abortion right away when the procedure is safest Before doing the abortion the doctor or clinic should repeat the pregnancy test Infrequently a pregnancy test Will give a positive result when in fact the woman is not pregnant This could happen if the container in which the urine was collected had a residue of detergent if there was blood or protein in the urine or more seriously if the woman has a uterine growth called hydatidiform mole or a cancer of the uterine tissue called choriocarcinoma Another concern is women with ectopic pregnancies which lodge in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus If not removed surgically ectopic pregnancids eventually rupture and could result in death A selftest may give a negative result early in an ectopic pregnancy giving the woman false assurance or somewhat later it could have a positive result leading the woman to think she has a normal pregnancy or that she needs an abortion which would not remove an ectopic pregnancy Any woman with a positive pregnancy test who has an IUD in place or who has had a sterilization operation should see a physician promptly to check on the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy The Food and Drug Administration has not yet licensed any company to market an overthecounter pregnancy test This includes WarnerChilcott which the agency says does not now require premarket approval The FDA is currently formulating a policy on selftests for pregnancy The agency expects to require assurance from the manufacturer that the lest is highly accurate safe and clearly labeled as to its proper use

Planned Parenthood's New Head Takes a Fighting Stand,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/03/archives/planned-parenthoods-new-head-takes-a-fighting-stand-watchdog.html,Faye Wattleton the new presidentdesignate of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said here yesterday that she was putting the world on notice that the traditionally lowkeyed organization was going to become more aggressive in the battle for abortion rights Miss Wattleton who is the first woman the first black and the youngest 34 years old president in Planned Parenthoods history said that the new aggressive stance was necessary to combat the burgeoning activities and successes of the family planning organizations enemies  antiabortion members of the socalled righttolife movement What _has happened is that weve allowed them to have center stage she said at a press conference held to announce her selection at Planned Parenthoods headquarters 810 Seventh Avenue Id like to say those days are over Miss Wattleton currently a Planned Parenthood official in Dayton Ohio who is married and has one child added Many of us had become complacent because of our victories in the 1960s and early 1970s There was Feeling among many of us that right would win out But so many events of the past year especially the Federal and state actions limiting payments for abortion under Medicaid have made us realize that we must become more aggressive Miss Wattleton said that during her threeyear 70000ayear term she would have three principal public policy targets To restore to the poor access to safe legal abortions so cruelly destroyed in twothirds of the states by recent Federal and state actions limit ing payments for abortion under Medicaid To place reproductive biology research and contraceptive development at the highest level on the nations research agenda To formulate and pursue a national strategy for reducing the incidence of teenage pregnancy Pregnancy rates among sexually active adolescents were as high in 1976 as they were in 1971 she read angrily from a statement Only one out of seven pregnant girls used contraception and eight out of ten teenage pregnancies were unintended Much needs to be done in health services and educational programs if the tragic prospect of many hundreds of thousands of children bearing children each year is to be ended Watchdog Position When asked in an Interview whether her being black would help diffuse criticism from some black groups that birth control and abortion are forms of black genocide Miss Wattleton replied I dont think a lot of people are yelling genocide anymore Because am black Im in a watchdog position on these issues and no one should assume Ive been coopted What better way is there to guard against those typesof abuses She added that when it came to the advancement of blacks we should not be concerned with increasing our numbers but with the quality of life Whats really important is that black women have equal access to determining when and how they will have children On another controversial issue sterilization abuse Miss Wattleton said she endorsed proposed Federal guidelines that would require among other things a 30day waiting period before a person could become sterilized to avoid possible coercion Some opponents of the guidelines argue that sterilization should be available on demand with no restrictions We think the onemonth waiting period is reasonable Miss Wattleton said But we are also concerned that the pendulum doesnt swing too far in the other direction so that it limits access to sterilization People have the right to decide to be sterilized just as the affluent do and with abortion restrictions more and more women are going to want sterilization In Charge of Headquarters Miss Wattleton was selected for the presidency do Jan 27 after a search that took exactly nine months she said with a smile at a meeting of Planned Parenthoods national board of directors in Kansas City As president she will be in charge of the headquarters staff in New York and 189 communitybased affiliates in 43 states and the District of Columbia Last year those affiliates provided family planning services to more than 11 million persons Planned Parenthood which has budget of 90 million employs 3000 staff members nationwide and utilizes more than 20000 volunteers Miss Wattletons new job will pit her headtohead with another articulate black woman  Dr Mildred Jefferson a Boston surgeon who heads the National RighttoLife Movement But Miss Wattleton doesnt think that their similarities had anything to do with her selecion I thought about it a lot she conceded and I think I was chosen for my knowledge of the organization and for being a woman and because we needed to change our imagenot because we wanted to emulate our enemies Miss Wattleton was born in St Louis the only child of the late George Wattleton who worked in a trunk factory and his wife Ozie a housewife She worked her way through Ohio State University where she earned degree in nursing and then went on to Columbia University where she received her masters degree in nursing It was while she was at Columbia during 196667 that she first became interested in family planning she said The majority of my clinical experience was spent at Harlem Hospital and one day I saw a 17yearold girl die from a botched abortion That had a greater impact on me than anything else I saw Miss Wattleton who is 5 feet 11 inches tall slender and once worked as a fashion model is currently executive director of Planned Parenthood of the Miami Valley Dayton Ohio She and her husband Franklin Gordon mental health administrator will move to New York in midApril when Miss Wattleton assumes the Planned Parenthood presidency Their daughter Felicia is 2

A House Panel Bars Curb on Abortions In Women's Aid Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/03/archives/a-house-panel-bars-curb-on-abortions-in-womens-aid-bill.html,WASHINGTON Feb 2A House subcommittee today rejected 5 to 3 a measure that would permit employers to withhold pregnancy benefits from employees who had abortions unless the womans life would be endangered if she gave birth The 30minute debate marked the first incident of abortion politics in the new session of Congress Last year an abortion dispute caused a fivemonth delay in enactment of a 613 billion appropriation bill Some Congressmen have indicated that they will attempt to attach a ban on Federal funds for abortion to the defense appropriations bill this year The antiabortion measure today was offered by Representative Edward P Beard Democrat of Rhode Island as an amendment to proposed legislation that would require employers to give pregnant workers the same amount of time off with pay and other rights that they would get if they were ill The legislation would overturn a 1976 Supreme Court decision that held that the failUre of emplovers to provide pergnancy benefits did not constitute sex discrimination under the civil rights laws Representative Beard said that providing pregnancy benefits to women who had abortions would constitute a loophole that could be used by people who advocate wholesale abortions He vowed that although defeated in the Education and Labor Subcommittee I will carry this forward to the full committee and if necessary to the floor The leading opponent of the antiabortion amendment was Representative Ted Weiss Democrat of Manhattan He said it was ironic that such an amendment should be offered to legislation seeking to redress discrimination against women adding that if it was adopted We would just be substituting one form of discrimination for another Mr Weiss said that although he was one of the 199 cosponsors of the bill to overturn the Supreme Court decision I could not vote for the bill if it included such an amendment
Good Years,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/05/archives/congress-freshmen-and-sophomores-bold-so-far.html,WASHINGTON  President Carter briefed them on his legislative priorities two days before his State of the Union Message They discussed the Administrations economic package with Budget Director James T McIntyre Jr and Charles L Schultze chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Last week they talked with Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr about an energy program They were not Congressional barons but people who plebably would have been ignored only a few years ago  the newest Democratic members of the House first and second teirmers who have banded together to develop an unprecedented impact Much has been made about the power of the newcomers and with good reason In the last three years they have helped alter the way Congress operates They were instrumental in reforming the seniority system thus undermining the oncetotal authority of committee chairmen and enhancing the power of the leadership The newcomers have been especially successful in deposing chairmen who are unresponsive to their wishes and in open ing conference committees to the public including committees that even had been closed to Congressmen who werenot members Those trends will be difficult to reverse The 168 freshmen and sophomores make up 38 percent the House a high percentage that reflects recent voter rejection of veterans and decisions by an unusually large number of oldtimers to retire Because of numbers alone the newcomers were hard to absorb in traditional fashion thereaire 126 of them in the 289member Democratic caucus The senators serving since 1974 also have impact but less dramatically so largely because the 19 Democrats among them are much smaller percentage of the partys delegation Besides their numbers the House freshmen and sophomores are highly organized the Democrats belong to a New Members Group that regularly discusses issues reforms and campaigning However were united more on process than substance says Representative Toby Moffett a Connecticut Democrat who has been prominent on the conference committee on energy On substantive matters they are diverse though generally as the postWatergate class they accept little on faith They tend to be more conservative fiscally than older Democrats but that may be because many come from normally Republican districts and must answer to a more conservative constituency That is a big factor this year when Democrats expect to lose more than 40 seats two dozen of them the result retirements or members running for the Senate Of the rest freshmen and sophomores are considered highly vulnerable Some have election worries partly because they haveneglected traditional Democratic supporters  organized labor for example Labors disappointment with the newer Democrats is such that Alexander Barkan director of the AFLCIOs Committee on Political Education has sin gled them out for warnings Those opposing laborlaw reA sion a minimumwage increase common site picketing and cargopreference legislation will not be supported this falf he said even if that means conservative Republicans win Representative Phil Sharp a sophomore Democrat from Indiana argues that it is not that the Democratic newcomers dont share the partys basic goals but that theres a greater skepticism about which Government policies would advance those goals Theres a great deal of concern about some of thee newer goals under the general heading of quality of life ad what happens when Government becomes too involved in making the daytoday decisions for people Their concerns are reflected in their votes which by vary ing margins have been cast against funds for Medicaid abor tions a tax rebate and restoring defense cutbacks and in favor of a human rights resolution and a delay in compliance with autoemission standards And the key legislators in many of these votes have not necessarily been Democrats Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois was freshman when he introduced the bill to ban Medicaid abortions On another sensitive issue Representative Bruce Capu to a Westchester Republican and a freshman has helped maintain momentum in the House investigation of South Korean influencebuying in Washington  In the Senate the newcomers have found it harder to make their mark but there are exceptions and as a group they also follow traditions less faithfully than their elders For instance they supported overwhelmingly a new limit on the number of chairmanships any onesenator may hold Some have even quickly become subcommittee chairmen Senator Daniel P Moynihan of New York heads the welfare subcommittee of the Finance Committee and so has an important role in welfare reform Senator James Sasser of Tennessee is chairman of the civil service subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee a key position in a Congress that will take up the Presidents proposed civilservice reforms Some House freshmen and sophomores like to think of themselves as a breed apart To a very great extent the id tellectual ferment and the ferment of conscience is provided by the newer members says Representative Theodore Weiss a Manhattan Democrat who although a freshmatt sponsored civilrights legislation that has been passed  But others worry that as time passes their freshness will fade Our sense of urgency diminishes Mr Moffett says All the pressures are to be a member of the club That all toocommon tendency can take the edge off eagerness a point made by

H.E.W. Team Had To Match Intention With Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/05/archives/drafting-abortion-rules-a-nowin-situation.html,WASHINGTON  Drafting regulations to carry out laws passed by Congress is often a cut and dried process But when the matter involved is as emotional and socially explosive abortion the process can be delicate as juggling dynamite Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare was reminded when he testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee last week He went to talk about his departments 150 billion budget but all most senators wanted to discuss were the departments new rules for Federal financing of abortions From the start the Secretary has been visibly nervous about the matter and pressures on him from both inside and outside his department have been heavy Last week he went so far as to instruct his staff not to discuss the preparation the regulations before his Senate testimony Presumably one reason Mr Califano has acted like a man walking on eggs is his own publicly stated opposition to abortion in principle In part because of his own vulnerability potential charges of personal prejudice he seemed to bend over backward to insulate the team of nine lawyers who prepared the regulations from outside pressures and to direct them into as narrowly Legalistic a channel as possible Normally when an age1cy drafts regulations to implement a new law policy implications as well as legal procedures are discussed This time there was no discussion of policy We were charged to stick entirely to the legislative history one of the lawyers said It was very unusual Under the rules the department finally adopted the Federal Government will help pay for abortions for impoverished victims of rape or incest if the women or anyone else report the crime within 60 days Federal funds may also be used if one doctor certifies that the womans life is in danger or two certify that childbirth would have a lasting effect on her health The rules implement a compromise Congress produced after months of bitter debate over the differences between the Senates generally more liberal and the Houses more restrictive bills Existing law had limited Medicaid assistance for abortion to women whose lives would be endanzered by childbirth and the department had been financing abortions for such women the new law permitted the Government to finance abortions for physically ill women and allowed certain medical procedures to avert pregnancy for victims of rape or incest But the HouseSenate compromise left the department with some discretion in drawing up the regulations It had to decide how many days constituted prompt reporting of a rape or an act of incest Did medical procedure include abortion Where should the rape and incest be reported Accordingly all the pressures that had been focused on and in Capitol Hill shifted to the department One official noted that a stream of letters from Congressmen flowed in many urging haste One argued that medical procedures included abortion another that it did not Public pressure from groups urging that women be permitted to make their own choices on abortion to those wanting to end all Federal financing was almost continuous Meanwhile President Carters own opposition to abortion hung like a shadow over the departments proceedings One department official said he was convinced that this was not a moral decision on Califanos part It was a political decision The President had to be satisfied There were also internal pressures A number of department officials including senior staff memberi were bitter about Administration support for a restrictive abortion policy Many women on the staff regarded abortions as womensrights issue We were aware of those pressures said one of the lawyers on the drafting team Colleagues would stop us in the cafeteria to talk about the regs But we never discussed the merits of the issue outside the team And inside we stuck very closely to the legislative record As for Mr Cali fanos personal views of course we knew where stood we couldnt expunge that from our minds But there was no suggestion from him at all at any time about where we should end up There were also crosscurrents among the nine drafting lawyers some of whom were recent law school graduates with liberal outlooks on social policy That the bills language did in fact mean abortion was decided with little controversy But on what constitutes prompt reporting some members of the team interpreted Congressional intent to mean within 30 days  or enough time for a woman to have one menstrual period Others argued that six months might be required for a victim of rape or incest to realize that she was pregnant and to muster enough courage to report it The 60day limit was selected because it would cover two a victims periods enough time it was deemed to determine and report pregnancy Some of the lawyers argued for longer time limit on reporting incest on the ground that its victims were likely to be too young and or too ignorant afraid to report the crime at an early stage But the differentiation between rape and incest was rejected on the ground that It was unenforceable Some of the drafters of the regulations wanted a liberal interpretation of which agencies might receive the reports rape or incest asking that any organization receiving Federal funds be so designated But Secretary Califano and others reportedly believe that such a broad definition which would allow private as well as public agencies and clinics take these reports would pave the way for widespread fraud The decision was therefore made to allow pregnant victims of incest and rape to report only to agencies of the Federal Government Some members of the team believed that the law required the Federal Government to doublecheck the certification by doctors that abortions were necessary That was rejected for several reasons including enforcement In the end few were satisfied One reason Mr Califano was so edgy about appearing before Congressional committees department official said is that he feared that the regulations may have been too liberal an interpretation of the law Proponents of a more forthcoming approach to Federal funding called the regulations unconscionably restrictive Senator Edward W Brooke said they established a more humane national policy Representative Henry J Hyde said he would have prefered a reporting requirement of no later than seven days Drafting the regulations one official asserted was nowin proposition
Abortion Is a Major Form of Birth Control in Japan,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/05/archives/abortion-is-a-major-form-of-birth-control-in-japan-a-growing.html,TOKYO Feb 4Last month Dr Shiro Sugiyama delivered 40 babies in his modern medical clinic here During the same period he performed 80 abortions The two figures which are not startling in Japan illustrate a facet of health care here that is little known overseas At a time when an emotional abortion controversy rages in the United States Japan is marking the 30th anniversary of its liberal abortion law One result is that abortions have become an accepted integral part of Japans birthcontrol efforts so much so that many married women have had two or three abortions while other women may have had 10 or more In terms of our long abortion experience and technique said Dr Sugiyama who agreed to an interview to help promote discussion of the issue Japan a developed country and the United States is still a developing country But the widespread reliance on abortions is of growing concern among medical experts including Dr Sugiyama not least because of the lowered value seems to place on human life and the overall ignorance of modern contraceptive methods that it reveals The laws advantages as cited in series of interviews with officials administrators doctors and patients are still viewed as outweighing the negative factors in terms of providing total qualified medical care and holding Japans annual population growth to around 1 percent In 1976 the last year for which figures are available Japan registered 1832617 live births and 664106 reported abortions But health experts agree that for bureaucratic and tax reasons probably only half the actual abortions are officially reported These developments are a result of combination of historical cultural legal and administrative factors in this traditionbound island nation of 113 million people These factors Include a lack of religious restraints against abortion a prohibition against use of the pill for birth control purposes and at least during the early postwar years strong economic pressures to curb family growth Over the centuries economic concerns have been a powerful social deterrent to large families During the countrys feudal era which lasted until 1868 the Japanese especially in the poorer countryside practiced infanticide  called mabiki literally thinning outas kind of expostfacto birth control But under military governments in this century birth control and especially abortion were banned in the interests of producing new soldiers But in the social chaos of a devastated Japan after its surrender in 1945 the shortage of jobs and food combined to inhibit family growth severely As one reflection of this need the Eugenic Protection Law of 1948 permitted abortions under greatly broadened criteria These included rape mental illness hereditary disease and leprosy Most important the law permits abortion through the 24th week of pregnancy for a mother whose health may be affected seriously by the continuation of pregnancy or by delivery from the physical or economic viewpoint The most frequent reason for abortions doctors report is the existence of two or three children already a reason not recognized by the Health and Welfare Ministry but one that most doctors accept under a broader definition of the mothers health Of the abortion totals reported 997 percent are in this catege ry The typical patient is a married woman between the ages of 24 and 35 in her second month of pregnancy In Japan teenagers account for only 2 percent of abortions Some doctors charge as little as 100 for an abortion a small sum in this affluent miadleclass nation where students have taken collections for a pregnarrc classmates abortion If the mothers physical health is the reason for the abortion it can be covered by nationalhealth insurance but this requires revealing the womans identity There is no other government financial aid available for abortions although a woman would qualify for child aid from the government after the birth
Provincial Struggle Is a Prelude to National Elections This Year and 1979 Referendum,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/05/archives/quebec-separatists-face-a-new-challenger.html,MONTREAL Dispersed discredited and leaderless the forces arrayed against the Quebec Governments drive make the province a sovereign Frenchspeaking nation have been ineffectual over the past 14 months Even Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and his Federal Liberal Party Government have been unable to achieve a national concensus an answer to the separatist challenge But last week there were signs that the Parti Quebecois which governs Quebec in for a tougher fight particularly from the provincial Liberal Party which is about to choose a new leader The most prob able choice is Claude Ryan like Premier Rene Levesque before he entered politics a respected journalist but unlike the Premier one who espouses the Federal cause The opposition in Quebec to the provincial governments drive for independence from the rest of Canada is gaining strength and the ramifications of that are likely to be felt throughout the country in what seems certain to be a year intense politicking including a national election and the prelude to a crucial 1979 referendum in Quebec Canadas only province with a Frenchspeaking majority has been at the center of a national crisis since Nov 15 1976 when the proindependence Parti QuebeCois led by Mr Levesque was unexpectedly thrust into power over the decaying body of the Quebec Liberal Party The Parti Quebecois will not be directly involved in the Federal elections being a strictly provincial party But if the national Liberals make unity the main issue then Mr Levesque has warned that he will not remain aloof It is in Quebec that the national Liberals have their main strength and the Quebec Government says it will not sit back and be attacked without offering an answer This is all the more true because the Parti Quebecois has prepare voters for a promised referendum on the partys proposal for sovereignty linked with a new association with the rest of Canada The most frequently mentioned date for the vote is the spring of next year The Quebec Governments campaign is expected to have as its most important feature the publication soon of a detailed proposal on association To face up to the Parti Quebecois offensive a coordinallrig committee has been set up to bring some coherence into the opposition campaign Probably more important however the rejuvenation of the Liberal Party of Quebec whichis fndependent of the Federal party to culminate in a special leadership convention in April Two candidates are running at the moment but the odds favor a man who may be able to revive the Liberals and provide formidible competition to Premier Levesque who has had the political stage more or less to himself up to now That man is Mr Ryan who has quit the editorship of Le Deyoir of Montreal to plunge into party politics   A man of firm even austere principles and lifestyle Mr Ryan is no runofthemill politician He has a strong mission ary spirit and believes that in this case his mission is to save the Canadian Federation by revamping it considerably To achieve a more balanced distribution of economic wealth and political power Mr Ryan proposes the reorganization of the 10 provinces into five regions One region would group the four small and chronically depressed Maritime provinces where old colonial boundaries mean little in the 20th century tiny Prince Edward Island for example is a sort of Canadian Rhode Island far outweighed in population resources and political clout by its larger neighbors The second region would correspond to Quebec a third to Ontario the fourth would group the prairie provinces of Manitoba Saskachawan and Alberta and the fifth would cover British Columbia But provincial jealousies may arouse as much opposition as Quebecs proposals for sovereignty and association Mr Ryans ideas at any rate do not coincide with those of Mr Trudeau but the Parti Quebecois would at least find it difficult to attack him as someone who simply seeks to preserve the status quo Mr Ryans only competition is Raymond Garncau Minister of Finance in the defeated Liberal Government   All of this will be important in Quebec but it could also have considerable effect on the national elections which are expected no later than June Mr Trudeau in power for 10 yeais is expected to fight his electoral battle primarily on the unityissue in the hope that the electorate will forget momentarily Canadas economic troubles For a while after the Quebec election Mr Trudeaus stock which had been rather low began to rise as Canadians perceived him to be the man best equipped to deal with the suddenly intensified threat to the Canadian federation But toward end of 1977 steadily worsen ing unemployment and inflation began to tell and Mr Trudeau has had to witness the last few polls whittle down his lead again and give hope to Joseph Clark and his Conservative Party The thinking now in influential Liberal circles that Mr Trudeau should call an election while still ahead  Mr Trudeau has apparently not been particularly hurt by continuing revelations of the illegal acts by the Royal Cana dian Mounted Police over which the Government appears have had little control Most Canadians seem tolerant of such acts as long as they are not directly affected Nor is a per sonal scandal whose revelation forced the resignation Francis Fox the Federal Solicitor General likely to affect the political balance Public tolerance also seems to extend the young politician who after weeks of fending off attacks on the Mounties had to acknowledge that a few years ago he had had an affair with a married woman and when she became pregnant forged her husbands name to admission papers at an Ontario hospital where she had an abortion If Mr Ryan does become the Quebec Liberal leader his presence may help to reduce some of the confusion among the Federalists and lessen the potential for confrontation that has arisen from two recent events in Quebec One of those events was an announcement by Canadas biggest insurance company Sun Life Assurance of a plan move its head office from Montreal to Toronto and the other was a court decision The target was the same in both cases a language law passed last August that seeks to make Quebec as exclusively French as possible and that consequently is an important step toward promoting a sense of nationhood Sun Life has lived for more than 100 years in splendid isolation in Quebec Its overwhelmingly Englishspeaking board directors decided they could not live with the restrictions placed by the new law on the Englishspeaking community The court decision on a suit brought by three lawyers dedared unconstitutional a section of the language law provid ing fot the primacy of French in the courts and in the National Assembly The British North America Act of 1867 which serves as Canadas Constitution puts English and French on an equal footing in both institutions The two events seen illustrate a refusal by the Englishspeaking community reconcile itself to a minority status in a French Quebec either independent or Federally linked In both cases the Quebec Government has been handed ammunition with which to con tinue and amplify its campaign to persuade French Quebicers that their future can be assured only by sovereign control over their own affairs Henry Giniger is a correspondent for The New York Times based in

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/06/archives/letters-whoever-is-kind-to-the-cruel-panama-canal-flawed-arguments.html,To the Editor Of all the arguments advanced against capital punishment the most specious is that which pretends to equate the taking of life by judicial execution with the criminal act of murderer By the same lunatic logic punitive fines are simply theft and imprisonment is kidnapping Indeed since all forms of punishment are unpleasant actions which would be criminal for an individual to inflict unjustifiably on another they should all be ruled unethical Not all taking of life is murder The distinction lies in the qualifier justifiable The act of a victim killing in selfdefense is not the same as the act of a coldblooded murderer Judicial execution has always been regarded as justified and its justification cannot be swept away by disingenuous logic To fail to see the distinction between the execution of the criminal and the murder of the victim is simply to be unable to tell right from wrong and is an ingredient in the obscene inequity between our solicitude for the rights of the criminal which is indeed the responsibility of society and our neglect of the needs of the victim which is nobodys responsibility The ancient rabbis put it well Whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind The expression of societys abhorrence of a crime is an important part of judicial punishment and should not be carelessly disregarded It is an educational process Our behavior may not truly reflect our theoretical sense of values but our ethical values will eventually come to reflect the way we act Our society by treating murderers leniently has learned to take murder for granted and has accepted it as a perfectly natural accompaniment to robbery and organized financial crime The need for a firm official stand is most urgent When America has learned to abhor murder as a casual or premeditated act a more refined approach will be perfectly proper Until then the punishment should fit the crime STANLEY SHAPIRO Teaneck NJ Jan 29 1978 Jan Sawka Panama Canal Flawed Arguments To the Editor In her letter of Jan 19 Dorothy Dillon asserts that ratification of the Panama Canal treaty will undo wrong committed in the past Yet the facts which she herself cites belie that contention First of all Ms Dillon points out that Panama was detached from Colombia of which it was then a province by American diplomacy in order to get the present treaty from Panama Now it is certainly true that injustice was done here but the injustice was done to Colombia not Panama How then can it be rectified by returning the Canal Zone to Panama which never properly exercised sovereignty over it in the first place If it is to be returned to anyone it should be returned to Colombia along with the rest of Panama By what logic can anyone argue that Panama has a right to the return of the Canal Zone but Colombia does not have a right to the return of Panama Furthermore Ms Dillon makes no mention of certain other provisions in the treaty which her argument cannot justify One of them is a commitment that if a new canal is built it must be built through Panama and no other country None of the arguments for handing the zone over to Panama that our presence is offensive to the Panamanians etc can possibly justify this provision Perhaps Ms Dillon or another proponent will explain why we should limit our future options in this way for the benefit of a country whose government does not even want its obligations WILLIAM S HAMMA Brooklyn Jan 21 1978 Sexual Abstinence The Unattainable Goal To the Editor Archbishop Joseph L Bernardin OpEd Jan 22 writing on Abortion and TeenAge Pregnancy states that more and better contraception   is a cheap solution that will not work    He proposes that more education of teenagers indoctrination if you will is needed ie that teenagers should refrain from sexual activity in order to achieve among other desired goals stability in marital relationships and a sense of obligation toward other persons Archbishop Bernadin is as unqualified to offer such advice as is a nonswimmer to teach a course in swimming In advocating celibacy as an alternative to contraception and abortion he displays a total ignorance of the intensity of the sex urge particularly in teenagers A celibate priest may be able to subdue or even to suppress these basic needs through indoctrination and piety but teenagers Never The quaint notion that education in contraceptive techniques will motivate young people to precocious sexual activity is absurd The lack of such education has never been a deterrent to sexual expression on the part of adolescents If we are to reduce the need for abortion the realistic goal must be more available information about contraception not the unattainable coal of abstinence DONALD R WEISMAN MD New York Jan 23 1978 Lifesaver To the Editor Americas zero weather reminds us of what Mark Twain wrote a friend under similar conditions If the thermometer had been a little longer I would have frozen to death CYRIL CLEMENS Editor Mark Twain Journal Kirkwood Mo Jan 26 1978 Of Hunters NonHunters and the New Conservation Ethic To the Editor It is always a pleasure to read a letter from George Reiger Jan 11 who is one of the most literate and persuasive defenders of the recreational hunting ethic in the country But the sad truth is that he is defending a constituency that is increasingly unworthy of his support It is true wildlife conservation in America obtained its initial impetus from the hunting community The modern ecosystemorientedas opposed to gamespeciesorientedconservation ethic is a new one whose scientific principles were not known at the beginning of the present century Theodore Roosevelt Gifford Pinchot and their brethren were both hunters and conservation leaders but they have been in their graves a long time now and the conservation banner has been progressively assumed since their time by modern nonconsumptive ecologically sophisticated biologists The hunting movement on the other hand has undergone a sad degeneration the relatively few sophistated and conscientious hunters left defending their sport as if it were entirely in the hands of people like themselves ignoring the extensive penetration of their ranks by louts in pickup trucks who shoot everything from bald eagles to basking turtles and leave the woods littered with beer cans and other trash Small wonder then that nonhunters rapidly become polarized into antihunters While it may be true that hunters money supports a great many conservation activities the bulk of this money is extracted in the form of spe cial fees and taxes rather than donated freely It is noteworthy that a signifi cant part of the nonhunting conservationist community is now expressing itself as willing to be equally taxed on outdoor recreational and birdwatching equipment even though this money will be used to promote overall conversation rather than specifically to offset any environmental stress that their own activites have caused Hunters on the other hand realize that they must support some kind of conservation simply to reverse the consumptive inroads they themselves make into animal populations As a pragmatic conservationist I do not welcome the growing rift between hunters and nonhunters But I see as inevitable since the two groups have a different ethic and different goals and it is only by occasional coincidence that they speak with the same voice on conservation issues these days The conscientious hunter today would be well advised to look around at his comradesinarms and ask himself if these are really the people he wishes to associate with philosophically The new ethic that it is morally wrong to killor even accidentally to inflict agonizing pain onwildlife for purposes of recreation is a persuasive one now held by a growing majority of Americans and to deny it is both to fight the winds of change and to turn ones back on ones con science PETER C H PRITCHARD Vice President Science and Research Florida Audubon Society Maitland Fla Jan 25 1978 Sri Lanka Our Invisible Aid To the Editor In the course of a recent visit to Sri Lanka Ceylon I had an opportunity to discuss with several knowledgeable Sinhalese citizens our Governments assistance program in this small democratic nation The Sri Lanka public is generally unaware of assistance rendered by the United States which has consisted primarily of lowcost loans and grants to finance food and other consumer goods imports This contrasts sharply with some aspects of aid provided by both the USSR and the Peoples Republic of China For instance the Bandaranaike Mememorial Hall named for the prime minister who was assassinated in 1959 was a present from the Chinese Government It is reputedly the finest conference complex in the Far East source of national pride and a constant reminder to the Sinhalese public as well as to foreign visitors of Chinese assistance Or there is the large impressive statue of D S Semanayake father of the modern state of Sri Lanka contributed by the USSR It is beautifully displayed in a small park in front of the National Assembly and local people proudly point it out There is no comparable public evidence of American assistance It will be argued that public display should not be a criterion for foreign aid but unfortunately some if it seems necessary in a world of superpower ideological rivalry My Sinhalese friends suggested several projects for consideration by our aid officials that not only are in the national interest of their country but would meet criticism of our present assistance program One is to assist the Sri Lanka Government in setting up and operating a showcase national youth training program and center for unemployed young people It was suggested that it be located between the international airport and the city of Colombo so it would have public visibility Youth unemployment particularly among educated young men and women is a major national problem of explosive potential Another project suggested is to provide help to Sri Lanka in realizing its freetrade zone in Colombo a highpriority plan of considerable economic significance in the nations struggle against poverty There were other suggestions but the foregoing illustrate an altered approach in our aid to this country which all of us hope will remain within the shrinking ranks of the democratic nations GORDON B HALSTEAD Stuart Fla Jan 27 1978 Snowplow Bargains To the Editor During the recent snow emerency in New York Mayor Koch and the various officials connected with the Sanitation Department indicated that they were working under extreme hardships because of the poor condition of their equipment and the fact that much of it was obsolete and little money was available for replacement The construction of the Alaskan pipeline is now complete and it has been indicated in various trade magazines that there is a tremendous surplus of good used equipment which is expected to flood the market and thus hurt sales of new equipment Perhaps the City of New York might make some arrangements to purchase this modern equipment at a substantially lower cost than new equipment
Leiters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/08/archives/letters-us-criminal-code-pitfalls-in-a-reform-bill-matches-for-the.html,To the Editor Reforms of our freakish and unfair sentencing system are long overdue as Judge Marvin E Frankel pointed out in a recent OpEd article Unfortunately the vehicle of reform could turn out to be more dangerous than the outdated model it would replace The sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code reform legislation now pending before the House Judiciary Committee have the potential for putting people behind bars for longer periods of time than is the case under existing law While this possibility was somewhat reduced last week by Senate amendments to the bill the danger of longer sentences is still acute in HR 6S69 the version pending in the House For eiample S1437 would permit a Federal judge to send a person to prison for the entire length of a sentence and the maximum permissible sentence could be considerably longer than the time actually served for comparable offense today These two factors alone could serve to increase the prison population at a time when our prisons are already severely overcrowded An additional factorthe bills sharp reduction of the availability of time off for good time served in prisoncould hasten this unfortunate and presumably unintended result A second major problem in the Criminal Code bill is that it would for the first time permit prosecutors to appeal sentences that they regard as too lenient This provision is unsound public policy Sentences are already too long The average sentence length for Federal offenders is now 455 months giving the United States the largest per capita imprisonment rate and the longest average sentences of anyWestern industrialized nation except South Africa A third problem is that while the bill would eliminate some of the existing disparities in sentencing it could permit considerable unfairness to continue For example judges could consider a variety of personal factors in selecting a particular sentence to be imposed including the history and characteristics of defendants and their need for educational and vocational training Accordingly an impover  ished or uneducated defendant could receive a substantially different sentence from one who is wealthy and skilled Finally the legislation would do little to encourage greater use of alternatives to incarceration To reflect growing consensus that prisonexperience rarely if ever rehabilitates a person the bill should provide a broader range of less costly prison alternatives such as community supervision and community service and should require judges to consider every alternative before imprisoning a person It is true as Judge Frankel notes that the Criminal Code bill would provide for greater certainty and less disparity in sentencing But it would be a mistake for Congress to link these and other important reforms to a potential for longer sentences rand overpopulated prisons The fair and humane system envisioned by Judge Frankel should be brought into effect through a revision of HR 6869 To the Editor I know all insurance premiums are going upand I put Defense Secretary Browns call for a 173 billion Pentagon budget by 1983 in the same categorybut giving his generals so many matches to play with can cause the very accidents we want to prevent Now I know why Ive been getting so many scare stories out of Washington these past months The Russians are still coming Its becoming boring To the Editor When the ancient Romans wanted to be sure that conquered Carthage would never rise again they destroyed their land by sowing salt all over it Why oh why are our highway depart ments still sowing salt To the Editor Secretary Califanos plea for direct help to the poor as reported in The Times of Jan 24 raises an issue worthy of nationardebate The problem of urban blight requires both strategies to rebuild major metropolitan centers which benefit the country as whole and direct aid to the poor in these cities Unfortunately our intergovernmental system encourages the concentration of poverty in our cities But when aid to alleviate poverty is directed toward the cities and other local governmental units Secretary Califano is right in asserting that politics will undermine adequate aid programs Some preliminary research that have been doing comparing several national educational programs indicates that higher education programs direct ed at poverty individuals have been considerably more effective and expansive than Title I of the ESEA Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 which while nominally directed at poverty youngsters is funneled through existing local governmental units in this case local school systems Given our present national legislative system direct payments seem to be a better targeting device than aid programs directed at state and local governmental units When the gains and losses of particulargovernmental units are salient and precisely calculable large cities and populous states do not fare well To the Editor I have agreed with letters to The Times I have disagreed with letters to The Times I have been delighted by them and offended by thembut never before have I been terrified by one The terrifying letter Jan 29 is by Gary Potter president Catholics for Christian Political Action in which he claims his and his organizations right and duty to take over the world The last time that the world was confronted with a selfappointed master race selfimbued with the right to take over the world in the name of its leader they were the Nazis and their leader was Hitler To the Editor Lawrence Laders recent OpEd article on Abortion Opponents Tactics is a mean smear against millions of Americans deeply opposed to abortion on demand including this US Senator This obvious effort to link the growing antiaboftion movement in America to the Catholic Church and the right wing is a gross distortiOn of the political realities of the abortion situation in this country today To label the abortion issue as solely Catholic concern first of all overlooks simple basic facts for example many of the outspoken opponents of abortion in Congress such as myself and such fellow Senators as Orrin Hatch Mark Hatfield and Jesse Helms nonCatholics President Carter himself and his wife Rosalynn have taken strong and unequivocal stands on the morality of abortion and this can hardly be attributed as Mr Lader implies to one or two meetings of the leadership of the Catholic bishops of America in the White House with a Baptist President The second charge of the rightwing influence is even more distorted Many Representatives and Senators with varying positions on the political spectrum oppose abortion as I do Senators Biden Durkin and Eagleton are just some who come to mind who have consistently joined me in opposing Federal funding of abortion yet could hardly be categorized as rightwingers The Catholic Church in America on the basis of most social issues could also hardly be called rightwing witness its recent testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee favoring the Panama Canal Treaty The simplistic and sweeping conclusions in Mr Laders article lend little to the great abortion debate going on in America today as a consequence of the socalled Hyde Amendment restriction on Medicaid abortions and the original January 1973 US Supreme Court opinions The abortion issue which goes to the very basic human right the right to life deserves more and better discourse than provided by Mr Laders pen We here in the Congress faced with this great and moving political issue are illserved by such rhetoric and debate To the Editor Recent discussions of whether there Is reason to be concerned about democracy in Germany Frederick Weibgens Jan 17 OpEd article and the Jan 30 letter by Prof Heinrich August Winkler reveal widely differing views For some the country is In the throes of semifascist authoritarianism according to others democracy was never safer in Germany Perhaps the truth is in the middle Those who assert that Germany is turning fascist are plain wrong In this respect Bonn is not Weimar This is owing above all to a firm democratic commitment of German workers Communism having become insignificant and to a more stable system of moderate parties and ensuing government stability Attempts to form neoNazi party have failed conspicuously But certain recent events give rise to concern Two examples Herbert Kappler a war criminal convicted in Italy for his role in the massacre as hostages of some 300 Italian women and children had escaped from his Rome prison with the aid of his wife After his return to his home city there was a spontaneous outburst of sympathy on the part of the public His house was literally swamped with flowers there were congratulatory messages from all over a small group of protesters were hounded while counterdemonstration of blackuniformed sympathizers was welcomed What disturbs  me is not that the German Government failed to extradite Kappler there was no constitutional way of doing that but the attitude pattern the general atmosphere revealed by the incident Of late there have been repeated street demonstrations in cities like Hamburg and Hanover by blackuniformed gangs threatening Jews giving the Hitler salute shouting Heil Germany without police interference Again the facts are perhaps less disturbing than the indifference of the public and the unconcern of the authorities The latters usual excuse for doing nothing is to the effect that these are excesses of small groups of psychopaths presenting no danger to democracy To one who like me remembers the 1920s this is frightening At that time too small gangs of uniformed toughs led by one Adolf Hitler were ridiculed as little gangs of crazies In this respect Bonn does begin to look like Weimar the same bias against anything leftist while rightist trends are played down Vestigia terrent To the Editor Professor Winklers letter with regard to the connection between the intellectual absolutism of the extreme left in Germany today and the absolutist tradition that culminated in Nazism was quite cogent There is another link between the terrorist groups and the Nazis that might also be mentioned namely virulent antiSemitism Hitler found a friend in the Grand Mufti the current groups find their allies among the extremist Arabs who still look forward to pushing Israel into the sea According to Frederick Weibgen the terrorists were driven by their parents antiSemitism among other factors to a total revulsion against the system but isnt it strange that this revulsion should bind them closely to the Munich Olympics killers instead of to their victims
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/09/archives/letters-first-amendment-issues-soap-sagas-adults-rights.html,To THE HOME SECTION Susan Jacoby [Hers Jan 26] muddles a serious First Amendment question in an interesting fashion She complains that those who call her a First Amendment junkie ask her about kiddie porn which she insists is not a First Amendment question at all since the responsible adultsparents and producers  should be prosecuted Obviously the parent who films the dismemberment or sexual abuse of his 8yearold child is going to be prosecuted IF we locate him and IF he is within our legal boundaries but what about the film itself Is it protected by the First Amendment and so can it be shown to interested viewers in some 42d Street theater or simply sold for home viewing so long as the ads dont offend the passerby In which case I am sure some enterprising film makers can locate some impoverished country with more relaxed law  enforcement standards where such films can be turned out endlessly to delight the drearier members of our society Who cares so long as the kids are foreigners That very simply is the possibility the First Amendment junkie is apparently prepared to accept lest some real work of art be censored tomorrow So long as such people insist we have no other alternatives they may find a lot of us will vote to protect the children and let the artist take his chances Weston Conn To THE HOME SECTION My compliments to Susan Jacoby on her most persuasive and insightful column with respect to the role of the feminist movement in the current antipornography campaign I respectfully submit that even she has neglected a most important source of a balanced and judicious treatment of the subject of regulating pornography It has been eight years since the publication of The Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography Unfortunately soon after the issuance of the report it was ignored by the press the public and our elected representatives The commission did however formulate model state laws which in striking a fair balance between the competing interests involved set forth a reasonable and constitutional means of protecting the public from the intrusion of unwanted materials into their private lives all is a victimless crime The issue of kiddie porn is a mere smokescreen and there are adequate laws if enforced to protect the abuse of children by their parents and others Manhattan To THE HOME SECTION A sympathetic sigh to a kindred spirit SoapSliver Saver Sandra Clark [Saving Soap Slivers Before They Go Down the Drain Fab 21 But prior to the bleak throwaway period and the new soap mold there hung in my kitchen a small plastic gadget a little cage as it were that opened up attached to a handle Into the cage went the slivers to he swished around in hot water into soap suds Id give at least a dollar today for such a simple soapsliver swisher To THE HOME SECTION I cannot understand why Sandra Clark has such a problem using up her soap slivers The obvious way is to wet the sliver thoroughly wet a fresh cake thoroughly and slap the two together Let this dry for a few hours and you have it No mess no fuss no jelly and you are using up all the soap as A was intended to be used The pieces really stick together improving with use Furthermore To THE HOME SECTION You mean my mother isnt the only one who washes plastic bags I thought we had an oddity in our family And I was the one assigned to dry themone towel inside and one to pat the outside we dont have a clothesline Now that Im keeping my own home Ive broken away from the plastic bag syndrome I just save corks To THE HOME SECTION Following a classic pattern of selective pseudo civil libertarianism Susan Jacoby [Hers Feb 2] indicates the right of some people to form childfree communities [is not] to be tolerated They may have got away with not having kids of their own but by golly shell see that they dont get away from everyone elses Rights are not something that belong to only those people who do not offend our own personal sensibilities While I personally despise those who would seek to prevent women from obtaining abortions that does not mean I have the right to force such people to help pay for something they consider mur der If Miss Jacoby despises those who prefer adult company that is her right But she has no right to punish them for their way of life by forcing them to finance her own beliefs Further information on the position of childfree persons in our society is available from The National Organization for Nonparents 3 North Liberty Street Baltimore Md 21201 To THE HOME SECTION As a mother of a small baby I resent the attitudes of people who insist upon no children but I was half of young couple a year ago and I felt the same way then I would no more choose to live now in a neighborhood of only young families than I chose to live only with young couples or only with singles when I was single How boring to see only rflections of ourselves in our neighbors If I never had children of my own I would feel deprived not to have a chance to know Children are messy and noisyand full of wonder at a world in which everything is fresh and exciting to them Who loses most by segregation To THE HOME SECTION Once again Susan Jacobys legitimate criticisms have been weakened by her blatant emotionalism in her column on adults only attitudes Even though 1 agree with much of what she has to say about this generations concern for the next I could not help but he angered and disgusted by her maudlin closing remarks Just who is she to define and judge others lifestyles
Art People,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/10/archives/art-people-look-whos-at-the-whitney.html,THEIR pants bag their bellies bulge their dresses sag their curlers show They have flab moles wrinkles varicose veins thinning hair and drooping shoulders They are Duane Hansons lifesize figures of American types of such hypersimilitude they make real people seem prettied up shoppers sunbathers busi nessmen construction workers repairmen porch sitters and players of solitaire And now a crowd of them29 in allhas come to haunt the fourthfloor galleries of the Whitney Museum through April 16 I like to make them familiarlooking the sort of people youd find anywhere says the sculptor a slim nonHanson type with faded blue eyes and a mop of blondish hair You see the best ones in shopping centers airports KMart stores They lug shopping bags and theyre always eatingice cream pizza a piece of candy At the Whitney with the help of his wife Wesla his father Dewey and his 7yearold daughter Maja he was touching up his characters before the show opened I have an affectionate sympathy for older people and workers and housewives he explained Theyre mostly friends I know in Florida or their friends but I dont aim to reproduce them My art is not about fooling people Its the human attitudes Im afterfatigue a bit of frustration aging To me theres kind of beauty in the way they respond to all that I try to show the lives of quiet desperation that Thoreau spoke of Still some critics spurn the literalism of the Hanson figures comparing them to the stuff of wax museums The sculptor disagrees Thats pure entertainmentlookalike personalities My work is recreation not facsimile And if its antiart its antiformalist art Ive rejected that You have to manipulate formal qualities to some extent but I try to make them subservient Of Swedish extraction Mr Hanson grew up in tiny Parkers Prairie Minn where his father ran a dairy farm In 1953 with a Master of Fine Arts degree from Michigans famous Cranbrook Academy he went to Germany where he stayed for seven years teaching art to United States Army dependents There after an unsuccessful show of formalist sculpture he met a German artist George Grygo from whom he learned the technique of working in plastics Back in the United States by 1960 be looked for a new kind of expression one more in touch with people Pop art he says spurred him on especially the very daring white plaster sculpures of George Segal He was also stirred by the troubles around him In Miami where he lived the newspapers reported daily on the perils of abortions performed by unlicensed Cuban doctors In 1966 he made his first realistic piecethe stark white plaster image of a pregnant young woman covered by a shroud More socially explicit tableaux followed a student suicide grisly battlefied scene a race riot In New York the indefatigable Ivan Karp picked up on him and in 1970 Mr Hanson soloed here at the dealers OK Harris Gallery Now the sculptor who casts his figures part by part in polyvinyl acetate from live models his father has posed for a couple has progressed from social outrage through satire to his present more sympathetic worka kind of taking people as they exist with all their overindulgence and tastelessness And patting the stomach of an ample woman shopper in a wild blouse and flowered pants he said Life in America goes beyond Surrealsim We have a lot of choicesthese are people whomake the wrong ones But they have vitality and energy and they let it all hang out  If you still think of stained glass as strictly for churches Tiffany lamps or fancy architectural windows stick around The current show at the Museufn of Contemporary Crafts 29 West 53d Street through April 2 may change your mind Called New Stained Glass it presents pieces by 10 artists who work in the medium employing the traditonal colored glass with metal strips that hold it together in very djfferent ways from the old window format Giving imagination its head they use texture color figure imagery and freeform abstraction with the same reckless abandon as painters And you can hang the results on the wall Take for example Robert Kehlmanns Composition XXXI in which he scribbles with lead on a field of colored glass the lead sometimes holding the glass together sometimes applied as free line Or Richard Posners satirical Watergate allegory The Big Enchilada done in the heavily symbolic tradition of Northern Renaissance art Or Rose Window No 2 by Albinus Elskus a round pun on Chartrestype window that bears two painted replicas of a rose When you look at the work its best to drop your notions of what stained glass should be says Mr Kehlmann an enthusiastic spokesman for the new glass movement who helped assemble the show and wrote its catalogue statement You dont necessarily get the bright color contrasts or the tiny jewellike effects usually associated with the medium Youre confronted close up with texture relief and qualities of form and line that you cant see in a stainedglass window high above your head Actually Mr Kehlmann notes in the catalogue scattered examples of autonomous nonarchitectural stained glass art have appeared since the pioneer coloredglass assemblages made by the late Josef Albers in the Weimar Bauhaus Glass Workshop in the 1920s Whats new here however is that for the first time a group of glass artists are devoting themselves to the medium in some instances exclusively If much of the work in the show comes from the West Coast thats no accident considering the California crafts tradition A number of stainedglass artists have studied at the Pilchuk Glass Center in Stanwood Wash where the noted German glass designer Ludwig Schaffrath has held summer seminars And several have made the pilgrimage to Burleighfield House in Buckinghamshire England a beehive of stainedglass activity where Mr Schaffrath taught with an English designer Patrick Reyntiens Now Burleighfield House is alas closed But Mr Schaffrath and Mr Reyntiens are coming to this country for extended teaching tours and predicts Mr Kehlmann a lot more people will be getting into stained glass Heres a footnote to the 66th annual convention of the College Art Association which met in New York two weeks ago The association founded in 1912 to enhance the teaching and practice of art and art history has joined the growing movement by organizations in arts and letters to boycott states that havent ratified the Equal Rights Amendment The associations board once an overwhelmingly male precinct but now almost equally divided between men and women found to its dismay that the 1980 meeting was scheduled for New Orleans a city in one of the offending states But it could not abrogate its hotel contracts without heavy financial damage So it passed two resolutions expressing the associations regrets at the necessity of meeting in New Orleans in 1980 asking for continued negotiations to be relieved of our contracts and stating that the association would refrain from holding future conventions in states that havent ratified the amendment
A Strong Voice For the Opposition,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/12/archives/connecticut-weekly-a-strong-voice-for-the-opposition.html, I F YOU really want to talk about inequality that conference was a super example of it said Carol Lyons launching into an explanation of why she is opposing the resolutions adopted last November at the International Womens Year Conference in Houston Mrs Lyons contends that the vast majority of the issues raised in Houston are the concerns of all people not just women Opposition to the womensmovement and the goals of the International Womens Year Conference has gained a little strength in Connecticut since the November meeting Mrs Lyons said al though the opponents are not sure whether it is a reaction to the conference or to other events Mrs Lyons and other critics have also captured renewed public attention Mrs Lyons who worked as secretary for Phyllis Schlaflys affiliate group in Connecticut Stop ERA is flatly against the equalrights amendment abortion and all of the 26 resolutions passed by the womens conference After failing at the Connecticut Womens Conference in Bridgeport last summer to rally the votes to be selected as a Connecticut delegate to the Houston conference Mrs Lyons decided to at tend the conference anyway even though she could not be a participant She emphasizes that she has many in terests besides socalled womens issues but she sees the Connecticut Con servative Union for which she became legislative liaison this year as one outlet for her opinions on womens rights Mrs Lyons a manualsystems analyst at Aetna Life Insurance has had noprior experience with the Legislature and says she is unsure of what is ex pected of her in her liaison position but the experience will certainly be useful if she decides to challenge State Senator Betty Hudson in this election yearan idea she has been toying with But eyed though Mrs Lyons pegs her criticism of the International Womens Year on the contention that it distorts issues common to all people by trying to make than only womens issues she said that  would object_ if it had been a peoples conference elivering the same resolution Weye got to stop thinking the Federal Giivernment is going to solve our probleins she said She contended that the Federal Gov ernmentparticularly the Department of Health Education and Welfare had failed to7show that it Could deal effectively with the social and welfare problems of tre Country and therefore should not be entrusted with more tax dollars The Iiternational Womens Year Conference did however seek more than Governmentpaid programs A resolution on rape for example called for revisionsin the criminal codes on the Federal Arad local levels Connecticut has adopted what is considered a model revision of its rape lawsfor which Mrs Lyons gives credit to her opponentsbut she is critical of the womens conference for advocating that the same revisions 1be made elsewhere The situation that exists in the State of Conrrecticut for example concerning rape doesnt necessarily exist in any other part of the country Mrs Lyons said Asked what was different about rape in Connecticut she replied Take missouri where threequarters of the state is farm and corn and soybeans IM sure their situation on rape is  a whole lot different than ours I just think legislation to handle these things is better done on a state than Federal level Mrs Lyons does not believe that any of the recommendations by the womens conference for revisions in statutes should be implemented because more laws wont solve problems Asked ifshe was aware of discrirdination agairrst any group of people in any part of the country she replied Im not sure But if an individual thinks theyvebeen discriminated against its up to them to use the laws that we have already Mrs Lyons who lives with her husband and four sons in Madison said she did not have any counterproposals to the International Womens Year resolutions and She added that she could not think of any state or Federal laws she would like to see rescinded except for legalized abortion Oneof the things that I strongly object to personally is using excuses as a crutch she said referring to the argument thatthe womens movement is needed to open doors for people Now Ive talked to people and Ive said Open the dotoWfOr yourselves Nobody ever opened the doors for me  DIANE HENRY
Do Women's Liberationists Play a Destructive Role?,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/12/archives/westchester-opinion-do-womens-liberationists-play-a-destructive.html,NO women in history have ever enjoyed such privileges freedoms and luxuries as American women Yet a tiny mi nority of dissatisfied highly vocal militant women insist that we are being exploited as domestic drudges and pretty toys There are of course women exploited by meh Just look at the business of pornography Anyone who is really interested in the liberation of women should go after the women haters who get rich off the bodies of women Another group of men who exploit women are the fashion designers Coco Chanel before she died tried to alert women to the fact of life about womens clothes saying High fashion is losing its influence because it is in the hands of men who do not like women and whose only aim is to make them look ridiculous Annelies Lengers an Ossining resident is chairman of Westchester Hight to Life So there is enough work to do for those who want to eliminate the real exploitation of women They are 100 percent wrong however when they blame husbands and the institution of marriage At womenslib rallies the Soviet Union is proudly cited as a country where women have equal rights The women do the work and the men tell them what and how to do it They dig ditches sweep the streets and load cargo on ships They also have to take care of their families and do the shopping cleaning and cooking with little help from hubby And their children of course go into stateoperated child centers There are two very different types of women lobbying for the equalrights amendment One group consists of the womens liberationists Their motive is totally radical They hate men marriage and children They are out to destroy morality and the family They look on husbands as the exploiters children as an evil to be avoided by abortions if necessary and the family as an institution that keeps women in secondclass citizenship or even slavery If anyone doubts the radical objectives and tactics they should read their own literature such as the magazine MS More than five years ago a New York Times article frankly described the ultimate objectives of the womensliberation movement in these words To give women full participation in society they say it is necessary to overthrow the structures on which the system is founded The first things that would go would be the political institutions simply because they perpetuate the system of institutional marriage that they assert enslaves women for economic reasons Probably the most important and most emotional issue that unites the reformers with the radicals is the proposed repeal of all abortion laws Midge Decter in tier recent book called The New Chastity and Other Arguments Against Liberation concludes that the womensliberation literature is totally radical and nihilistic One of the leading experts on the equalrights amendment is Prof Paul A Freund of Harvard Law School Professor Freund writes that if we want to help women in business professional domestic and political relationship in law firms in the medical profession in the Cabinet we must turn elsewhere than to the proposed amendment He also points out that the literature of its main sponsors insist on an absolute meaning and that a doctrinaire equality is apparently the theme of the amendment And so women must be admitted to West Point on parity with men women must be conscripted for military service equally with men and girls must be eligible for the same athletic teams as boys in public schools and state universities Thus the equalrights amendment will positively make women subject the draft and for combat duty on an equal basis with men  Most womens liberationists adrriit that this is what they want Others sidestep the issue by arguing that there will be no more wars or no draft in the future The No 1 goal of the womens liberationists is in the words of Bella S Abzug to enforce the constitutional right of females to terminate pregnancies that they do not wish to continue There is no such constitutional right yet and there wont be so long as the equalrights amendment is not ratified The womens liberationists are not satisfied with this There is nothing in the Constitution or in any Federal law to assure that the Supreme Court right to abortion will be permanent The womens liberationists believe that the greatest inequality between men and women is the tact that women get pregnant and men do not We can be equal if we want to be but we can never be identical It becomes a sad state of affairs when just a small minority can dominate the majority of women who do believe family life is still the single most important human institution I like being womanprolife prochurch prochildren and all that stands for being a woman Im glad that we still have the protection of the law God help us if that should ever be taken away I was asked if I could live in a feminist world The answer to that question is no Im terribly afraid of the feminist they want to be identified as men more power to them But lets leave the rest of us alone Dont let them take away the right to be a woman
Connecticut Protests Fail to Delay U.S. Health Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/12/archives/connecticut-protests-fail-to-delay-us-health-plan-leave-us-alone.html,Over protests by hundreds of residents of Greenwich and Stamford at stormy public hearings in Connecticut there will be no delay in the filing of a controversial federally initiated health reorganization plan for the area due to be placed before the Boston regional office of the Department of Health Education and Welfare tomorrow The rejection of any delay came on Thursday even though there was direct intervention by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr and Representative Stewart B McKinney both of Connecticut who wrote letters to the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Joseph A Califano Jr urging him to allow a 90day extension thus insuring that the concerns of inter ested groups would not go unheeded In rejecting the plea Secretary Califanc said When we were granted the authority to allow extensions they were only in instances in which unusual circumstances prevailed They do not appear to be present in this situation Representative McKinney immediately called this reply inadequate and a serious misinterpretation of the law Shouting Leave us alonewe want no Federal interference in our affairs hundreds of people packed four public hearings held in Bridgeport Norwalk Greenwich and Stamford during the last two weeks denouncing the plan The most sensitive issues involved are proposals for cutbacks in the number of local hospital beds consolidation of services in the GreenwichStamford area and a proliferation of Medicaid  supported abortion clinics Dindy Harris speaking for the Fairfield County Medical Association which together with Greenwich Hospital and neighborhood groups has mounted an advertising campaign urging people to protest said This is a very sophisticated part of the country We dont like the Government coming in and telling us what to do Or how to run our hospitals The plan drawn up by the federally sponsored Southwest Connecticut Health Systems Agency is the result of an 18month study by a task force of 250 local people recommending ways of making health care more costefficient and more responsive In the 14 shoreline communities from Greenwich to Stratford which this plan covers taxpayer and business groups have spoken out particularly against the potentially high cost of proposals for new neighborhood health clinics overall extension of insurance benefits to the needy and a whole range of new programs in preventive education Prolife factions and church groups oppose the use of taxpayer dollars for abortion clinics Private practitioners fear the loss of their traditional independence The voluntary hospitals maintain that the Federal Government has no business in the affairs of facilities built and maintained by private funds Voicing the opinions of many at these hearings Gene Wilhelm speaking for the Greenwich Public Schools Association said Greenwich parents are dismayed that the pediatric and obstetrical units at Greenwich Hospital might be closed and their hospitals become part of the Stamford area Though the plea for delay has now been turned down certain lastminute modifications were agreed upon at the meeting of the agencys 30member board of directors in Norwalk on Thursday night They include provisions for detailed feasibility studies cost analyses and close regard to community acceptability before any future actions are taken familiarizing all women attending familyplanning clinics with the prolife point of view and finally asuring that the potential cost be carefully evaluated before implementing any proposals to further extend reimbursement to the poor
INTERVIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/12/archives/connecticut-weekly-interview-after-houston-a-fight-at-home.html,ONNECTICUT fortu c nately is really way ahead on womens issues said State Senator Betty Hudson a leading feminist in the state who will be trying to get some of the most controversial proposals from the International Womens Year Conference through the Legislature this session Senator Hudson said that Connecticut legislation and programs dealing with battered women rape child abuse and job discrimination are exceptional compared to many other parts of the country although some of the programs need more financing and further implementation to achieve the conferences goals The hottest issue before the Houston conference legalized abortion will also be a highly controversial issue before the Legislature this session ifas Senator Hudson firmly expectsthe subject reaches the floors of both Houses for a vote Because it is an election year most legislators will probably try to avoid any commitment on abortion Senator Hudson however claims she has the votes to get out of committee and force vote on a bill seeking state financing for abortions for poor women I think weve got a shot at it said Senator Hudson because the issue is not now and never has been abortion It happens to be legal for all women The Supreme Court decided that issue The question is equal access to health care The fate of this and other bills will be the true test of the effectiveness of the Houston conference Senator Hudson said Its too early to assess the impact of IWY she Hudson said Nobody is going to do a 180degree turn because of IWY People dont act that way not legislators not the public Its more subtle Senator Hudson makes no effort to restrain her frustration with those who oppose her efforts I really get ticked off when they are given equal time she paid They dont have any track record for doing anything for women or any body We have all the facts They have all the myths Senator Hudson does not think that laws are the answer to all social problems Im not of the opinion that somehow all you need is a law to solve a problem she said Clearly civilrights legislation is an example of the ineffectiveness of the law alone This is not to say we dont need laws thats the foot in the door But youve got to change attitudes Senator Hudson said there are other things that can be done to implement conference goals For example she noted that some businesses in the state are already experimenting with flexihoursan aid to women with families She added that the Houston conferences call for more women in government is not a priority issue here since the state is ahead of the national average of participation by women in government with about 20 percent of the legislators being female compared to 9 percent around the country But Senator Hudson cochairman of the Human Services Committee does have a 2million plan on family planning and health care for the state which focuses on many of the conference goals including a childcare program for lowincome working poor It would also include 250000 in grants for those communities that elect to have family planning education in the schools In another proposal responsive to the conference goals Mrs Hudson will be introducing legislation mandating stricter control of sterilization procedures She also wants a bill on contract compliance Under this proposal the state would refuse to let any contracts without a jobdiscrimination clause mandating that a certain number of women be employed by the company or perhaps that it promise to employ more women Since her committee would not be responsible for labor laws contract compliance is probably Mrs Hudsons highest and most distant hurdle Her list of initiatives for women sometimes seems endlessfrom a desire to see more women prosecutors to bettering the tipping system for waitresses through the minimum wage laws She has tried and failed in previous sessions on some of these issues but she remains an unwavering optimist Weve got a lot of successes she said Well have more
"With Taxes Due, The Tangle Thickens",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/12/archives/long-island-opinion-with-taxes-due-the-tangle-thickens-politics.html,NELSON A ROCKEFELLER had the South Mall state office building project in Albany as governmental albatross and John V N Klein the Suffolk County Executive has the Southwest Sewer District The similarities between the two massive projects have been striking to several politicians even if Mr Klein may not appreciate the comparison Both the mall and the district have been plagued by controversy criticism inflated prices and construction delays that seem to make the projects neverending Theyre still putting the finishing touches on the mall and its likely to be years before the last sewer pipe is connected in the Southwest Sewer District H Lee Dennison was the Suffolk County Executive and John Klein was chairman of the Board of Supervisors in 1969 when the sewer district was approved in a referendum The sewers had been proposed when detergents and other pollutants turned up in the water supply in the area where the water table is close to the surface But now that the first taxes are being levied its Mr Kleins baby even though the initial links of the sewer district arent scheduled to go into operation until later this year at the earliest The anger over the impending tax bills has been escalated by charges that the initial sewer linkups wont be ready in the second half of this year although the taxing will begin then Mr Klein is the target of charges that he is breaking a commitment not to impose the taxes until the sewers are in operation The sewer taxes an additional 60 cents per 100 of assessed valuation every year atop already heavy realestate taxes are likely to cost the average homeowner about 300 a year according to Islip Town Councilman James J Mackey Mr Mackey lives in the sewer district and has become somewhat of an expert on its problems In fact he predicted many of them His assessment does not include oneshot hookup charges which two years ago were estimated at 20 a foot between the street sewer and a house and now Mr Mackey says could run to 1000 for a homeowner depending on location and problems encountered Even churches hospitals and other nonprofit institutions which usually dont pay realestate taxes are faced with major sewertax assessments Southside Hospital in Bay Shore for example is expected to be assessed 120000 annually Prospects of these taxes and charges have touched off one of the most bitter political furors in the county with Republicans as well as Democrats lashing out at Mr Klein and the project although the County Executive noted that all of the assessments had been predicted publicly when the voters in the sewer district narrowly approved the project The sewer district covers the area south of the Southern State Parkway from Heckscher State Park westward to the Nassau County border with northward salients taking in the State University at Farmingdale and the Central Islip State Hospital The political implications of the sewer district are obvious Faced with irate residents at several meetings the Republican Supervisors of Islip and BabylonPeter F Cohalan and Raymond Ailmendinger respectivelythreatened to withhold from the county any sewer taxes collected this year because of what they contended were misrepresentations by county officials that the taxes would begin only when the sewers were hooked up However the county needs the taxes this year to begin paying off sewer bonds whether or not the sewers are operational Mr Klein is obviously concerned about the political fallout and its possible effect on his expected reelection attempt next year Islip and Babylon are key areas in putting together Republican majorities in the county and even before the sewer controversy the GOP leadership of these towns was not particularly close to Mr Klein a product of the oncedominant alliance between Smithtown and East End Republican organizations The County Executive said in an interview that he hoped Federal revenuesharing funds could be diverted to reduce the sewer assessments for homeowners He estimated that if half the 12 million in Federal revenuesharing funds due the county this year were earmarked for the sewer district the assessment could be dropped onethird to 40 cents per 100 annually Federal and state aid have already played a major role in preventing a fiscal disaster as the cost of the project has inflated from 291 million to 640 million Federal and state funds have made up the difference so that the original estimated assessments on homeowners have remained at 60 cents per 100 rather than possibly tripling Mr Klein who had earlier resisted any countywide responsibility for the sewerdistrict finances conceded that the county has an obligation to provide some assistance Asked about the political implications he said that there would be relief to the point where will not be a serious problem The key will be to persuade as many legislators as possible Democrats as well as Republicans to become involved in the sewerdistrict problem with Mr Klein Only five of the 18 county legislators come from within the sewer district so Mr Klein will have to convince some legislators outside the district to go along with the diversion of Federal funds to the homeowners in the district He said that he had spoken to GOP party leaders in an effort to win their support Is he putting pressure on the Republican county leaders I wouldnt tell you if I did he said with a laugh Democrats might be another story Dr Martin J Feldman the Dix Hills dentist and county legislator who hopes to be Mr Kleins opponent next year has entered the fray by virtue of his recent appointment to the Legislatures Environmental Affairs Committee the committee concerned with any sewer legislation They figured theyd put me in the lions den with John Klein Dr Feldman said of the Republican majority that parceled out the committee assignments Dr Feldman has repeatedly referred to Mr Klein as the father of this financial abortion In perhaps a preview of next years County Executive contest Dr Feldman has accused Mr Klein of stealing his idea of diverting Federal funds for the district and has charged that interest charges on the sewer bonds are nearly double what they should be because of shortterm rather than longterm borrowing by Mr Klein But the political volatility of the controversy was evident when Dr Feldman himself was heavily criticized by fellow Democratic legislator Robert J Mrazek of Centerport who has been the leading critic of the sewer district ever since he was elected to the Legislature in 1975 Mr Mrazek who was removed from the Environmental Affairs Committee presumably in retribution for his attacks on the sewer project chided Dr Feldman How can legislators who basically kept their mouths shut over the last seven years say a thing about John Klein  Mr Mrazek who has made enemies of almost all his colleagues with his criticism of their lack of action on the sewer district until recently said that it was hypocritical to try to pin the thing on John Klein Obviously the voters will be hearing a lot about sewers in the next year or two Will there be any other sewer projects when the southwest district is completed Mr Klein groaned To say that was unlikely would be the understatement of the month  Bruning

nominee ranged through half a dozen popular Third Avenue restaurants during the early afternoon grasping the hands of sometimes startled brunch customers who were deep into Bloody Marys and eggs Benedict Mr Green her Republican opponent approached strollers in Tudor City and along  Second Avenue pressing leaflets into their hands and urging them to turn out for the special election tomorrow Earlier in one of their comparatively few direct confrontations the candidates debated on the WNBC Here and Now television program where they were joined by two other candidates for the seatHoward Lim Jr running on the Conservative line and Paul Gallagher of the Labor Party As in their earlier  meetings Mrs Abzug sought to stress her previous six years in the House of Representatives while Mr Green argued that his four yearsas a State Assemblyman and seven years as the New York regional administrator for Federal housing programs had given him abetter background for Congressional service They clashed angrily at only one point when Mrs Abzug flourished a greencolored leaflet distributed in the 18th District attacking her stands on such issues as job rights for homosexuals liberalized abortions and opposition to the Vietnam war Challenged by Mrs Abzug to disavow the leaflet Mr Green said he had never seen it and pointed out that the issuer the Council for Community Consciousness had not urged his election over Mrs Abzug A spokesman for the council Henry Malliet later confitinedthat the organizations only position was that Mrs Abzug should be defeated He said Mr Green had ignored an invitation by the council to present his stand on the matters it considered important Few Differences Expressed In discussing the major issues in the campaign the two main candidates displayed little difference in point of view Both are for welfare revision including a Federaltakeover of the payments made by New York and other cities Both favor the HumphreyHawkins fullemployment bill now before Congress and both deplore the wateringdown it has  undergone Both believe Washington should increase aid to elementary and secondary schools Later in the day when the candidates appeared separately ata forum held by the Brotherhood Synagogue on Gramercy Park they generally voiced the same sentiments on an important topic for a New York City office seekerUnited States policy toward Israel Both stressed their Jewish heritage and said they were disturbed by the growing controversy between President Carter and the Israeli Government over Israeli settlements in former Arab territory It was in their street appearances that Mrs Abzug and Mr Green could best be seen in their differing campaign styles Beginning at Rustys a restaurant on Third Avenue near 73d Street Mrs Abzug worked her way along the bar and then from table to table telling each patron that she hoped for his vote on Tuesday In Churchills another bar Mrs Abzug ran into several voters who said they had

Abzug encountered a voter who said Im very much for you but I have a problem Im in favor of Westway What should I do Mrs Abzug opposes the Westway the highly controversial highway proposed for the West Side of Manhattan and Mr Green favors it The issue is one of the few on which the two are completely at odds Her reply to the wavering voter was You should vote or me anyway Mr Green meanwhile went into supermarkets and coffeeshops along Second Avenue from Tudor City south to Gramercy Park accompanied by State Senator Roy M Goodman the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Mayor last November Shoppers felt their elbows gently taken by Mr Goodman who introduced himself and then said Id like you to meet Bill Greena very good man for Congress and I hope youll vote for him on Tuesday Mr Green dressed like Mr Goodman in a tan camels hair coat was encouraged by the number of people who recognized him Since entering the race as a virtual unknown eight weeks ago he has faced the problem of gaining recognition while running against an opponent who needed no introduction to voters The Smaller Parties The two minorparty candidates taking advantage of equaltime provisions of Federal law governing television stations appeared yesterday in the Channel 4 debate and they also were invited to the Brotherhood Synagogue forum Mr Gallaghers Labor Party candidacy is based on a platform contending that the entire United States establishment including Mrs Abzugsis opposed to the working people He is not expected to draw many votes among voters in the socalled silk stocking district But Mr Lim could well be a pivotal factor if the race between Mrs Abzug and Mr Green is as close as some predict it will be In the last two elections in the 18th District Conservative Party nominees have received about 4 percent of the vote Since the Conservative vote would be expected to go to Mr Green if the party did not have its own candidate in the race Mr Lim a New York University

U.S. Panel Finds Lag in Rights in ‘77,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/14/archives/us-panel-finds-lag-in-rights-in-77-four-agencies-praised.html,WASHINGTON Feb 13 UPIThe Commission on Civil Rights said today that there was a disturbing lack of economic gains for women and minorities last year despite the Administrations efforts to improve the situation In a 129page report on civil rights efforts in 1977 the commission also said that womens rights were set back by Congressional restrictions on abortions and the failure of states to ratify the equal rights amendment While praising the Administration for its initiatives to improve enforcement of civil rights laws the commission said that it remained concerned about continuing high unemployment and poverty rates among minority groups and women and the inadequacy of programs to deal with the problems of lowincome urban residents Four Agencies Praised The lack of economic progress for minorities and women is especially disturbing since the costs of meeting basic human needs continued to rise and the overall employment position of white males improved the commission said It said that the most gratifying efforts on civil last year were made by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the Labor and Justice Departments and the Civil Service Commission The panel said that it was encouraged by the national movement toward greater equality of educational opportunity in 1977 but that the Bakke case and Congressional activity have threatened to slow down the effort And while community acceptance of desegregation appeared to be growing it said acceptance may be due in part to the limited scope of desegregation plans put into effect last year In the Bakke case now before the Supreme Court a white man Allan Bakke is charging that he was denied admission to medical school because places were reserved for less qualified members of racial minorities The commission said that a court decision on the matter may have consequences for affirmative action programs in employment and other areas as well as education In housing the commission said subtle patterns of discrimination continue to exist and Federal programs aimed at aiding lowincome people are inadequate It said that full participation by minorities in the nations political process remains a distant goal even though voting rights of minorities were strengthened last year On law enforcement the panel said police abuse of minority citizens intensified as a critical issue contributing to disorders in several cities
Letter: On the Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/14/archives/letter-on-the-abortion-law-to-help-children-avoid-childbearing.html,To the Editor Your Jan 31 editorial regarding interpretation of the abortion law was insightful in pointing out several problems inherent in the laws mandates In particular the 60day reporting period for cases of rape or incest will most certainly be inadequate for very young girls though unfortunately these are not the few exceptional cases that the editorial suggests Rape and incest cases all too commonly involve the young who are also more devastated by the experience because of their age and circumstances But there is another important factor that is sometimes forgotten The typi r cal person is not usually familiar with the detailed specifications governing availability of such a service especially if she doesnt think she will need it While newspaper editors and advocates on both sides of the abortion issue may be acutely aware of the final legislative language the wave of publicity over recent lawmaking often serves to confuse the public about just what is available and legal Teenagers tend to get their information about such matters from their equally uninformed peers which delays the process of getting the needed information and guidance The new law adds additional barriers for Tis group Most teenagers are effectively poor and many will need Medicaid assistance for abortion services Even before the new law went into effect there were 600000 births to teenagers in a yearmost of them unintendedand about 300000 abortions Instead of instituting policies to allow thg number of teenage births to approach one million we should work toward the provision of informational and health services to help children avoid childbearing until they chooseand are preparedto do so JUDITH SENDEROWITZ The Population Institute Washington Feb 2 ii978
Women's Magazines Are More Than Fashionable,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/15/archives/new-jersey-pages-womens-magazines-are-more-than-fashionable.html,Woman eternal woman Age cannot wither her not if the cosmetics industry has its say nor custom stale her infinite variety Orat least thats what a numoer of publishers and wouldbe publishers are hoping Womah is being wooed and wooed hard by the magazine industry Half a doten new womens magazines have come into being in the last two years Another half a dozen are planning publication this Year OneWomenSports has folded Working Woman has just been through bankruptcy proceedings and American Home is being incorporated into Redbook Still another magazineTime Incs proposed Womanmay never be born at all A few years back the sybils were saying that the womens movement would deal the death blow to womens magazines Liberated woman they said would no longer be interested in such frivolousor drearysubjects as beauty fashion homemaking and romantic fiction Tradition Still a Success But the sybils were wrong it seems For one thing traditional womens magazines are for the most part well and enjoying what is the biggest advertising boom for magazines in more than two decades Advertisers have been switching to magazines because of the soaring costs of primetime television McCalls leads the Big Five with a circulation of 65 million The circulations of the other four according to 1977 statements submitted by their publishers to the Audit Bureau of Circulations are Ladies Home Journal six million Good Housekeeping five million Redbook 47 million and Cosmopolitan 25 million It is evident that the time has not yet come to play the dirge for fashion homemaking or evenheaven forbidromance They are still selling magazines For instance LOfficial USA which has been publishing since September 1976 is handsome magazine with dazzling color pictures of luxurious women in expensive clothes It is crammed with fullpage advertisements of furs expensive perfumes jewelry and sleek cars With a circulation of 135000 its target audience is women older than 25 with an average income of 38000 Its publisher Evan Katz thought up the magazine when as a countryclu manager he used to sit and listen to women complain that the traditional fashion magazines were giving them kinky clothes and how to articles instead of pure fashion Ambiance another new fashion magazine will be published this month by Michael Butler a former Time and CBS executive It will be basically service magazine for the very busy woman and will emphasize cosmetics and beauty products as well as clothes This is a magazine for a new generatin of women Mr Butler says Vogue and Bazaar are outdated They still look to Paris as the center of all fashion We will only feature products that are available at the US level Rags the third new fashion magazine is sceduled to come out later this year Its tone will be irreverent and sassy and it will be aimed at the 18 to 34yearold professional woman who makes from 18000 to 24000 a year It will feature articles such as Do You Really Want to Look Wrinkled How to Look Your Best When Swimming Naked and The Great Thrift Shop Rip Off The Total Farm Woman Another recent publication that proves traditional woman is still around is The Homemaker which is printed in South Dakota and has a circulation of 118000 Its articles range from The Total Terrific Farm Woman to Action Against Crime the account of a Virginia womans efforts to reform rape laws As for love it is still evidently helping to make the magazine world go round The Hearst Corporation is testing a proposed magazine called Romance Weekly According to Mina W Mulvey executive editor of Good Housekeeping who is in charge of the project it will be aimed at women who devour romance paperbacks Gothic novels Regency novels and the whole field of romantic fiction What the womens movement did was create the need for a new genre of magazine aimed primarily at working women It also gave rise to the need to treat women as decisionmakersas people who buy life insurance or take out mortgages or buy cars all once thought of particularly by advertisers as subjects of interest to men only I keep reading about new magazines that are going to be somewhere between Cosmo and Ms This acknowledges that the womens market has been segmented It also shows the slow acknowledgment of this by the advertising community Role Models Emphasized Ms has developed a strong feminist personality of its own but the other magazines are harder to define Work ing Woman for instance makes no at tempt to be radically feminist but rather runs stories about successful women as role models emphasizes health and diet as necessary concerns of the career woman and gives its read ers timesaving tips on fashion mak up and entertaining Working Woman has just been ac quired by Dale Lang founder of Media Networks which publishes local adver tising editions for local magazines He acquired it at a bankruptcy sale after the former owner W W Publications filed under Chapter XI of the Federal Bankruptcy Law in December Working Woman has not missed an issue despite the bankruptcy proceed ings Immediately after acquiring the magazine Mr Lang met with Kate Rand Lloyd the editor and her staff and told them he expected them all to stay on and continue working on th magezine which is not yet two years old and has a circulation of 200000 How to Juggle Six Men The other magazine in this genre is New Dawn described by its editor as a feminist  oriented Redbook However while there are occasional articles such as How to Findand keepa Good Lawyer the more typical titles are How to Juggle Six Men at Once Diamonds the Romantic Accessory In Search of a Sex Symbol a man of course How to Deal with Jealousy in a Relationship and The Joys of Baking Bread Judith Daniels former managing editor of The Village Voice and New York Magazine has been trying to raise money for more than a year for a magazine called Savvy It will be aimed specifically at the executive woman and her needs Both Time Inc and Conde Nast have been looking into publishing new magazines for women Time put out two dummy issues of Woman last year but according to a spokesman for the company the test marketing proved disappointing The magazine is small the size of Readers Digest and the plan was to sell it in supermarkets Articles in the first dummy included pieces on the effects of President Carters abortion stand teenage pregnancies and an article on Rosalynn Carter The lead piece was entitled Changing Woman It was one womans account written with a certain sense of wonderabout her past lovers Naked in North Platte Take the fellow in Bloomingdales she writes While I still cannot recall his name I do recall that at his urging I once walked naked through the corridors of a Holiday Inn in North Platte Neb to fetch him a Coke from a vending machine And she adds I used my own quarter too The Conde Nast magazine scheduled for the fall is to be called Self and will be aimed at women of all ages who have desires beyond cooking and patchwork quilting the real woman her real desires and her real joys according to Phyllis Wilson the editor who was managing editor of Glamour for 16 years It would be the first new magazine for Conde Nast in 39 years How does one start a new magazine The efforts of Caroy Troy and Many Peacock two young editors who are trying to start up the new Rags are probably typical They feel there is a market for new fashion magazine for younger women who shun the fashion dictatorship of the more traditional magazines In September they ran a 200000 piece directmail test using accepted test marketing procedures describing their magazine to potential readers nationwide and asking if they would like to subscribe They got an 85 percent response4 percent is usually considered goodand then began taking the results around to potential investors They are still in the process of trying to put together the financing Being women has helped us says Carol Troy People want to help us because they are still surprised to run across enterpreneurial women
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/15/archives/letters-obsolescent-sovereignty-wall-street-is-not-a-gamble-cheap.html,New Rochelle NY Feb 7 1978 To the Editor There is much talk these days about sovereignty the inherent right of selfdetermination the sanctity of land and the need for safe and secure borders These resounding declarations of high principle obfuscate the reality that in our interdependent world many of the most sacred ideals of the past are becoming obsolete The doctrine of sovereignty which i the foundation stone of our present international system derives its justification from the nowdiscredited Divine Right of Kings Today no people no matter how powerful can determine its own destiny A refusal by sovereign states to produce oil or wheat for example will cause freezing or starvation to helpless millions in distant lands Cruelty will find sanctuary behind the notion of noninterference in internal affairs As the earths resources continue to be depleted the growing populations will come to recognize that the land like the seas and the skies should be regarded as the common heritage of mankind Those who now make an uninhabited desert bloom should not be condemned as criminal aggressors The realignment of frontiers and the escalating acquisition of weapons can provide no permanent security It is more likely that the threat of military defeat will provoke the nuclear holocaust which will be the ultimate demonstration of the futility of remote outposts or meticulously drawn national boundaries What is urgently needed is the establishment of an effective international procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes Until that can be devised statesmen would do well to suppress outworn slogans and political rhetoric and concentrate instead on the daily human needs of the people they serve To the Editor Wall Street is not a gamble as one would infer from Billy Grahams remarks in The Times Notes on People in which he associates it with Las Vegas in the statement Probably the greatest center of gambling in the US is Wall Street The purchaser of stocks is a speculator and although the motivation of individual Wall Street speculators may be identical with that of Las Vegas gamblers one performs a useful service which the other does not Billy Graham like so many others fails to observe the distinction between gambling and speculationthe former being the assumption of risk which would otherwise be nonexistent the latter providing a beneficial function by accepting risks present in the operation of a capitalistic freeenterprise system Where would equity financing be those who invest in a public corporation were without the availability of a Wall Street where the risks of ownership could be so readily transferred If there were no Wall Street we would have to invent it Las Vegas and its gambling casinos would not be missed Thoughtless remarks by Billy Graham in linking Wall Street with Las Vegas belittle the sophisticated sagacity of one whose business acumen has propelled a multimillion dollar To the Editor In replying to Archbishop Joseph L Bernardins suggestion that continence might be a better solution to the problem of teenage pregnancies than more and better contraception and abortions Dr Donald Weisman letter Jan 23 says A celibate priest may be able to subdue or even to suppress these basic [sexual] needs through indoctrination and piety but teenagers Never What a cheap shot to the thousands of teenagers Catholic and otherwise for whom Dr Weismans unattainable goal of abstinence is a daytoday reality chosen out of a commitment to purity in the face of overwhelming pressure from peers the media seemingly the whole world Calling abstinence an unattainable goal is a selffulfilling prophecy if done often enough and by respectable enough people If theres one thing harder than struggling through adolescence celibate its having some adult tell you induleentiv that it cant be done To the Editor In a recent letter All Hag Ibrahim Aden rejects the idea that Soviet mill tary support for Ethiopia was the pri mary cause of the new turn in the SomaliSoviet relations Instead he as serts that the problem was caused mainly by the Somali and Soviet Governments conspiracy to force Communism on the Somali people These efforts failed Aden states because    Soviet Communism totalitarianism and the destruction of religion could not be forced on the Somali people [who]    believe in the Koran to the point    of choosing death over becoming nonbelievers This is a shallow explanation to say the least of the SomaliSoviet dispute For instance how is the degree of religious belief in the Somali culture related to the sudden expulsion of the Soviets from Somali And why would the Somali Government force Communism on its people while the top leadership is as religious as the general public Aden seems to be confused by two issues the intentions of superpowers and the activity of the Somali Government Contrary to Adens belief a superpower does not normally attempt to transplant its own system in developing countrysimply because of the impracticability involved What actually seeks to cultivate is a stable and friendly government so that its interests in that country may remain unaffected The authoritarian rule and regimentation introduced by the Somali Government was not an imitation of ne Soviets as Aden asserts but a strategy for mobilizing scarce local re sources for the purpose of shifting the country from total dependence on foreign aid to selfreliance in at least essential goods and services Actually there was never a love affair between the Somalis and the Soviets at the public or the governmental level The close relationship between them in the past was guided by pragmatic selfinterests With the help of the Soviets Somalia instituted among ether things the kind of military establishment it needed and in return Soviets received friendly reception and the privilege to use certain pans of the country for military facilities However the Soviet decision to supply Ethiopia with sophisticated weapons and thousands of combat troops to be used against the Somalis struggling to achieve their independence from the Ethiopian occupation of Ogaden was considered by the Somali Government as an act of hostility against the Somalis as a people Thus the closing of the facilities and expulsion of the Soviets were direct results of the Somali reaction to this Soviet decision The reason for the Soviet action is not yet quite clear Perhaps it was an attempt to enlarge their sphere of influence but in the process the Soviets misjudged how fiercely independent the Somalis are and underestimated the seriousness with which the Somalis view the subjugation of their compatriots in Ogaden But one thing is obvious The SomaliSoviet rupture resulted from these conflicting in terests To the Editor The positions espoused by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe leaders of the Patriotic Front of Rhodesia strike me as being somewhat incongruous While they are carrying out the fighting against a racist regime and forcing Prime Minister Ian Smith to the bargaining table with black moderates they somehow feel that they are automatically entitled to power in an ensuing government regardless of the fact that they do not have popular backing and the moderates such as Muzorewa Sithole and Chirau do It seems logical to me that Britain and the United States should be more inclined to support a newly formed democracy created by negotiations between Smith and the moderates What Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe have done in the way of forcing Mr Smith to bargain is fine and admirable but no actions by anybody warrant that they automatically deserve the reigns of government without popular backing To the Editor Paternalism is a relatively innocuous form of behavior except when it is used in the fashion exhibited by The Times in its Jan 27 editorial Does Civil Rights Include Energy When used in this fashion it becomes a dangerous tool of influence calculated to subvert the truth or a very important subject For The Times to say that the NAACPs paper on energy was inadequately prepared poorly reasoned and finally wrong for all Americans without supportive evidence for such a stand is a serious evasion of the truth The NAACP reszes that the domestic lid on the price of energy serves to export jobs a matter of grave concern to the black community to foreign lands If the NAACP is to work effectively toward improving the status of blacks in this country can it afford to ignore the economic wellbeing of blacks The natural law of economics states that producers will always seek the highest return for their efforts If it pays more to develop their products in foreign lands and ship them to this country they will do exactly that Using the law to curtail such activity will only lead to black marketeering There has never been a shred of worthwhile evidence to infer that controls benefit the marketplace but there is substantial evidence to support the fact that controls stimulate blackmarket activity and eventually lead to shortages Deregulation of energy prices will create shortterm hardships this is well known But freeing the price to the competitive forces of the marketplace will produce longterm benefits On the other hand keeping the ceiling on domestic energy prices will worsen the shortterm and the longterm energy nroblems A free market that has been disrupted by controls takes time to heal itself This nation created its enerv problems and this nation will have to pay the price for correcting them Correcting a wrong is seldom an easy or painless task I applaud the extremely courageous stand of the NAACP I only hope that freethinking Americans will take the time to inspect its analysis of the energy problem carefully To the Editor William Safires column Reading Sadats Mind Feb 6 comes close to outright misrepresentation of Mr Sadats views in the disarming guise of a firstperson reflection by Mr Sadat Mr Safire is entitled to his prejudices but it is poor taste to inflict them on readers as though Mr Sadat really thinks the way Mr Safire says he does A growing number of Americans feel that Mr Sadats peace proposal to the Israeli people was fair and forthcoming Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and Palestinian selfdetermination in exchange for the peace and regional acceptance that Israel has demanded for so long It is worth pointing out that Mr Safire like Mr Begin describes as suicidal for Israel an existence within preJune 1967 boundaries and Arab sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip yet Israel lived with exactly this situation

MEDICAID ABORTIONS BARRED BY SUFFOLK,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/15/archives/medicaid-abortions-barred-by-suffolk-legislature-votes-153-to-end.html,HAUPPAUGE LI Feb 14The Suffolk County Legislature today passed measure barring the use of Medicaid funds for abortions despite a warning from the County Attorney that the measure was illegal The 15 to 3 vote came after a long day of argument that included several dozen residents urging the Legislature to act one way or the other In many respects the argument echoed past debates over abortion The Federal Government after compromise lefislation was reached in Congress last December decided to help finance abortions for impoverished women who are rape or incest victims or who would suffer severe and longlasting physical health damage if allowed to give birth New York State law allows Medicaid reimbursement for abortions judged medically necessary A bitter legislative battle is expected over whether to recast the states policy in the more restrictive language of the Federal Government which would not pay its share for abortions the state would otherwise allow The debate in Suffolk County was not concerned with the specific circumstances warranting Medicaid reimbursement but whether abortions should be financed at all Rabbi Raphal Weisman representing the Suffolk County Orthodox Rabbinate said Abortion is a violation to human dignity The Rev Charles W Lee a Methodist minister said that before abortions were legal the rich could and did go to London or Japan for their abortions while the poor were left to mutilate themselves A spokesman for the Suffolk County Department of Social Services said 900 abortions were performed in the county last year under Medicaid at about 250 for each abortion with theiFederal Government paying half and the state and county governments onequarter each Before the vote the County Attorney Howard E Pachman said the measure should not be passed by this Legislature since its adoption and enforcement would be beyond the powers of this Legislature Mr Pachman said his staff had found that clearly the state has preempted the area of assistance for the needy The local government cannot act to the contrary Mr Pachman said that two other counties in the state Seneca and Niagara had adopted similar resolutions barring Medicaidfinanced abortions One member of the Suffolk Legislature Denis Ralph Hurley Republican of Wading River said that he was opposed to abortion but was going to vote against the measure If we are going to pass a bill that is illegal we will have accomplished nothing he said Instead he added the Suffolk Legislature should pass a resolution urging the State Legislature to pass a law barring the use of Medicaid funds for abortions This led Legislator Louis T Howard Republican of Amityville and sponsor of the resolution to accuse Mr Hurley of supporting the opposition Legislator John P Finnerty Jr Republican of Bay Shore said he agreed with Mr Hurley but the resolution should be missed so the court could rule on the matter Mr Hurley changed his mind and voted for the measure
Women's Magazines Are More Than Fashionable,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/15/archives/womens-magazines-are-more-than-fashionable-tradition-still-a.html,Woman eternal woman Age cannot wither her not if the cosmetics industry has its say nor custom stale her infinite variety Or at least thats what a numoer of publishers and wouldbe publishers are hoping Woman is being wooed and wooed hard by the magazine industry Half a dozen new womens magazines have come into being in the last two years Another half a dozen are planning publication this year OneWomenSports has folded Working Woman has just been through bankruptcy proceedings and American Home is being incorporated into Redbook Still another magazineTime thcs proposed Womanmay never beborn at all A few years back the sibyls were saying that the womens movement would deal the death blow to womens magazines Liberated woman they said would no longer be interested in such frivolousor drearysubjects as beauty fashion homemaking and romantic fiction But the sibyls were wrong it seems For one thing traditional womens magazines are for the most part well and enjoying what is the biggest advertising boom for magazines in more than two decades Advertisers have been switching to magazines because of the soaring costs of primetime television McCalls leads the Big Five with a circulation of 65 million The circulations of the other four according to 1977 statements submitted by their publishers to the Audit Bureau of Circulation are Ladies Home Journal six million Good Housekeeping five million Redbook 47 million and Cosmopolitan 25 million It is evident that the time has not yet come to play the dirge for fashion homemaking or evenheaven forbidromance They are still selling magazines For instance LOf ficiel USA which has been publishing since September 1976 is handsome magazine with dazzling color pictures of luxurious women in expensive clothes It is crammed with fullpage advertisements of furs expensive perfumes jewelry and sleek cars With a circulation of 135000 its target audience is women older than 25 with an average income of 38000 Its publisher Evan Katz thought up the magazine when as a countryclub manager he used to sit and listen to women complain that the traditional fashion magazines were giving them kinky clothes and how to articles instead of pure fashion Ambiance another new fashion magazine will be published this month by Michael Butler a former Time and CBS executive It will be basically service magazine for the very busy woman and will emphasize cosmetics and beauty products as well as clothes This is a magazine for a new generation of women Mr Butler says Vogue and Bazaar are outdated They still look to Paris as the center of all fashion We will only feature products that are available at the US level Rags the third new fashion magazine is scheduled to come out later this year Its tone will be irreverent and sassy and it will be aimed at the 18 to 34yearold professional woman who makes from 18000 to 24000 a year It will feature articles such as Do You Really Want to Look Wrinkled How to Look Your Best When Swimming Naked and The Great Thrift Shop Rip Off Another recent publication that proves traditional woman is still around is The Homemaker which is printed in South Dakota and has a circulation of 118000 Its articles range from The Total Terrific Farm Woman to Action Against Crime the account of a Virginia womans efforts to reform rape laws As for love it is still evidently helping to make the magazine world go round The Hearst Corporation is testing a proposed magazine called Romance Weekly According to Mina W Mulvey executive editor of Good Housekeeping who is in charge of the project it will be aimed at women who devour romance paperbacks Some of the new generation of magazines for women that have been published or are in planning stages Gothic novels Regency novels and the whole field of romantic fiction What the womens movement did wafi create the need for a new genre of magazine aimed primarily at working women It also gave rise to the need to treat women as decisionmakersas people who buy life insurance or take out mortgages or buy cars all once thought of particularly by advertisers as subjects of interest to men only I keep reading about new magazines that are going to be somewhere between Cosmo and Ms says Patricia Carbine of Ms magazine which began in 1972 as a specifically feminist publication and now has a circulation of more than 450000 This acknowledges that the womens market has been segmented It also shows the slow acknowledgment of this by the advertising community Ms has developed a strong feminist personality of its own but the other magazines are harder to define Working Woman for instance makes no attempt to be radically feminist but rather runs stories about successful women as role models emphasizes health and diet as necessary concerns of the career woman and gives hs readers timesaving tips on fashion makeup and entertaining Working Woman has just been acquired by Dale Lang founder of Media Networks which publishes local advertising editions for local magazines He acquired it at a bankruptcy sale after the former owner W W Publications filed under Chapter XI of the Federal Bankruptcy Law in December It has a circulation of 200000 Working Woman whose editor is Kate Rand Lloyd has just been acissue despite the bankruptcy proceedings Immediately after acquiring the magazine Mr Lang met with Kate Rand Lloyd the editor and her staff and told them he expected them all to stay on and continue working on the magazine which is not yet two years old and has a circulation of 200000 The other magazine In this genre is New Dawn described by its editor as a feminist oriented Redbook However while there are occasional articles such as How to Findand keepa Good Lawyer the more typical titles are How to Juggle Six Men it Once  Diamonds the Romantic Accessory In Search of a Sex Symbol a man of course How to Deal with Jealousy in a Relationship and The Joys of Baking Bread Judith Daniels former managing editor of The Village Voice and New York Magazine has been trying to raise money for more than a year for magazine called Savvy It will be aimed specifically at the executive woman and her needs Both Time Inc and Conde Nast have been looking into publishing new magazines for women Time put out two dummy issues of Woman last year but according to a spokesman for the company the test marketing proved disappointing The magazine is small the size of Readers Digest and the plan was to sell it in supermarkets Articles in the first dummy included pieces on the effects of President Carters abortion stand teenage pregnancies and an article on Rosalynn Carter The lead piece was entitled Changing Woman It was one womans account written with a certain sense of wonderabout her past lovers Take the fellow in Bloomingdales she writes While I still cannot recall his name I do recall that at his urging I once walked naked through the corridors of a Holiday Inn in North Platte Neb to fetch him a Coke from a vending mazhine The Conde Nast magazine scheduled for the fall is to be called Self and will be aimed at women of all ages who have desires beyond cooking and patchwork quilting the real woman her real desires and her real joys according to Phyllis Wilson the editor who was managing editor of Glamour for 16 years It would be the first new magazine for Conde Nast in 39 years How does one start a new magazine The efforts of Carol Troy and Mary Peacock two young editors who are trying to start up the new Rags are probably typical They feel there is a market for new fashion magazine for younger women who shun the fashion dictatorship of the more traditional magazines In September they ran a 200000 piece directmail test using accepted test marketing procedures describing their magazine to potential readers nationwide and asking if they would like to subscribe They got an 85 percent re sponse4 percent is usually consid ered goodand then began taking the results around to potential investors They are still in the process of trying to put together the financing

17President Carter predicted at a news conference today that Congress would approve his controversial proposal for the sale of advanced military planes to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as Israel and he insisted that the sale would not disrupt efforts for peace in the area I think Congress will go along he said with the proposal to sell a limited number of airplanes in the Middle East [Page 10 Question 1] The news conference was the opening move in a campaign by Mr Carter to help reelect Democrats in the hope of bolstering Capitol Hill support for his Administrations programs The President came to New England on behalf of Senators Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island William D Hathaway of Maine and Thomas J McIntyre of New Hampshire all seeking reelection Such campaigning is a traditional method by which Presidents and White House aspirants seek political IOUs Mr Carter asked whether the proposed arms sale would widen the arms race said that the United States was not introducing new weapons into the Middle East He said that he had pledged himself to reduce the volume of weapons with each succeeding year as long as I am in office barring some unpredictable worldwide military outbreak He said that he thought the arms sale would strengthen the United States position in the Middle East I think its very good for nations to turn to us for their security needs instead of having to turn to the Soviet Union as they have in the past [Question 13] The President began the news conference with an optimistic report on the coalstrike negotiations and discussion of his economic policy My top priority this year on the domestic scene is still the economy the President said [Opening Statement] He said that there had been improvements in the economy of New England where he noted that employment had risen 55 percent The unemployment rate dropped 3 percentage points from the level of 85 percent President Carter explained a need for legislation for further improvements in the economy Such measures would add up he said to 25 billion in tax cuts 17 billion of which would aid working families while the rest will be in the form of corporate reductions The President again assailed expenseaccount privileges of what he called small number of people saying I dont think a relatively small minority has some sort of divine right to have expensive meals free theater tickets country club dues sporting events tickets paid for by heavier taxes on everybody else [Opening Statement] The President acknowledged that the economy wont turn around overnight of course any more than an ocean liner can turn around on a dime He added however The machinery of the Ameri can economy is sound We have a lot to be thankful for It has worked well despite several shocks But it can work better and that is our major goal inthis country this year The President asked about the Middle East arms sales including 50 F5Es to Egypt said that Egypt which is now one of our staunchest friends and allies severed their close relationship with the Soviet Union and in effect became an ally of ours He added that he did not think there was any danger of this relatively shortrange notadvanced fighter disrupting the search for peace in t he Middle East President Carter stressed the view that governors and other local officials had the primary responsibility to determine the needs of their areas The cost of the Presidents trip to New England the White House announced will be divided between public and political funds based on the amount of time spent on official and political activities According to the schedule the breakdown is estimated at 75 percent official activities and 25 percent political If it appears to me that the ruling is being abused then I would favor tightening up the HEW regulations he said in a reference to the Department of Health Educations nd Welfare I think we ought to be very strict about the administration of the law and the rulings 3bdoubts Abortion Is Taking of Life The President said in response to another question that I do think that abortions are the taking of a human life Regulations promulgated by the department provide that a woman may report rape or incest within 60 days to qualify for medical procedures including an abortion On the subject of the equal rights amendment however the President came down fimly on the side of feminists saying that he favored an extension of the sevenyear liMitation for states to ratify the amendment Congress would have to pass it and if it is passed I would sign it with pleasure he said The President theme took to task former college students who had not repaid Federal loans One of the things that has endangered the entire program is the deliberate cheating by college students he said

Students Print Own Sex Study In High School,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/19/archives/westchester-weekly-students-print-own-sex-study-in-high-school.html,EDG EMONT TEENAGERS have grown accustomed to reading about their age groups alleged sexual habits in surveys conducted by adult research organizations or maga zines designed for the young At Edgemont High School last term the Campus Monthly staff decided to conduct its own study of sexual attitudes and practices Principal Joseph Doohan assumed the staffs mature and serious report would remain an internal document But Planned Parenthood of Westchester was so impressed with the result that reprinted copies to demonstrate the students own understanding of and concern about the need for more effective efforts in sex education Sex and Todays TeenagerAn Indepth Special Report was similar in thoroughness to earlier alcohol and drug studies Bradley Crystal editor of Campus Monthly said These subjects are national issues affecting all students We felt it was the responsibility of the school newspaper to present the facts The responses showed that among the sexually active students from the 10th through 12th grades an overwhelming 74 percentage of the males practiced birth control only sometimes or not at all while females were slightly more conscientious with 60 percent sometimes or never using contraceptives The Nov 8 publication carried not only the surveys findings but also details of birthcontrol methods along with the medical risks of each and their statistical effectiveness when properly used It included an outline of problems of venereal disease Dr Mary Lane director of Women and Youth Services of the Department of Health in the county reports eight live births and 52 abortions to children under 15 in 1976 There were 666 live births and 1078 abortions in the age group 15 to 19 That means we have four known pregnancies for every 100 between 15 and 19thats 40 percent of the national average With 27 percent of abortions being done for the 19 and under group they still account for 8 percent of the live births Dr Lane said The Campus Monthly Sex Survey revealed some of the attitudes of the 315 students who voluntarily and anonymously responded Both females 82 percent and males 89 percent said they approved of premarital sex The majority answering felt that two people could not be content in a relationship based on sex without love Half of the males said they had engaged in sex while fewer femalesapproximately thirdsaid they had done so Nearly a third of sophomore males said they had engaged in sex while 79 percent of seniors said they had done so The editors noted This figure of 79 percent so exceeds all national statistics that one could assume that some of the respondents may have been less than honest The female responses showed that 25 percent of sophomores engaged in sex and about 40 percent did so by their senior year The report described the reasons selected for the lack of use of contraceptive precautions as varied and in some cases alarming Males cited destruction of sexual spontaneity a belief that contraceptives are not necessary for pregnancy prevention and embarrassment in purchasing birth control devices Females put their answers in a slightly different sequence mentioning embarrassment in purchasing and loss of spontaneity as more personally significant Few of either sex selected two alternative answers not understanding how contraceptives were used or being against them on moral or religious grounds Sixtythree percent of the males and 58 percent of the females did not think their sexeducation backgrounds had been complete Twothirds of  the students felt the school system should provide them with more information Fortysix percent of the males and 61 percent of the females did not think sex education would increase the likelihood of teenagers engaging in sex When asked to whom they would turn for guidance in relation to a sexual matter 43 percent of the males and 55 percent of the females indicated they would turn to a friend After that 20 percent of the males would turn to a doctor and 29 percent of the females to an organization such as Planned Parenthood Stu dents of both sexes mentioned parents  as a third choice as a source of information with clergymen last Doreen Randall education director of planned Parenthood of Westchester who wasinterviewed for the report said Riegnant teenagers particurarlythose under 15 face a far greater risk of illness and death because their bodies are not biologically mature enough Im not sure that teenagers know enough about the availability of contraception There is so much misinformation that we feel sex education birtlicontrol counseling and contraceptive information should be available to all people regardless of age marital or financial status Planned Parenthood of Westchester she said has a nocharge telephone information line 99815533 in 1976 it had 6000 callers Slidingscale fees are used at major centers in Mount Vernon Yonkers White Plains and Mount Kisco with branch clinics in New Rochelle Port Chester and Tarrytown One speaking engagement arranged recently was for a sixthgrade class at junior high school where a seventhgrader had become pregnant Her situation should she keep her illegitimate child has been described by Arthur A Campbell in The Role of Family Planning in the Reduction of Poverty in The Journal of Marriage and the Family as suddenly having 90 percent of her lifes script written for her Her choices are few and most of them are bad \  `These are national issues that affect all students We felt it was the responsibility of the school newspaper to present the facts
INTERVIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/19/archives/connecticut-weekly-interview-in-the-eye-of-the-healthservices-storm.html,EUGENE MICHAEL thinks he occupying one of the hottest seats in Fairfield County The source of the heat is the controversyMr Michaels word is uproarcaused by the 700page health plan being put forward by the Southwest Connecticut Health Systems Agency of which he is the executive director What worries Mr Michael  he says is that some of the controversy may be caused by misconceptions about the plan The Federally financed agency which is run by an independent panel of area residents was formed to draw up proposals for making health care more costefficient and accessible to the needy in 14 communities from Greenwich to Stratford But just days before the Feb 13 deadline for filing the plan with the regional director of the Department of Health Education and Welfare in Boston hundreds of the areas citizens suddenly found out about it They started writing letters to their elected representatives and the local press attended stormy public hearings and signed critical petitions Why Among other things they resent the idea of a Federally initiated role in private medical practice They say it the beginning of socialized medicine They also feared proposals to cut back hospital beds in the GreenwichStamford area Antiabortion groups worried about what they viewed as the proliferation of Governmentsponsored abortion clinics called for in the agencys plan And business groups questioned the cost of expensive proposals for making medical care more available to the poor Earlier this month concern had reached a high pitch After a public hearing in Stamford was ended by a fire marshal because the room could not hold the people who showed up the final public hearing in Greenwich drew over 400 people and did not end untl after AM But despite all the furor a visitor to Mr Michaels fourthfloor offices on North Main Street in Norwalk recently found him surprisingly relaxed in good humor and sure that we will get over this hump in time even though Im getting less sleep I feel two ways about the uproar he said I naturally have concerns about the misunderstandings Lets deal with these first We will notI repeat notbe making any cutbacks in hospital beds or in inpatient services until there has been a fullscale costanalysis and feasibility study Secondly we are amending some of the language about the Medicaidsponsored abortion clinicswhich our task force felt was particularly needed among the poor Women using the clinics will he said be presented with the prolife point of view as well They were not promulgating the idea Mr Michael said of the agencys planned abortion clinics but were just suggesting more people should have the opportunity if they wished John Wiltrakis regional director of the 5000member Connecticut Right to Life group says these changes are merely cosmetic Mr Michael says they are seriously considered modifications made after fierce attacks by the Connecticut Right to Life group The agency has also been accused of rushing through the plan without enough time for consideration Critics said that they had only 30 days notice to read huge document available at public libraries and that this was too little time to prepare for the five hearings Perhaps our findings did come out late compared to other agencies working on similar plans in other areas Mr Michael said Had we had more time to speak to consumer groups there would have been more information disseminated and more consensus would have resulted But we did put out 102 press releases to all area newspapers and radio stations during the 18month preparation of the studyreleases that were used by only a few local papers and ignored by the rest Now suddenly everybodys jumping in and saying we are ignoring community feeling and due process Maybe its an uncomfortable time for us But I also see it as a rare opportunity to turn such attention around and reach a far greater audience Yes we are Federally financed But it is also true that we are everyones neighbor and friend A task force of 250 local providers and consumers of health care worked on this plan We have been given a chance to do it for ourselves Lets get on with it before the Federal Government really does come in and do it for us Mr Michael was born in Danbury graduated from Fairfield University and got a masters degree in social work at Fordham University During the 1980s he worked in antipoverty and communityaction programs in the Bridgeport area He lives in Fairfield with his wife Mary a biology teacher and their three sons In the early 70s he took over as director of the Health Planning Council of Eastern Fairfield County the forerunner of the Health Systems Agency which was set up in 1976 The Government was committed to financing health care one way or the other Mr Michael said and it was worried about escalating costs They had to make an attempt at influencing decisions which would contain these costs and also bring that care to all the people That is what we are all about The Stamford Area Commerce and Industry Association said we never bothered to ask their opinion even though healthcare costs deeply affected all corporations This is not true I drew a copy of the letter from our files just the other day which was sent to them in October 1978 asking their cooperation and their views We approached 201 organizations this way and like many they did not respond I do not believe they realized the implications of our plan or our statutory powers Even so we welcome their suggestions today They are asking for community workshops to explain what we are aiming to do This is an excellent suggestion It will give us more chance to test consumer preferences After all this is only a preliminary plan People are saying we must have priorities True And one of the proposals think most important is that of the neighborhood health center We have lopsided situation nowfar too much reliance upon inpatient care These centers have the finest potential for bet ter balanced service at the most economical cost Besides Congress has specifically asked us to find alternate methods to expensive institutional care Many citizens in an affluent region such as this do not acknowledge the poor are even out there Mr Michael said The 80 percent of people who do have adequate insurance coverage are anesthetized to the pain of rising costs Most of them therefore dont realize we must face critical choices in health care Perhaps some of the more costly equipment should be available only at certain hospitals and not all Perhaps some procedures should be moved out altogether Hospitals have had the benefit of retroactive reimbursement so they have had few of the economic restraints that are present in the rest of the marketplace Perhaps there are excess beds There are widespread differences between the quality and availability of health care in our cities and in the more affluent small towns These differences must be faced
INTERVIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/19/archives/new-jersey-weekly-interview-civilrights-leader.html,WHEN Kenyon T Burke was growing up in Cleveland the hotels there often refused to let the leaders of the Ndtional Association for the Advancement of Colored People rent room so they often stayed in his home Today Mr Burke who lives in Maplewood is a leader of the NAACP and although the Cleveland hotels have changed their policies there is still much work for the organization before its full goals are realized In November Mr Burke was appointed associate director for programs ofthe NAACP with the responsibility of revitalizing housing labor education armed services and veterans affairs voter education religious affairs minority business and communication prOgrams Mr Burke whose philosophy is that everyone ought to have an equal opportunity to succeed    or fail can trace his roots to ancestors who were settled in Ohio before the Civil War A greatgrandfather and greatuncle fought for the Union The American work ethic and a family belief in the power of education framed the values that he inherited from his parents Mr Burkes first job was in Newark I got at one end of Broad Street and started knocking on doors he said A giaduate of Bowling Green State University he earned a masters degree from Columbia University and is currently a doctoral candidate at Rutgers University Mr Burke started as a stock clerk earning 200 a month Not long after however he took a Civil Service test and began working in state government as an employment and rehabilitation counselor When the civilrights movement became active in the early 1960s I was able to call on a lot of experience in manpower and working with disadvantaged people he said He joined the Urban League of Essex County in 1964 as an associate director responsible for programs in housing health employment race relations and education The Urban League was the first exciting position I had Mr Burke recalled Although I had been trained as a psychologist I didnt get that much satisfaction working oneonone It seemed to me that most of the people saw had problems whose pathology was not so much a part of them as it was in society generally The Urban League opened my opportunities to really affect some changes on a large basis After the Urban League Mr Burke spent a year with Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals as a communityrelations manager He then moved on to become national urban affairs director for `Everyone ought to have an equal chance to succeed in life the AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith It was an experiment he said No major Jewish organization had ever hired a black executive to run a department or just to even be at the policymaking level They were very concerned in 1968 with what they saw happening to the relationship between the Jewish and black communities It was an exciting thing I spent five years giving them an honest perception It was the first job I ever had in my life where I really felt free to say exactly what I felt They wanted to know what they looked like from the outside and to alleviate some of the stresses and strains During those years Mr Burke worked throughout the country to create good relationships between the Jewish and black communities He led a group of black editors and publishers on a trip to Israel in 1969 and in 1971 conducted similar tour for black college presidents In 1973 Mr Burke convinced that he had made as much of a contribution as he could to the AntiDefamation League accepted a post that some friends in the civilrights movement questioned He became director of the Community Affairs Department for Planned ParenthoodWorld Population It seemed very clear to me that the right to control your own fertility is personal right he explainedIf you can do that you can control the quality of your life I always thought it was very unfair for some people to have access to contraceptives and abortion services and others not to have this access With the planned parenthood group Mr Burke focused on issues of family planning quality health care and population stabilization particularly as it affected the nations minorities It was decided before I was born that I would have to deal with the problems of blacks but I think we are members of the human family he said In his new job Mr Burke said that he wanted to strengthen the advocacy capacity of the association and improve service to the associations national network of branches When not out on the road Mr Burke can be found at his home in Maplewood joining his wife Dorothy and his two sons Gregory 19 years old a sophomore studying political science at Rutgers and Steven 16 a sophomore at Columbia High School Mr Burke who is 47 has a deep concern for civil rights He puts it this way I tell people its not a question of having a heart overflowing with brotherhood and love If one person is denied a right because of race or religion or ethnic background then the others are in jeopardy If we tolerate tyranny or oppression against one group sooner or later someone will come knocking on your door  Alan Caruba is a freelance writer who lives in Maplewood
Doris Sassower Stirs Rights Controversies,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/19/archives/westchester-weekly-doris-sassower-stirs-rights-controversies.html,TEN years ago in her inaugural speech as president of the New York Womens Bar Association Doris and electrified her colleagues and many other members of the legal profession when she called for a series of reforms liberalizing womens rights in marriage education and the professions Today while many of her radical proposalstaxdeductible childCare expenses repeal of the ban on abortions and expanded work and education opportunities for womenhave become accepted in law in state andFederal jurisdictions Miss Sas sower is still raising eyebrows in legal circles with her controversial ideas  There are still many inequities in our laws that have to be corrected said Miss Sassower a nationally known attorney writer and champion of human causes and frankly it is my greatest happiness to help people especially women who are doubly handicapped in our Society achieve equality Miss Sassower who was a founder of the Professional Womens Caucus in 1970 and the first woman ever invited to address the National Conference of Bar Presidents is a noted authority on matrimonial law She is a resident of New Rochelle and practices law in both Westchester County and New York City A member of the legislative committee of the Family Law Section of the New York State Bar Association and chairman of the special committee for matrimonial law reform of the Sex and  Law Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York Miss Sassower noted that the matrimonial laws in this state were sadly out of date and often totally unsympathetic to the rights of wothen What we have on the books in New York now is an obscenity Miss Sassower said and absolutely contrary to what most women believe when they get married Unfortunately the only time they really find out what the laws are is when they are about to get divorced Not only are the matrimonial courts still dominated by male authority figuresmale attorneys court personnel and judgesaccording to Miss Sassower but the divorce laws themselves are also often interpreted to the detriment of women Most women are shocked to discover they have no legal right to their husbands separately owned property acquired after the marriage she explained They usually take it for granted for instance that the house they have lived in cleaned looked after and decorated for years is legally half theirs even if it is in their husbands name But thats just not the case The worst of it according to Miss Sassower is the divorce process itself especially with its delays and lack of concern for womens immediate financial problems In accordance with this years version of the Equitable Distribution Law which is currently being sponsored by the legislative committee of the family law section of the New York State Bar Association and other bar associations and Which will be presented to the New York Legislature later this session property will no longer be automatically awarded by title to divorcing spouses but distributed instead to marital part ners according to economic need and other factors But while other pending matrimonial legislation does incorporate progressive measures such as maintenance in lieu of alimony and explicit recognition of the womans role in the marriage as homemaker Miss Sassower expressed disappointment that there was little support within the legal profession itself for the concept of nofault divorce which would allow people to divorce quickly and with dignity Under the New York Domestic Relations Law a couple may obtain a modified nofault divorce by mutual consent after being legally separated for year But because consent is not often given readily hundreds of thousands of people are forced to remain in unhappy marriages Thats one reason we have so many battered wives psychologically traumatized children and high juveniledelinquency rates said Miss Sassower who pointed out that 34 other states had already adopted nofault legislation We should provide the public with just and rational way to end their marriages without forcing them to engage in bitter court litigations to determine who is at fault Nine times out of 10 they are both at fault or the relationship is simply not working anymore But reform as Miss Sassowers mentor Arthur T Vanderbilt a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey often used to observe is not a sport for the shortwinded and few people illustrate that point better than the feminist attorney herself Feminism according to Miss Sassower means equality for both sexes and for that reason she has also undertaken the defense of men when she feels they are the victims of discrimination I like to take cases that will advance the cause of feminism in some way Miss Sassower said recently speaking about several of the sexdiscrimination cases she is currently litigating When I represent men in a custody case dont see it as a detriment to women Hopefully it will advance the idea that men should accept just as much responsibility for their children as women And once women can rid themselves of that feminine mystique of dependence they will better be able to find independence and true equality
"Ethics Courses Now Attracting Many MoreU.S. College, Students",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-ethics-courses-now-attracting-many-more-us-college.html,Courses on ethics once confined largely to departments of theology and philosophy have moved into the mainstream of American universities and professional schools At least half of the countrys 116 medical schools or about triple the number of five years ago now have humanities departMents or regular programs in medical ethics and a similar trend is evident in law engineering public policy and other professional schools At the undergraduate level courses are proliferating in applied ethical problems relating to such issues as nuclear power and population control and enrollment in preprofessional courses such as biomedical or legal ethics is soaring Professors in fields ranging from physics to soCiology now find themselves teaching ethics often in partnership with a theologian or philosophei and this in itself constitutes a major change in the academic climate There was a time when the discussion of ethics was questioned as being legitimatewhen there was a sharp distinction between facts and morals said Nicholas Sturgeon who teaches philosophy at Cornell University Among thereasons offered for the new concern with ethics is disillusionment with a strictly technical approach to such professions as law and medicine There is a growing recognition that understanding a patient requires a lot more than reading the test reports from the laboratory said K Danner Clouser of Pennsylvania State University who 10 years ago became the first philosophy professor to be hired for the faculty of a medical school The trend is also seen as related to the social and political unrest of the 1960s and in some fields it has clearly been spurred by the Watergate scandal and the resultant loss of faith in public officials Watergate really did the job Bruce Payne who teaches a new Ourse entitled Choice as Value Conflict to students of public policy at Duke University Ever since Nixon nobody his asked me why I am teaching course like that At the undergraduate level enrollment an the traditional survey courses in philo sophical and theological ethics remainsstrong but these are now being supplemented by at least three other approaches Solnecolleges such as Fordham University with its Values Program have put together collections of courses direct ed toward moral consciousness raising in a variety of disciplines Other institutions have taken a more Issueoriented approach In 1969 for example Cornell established the Center for Science Technology and Society which offers courses in conjunction with other departments on topics such as The Politics of IQ and Environmental Law tzdEthics Still others have created centers for ethical studies in single fields such as a Worcester Polytechnic Institute program in engineering ethics In both traditional ethics courses and the new centers there is a clear trend toWard courses that deal with practical problenis and many of the new undergraduafe courses have a strong preprofessional flavor At the State University of New York at Buffalo the philoso phy department began offering a course on medical ethics three years ago and it now attracts 100 students most of them in the pre  medical program Applied ethics courses are considered relevant to ones future career explained Kenneth Barber the departments director of graduate studies Similar patterns are evident in professional schools Virtually all of the countrys medical schools have at least course or two on medical ethics The Institute of Society Ethics and Life Sciences in HastingsonHudson NY which recently received a 197000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation to study the rise in ethics courses reports that since 1972 the number of medical schools with humanities and ethics programs has grown from 19 to nearly 60 At Penn State the medical school has an eightmember department of humanities that offers 15 courses Students must take at least two of them to graduate but about half takemore Themost popular elective is Medicine and Ethics which gees well beyond traditionaltopics like doctorpatient etiquette to issues such as euthanasia abortion and national priorities in health care  At Cornell the law school established Center for Law Ethics and Religion two years ago It is designed as John Lee Smith the director put it to provide occasions where students can see moral issues hidden in legal jargon and technicality Not long ago a group of 30 Cornell law students viewed a film about a man who had been burned and blinded in an automobile accident and wanted to hire a lawyer in order to get out of the hospital which would almost certainly mean his death In the ensuing discussion virtually all of the students began by taking the position that they would accede to the clients wishes They were not perceiving the moral diniensions of the case said Dr Smith a Yaletraiaed theologian They didnt sense the indecision and the guilt in the mans voice until it was pointed out to them At Penn State members of the hurnanitles department regulary accompany medical students on their rounds in hospitals and then discuss the ethical conse quences of medical decisions such as how to handle an unmarried teenage mothers interest in sterlization Last Month a professor or literature and a plastic surgeon at Penn State teamed up to offer a seminar on cleft palates and other facial deformities Students were asked to read a section of Mary Webbs Precious Bane a novel in which the heroine has a clefted lip They then viewed a series of slides of facial deformities ending with three slides of Picasso portraits in which the subjects seem to have cleft palates The idea was to give the students some information about how clefted people have been treated historicallythey were often considered to be of the devil as well as some training in the viewing of art and literature said Joanne Trautman the literature professor involved The students responded withsome moving descriptions of their own attitudes toward facial deformity including some accounts of their first encounter with it This carries over into medical care The increased interest in ethics has been prompted in part by such technological developments as lifesustaining medical equipment and computers with the capacity to infringe on personal privacy Stuart M Brown associate director of the undergraduate Science Technology and Society program at Cornell attributed its creation to the experience of academics who went to Washington in the late 196Ps They originally thought ofthemselves as physicists who were there to advise on physics and chemists who were there to advise on chemistry he said It took them awhile to realize that what they were doing was affecting human lives Renee Fox a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania Who also has an appointment in the medical school sees the new ethical concern as closely related to the political and social turmoil of the last decade Our society is going through a phase in history where we are reexamining basic beliefs and values she said In some cases you end up with neoindividualism like affirmations of the right to die In others you end up with changes in basic beliefs like the new definition of death Whenyou invite the soul from the heart to theupper regions of the brain you are dealing with nothing less than a new symbolic locus of personhood Thenew interestinethids courses has also posed new problemsIn some institutions facultycouncils have resisted Ives sure to deal with ethics on the ground that the issues are too subjective and even those favorable to the idea have warned against issueoriented courses that are popular but lack intellectual rigor Moreover colleges have not yet developed extensive teaching materials or reliable means of evaluating the content of many ethics courses At Stanford University the law school faculty decided in 1971 to handle ethical issues in regular courses If you haye a separate course you spend a lot of time explaining the context said Howard Williams who was chairman of the committee that made the decision The graduate business school at Stanford made the same decision but Arjay Miller the dean and former president of Ford Motor Company said he was uneasy about the whole subject I believe we ought to be doing more but Im not sure exactly what he said Its a problem of motivation and basic human values There are a lot of people injail today who have passed ethics courses

The Hidden News,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/22/archives/the-hidden-news-los-angeles.html,LOS ANGELESOver the last few days about 800 people have gathered here in a Congress of the Laity to discuss the religious and social issues of the day The idea behind the congress was that relieion was too serious to be left to the clergy alone and that social questions were too important to be left to political leaders The congress felt the people themselves must get more deeply involved in the spiritual and material conflicts of the nation Former President Gerald R Ford and his wife opened the congress and Howard E Butt Jr of Corpus Christi Tex stated its purpose The contemporary world he said cries out for creative competent moral leadership In response we are calling together men and women of prominence and influence from government and business from science and the arts from the professions from sports and entertainment and from family life who are open to the leadership of Jesus Christ Together we will break through the traditional barriers between liberals and conservatives We will examine the tension between secular leadership and Christian discipleship explore the interactions between Christianity and our culture discover the intellectual psychological and artistic implications of faith and build bridges of mutual support Well this is rather a tall order and while there was some useful plain talk about the clash between the sacred and the profane in American life it would be too much to say that the congress made any great breakthroughs or built many bridges beyond the consciousness of the participants Yet this congress may be a symbol of something important that is happening in American life some feeling that the young liberated generation distrusts its new freedom almost as much as the old values and is looking for guidance outside the established leaders of the religious intellectual and political communities Three themes seemed to recur in the discussions here First that the regrets perplexities and anxieties of our time couldnt be blamed alone on the failure of our religious and secular leaders but must also be a charge on the people themselves second that the majority of the American people may not believe but feel amputated without belief and at least believe in believing and third that there is a growing remnant of the people willing to take some responsibility for reviving a national debate on the moral foundations of the Republic One of the interesting things about this congress was that it didnt get lost in argument between sects or even the contemporary disputes over abortion or women in the clergy It crossed denominational and theological lines and reached out to the Bible classes among businessmen and the prayer breakfasts among politicians and the growing religious organizations of sports figures like Roger Staubach and Coach Landry of the Dallas Cowboys This democratization of the church has its secular counterpart in the universitiesagain not a major movement but an important symbol of change on the campuses Edward B Fiske of The New York Times reported this week that courses in ethics once confined largely to departments of theology and philosophy have moved into the mainstream of American universities and professional schools At least half of the nations 116 medical schools he reports or about triple the number five years ago now have humanities departments or regular programs in medical ethics and similar trend is evident in law engineering and other professional schools Vietnam and Watergate obviously had a lot to do with this How could so many officials and lawyers have connived at the war plans of Richard Nixon and the obstruction of justice in the Watergate conspiracy if they understood the countrys philosophy or the prohibitions of the Constitution All this is now being debated in the professional schools of the universities more intensely than it was before Mr Nixons moral crash Maybe it wont do much good H R Haldeman LOS ANGELES is still proving that it pays to be loyal to nobody even to the truth even to yourself but everybodys on to him now since his commercial success is even more repulsive than his political failure What to do about all this That is the question the Congress of the Laity was asking here in Los Angeles How can you get a hearing for the good things the yearnings in the American character when they are overwhelmed by sleazy twisters like Mr Haldeman The Congress of the Laity here had no answers to these questions but at least they tried and they did one thing in the process They reminded us that outside of Washington outside of all the arguments over the Middle East and the miners struggles in the Middle West there are a lot of people in this country literally millions of them in critical political areas who are thinking about the meaning and the deepest principles of this country and they want to be heard

so with regret concluded today that Richard Lapchick a political activist scratched a racial slur into his own abdomen before reporting to the police that he had been attacked Mr Lapchick a vocal critic of South Africas apartheid racial policy denied the findings by Dr Faruk Presswalla and said he remained confident he would be cleared of any wrongdoing Sgt W D Haden of the Virginia Beach police investigating the alleged attack on Mr Lapchick last week at Virginia Wesleyan College here said that the police havent formed any firm conclusions Dr Presswalla said that the shape of the wounds on Mr Lapchicks abdomen indicted hesitation on the part of the person inflicting them and that this was strong evidence that they were selfinflicted The wounds also were too regular the medical examiner said to have been inflicted by a hurried attacker And he added Mr Lapchicks medical reports in general did not bear out the contention by Mr Lapchick a 32yearold political science professor at Virginia Wesleyan that he had been beaten senseless by two masked men who then carved the misspelled racial slur niger n his abdomen Federal Court Blocks Illinois Abortion Curb Special to The New York Times CHICAGO Feb 23A new legal challenge has halted the enforcement of a controversial Illinois law that requires unmarried girls under the age of 18 to get their parents consent for abortions In a classaction suit filed in Federal District Court here on behalf of four doctors and two pregnant teenage girls the American Civil Liberties Union has charged that the law which went into effect Jan 1 violates the constitutional rights of the girls and the physicians On Jan 31 Judge Prentice H Marshall granted a temporary injunction against continued enforcement of the law Today he extended that injunction indefinitely In his 22page written opinion Judge Marshall called the law unduly burdensome and void on its face John A Dienner 3d a Cook County assistant states attorney said he expected to appeal the decision early next week Meanwhile minors may continue legally to have abortions without parental consent Federal Judge Clears Way For Nazi March in Skokie CHICAGO Feb 23 APFederal District Judge Bernard M Decker citing violations of freedom of speech and assembly today threw out three local ordinances by which the predominantly Jewish suburb of Skokie hoped to stop a Nazi march on April 20 the birthday of Adolf Hitler Mayor Albert J Smith of Skokie said that the village would appeal If it stands the decision apparently will have removed the last stumbling block in a long legal battle by Frank Collin and his National Socialist Party of America for the right to parade in Skokie in their storm trooper uniforms The Illinois Supreme Court recently overturned an injunction against the march In announcing the appeal today Mayor Smith said that to do less would mean that the village government is not representing the vyews and feelings of virtually every Skokie resident A spokesman or Mr Collin said of Judge Deckers ruling Its a fair and just decision In  view The ordinances banned the wearing of Nazi uniforms and the dissemination of offensive material such as banners and leaflets and required 350000 worth of insurance by groups planning marches Judge Decker said that although Skokie residents were revolted by the march it is better to allow those who preach racial hate to expend their venom in rhetoric rather than to be panicked into embarking on the dangerous course of permitting the Government to decide what its citizens may say and hear A TestTube Treatment For Sickle Cell Anemia BERKELEY Calif Feb 23 UPIA new technique for treating sickle cell anemia has been developed in a test tube the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory said today The next step will be to test the method on humans it is said Sickle cell anemia a hereditary disease of the red blood cells affects 50000 people in the United States mostly blacks The Lawrence Laboratory has found that a chemical called imidester if injected and then trapped in red cells will inhibit abnormal hemoglobin from sickling or forming into a rigid crescent shape Sickle cells tangle and block blood vessels causing a loss of red cells which leads to complications that can cause early death Lester Packer a Lewrence physiologist said Our experiments have shown this treatment can prevent distortion of the molecules We have done it with human blood in the test tube If we can do this in patients then the clinical symptoms of the disease and the complications should not occur Carolina to Bolster Drive On Cigarette Smuggling RALEIGH NC Feb 23 UPIGov James B Hunt Jr said today that his state would bolster its effort to curb the smuggling of cigarettes from North Carolina to other states He said that a special agent from the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety would work with other state and local law enforcement officials and with their counterparts from other states to help determine the extent of the smug gling problem North Carolina the nations largest tobacco producer has a tax of 2 cents on each pack of cigarettes Taxes in some Northern states exceed 20 cents and officials there have suggested that North Carolina increase its tax to remove the incentive for smuggling which in New York alone is said to cost 400 million year in lost revenue If we expect people in other states to cooperate with us weve got to be sensitive to their problems the Governor said He added however that he saw no need to increase North Carolinas cigarette tax Hamilton Jordans

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/24/archives/letters-mideast-what-a-mediator-must-not-do-on-mrs-abzugs-loss.html,To the Editor The present restless phase of the Mideast peace process and the United States mediatory role in it involve some delicate points of international law It is true that international law admits initiatives by way of suggestions from a mediator No less clearly however it frowns on activities by a mediator which are prejudicial to one side unless first cleared with that side The abject failure of Dr Jarrings earlier mission should be a warning to all intermediaries Israel has complained that Secretary Vances recent pronouncement about the status of settlements in the Sinai violates the mediatory role since was calculated without prior consultation with Israel to impair its negotiating position It does not answer this complaint to say that similar statements have previously been made before the United States began to act in its mediatory role The Secretary of State in his MacNeilLehrer TV appearance Feb 14 while defending his above pronouncement declined to reply to the question whether Israel might have grounds for arguing in the negotiations that at this point settlements in Sinai were essential for defense of its final borders This reticence points to a further confusion of international law issues The Secretarys above pronouncement on illegality of the settlements was as observed incongruous with the role of mediator But it also confused the question of Israels past rights during belligerency with what Israel may lawfully propose in negotiations for a treaty of peace International law in no way prohibits a state which in defending itself against repeated armed attacks has occupied part of its attackers territory from seeking in the peace treaty territorial arrangements to prevent further attacks This is in no way affected by whether Israel has previously sought to establish settlements or whether such settlements are legal Moreover in such a case international law permits that stateunder the centuriesold and stilllive doctrine of uti possidetisto maintain its territorial status quo as at the ceasefire until negotiations for peace are consummated in agreement It is these very negotiations in which the United States is mediator Even were the Secretarys view of past settlements correct its public reiteration would be irrelevant to the process of negotiating a peace treaty This irrelevance would redouble the wrong done to Israels negotiating position In that negotiation the mediators irrelevant imputation flouts clear international law and practice From time immemorial this has entitled a state repeatedly the victim of armed attack to seek in the treaty of peace territorial arrangements reasonably related to the forestalling of similar future attacks And on his recent US visit President Sadat admitted that he could not exclude renewal of such attacks by his successors Even at this stage one may hope that American advisers may recognize that the mediators role forbids prejudicial and uncleared public assertions about the legal status of the Sinai settlements at least as severely as it forbids his similar public assertions concerning territorial arrangements necessary for Israels security in the Sinai buffer zone A mediator violates the rights of Israel by the former at least as much as he would violate those of Egypt by the latter JULIUS STONE San Francisco Feb 15 1978 The writer is Distinguished Professor of International Law and Jurisprudence at the University of Californias Hastings College of the Law On Mrs Abzugs Loss To the Editor Every Democrat in New York should be perturbed puzzled and perplexed by Mrs Abzugs defeat Is the loss of a seat in Congress so insignificant to warrant the total abstention from the campaign by Messrs Koch Carey and Carter One doubts whether Mrs Abzug like Muhammed Ali will have the opportunity to stage a rematch andMrs Abzug should feel more angry at the rejection by her political peers than by her constituents CHARLES F KAUFFMAN New York Feb 16 1978  To the Editor It was indeed heartening to witness the defeat of Mrs Bella Abzug at the polls Let all take notice that the people of New York are no longer being guided in their votes by the choices of the party machine whose nominations are not necessarily predicated on representative ability but rather on party affiliation The mandate seems clear The raucous voice of invective and abuse does not appeal to the majority of our electorate The voice of the people has also indicated to those who gave their support to Mrs Abzug including the President and the Mayor and The New York Times to name but a few that choices had better be based on acceptable values if they want to keep their credibility RAYMOND E SALMAN New York Feb 15 1978 Educational Limit Tb the Editor In your recent article discussing administrators concern over the school days which have been lost because of this winters bad weather Dr Harry Mix Superintendent of Port Chester schools is quoted as having said We dont want to postpone graduation and there isnt much use for education after the Regents exams One wonders whether Port Chester schools would open in September if the Regents exams were discontinued THEODORE H COPELAND Jr Rosemont Pa Feb 9 1978 Lonesome Animals To the Editor So many of the animals in Central Park zoo have died When I was a child there were four seals splashing about in the pool by the Arsenal Now there is one One beaver huddles at the edge of the otherwise deserted Beaver Pond Other animals have lost their mates including the elephant and the polar bear I have just come back to New York after many years absence and its very sad to find Central Park Zoo becoming a ghost zoo But I feel sorriest of all for the animals left behind Solitary confinement is no easier on animals than it is on human beings I understand that Tina the elephant has sent two keepers to the hospital since she lost her mate a couple of years ago I know these animals fate is less dramatic than that of the dolphin or the baby seal but it is much crueler Besides these are our animals If the city cant afford replacements for lost mates could a public subscription fund be started And if that isnt possible either I suggest we send the survivors to zoos where they will have some company even if that means disbanding Central Park Zoo HALINA BOROWSKA Staten Island NY Feb 11 1978 The `Small Price of Medicaid Abortions To the Editor Health Education and Welfare Secretary Califano has now announced how he plans to implement the new Federal law denying abortions to Medicaid recipients except for victims of rape or incest The regulations that his department imposed were the most liberal with the widest interpretation possible to allow abortions within the framework of the law Many of us sighed with relief when we learned of this interpretation It is more humane After sighing with  relief however I became angry I was angry with the fact that poor women wanting abortions could now get them at just a small pricelying and cheating when necessary If you want an abortion and you can afford it no problems are presented If you are too poor for that now all you need to do is claim that you were raped or that incest took place and report it within the proper number of months to a Federal agency That will be the end of the problem It strikes me that we have made the poor understand that laws are meant to be disregarded or turned around and that that is the way to make the system work for you You become streetwise the way of survival for the poor Passing laws that are to be disregarded and circumvented is basically selfdestructive to our society If we are to be a civilized society that lives by law then we must pass laws that are to be obeyed and not to become instruments of perfecting fraud Sad as this situation is the next step in this unfortunate situation is that statistics will be culled from these abortion requests and middleand upperclass America will be shocked to learn how much rape and incest takes place among the poor And so the downward cycle of lying followed by statistics to prove whatever we want to prove will continue to obscure this fundamental need and right of Door women in America ADELE S BRONSTON Jamaica NY Feb 13 1978 Questionable Analogy To the Editor Stevens B Harris in his letter of Feb 4 draws an analogy between the Founding Fathers of Israel and the USA implying that the Zionist settlers following the example set by the Puritans should annex Arab territory and deplete it of its inhabitants Such historical analogies could be of some relevance and interest after all the slogan a land without a people for a people without a land was shared by Puritans and Zionists alike Both believed that they had divine sanction to expand and depopulate However such analogies prove to be of dubious value once subjected to close scrutiny The Zionists far from settling in a land without a people landed in a densely populated area with complex cultural traditions and a history going back for several millennia Moreover the history of the 20th century leaves no doubt that processes of annexation and depopulation are no longer condoned by the oppressed or the world community But above all the Palestinian Arabs with their resistance movement and various political cultural and social institutions are no red Indians leading a static or pastoral life Probably the Israelis would be better off if they were to cast off some of their religicnational myths as well as their illusions about themselves and others Rather than see themselves as ancient Israelites heroically entering the Land of Canaan they should perhaps realize that they  belong to the modern Middle East and consequently that they have to come to terms with the Palestinians I think this is not too much to ask A M ELMESSIRI Adviser on Cultural Affairs The League of Arab States New York Feb 16 1978 NewFound Concern To the Editor In his criticism of the recently published advertisement of the Catholics Concerned for the Future of Israel and Its Arab Neighbors Lord Caradon argues that the Palestinians have the right to set up an independent home in the West Bank and Gaza [letter Feb 12] In his righteous zeal for the Palestinian cause he is entitled to ignore the problem of Israels security But why should he ignore the fact that for 19 years from 1948 till 1967 when those territories were actually under Arab occupation there was no mention of an independent Palestine state from the Palestinians the Arabs or from Lord Caradon Isnt it altogether strange that just when it would have been easy to set up a Palestinian state no one mentioned it Could it be that Lord Caradons present letter of concern and not the Catholicsponsored advertisement is onesided propaganda Rabbi CHAIM PEARL Bronx Feb 15 1978 About Managing Well To the Editor In a Feb 15 letter John P Richardson states that Israel lived within the pre1967 borders for almost 20 years and managed quite well If unrestrained antiIsraeli terrorism and three wars are considered managing quite well one can only imagine how much better Israel will manage if returned to the pre1967 borders During the same 20year period Palestinian Arabs of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were under the thumb of Jordan and Egypt Perhaps it is they who managed well since we heard no demands for selfdetermination an independent state legitimate rights or even human rights

special hourlong trip into outer space Set in the yeat 2222 AD the story line centers around Adam Quark Richard Benjamin commander of a starship called theUnited Galaxy Sanitation Patrol Affording an uncanny commentary on theseries itself Quarks stock in trade is garbage Obviously meant as a dizzy parody of Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind the Quark concept is caught in a dilemma For those who like myself have not seen those films the parody is largely meaningless and therefore silly For the many devoted fans of the films the parody is likely to be profoundly insulting This leaves the readers of dumb comic books as a potential audience Tonight Quark and his sanitation crew are sent out to destroy a Gorgon domsday ship bent on conquering the entire galaxy Quarks only weapon is The Source a disembodied voice that in Tinkerbell fashion is constantly urning everyone to believe in its extraordinary powers Quarks crew includes Officer Ficus more vegetable than animal

format produced and written by Ernest Chambers and Mr Manilow the direction is being handled by George Schaefer normally associated with drama specials The result is an unusual and appealing glimpse of the performer as a person more than an object in a dazzling white sequined costume playing for shrieking fans Most of the program is set in Hollywoods Pantages Theater where Mr Manilow sporting a Brooklyn College sweatshirt goes without an audience to indulge in fantasies that range from old Copacabana nightclub shows to imitations of 1940s groups in the style of the Modernaires The personality that comes across is warm boyish attractively goofy Ray Charles is the only guest star appearing to inject soul into a Manilow medley that includes Its a Miracle  Most of Mr Manilows material though borders on bubblegum inspirational For a finale he sings Looks Like We Made It before his typical screaming audience most of which seems to be composed of girls just this side of puberty The 32yearold performer thus joins the ranks of other seemingly ageless stars eg Henry Winkler who continue to be the idols of passionate teen brigades   Reducing just about every major  event

A New Survey of Teen‐Age Sex With Teen‐Agers Asking the Questions,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/25/archives/a-new-survey-of-teenage-sex-with-teenagers-asking-the-questions-a.html,New York teenagers are more likely to be sexually active if they live in singleparent household than if they live in an intact family Boys tend to be more deeply Influenced by peer pressure than are girls Many teenagers claim they knowall the essentials of birth control but few in fact are aware of when conception is possible Teenage mothers have the same longrange goals as their less burdened peers and do not grant marriage much importance in their list of priorities These are some of the findings to emerge from the Youth Values Project a study of teenage sexuality sponsored by the Population Institute a nonprofit organization that encourages couples to limit the size of their families and by the State Communities Aid Association a nonprofit health and welfare agency But the project which began two years ago has been conducted by teenagers recruited from such places as schools and churches Twentyfive youngsters developed the questionnaire helped find the respondents and did the analysis Why another sex survey when so many have already documented the alarming escalation of teenage pregnancy Susan Ross the 31yearold project director explained Research on adolescent sexuality has focused too much on information and access to contraception and not enough on motivation We wanted to clarify the reasons teenagers do or dont use birth control A Diverse Sample The respondents as well as the researchers who became known as youth consultants and were paid 265 an hour for their work reflect the citys diverse population They come from the ghettos of the Bronx and Brooklynand from the wealthy enclaves of the East Side they represent every ethnic and socioeconomic group Of the 1543 quesionnaires distributed an unusually high 73 percent were returned However that does not mean each respondent answered every question in some cases quesions did not apply and in others they were ignored But all of the significant questions drew responses from the vast majority of youngsters to whom they applied The final study group of 13through 19yearolds totaled 1000 of which 667 were female and 333 male Twohundred eightynine were white 494 were black 126 were Hispanic and 91 were classified as other Sixtytwo percent of the females and 70 percent of the males said they had had sex Although anyone who had had Intercourse even once was classified for research purposes as sexually active the greatest number said they had sex regularly The fact that teenagers who live in singlepatent homes are more likely to be sexually active was one of the more significant findings Miss Ross said that the survey looked at such aspects of a youngsters life as income level and race but that these did not seem as significant in predicting sexual activity as did the number of parents in the household Claudio Sturla 17 of Manhattan senior at Stuyvesant High School said If theres only one parent at home in Getting married was clearly not considered crucial by the youngsters surveyed 95 percent of the cases its the mother And if a guy is living with his mother what can she say to him In fact what can she say to a daughter The mother is likely to be having sex herself and the daughter sees a strange man at the breakfast table Use of Contraceptives Fiftyfour percent of the femaies responding to the question said they used contraceptives For males that figure dropped to 49 percent Although race seemed to have little bearing on the attitudes covered by the study it did correlate with the reasons girls chose not to use birth control When asked why they didnt use contraception black females most often answered Its bad for my health Hispanics said I dont have sex often enough to need it but they also stressed health White girls said I dont have sex often enough to need it It is unnatural and I dont know enough about it in equal numbers There was far more unanimity among the boys No matter what their race they all cited interference with pleasure as the leading reason The

decided during the course of their research that teenagers fall into three distinct groups based on attitudes on birth control There is a large number who do In fact lack information and access Miss Ross said If we increase the number of clinics and make them appropriate to the needs of teenagers it would solve many of their problems But there isa second group who arent motivated to use birth control regardless of whether its available They claim its not worth the hassling with the pharmacist or doctor that it makes sex seem too planned or that theyre afraid of their parents finding it The third category comprises the teenagers Who want to have babies becaUse they have no other options Theyie not getting a good education and theYre not prepared for work They have no sense of any opportunity and Im not sure that theyre not right she said Doreen Thomas 18 a graduate of Mabel bean Bacon Vocational High School deliberately became pregnant last year Its not that I didnt have other

What Feminists Really Believe,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/26/archives/westchester-opinion-what-feminists-really-believe.html,As a member of the National Organization for Women and as a Roman Catholic whose heart is fully with the Right to Life movement I protest against Miss Lengerss narrow accusations To state as she has that feminists hate men is to insult and ignore the majority of feminists who seek a healthy loving equality with men as an alternative to the parasitically imbalanced marriages of the past Whereas Miss Lengers would prefer the stagnancy of destructive sex roles feminists dare to be human beings integrating all facets of their personalities into selfacceptance Neither do feminists hate children as evidenced by the fact that most feminists either are or plan to become mothers Children are not a scourge but a blessing as Miss Lengers would learn if she had educated herself by reading one of the many feminist books on the joy of giving birth and on nonsexist childrearing As to Miss Lengerss view of abortion which I share it is sad that she should confuse this issue with all the others of womens rights While feminist groups have sought and continue to seek legal ized abortion I am certain that feminists whether they favor it or not would agree that abortion is an unhappy affair both for the psychological andor the physical injury to the woman and for the lost potential of the child Therefore rather than encouraging abortion feminists see family planning in accordance with personal religious be liefs as the ultimate goalso that all children will be wanted and loved Miss Lengerss inexplicable horror of school athletic teams for both boys and girls is undermined by the normal healthiness of such justice Whether Miss Lengers objects to teams of mixed ex or to the idea of a girls football team her fear is unwarranted Young women and men benefit from competiive sports both in body and mind And Miss Lengers fears that we as a sex are no fragile for such exertion she ought lo recall the strengthening effects of physical exercise coinhinecl with the in herent danger of approving physical weakness in women The prospect of coeducational teams chosen by the same stringent standards need not alarm Miss Lengers If she fears possible injury in mixed football games for example she may take comfort in the fact that injury is just as likely in an allfemale or allmale game If physical contact between the sexes during such games is objectionable the presence of protective padding and the unlikeliness of intentional contact between teammates intent on winning should ease Miss Lengerss mind The authors Ironic instinct of selfpreservation becomes apparent in her remarks about the draft Women have been proven capable of warfare if necssary in many societies including that of modern Israel The thought of killing is nonetheless repugnant to most women and men and warfare remains a moral problem for all human beings The ab surdity of creating an issue of female conscription would be demonstrated by Miss Lengerss response to the question of Whether her son is more expendable than her daughter to a senseless death Women do not need the protection of the law as Miss Lengers implies Instead women need the support of the law as men do so that wage parity equal employment benefits and equal job and educational opportunities replace lopsided alimony burdens and economic discrimination Although Miss Lengers has admitted her terrible fear of feministsand her fear coupled with misinformation is a fertile source of bigotry and sexismshe must reeducate herself The equal rights amendment not only would give her the absolute right to be prolife prochurch and prochildren but also would give that right to feminists  The ERA would not force anyone to demand his or her rights nor would it encourage spouses and parents to abandon Indeed if the dire predictions of ERA foes have any validity it is in their betrayal of exaggerated insecurities Contrary to Miss Lengerss twisted reasoning we are all proud to be women thi3 pride is the source and the strength of feminism Women must be free to be mothers doctors wives or lawyers we must be free to choose so that our daughters and sons will inherit our freedom  To state that feminists hate men is to insult the majority of feminists who seek a healthy loving equality with men
The Birth of Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/26/archives/the-birth-of-birth-control-birth.html,The Birth Control Movement and American Society Since 1830 By James Reed Illustrated 456 pp New York Basic Books 1795 WHEN our American ancestors tried to prevent the birth of too many of us descendants they resorted to a variety of methods Coitus interruptus was the 19thcentury favorite In addition there were douches sponges potions and powders the rhythm method although experts disagreed on the rhythm eventually the condom and diaphragm and when all else tailed abortion As the steaany aecumng birth rate after 1800 testifies birth control worked enough times for enough people But more than physiological outcome was at stake Huge social and moral principles rode on that microscopic encounter between sperm and egg Proponents spoke out fervently in the name of racial progress marital stability womens health womens rights Until a generation ago however they were outshouted by pronatalists The Roman Catholic Church denounced contraception of course but so did most Protestant clergymen because it permitted in Peter G Fllene is the author of HimHerSelf Sex Roles in Modern America tercourse without procreation pleasure without consequences gratification as an end in itself Victorian civic leaders agreed If a douche or condom replaced human selfcontrol morality would explode into license and the family would fall apart For their own reasons physicians agreed Preoccupied with maintaining their newly won professional status against the patentmedicine men American Medical Association leaders refused to test the reliability of different contraceptive techniques and instead urged women to enter motherhood gladly and often Meanwhile Federal and state legislators passed laws that banned the dissemination of contraceptive and other obscene materials trol as a medical service only in the 1960s were the laws repealed By then the conventional wisdom had turned the population problem inside out instead of too few people too many By then advocates of birth control were no longer rebels quacks or criminals they were prophets illuminated by the halos of ecology and womens liberation In a story so charged with emotion where the stakes were and are so high how does a scholar proceed James Reed a historian at Rutgers University has chosen a strategy that avoids partisan subjectivity as well as deittiPan objeciiVity He looks over the shoulders of four individuals who played significant parts in the birthcontrol movement Most famous was Margaret Sanger who went from nursing to sociaMm to a Continued on Page 37 lifelong crusade for contraception in the name of womens rights Robert Dickinson a gynecologist worked tirelessly for medical sanction of birth control as a way to strengthen marital life Clarence Gamble a medical researcher and heir to the soap fortune spent both fortune and talent in vain on developing a contraceptive device simple enough for uneducated lowerclass women And finally there was Gregory Pincus a biologist whose experiments with parthenogenesis among rabbits eventually produced the little pill that caused the big revolution Each of these four brought different professional training and ideological purpose to the birthcontrol movement Mr Reed plays no favorites On each protagonist he lavishes analysis as well as compassion We witness Mrs Sangers egocentricity and opportunism but Mr Reed reminds us of her own conviction that she was acting on behalf of womankind We accompany Dr Dickinson on his 15year quest through the narrowminded labyrinth of AMA politics but Mr Reed tells us why the doctors resisted and why the quest despite its many compromises and few achieveworth the effort So far so good The books truly impressive feature however is that it develops the evidence into a theory of change Mr Reed is not telling a heroic history but a social history Although heroes were necessary to the success of birth control none could succeed until social values were receptive Success did not depend on the discovery of a spermproof device It depended on the willingness of Americans  especially Americans in power  to accept the device And that willingness developed only after traditional ideas of progress sexuality and womens role in the family began to wane Gregory Pincuss pill would have been accorded the same censorship as Mrs Sangers diaphragm if values had not changed in the meantime By the mid1960s social scientists emphasis on the population explosion along with pressures from developing nations finally persuaded the Federal Government to support fertility con This book is long serious and resolutely empirical Mr Reed has mastered an awesome amount of material ranging from medical journals and pharmaceuticalcompany account books to private letters and his own interviews with a dozen veterans of the contraception movement That sort of research requires patience more than five years from him many hours from his readers Because he wants to be fair both to his historical subjects and to the truth Mr Reed methodically assembles the evidence before drawing conclusions and making judgments During the 13 pages of Gregory Pincuss troubled relations with Harvard and with Clark University and the five pages on hormone research my patience wore thin On the whole however Mr Reed has managed to keep the larger argument in focus More important he never loses our trust His scrupulousness tends to subdue flashy phrases and speculations but the other side of this sober coin is reliability Mr Reeds book deserves a place between its two notable predecessors David Kennedys Birth Control in America 1970 which includes stern criticisms of Mrs Sanger and lucid syntheses of ideas in a discussion of the period from 1900 to World War II  and Womans Body Womans Right 1976 in which Linda Gordon interprets the history of birth control with a radical feminist perspective that raises consciousness and Together these three works teach us how private and public history intersect Pregnancy has not been simply a personal matter or even a subjective question of vice or virtue It has also belonged to politics economics and technology This is a large lesson and an illuminating one

against the National Organization for WOrnen accusing it of antitrust violations for urging conventions to boycott the State because it hadinot ratified the proposed equai rignts ainenoment The merits of the proposed amendment are not at issue state Attorney General John Ashcroft Said in announcing the suit filed in Federl District Court The issue is the intentional economic harm to our state and its citizens and the inability of those harmed to defend themselves Mr Ashcroft said that the suit did not seek damages but asked the court to issue an injunction ordering the womens rights organization to end its boycott There was no immediate comment from the group By the groups figures Mr Ashcroft said Kansas City has lost 8 million and St Louis 10 million because of the boycott which has been joined by about 90 organizations That dollar loss will mean a loss of jobs and reduction in tax revenues to the cities and the state Mr Ashcroft said These businesses and individuals cannot ratify the equal rights amendment Only the Legislature can do so Consequently the persons harmed by the boycott can of themselves do nothing to keep from continuing to be harmed LOS ANGELES Feb 28

Surge of Vandalism Hits Abortion Clinics,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/02/archives/surge-of-vandalism-hits-abortion-clinics-vandalism-and-threats.html,WASHINGTON March 1Ten days ago someone posing as a delivery man and carrying a plastic bag walked into the Concerned Womens Clinic in Cleveland and rushed down the hall to an operating room The bag contained gasp line which he splashed in the face of a technician temporarily blinding her He then spread it around the room set afire and fled In an adjoining room a 20yearold woman was having an abortion As flames swept into the room and smoke rolled down the hallway the woman leaped off the table and  ran out A counselor threw her a coat and she and 15 other patients dressed in paper gowns escaped The woman was taken to a hospital where her operation was completed The fire which caused 30000 in damage and put the clinic out of business is the most serious of a number of recent incidents of violence or vandalism at abortion clinics around the country In a little more than a year at least five other clinics have been forced to close or move because of fire firebombs or chemical bombs although the Cleveland incident was the only one that happened while the building was occupied Other clinics have experienced repeated vandalism threatening telephone calls and increasingly hostile picketers according to a survey by the National Abortion Rights Action League Some clinics have hired security guards arranged for extra police protection or provided escorts for their patients The Planned Parenthood Clinic in St Paul where a fire set on Feb 23 1977 caused 250000 in damages and forced the suspension of abortion services for six months warns its patients that they may face hostile pickets In the Washington suburb of Fairfax the Northern Virginia Womens Medical Center succeeded last week after more than a year of regular picketing in obtaining a preliminary court injunction to keep the demonstrators off clinic property It was a step that Sharon McCann the clinics administrator had hoped to avoid she said because she strongly believes in the rights of free speech and assembly But on a halfdozen occasions in the last year she said the picketers barged into the clinic harassed the patients and took over the telephones to tell callers that the clinic was closed On Feb 11 Miss McCann was thrown to the floor a coowner William Longstreth suffered a knee sprain a nurse was injured and a woman guest six and a half months pregnant was trampled on according to Miss McCann A dozen demonstrators have been charged with trespassing in these incidents but two Fairfax County judges have acquitted them on a common law principle the defense of necessity They had a goodfaith belief Judge Lewis Griffith said last October that their actions were necessary to save lives Softie of the most ardent picketers at abortion clinics are members of the National Right to Life Committee but the groups president Dr Mildred Jefferson of Boston said We are not violent people She dismissed the picketing as so much sideshow activity Those people who are most visible in organized groups are not the ones who are succeeding in accomplishing our goals she said in an interview We believe in working within the system and those who are most successful at that are not in the spotlight Most people will never know who they are No one has taken responsibility for the fires or bombings and no one has been charged But some prochoice activists say they suspect that some individual proponents of the righttolife movement are growing impatient with orderly attempts to outlaw abortion Susan Bilycu a counselor at the Concerned Womens Clinic which was heavily vandalized two days before the fire said she did not believe that the picketing or violence would deter women from having abortions People are still calling regularly she said and the answering service is referring them to other clinics AL the St Paul clinic services have been increased despite the fire a year ago an unexploded bomb found outside the building two weeks ago vandalism and daily picketing according to Torn Webber executive director of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota He said that women had been accosted by picketers chased in the parking lot and verbally abused that the lives of two board members children had been threatened that vandals had repeatedly thrown garbage against the building and had twice sealed the outside locks with glue Still he said patient service programs were up 10 percent within the last year and the number of private donors had more than doubled The same is not true for the Northwest Womens Center of Columbus which has been operating out of a doctors office since a fire on Jan 8 caused 200000 in damage The police say it was arson but have no suspects A fire that destroyed about 75 percent of the Ladies Clinic in Omaha last August also was set according to the abortion league The league says that the authorities determined that at least four bottles of gasoline had been thrown through window The Vermont Womens Health Center in Burlington was destroyed by fire last May and was closed for seven months The state police never made a conclusive finding on the cause Capt Earl Martin said yesterday There have been several incidents in Cincinnati Last November according to Ann Mitchell of Planned Parenthood of Cincinnati a man broke into the Christ Church medical buildinab before it opened and set fire to a crib in the reception area Planned Parenthood is among several groups that use the building but no abortions are performed there Also last November she said a firebomb was thrown at a window of the Margaret Sanger Clinic but did not explode And last month a chemical bomb was thrown through a window at the Wdmens Center there It did not explode but the clinic was closed for nine days after the incident Mrs Mitchell said she was hiring escorts for women coming to the Sanger clinic which is picketed daily by a group canine itself Concerned Citizens
"Mrs, Humphrey Poses Problem for Potential Rivals",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/03/archives/mrs-humphrey-poses-problem-for-potential-rivals-impact-of.html,MINNEAPOLIS March 2Muriel Humphreys appointment to the United States Senate has created a sizable problem for potential candidates in both of Minnesotas maior parties When she was named by Gov Rudy Perpich to succeed her late husband Hubert H Humphrey the move was widely applauded within the DemocraticFarmerLabor Party as the ideal means of honoring the popular Senator and his widow and also of blunting the criticism of the rival IndependentRepublican Party that the four highest statewide elective offices were filled by appointees All four offices will be on the ballot in November The DFL leaders were certain that few IndependentRepublicans would risk the wrath of Minnesota voters by taunting the appointees as long as Mrs Humphrey was one of them And most of those in her own party who had designs on the Senate seat were just as sure that she would serve only as a caretaker with no desire to seek election in November to the remaining four years of her husbands term But since her appointment the 66yearold Mrs Humphrey has steadfastly declined to say whether she will seek the nomination indicating only that she will make up her mind before the states Congressional District party conventions begin in late April And as the first step in the nominating process got under way this week at caucuses in the states 4000 precincts Mrs Humphreys indecision weighed heavily on possible rivals in both parties In the DFL those seeking the seat had to take the chance of being labeled insensitive and pushy if they appeared to be challenging her for the nomination Among the Independent  Republicans those generally considered the strongest potential candidates were holding back all but openly conceding that they would not run if Mrs Humphrey entered the race Among the Democrats the various aspirants have handled the problem in different ways Donald M Fraser the liberal Congressman in the Fifth District who in the cause of party unity earlier agreed to forgo his intended challenge of Senator Wendell R Anderson has declared that he will seek nomination for the other Senate seat whether Mrs Humphrey runs or not Hes said that hes a candidate all the way said Eric Mathenaon a spokesman for Mr Fraser who has also said that he will not seek reelection to the House However others noted that Martin Sabo speaker of the State House of Representatives who has announced for the Fifth District Congressional race has said that he will step aside if Mr Fraser changes his mind before the July filing date The majority leader of the State Senate Nicholas Coleman has taken a more cautious approach in his bid for the United States Senate nomination one designed Dot to offend supporters of Mrs Humphrey We have put together a pretty good statewide organization he said But have said if she runs I will not Robert E Short the millionaire lawyer and businessman who once owned the WashiugtoOenators and later the Texas Rangers baseball teams and who has been a longtime contributor to Democratic causes announced last week that he would run for the seat if Mrs Humphrey did not Meanwhile Representative James L Oberstar of the Eighth District who had been the principal hope of the partys strong antiabortion or prolife faction said that he would not seek the Senate nomination and urged Mrs Humphrey to run Prolife is very very powerful in our state maybe as much as 40 percent this year but Jim doesnt want to be labeled a oneissue candidate said Tom Reagan Mr Oberstars administrative assistant Mrs Humphrey wouldnt have to campaign that hard and she would bring all of Huberts pluses and none of his negatives We just think that shed be a unifying force Although Mrs Humphrey has taken position similar to Mr Frasers one that accepts the Supreme Courts ruling that women should have freedom of choice on abortions Mr Reagan added Her stand on prolife doesnt change our stand a bit although that may be one stand we would disagree on As for the IndependentRepublicans they are having difficulty getting anyone of stature to announce for the Humphrey seat until Mrs Humphrey declares her intentions A spokesman for Bill Frenzel the moderatetoliberal Republican Congressman from the Third District said that he would not make a decision for at least a month And George Berg administrative assistant to Tom Hagedorn the conservative Republican Congressman in the Second District said Well hes still consid ering it Hes toetesting the waters but were not going to make a decision perhaps until Mrs Humphrey makes her decision All of this makes Vern Neppl the IndependentRepublican state chairman nervous Ive been telling our pospective candidates Frenzel and Hagedorn that dont think shes going to run he said Theyve got to take the bull by the horns and if she does so what Ithink they would be better respected if they would go regardless of what Muriel does In the meantime Mr Neppl is convinced that the IndependentRepublicans have a chance to make some gains this year against the solidly entrenched DemocraticFarmerLabor Party He thinks Senator Anderson may be more vulnerable than many people suspect because as Governor Mr Anderson had himself appointed to the seat vacated when Walter F Mondale was elected to the Vice Presidency Rudy Boschwitz plywood merchant and Republican National Committeeman is the favorite to get the nomination o oppose him The Anderson move set off a chain of appointments in elective offices with Mr Perpich stepping up from Lieutenant Governor to Governor and Alec Olson the president of the State Senate becoming Lieutenant Governor That gave the IndependentRepublicans an issue that they have been hammering on gleefully Albert H Quie the 10term Republican Congressman in the First District who is seeking his partys gubernatorial nomination has perhaps made the point most tellingly in his campaign billboards Something scarey is going to happen to the DFL they read Its called an election
A POLL OF CATHOLICS POINTS UP DIVERSITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/03/archives/a-poll-of-catholics-points-up-diversity-college-graduates-are-held.html,A major new study of Roman Catholics in the United States shows that those with college degrees are increasingly likely to reject church teachings on such issues as abortion but are less inclined than in the past to abandon Catholicism The survey conducted by the Gallup Poll for the Catholic Press Association and released yesterday also shows that college graduates compared with those whose formal education ended at high school are more involved in such religious practices as attendance at mass and meditation The findings present a striking contrast to the common impression of greater defection from the church among highly educated Catholics and sharpens the image of the church as an increasingly diverse body of belief and practice Other findings drawn from a cross section of Catholics include evidence of rising interest in Bible study a practice that was largely unknowfl on the popular level a decade ago and a strong preference for greater ecumenical involvement among Christian churches On the abortion issue 44 percent of the respondents agreed that the church should relax its standards forbidding all abortions under any circumstances while 47 percent held the opposite view The results indicate a further liberalizing tendency among Catholics Collegetrained Catholics represent growing proportion of the church 28 percent in 1976 as against 17 percent a decade before and their influence on church policy is mounting As pictured by the survey the college graduates tend to think more independently than other groups do about a variety of moral issues and defining loyalty to the church in less conventional ways For example many of those who dissented from certain church teachings nevertheless appeared to consider themselves valid Catholics The Rev Andrew M Greeley a Catholic priest and director of the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago refers to this phenomenon as the emergence of the communal Catholic whose commitment is to a core of spiritual beliefs rather than to church rules The Gallup survey consisted of 1405 interviews with Catholics from Aug to Oct 3 Questions covered such subjects as church teachings reading and television habits and personal convictions Though persons with no more than grade school education continued to show the highest general levels of devotion to church practice and its traditional teachings the college graduates pulled ahead of high school graduates in several areas of spiritual concern  For example 56 percent of the college group said that religious beliefs were very important to them as against 49 percent of the high school group and 65 percent of the grade school group College graduates were also found to be more interested than the others in such religious experiences as speaking in tongues a charismatic practice and mysticism The same group showed greater interest in attending mass frequently and reciting the rosary Thirtysix percent of all respondents said that they had recited the rosary in the previous month 32 percent had meditated and 23 percent had read the Bible The apparent rising interest in religious diversity is indicated at several places in the survey College graduates for instance were considerably more favorable to allowing the use of the old Latin mass which was supplanted by a new order of the mass at the behest of the Second Vatican Council Seventythree percent of the college group favored granting permission to use the old liturgy as against 61 percent of the high school graduates and 56 percent of the grade school group At the same time all three groups strongly endorsed the reforms of Vatican 11 College graduates also led the way advocating changes in church law to allow divorced Catholics to remarry in the church and to permit the use of artificial means of birth control

article [Do Womens Liberationists Play Destructive Role Feb 12] my immediate reaction to it was What is this woman talking about Her facts are incorrect her point of view is twisted her reasons and considerations are illogical But then I read Im terribly afraid of the feminist and my distaste turned to compassion Here is a sister afraid of the changing society  in which she lives She looks around her sees the family falling apart women forced to participate in the world outside of the family and people living different life styles and finding them satisfactory She sees the result of population pressure inflation and all the other economic pressures and blames everything on the feminists The second wave of feminism began as a consequence of all those things it did not cause them Women are now living twice as long as they once did Economically they can afford only two or three children Infant mortality is way down so they usually have only two or three pregnancies Many women have to work to send those children to college or to support them if they are raising them alone or to help bring in needed income if both parents are there People still have 30 to 90 years of life left after their children are grown and have left them These are toe facts of life that gave rise to feminism Later on we raised our consciousness to such a point that we were able to deal with the problems of rape and battered wives We have always strived for equality of opportunity in employment education and credit We are concerned with the displaced homemaker as well as victims of an abusive society And remember that society is a patriarchal one The power money and position are in the handsof the men In order for women to assert their rights as full participants in this society men must be willing or must be forced toand its mostly the lattershare the proceeds of such a society In this changing world what the womens movement is striving for will probably strengthen the family and lead to equal relationships based on shared needs and purposes Where in the world did Annelies Lengers discover that we want to be like men For one thing she also says we hate men Why would we want to be like that which we hate I have not heard or read of the Soviet women being held up to American women as models of liberation Karen De Crow past president of the National Organization for Women visited the Soviet Union and reported that women there were just as oppressed if not more so than American women and there is little feminist leadership There are no women on the Supreme Soviet and few visible female government officials They are led by a bunch of old men with old ideas Sound familiar I know few feminists who hate men marriage and children Most of the ones I know are married and have children Ellie Smeal the president of the National Organization for Women is housewife with two children One can be a housewife and be liberated and there are all the other options in the world that we might want to choose ie West Point cadet astronaut President of the United States athlete or business person I hope that Annelies Lengers realizes that we are giving her the space to be what she chooses and that is great More power to her We also wish to have our space to be what we choose More power to us One could not help but notice the fine line that separates those hysterical women who scream draft and now well have to use the same bathrooms from those who desire equality The authors point that women are exploited by men especially in the business of pornography is not so much a good example of how women are exploited as it is tangible evidence of the unjust political social and economic situation that conditions women to allow themselves to be thusly exploited Im terribly afraid of the feminist the author states Are women who so fear the feminist perhaps more afraid of facing their own inadequacies in changing times than they are afraid of the Movement itself Yes the Womens Movement means reorientation from almost everything we were taught about our place in the world and how we are to live in it Yes it means flexibility and coping with brand new roles and demands But what makes it easier and even comforting is the fact that all womankind is going through the same transition not one of us is alone By her touching confession the author pleads for the very goal of womens liberationists selffulfillment Representative of one and all exploited women this antihero is left defenseless fearful and intimidated by what must seem to be a new breed of superwomen It is ironic but the female victim of past injustices who stands to gain the most from the progress womankind has achieved and the support it could give her now is the most resistant Dont let them take away the right to be a woman is the authors final plea A woman who hag the selfconfidence that brings dignity and fosters independence as a selfmotivated human being doesnt have to be afraid For her an onslaught of realistic opportunities for social economic and intellectual fulfillment becomes an exciting challenge long overdue instead of a threat to her very existence I am not a feminist but a fairly traditional conservative woman who is insulted by a definition of a woman that can only be equated with prolife prochurch prochildren and all that stands for being a woman Woman do and should consider themselves more than all of the above No woman would consider herself as not being included in one or more of the above Mrs Lengers has expressed something that she and many women like her have experienced but are afraid to analyze Call it anger fear guilt disillusionment or whatever but a storm is brewing within these women This storm arises out of the need to question values that no longer seem to fit from sorting out the pieces of a new reality for all women and from experiencing guilt and anger with having dared to question all that has gone before Liberation is more than physical it is a state of mind and acceptance of all the definitions of womanhood Just as in life itself there are no shortcut answers to the questions that confront all woman Labeling these questions is a copout Growth cannot be achieved if the ability to think and reevaluate traditional values is left to the male world The statement that womens liberationists hate men marriage and children and are out to destroy marriage morality and the family would almost be laughable if it werent so sad to know that the author honestly feels that way It is difficult to understand why men or women feel threatened by women seeking equality Full equality under the law as embodied in the Equal Rights Amendment is essential in all aspects of life so that each one of man or woman can do his or her own thing whatever that may be True the womens movement is cornposed of many kinds of women married and single women heterosexual and homosexual women white and minority women professional and business women homemakers and women on welfare but all are united by the common experience of womanhood Even the Girl Scouts endorse the womens movement All of us are working toward the same goalfor people to be treated fairly decently and honorably regardless of their sex The ERA simply states that Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the US or any state on account of sex This proposition seems indisputable and long overdue Mrs Lengers is entitled to her opinions and because of her position in the antiabortion movement they are newsworthy Her area of authority is limited to abortion Even those who disagree with antiabortionists are aware that the moral and religious scruples of such women should be respected Her fantasies about feminism however have all the authority of a streetwalkers opinion of convent life How would she know Quite simply feminism is the belief that women are intellectually morally and spiritually the equals of men and that this equality should be expressed through political and economic equality Persons believing this may be male or female may agree or disagree with Mrs Lengers on abortion can go braless or wear Merry Widows and hold diverse opinions on men children women and the Soviet Union The draft is not relevant to the argument since it does not exist One tradition feminists are seeking to dismantle is that women need to be protected because they are the weaker sex Protected as Susan Brownmiller would say by the threat of rape Protected by being denied access to birthcontrol and abortion information and services Protected by being paid less for equal work Protected by being viewed as freaks if they choose not to marry Feminists believe that women can and should take care of themselves To this end for example they encourage women to enroll in martialarts classes In addition feminists strongly advocate access to familyplanning informati4 and services and also argue that men and women should be paid the same for equal work Finally feminists believe that woman can be just as whole a person if one chooses to stay single as she will be if she chooses to marry and have children  Granted some radical feminists believe that women are much better off without men but they represent the leftwing common to any revolutionary movement and should not be taken to represent the mainstream of feminism

Two Pioneer Programs Help Unwed Teen‐Age Fathers Cope,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/05/archives/two-pioneer-programs-help-unwed-teenage-fathers-cope.html,LOS ANGELESThis year 600000 teenage boys will become unwed fathers Until recently they were ignored by social agencies and parents busy ooping with the problems of unwed teenage girls who face a bleak future of unemployment and overwhelming responsibilities for child rearing Now however two pioneering social agencies in Southern California are counseling boys as well as girls because they have found that both partners in an outofwedlock pregnancy suffer guilt and anxiety that can lead serious sous psychological problems if unresolved The agencies also have discovered that involving the boy in the decision to keep or place the baby for adoption relieved the girls guilt and makes her adjustment much easier In the past society ignored the unwed teenage father because it assumed that he was just sowing wild oats and didnt care about the girl or their baby said Chuck Wilkersons He is a social worker who has counceled unwed teenage fathers for the past two years at the Childrens Home Society of Orange County a private nonsectarian child welfare organization The boy was encouraged to run away from his responsibilities because an outofwedlock pregnancy was assumed to be the girls problem he said Less than 5 percent of the unwed fathers who participate in the counseling programs at the Childrens Home Society come without being invited by the social workers In most cases the girl comes alone or with her parents for the first session Many of the girls find out about the counseling programs through their friends schools or the yellow pages Initially the girl and her family resist any effort to involve the boy in the counseling sessions because they feel that the boy is no good and has done enough damage said Mr Wilkerson We point out to them that two of them were involved in the pregnancy and two of them should be involved in its resolution The girl usually gives the social worker the name of the boy in rare cases she refuses because she is afraid that the boy will reveal intimate details of their relationship or her affairs with other boys The social worker telephones the boy and tells him that the girl has mentioned that he is a friend of hers that she is pregnant and needs his help The social worker avoids saying that the girl has told him that he is the father of her child because the boy may wrongly assume that the social worker is going to criticize him or turn him over to the authorities for prosecution as a rapist Boys usually are relieved to talk to somebody because unlike girls they dont have the close friendship that encourages them to express their feelings and fears said Mr Wilkerson A girl who finds herself with an unplanned unwanted pregnancy gets lots of support from her girlfriends but boy who tells his friends is greeted with shrugs and cold shoulders Boys welcome counseling because it is a way of resolving their own conflicts over what it means to father child said Reuben Pannor director of Community Services of Vista del Mar where he has counseled more than 1000 unwed fathers He feels helpless and bewildered because he never intended to become a father He feels guilty because in most cases the boy loved the girl The teenagers we see are typical allAmerican kids not those involved in onenight stands Kids who are promiscuous use contraception and dont get pregnant When asked why the couple avoided using birth control one boy said To have used a contraceptive would have been just having sex for sex sake and our relationship had much more meaning that that Another bay replied She just wasnt that kind of girl The teenagers meet Individually and as a couple with the social workers Typical of those who have undergone counseling is Ron a tall slim 17yearold high school senior Ron and his girlfriend Nancy a 16yearold high school junior had sexual intercourse four times at a drivein Although Ron knew about contraception he didnt bother to use it because he assumed that nothing would happen When Nancy told him that she was pregnant he was terrified His straightA average dropped he found it impossible to practice basketball and he developed headaches Nancy started pressuring him to marry her a marriage that he considered to be unwise because they didnt have the same goals for careers in college When Nancys sooial worker at Vista del Mar invited him to attend a counseling session he quickly accepted Ron felt more relaxed after he talked with the social worker He realized that it would be foolish for him to run away from home or try to get Nancy an abortion because she was too far along in her pregnancy The couple started talking about the alternatives marrying and raising the child keeping the baby but remaining single or giving the child up for adoption The social worker urged the teenagers to tell their parents about the predicament When Ron did so his parents ordered him to deny paternity and to never speak to Nancy or the social workers again Parents can be a tremendous obstacle in pregnancy counseling said Mr Pannor who founded the Vista del Mar program in 1963 The social worker telephoned Rons parents after he missed his second appointment and invited them to attend the counseling session Although hurt bewildered and frightened they agreed to do so As the end of Nancys pregnancy neared Ron became increasingly supportive of her but said he wished to continue his education and not get married as Nancy had hoped they would But he said that if they decided to keep the baby he would get parttime work to help pay the expenses for the baby Both sets of parents agreed that they would share some of the time and money involved in child care But two weeks before the birth e the baby Ron and Nancy decided that it would be best if they gave the child up for adoption although an increasing number of youngsters have been deciding to keep their children these days Ron and Nancy felt they were simply not ready to be parents Ron was present for the brth of his son He cried when he held the baby He said it was the saddest day of his life because I realized that there would always be somebdy out in the world who looked like me and wouldnt be part of his life

Editor Your Feb 14 editorial on Social Security ReReformed does not seem to me to look far enough beneath the financial surface Our basic trouble is that 0ASI still works on the defeatist New Deal presumption that there could never be enough jobs hence 0AS1 was designed to induce the elderly to move over and make room for younger workers As we adapt to the prospect of slower growth in the younger labor force and continued rapid growth in the elderly population we find that to continue the established pattern calls for a precipitate rise in employment taxes Active workers and employers are already finding these taxes painful Any real solution of the Social Security problem hinges on rearranging the economy so that the productive activity of the elderly will generate the counterpart of a much larger share of their consumption The decline of this productive contribution may be gauged by the laborforce participation of males aged 65 and over which stood at 58 percent in 1930 is now about 21 percent and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Is headed for 16 percent in 1990 For many elderly people leaving the labor force leads into isolated and less interesting life The sudden eruption of a major political movement against mandatory retirement testifies to the importance for the elderly of being till participants in society As It now stands OASI leaves little incentive Mr elderly people to carry their own economic weight by productive activity As your editorial points out only a small fraction of benefits forgone because retirement is deferred will come back in higher benefits later on Furthermore the interaction of OASI and taxes is perverse Under the 1977 amendments workers aged 65 to 72 will forfeit 1 in OASI benefits for every 2 earned in excess of a base of 4000 This arrangement is roughly equiValentto a 50 percent tax on earnings in the bracket from 4000 to 12000 Besides the OASI benefits forfeited are exempt from income taxes whereas the earnings areon a beforetax basis Incentives are left intact to accept temporary or parttime employment up to perhaps a third of a fulltime yearround equivalent But if we allow for taxes and for some jobrelated expenses few elderly workers can pocket as much as a third of the difference between fulltime and parttime earnings if they hold a regular job and many will find that they are working for the fun of it with no person economic gain from being producers An agenda for rereform of Social Security must deal with 1 Resealing of benefits 2 Inclusion of 0ASI benefits in adjusted gross income for incometax purposes 3 A sharp cut from a half down to a quarter of the share of extra earnings taken out of currentyear OASI benefits 4 A reasonable upward gradient of benefit scales from postponement of retirement 5 Mitigation of the antiemployment and proinflation effects of financing OASI through employment taxes As a minimum the equivalent of the added tax revenue from point 2 should go into as a Treasury contributibn Social Security reform requires also a strengthening of general employment programs The social gains of Social Security reform and of moves to bar mandatory retirement must not be canceled by letting added employment for the elderly come at the expense of displacing younger workers We need fuller employment for all age groups To the Editor If selfdetermination for the Palestinians only meant internal democracy it would be hard to oppose it But every nation also has armed forces Do Americans want the Palestinians to have an army an air force machineguns bazookas rocket launchers cannon fighter planes bombers Against whom would they be used And selfdetermination includes control of foreign policy Do Americans want Israel to be confronted by Russian and Cuban freedom fighters Since a totally disarmed except for small  arms police  type weapons Palestine whose foreign policy must be controlled to keep out Russians Cubans et al is not compatible with complete selfdetermination how can Israelis allow or Americans favor To the Editor A most distressing example of Institutions losing sight of their goals has been the recent decision by the National Foundation Against Birth Defects that it will no longer support amniocentesis with some exceptions or genetic counseling How can the foundation possibly underwrite a complete investigative program of birth defects without the one How can it possibly help families subject to these distressing maladies without the other The foundation avers that pressure from the RighttoLifers was not responsible for this policy changealthough it has been subjected to pressure from that group In any case since the aims of the two organizations are now the same I suggest that they merge and form the National Foundation for the Right to Life Fall River Mass Feb 24 1973 To the Editor Your Tennis Without Love editorial of Feb 24 solemnly concludes that we should applaud South African participation in international tennis while simultaneously cheering peaceful protests against such participation One can either probe the absurdities that culminate in this suggestion without logic or draw a conclusion of ones own that The Times has badly miscalculated the intention of the protestors Organizations ranging from the Gray Panthers to the YWCA to the NAACP will be picketing the Davis Cup matches in Nashville March 17 to 19 as a last resort Some have worked for years to halt any and all forms of recognition of South Africas oppressive racist governmenta government which is engaged in a real war against the majority of its people The threat of boycott which you claim is useful in bringing about change in South African apartheid is not useful at all unless that threat is perceived as a possible reality To imply otherwise is to trivialize both the motivation and the actions of Americans To the Editor Formany years Hal Borland has enriched our lives with his nature editorials in The New York Times We mourn his death as if he were our special friend Reading him was to be reassured that despite the chaos of wars and politics nature and the cyclical beauty of our planet would prevail and the seasons would continue to come and go in their colorful and orderly procession Through the magic of his words he was able to transmit his own sense of cosmic harmony Seldom could one read a Borland editorial without an tiplift of spirits It is appropriate that his last one should speak with optiinism of the willows with their touch of amber and the sun approaching the rim of winter and that it should be entitled Toward Spring But March just wont be the same this yearwithout Hal Borlands joyous reminder that the time is approaching to listenfor the peepers in the pond To the Editor In an otherwise commendable defense of freedom of speech On the Topics section of the Feb 19 Times you gave an unfortunately erroneous impression of sociobiology Sociobiology is not a doctrine that attributes some human behavior to genes inherited from animal ancestors It is the discipline of biology that treats the biological basis of social behavior in all kinds of organisms including man Its focus has always been in zoology Its body of theory allows for various attributes of human beings including the total environmental control of human social behavior although many individual sociobiologists of whom I am one believe that the evidence favors some degree of genetic control MoSt importantly thi charge by the demonstrators at the American Association for the Advancement of Science that sociobiology is racist is absurd Insofar as any genetic basis for human nature can be demonstrated it emphasizes the unity of mankind To the Editor Perhaps because they were feeding into my consciousness at the same time I was struck by an interesting parallel between Boyce Rensbergers article Prehistoric Astronomy Was Pretty Good Science [Week in Review Feb 191 and the Glen Campbell Open golf tournament on television Rensberger seems to find it hard to believe he mentions it three times that ancient man could be capable of sophisticated astronomy without written language He has every reason to find it hard to believe it may very well not be true As with many other of our concepts of early man our knowledge and theories about the origins of writing of literacy are undergoing fundamental change from current linguistic dogma which holds that writing was invented about 5000 years ago to record human speech We are now beginning to realize that written language is a natural development out of what archeologists seem agreed are the keys to early mans intellectual development abstractive seeing and the use of tools And anthropologists seem pretty much agreed that written languageand a literate mindwas required for the development of science and mathematics and logic The spatial temporal combination which makes written language work makes it a natural foundation for the beginnings of Television coverage of golf tournaments usually begins with the 14th hole Gil Morgan may have won back on the 10th we could hear the shouting but with limited coverage television has opted for final drama What struck me while watching last Sunday afternoon was that a basic problem  in research and theory on written language has been that for too long our thinking has also begun with the 14th hole Yet our understanding of why literacy is so critical to modern man for example may lie back in ancient mans earliest struggles to explain his environment Let us hope that we will be interrupted by more and more shouts from the archeologists and anthropologistsback on the eighth or ninth hole To the Editor Reading of the princely sums that former Presidential courtiers are earning through the sale of books describing the events that led to their disgrace and imprisonment I am reminded of an incident in the life of courtier in the France of Louis XIV the Sun King Duke dAntin had the misfortune to be born the legitimate son of one of the Kings mistresses Madame de Montespan His existence was an annoyance to the King and an embarrassment to his mother her seven illegitimate children being considered demigods were a great pride to Madame de Montespan Upon the death of Louis XIV his successor Duke dOrleans having greater appreciation for the perfect courtier dAntin described him decisively Thats how a true courtier ought to be without humor and with out honor The Times welcomes letters from readers Letters for publication must include the writers name address and telephone number Because of the large volume of mail received we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters
Bridges of Rome: Spanning the Centuries,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/05/archives/bridges-of-rome-spanning-the-centuries-pons-sublicius-bridges-of.html,Old cities can best be seen from their bridges Take Rome for example To stroll along the Tiber crossing and recrossing the bridges of Rome is to relive the citys history Bridges were sacred to the ancient Romans The Latin word pons bridge probably led to the word pontifex bridgebuilder or more to the point priest From pontifex to Pontiffit is no coincidence that for at least 15 centuries the popes have made the bridges across the Tiber their special concern In preChristian times human sacrifices were thrown from Rofnan bridges into the turbid and often swift water practice that quickly degenerated into political assassination Tiberius and about 100 of his followers were killed and cast from a bridge his overthrow may have given the Tiber its present name since it is first mentioned as the Albula The bridges nonetheless maintained their holy character and the idea of sacrifice from a bridge persisted Many early Christian marytrs died this way Nicodemus Calepodius Asterius Pygmeniusthe list is too long to cite The Tiber is not particularly wide now that it has been imprisoned by high travertine embankments But before these were erected less than a century ago the river could turn the lower parts of the city into a vast urban marsh during the spring and fall floods In ancient Rome the lower part of the Forum was often inundated as well as all the region below the Palatine Hill along what now the fashionable Via San Teodoro This area used to be called the Velabrum and was little more than a pestilent swamp One reads of the seven hills of Rome not because they were so extraordinary but because they were frequently the only bits of land above water During the disastrous flood of 1598 for example there was 10 feet of water in the Pantheon and one could drown in the Piazza Navona In fact the city must once have been about as waterlogged as Venice is now and Ive often wondered why anyone bothered to live here But of course just because of all this water the hills of Rome were in an excellent defensive position As the Venetians themselves were to learn water is a more effective barrier than concrete The Romans therefore had time to bind themselves together politicallythrowing unwanted leaders into the river now and then from a sacred bridgeand when they had finished that job they set about the real business at hand the conquest of the known world The first bridge of which historians have any knowledge the Pons Sublicius was made entirely of wood even pegged at the joints so that it contained no metal whatsoever Such a bridge was easier to cut when an enemy appeared and as Dionysius and Ovid explain this method of construction was pleasing to the god who dwelt in the Tibera deity otherwise given to flooding the plain Militarily the Pons Sublicius served a defensiveoffensive purpose It connected the Aventine and Janiculum hills on either side of the river so that the Romans were able to put forward guards on the Janiculum either to fight or to withdraw to the Aventine if necessary after cutting the bridge But the religious function was not forgottenevery May 19 a procession of 30 virgins was led onto the bridge by the vestal virgin Flaminia priestess of Jupiter who even at this distance in time sounds like a particularly severe governess for young ladies of quality The virgins in any case cast 30 little puppets from the bridge as sacrifices One suspects however that just beyond the horizon of history at least one of the virgins went with them The Pons Sublicius no longer exists but I often think of that procession of virgins when I walk across what is now the oldest bridge in Rome just a few hundred yards upriver from where the Sublicius stood This is the Quattro Capi or Fabricio bridge leading to the Tiber Island The more popular name means four heads and may derive from two statues on the parapet each with four faces I dont know if sacrifices were ever held on this bridge but it has an undoubtedly solemn and mysterious look not at all dissipated by an excellent portrait of Snoopy painted on one of the columns of the fourfaced statues Horace mentions this bridge and says that it was a favorite of suicides perfectly understandable because the Tiber Island at this point blocks the river and causes it to violently The Tiber Island has an equally misterious air It has always reminded me of such things as alchemy necromancy viscerareading The Quattro Capi bridge is about 2000 years old though from time to time it has been restored but the island itself has been occupied regularly since about 290 BC when a temple dedicated to Aesculapius was erected there Aesculapius of course was the Greek god of medicine and has been traditionally associated with a serpent There was a sacred serpent on the island which scientists have now identified with Elaphe longissima common to all of the country around Rome It grows about two yards long and is perfectly harmless to man but is a terror to rats and mice It may or may not have been a coincidence that the serpentmore likely serpentsgained such renown on the island after the epidemic of 290 which was almost certainly bubonic and mice The island has been rebuilt to look like a boat In fact it is about the length and width of a mediumsized ocean liner And perhaps its not surprising that the area is still largely devoted to medicine At the upper end is the Fatebenefratelli hospitalthe Dogoodbrothers  hospitaland along one side is a row of buildings which until recently housed and gave medical treatment to Jewish old folk since the island is very near the old ghetto Next door is a big and not very distinguished church named after St Bartholomew There is also a tiny police station though it is hard to think whythis is one of the most peaceful places in the city Even political rioters stay away from it and no one sprays insulting remarks about the Minister of Justice on the walls of the buildings Of course  there is the traffic roaring across Quattro Capi and across the Cestio bridge on the other side Only a Roman emperor with a coliseum full of lions could deal with that Across the island the Cestio Bridge leads to the Trasteverewich simply means transTibersection of the city Like the Quattro Capi the Cestio is about 2000 years old From its span one can look back at the umbrella pines and oleanders that flank the Fatebenefratelli hospital and note that some rather splendid apartments lie behind the simple front door of the Franciscan Order beside the church Ponte Sisto I usually tut u right at this point A few hundred yards upriver are the two long flat arches of the Garibaldi Bridge then the Ponte Sisto or Sistine Bridge built by the same pope who commissioned the chapel of that name There had been a bridge at this point since ancient times but it was severely damaged by floods on several occasions and became known as the ruptured or fractured bridge if I am translating ruptus and fractus correctly At any rate in 1473 Sixtus decided to rebuild the bridge and actually walked down to the river to lay the first stone into which his name had been carved He dragged with him four cardinals and as many bishops as he could pick up along the way from the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere from which the stonelaying expedition set out One can be pretty sure that he himself didnt the stone The bridge which was completed in 1479 was made in the dimensions and the proportions and of the same materials as the old Roman one Tremendously solid it had a spare but heavy majesty A large hole probably about eight feet in diameter was placed just under the apex of the bridge between the four arches This eye served to take the pressure off the center when flood waters rose to that level The inhabitants of the city soon found that they could measure the seriousness of a flood by watching the water rise toward the aperture if it began to stream through the eyeor worse actually closed itthey were in trouble Otherwise they their Today the once austere structure is incongruously crowned with art nouveau in the form of Christmastrinket street lanterns possibly designed for gas and converted to electricity Its top is stained an ugly black that has been washed down from waffle iron fences along the walks while a hammer and sickle are drawn at the top of one of the stairways leading down to the river A spraypainted message on Sixtuss own commemorative plaque proclaims laborto libero an appeal for free unregulated abortion If the Ponte Sisto is absurd in detail distance reveals its powerful classic lines For the best view it is necessary to go farther upriver to Ponte Mazzini handsome but not particularly notable structure where an illtempered eelfishermanwho I suspect has liver troubleis usually resident The ideal time is dusk as evening begins to come on the light glances off the decorations and heightens the shadows beneath the arches Just behind the bridge rises an umber background of Roman buildings and the plane trees at the top of the embankment on either side of the river provide colorful frametan and dull orange in the fall fresh cabbagegreen in the spring fast off to the left within 10 or 15 minutes walk are most of the ruins of Romes vanished grandeur If you can overlook the extraneous ornamentation of the Ponte Sisto there is little difficulty in imagining what this ancient aggressive city must have been like It is always difficult for me to leave this spot Straight ahead is the Sistine Bridge just behind me and to the right is the Vatican and to the left the Renaissance quarter of old Rome To me the center of the Ponte Mazzini has always seemed the center of the cityfar more than the Via Veneto for instance or even the Piazza di Spagna Proceeding farther upriver we pass series of bridges of no exceptional interest If the light is right this is the time to note that the embankments and many of the bridges are faced with travertine marble which has the peculiarity of growing whiter with age In direct sunlight even on a winter day the whiteness can be dazzling sometimes from distance the bridges look as though they were built of some substance both organic and structuralsuch as bone Because of the traffic it is wise to ap proach the Ponte SantAngelo the bridge that leads to Castel SantAngelo from the Trastevere side The bridge was built by the same architect who erected Hadrians tomb which is now the foundation of Castel SantAngelo It is a solid structure one that for 18 centuries has come through every buffeting the river could give it without damage There is a firm sense of taste here too which one would expect of Hadrian one of the few highly cultivated Roman emperors But whereas the bridge was originally designed for eight statues of moderate size it now has 12 huge ones on its balustrades10 of them epicene angels with aerodynamically improbable wings I dont really object to these or to the rather weak statues of Peter and Paul at the entrance to the bridge This is Rome after all a city of baroque miracles and monsters But the whole marble corridor is a little too florid without the saving astringency of high The angels were commissioned of Bernini who brought this sort of thing off brilliantly in the Piazza Navona only five minutes away All but one however were executed by Berninis pupilsthe statue from Berninis own hand is the one opposite the angel holding the cross The Ponte SantAngelo as a whole gives the impression of having been touched by too many hands even though the bottom part is strong and purposeful But it is barred to traffic and one can stand peacefully on it to enjoy the view With exhausting frequency guidebooks recommend retracing ones steps for a moment This can be annoying but I see what they mean you cannot go in two directions at once If you retrace your steps to the Ponte Cestio then turn left instead of right upon reaching Trastevere you can see just downstream a kind of railroad trestle with heavy iron beams running straight across columns in the river This is such an imposingly ugly piece of engineering that at first it obscures the ruin that stands just before it in a particularly turbulent part of the river The ruin is that of yet another bridge now called the Ponte Rotto or Broken Bridge The single remaining arch marks the site of the ancient Pons Emilius probably the second oldest in Rome It was first built somewhere around 200 BC and was unique in that it was made entirely of stone Over the next few centuries it was continually damaged or knocked down by floodsthe Romans had not yet quite got the hang of building stone bridges In 1550 Pope Julius III decided to let Michelangelo repair it and make really decent bridge The master set about making plans for the bridge but he explained that it was in a very bad spot and would have to be heavily reinforcedand that this would take time and money Now there happened to be competitor at hand a selfpromoting Tuscan architect named Nanni Baccio Bigi Nanni said he could do the job faster than Michelangelo and for less money and the project was handed over to him The bridge fell down not many years after it was completed If you look closely at what remains of the Ponte Rotto it looks remarkably like bad Michelangelo it is possible that Michelangelo actually drew a design for the brige and that Nanni adopted it wholly or in part At any rate there is lesson here for those in charge of commissioning public structures There are other bridges in Rome of course One very old one first built in preChristian times is the Ponte Milvio It lies far upriver and is practically impossible to reach on foot because of the tremendous traffic But it too has the dark and pagansacred look that the Romans managed to give to so many of their bridges Pause here and remember it was across these bridges that ancient Rome flung herself at the worlds throat like the symbolic wolfmother And over these bridges came our present civilizationfor good and for bad 
Looking Out For the Folks Back Home 6—And Oneself,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/05/archives/looking-out-for-the-folks-back-home-and-oneself.html,WASHINGTON  A Congressman is said to have leaned on the executive branch to ship coal from his district to West Germany to speed housing funds to a hometown bank and get entryport status fora local airport But he is not putting out press releases to announce these triumphs because people are charging that he did all these things to make money for himself or for campaign contributors hot for the general benefit of WilkesBarre and its environs The accusations against Representative Daniel J Flood Democrat of Pennsylvania point up the dark side of an activity commonly called porkbarreling or more politely looking out for the constituents It is something that all Congressional offices spend a lot of time doing  and something that the senior more powerful members of Congress especially on the appropriations committees do best As Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr put it in appraising his own recent efforts to get the Navy to buy more F18 fighters whose jet engines are built in Lynn Mass  instead of F14s built by the Grumman Aerospace Corporation in Bethpage LI Im doing my job representing my people Of course this involved a cutback at Grumman that affected somebody elses people and to add insult to injury Defense Secretary Harold Brown ordered an investigation into Grummaris counteroffensive lobbying to get the decision reversed Scrutiny of such activities is greater than it used to be and so is public cynicism about them The assumption of corruption comes quickly and that distorts the picture of Congress Consider Representative Flood Whatever their truth or falsehood the accusations of graft and cronyism  which extend beyond his district to trade schools in California a hospital in Philadelphia construction projects in Haiti and cattleraising in the Bahamas  they have got Mr Flood more public attention in a month than two major steps affecting the whole nation got him last year Those steps were his to take because as a senior Con gressman who has served in the House continuously since 1955 he is chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor and Health Education and Welfare In that role he stoodup to the demands for spending more money on cancer research because he thought it was being badly spent and he fought to restrict Federal funding of Medicaid abortions But however gratifying or annoying national attention may be local publicity is what pays off at the polls A politi cians stand on abortion will cost him Some votes and win hIni some votes seeing that the local production line for a fighter plane stays in business is a clear winner Sometimes the goal can be achieved by writing legislation Mr Flood who is also on the defense appropriations subcommittee wrote in a rider that compelled United States forces in Europe to buy Pennsylvania anthracite Sometimes it involves just talking with an agency or department Representative John J Flynt another Democratic member of the defense subcommittee has no major defense contractors in his Georgia district But he recalls that several instances he has reminded the Pentagon of provisions that allowed local canners to sell foodstuffs to the armed forces It is rare for a senator to go to bat for such things outside his home state or for a representative to do so outside his own district Exceptions are often made for other districts in a home state however as shown by Speaker ONeills intervention behalf of the F18 and the workers of Lynn One of the biggest recent controversies over localinterest projects developed last year when President Carter tried to halt 32 water projects He sharply reduced his hit list when confronted by congressional realities  like the number of committee chairmen who were prepared to hold tidier issues ransom to the TennesseeTombighee project to take the bestpublicized example When Mr Carters list got to the Senate the states with senators on the Public Works Appropriations subcommittee fared best Only nine projects were eventually killed titte of these were in Colorado which has no influential senators and no clout on appropriations Writing a law or a part of a law is a bigger production than most district demands are worth But any time a power ful member asks nit help for his district a smart Government agency must consider the possibility that he may write a law  or that he may block something that the Administratibn needs from Capitol Hill As an example of how much trouble a member can cause Representative Daniel Rosenkowski Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the health subcommittee of Ways and Means held up the Carter Administrations hospital cosrplan to punish the Department of Health Education and Welfare for not naming a certain Chicago politician to a regional post There are less spectacular legislative devices A senior House aide said his favorite tool for getting a Governmetit partments attention was to tinker with its organization It drives the bureaucrats nuts and it doesnt affect the public at all he said You require that a commissioner report di rectly to the Secretary or something like that and it makes them frantic Whether the issue is a grant application or a constituents complaint that a bidding specification is rigged against him a Congressional office usually starts with letters and telephone calls to appropriate officials in the bureaucracy When theres a really big lobbying effort by a Congressmans office irsusually because jobs are at stake  This kind of parochialism undoubtedly costs money Paying for more expensive fighter planes or coal or marginal dams is a financial waste nationally But so is paying more for construction labor at union rates if nonunion workers are available  and thats in Federal law to protect union standards Last years cheap loans to New York City were also the result of a Congressional decision that benefited a particular interest Acquisitiveness can get carried to extremes It used to be said that South Carolina would sink under the weight of the military installations Mendel Rivers won for the state as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee And there boodlers something on the side The problem is bigger and more complicated than it used to be So is the Government and the country But its really nothing new On May 5 1789 only five weeks after the Hotise first assembled a quorum Representative James Jackson Georgia was decrying tonnage duties as a mortal threat to production of rice tobacco and indigo And a week before that Representative Fisher Ames of Massachusetts contended that a high duty on molasses would carry devastation throughout the New England states

Plan to Soften Abortion Dispute Collapses,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/10/archives/plan-to-soften-abortion-dispute-collapses-clinic-in-hempstead.html,CLEVELAND March 9Hopes for an unusual step toward cooperation between righttolife groups and advocates of abortion rights raised at a meeting here two weeks ago between officials of the Roman Catholic Church and William R Baird the abortion activist collapsed in confusion this week as plans for a followup meeting fell apart Mr Baird came here intending to join staff members of four Cleveland abortion clinics for a meeting yesterday with local representatives of the righttolife movement But those plans deteriorated and as he waited in a hotel suite that he he had designated for the meeting two of the antiabortion spokesmen called to tell him they would not attend the meetings The effort to bring about talks between the two sides followed a series of recent firebombings of abortion clinics in Cleveland and other cities Tensions had been further heightened by Mr Bairds contentions cited in the local press that the antiabortion campaign of the Roman Catholic Church had helped create a climate of violence After Mr Baird and two officials of the Diocese of Cleveland met on Feb 20 the church issued a statement that condemned the violence rejected accusations that the church was linked to the attacks and vowed to support further meetings between the two sides Mr Baird who is director of the Parents Aid Society a birth control and abortion service in Hempstead LI emerged from that meeting saying that there were decent people on both sides Other observers of the long often bitter dispute between the two groups viewed the meeting as an important step toward bridging the gap between them But arrangements for a second meeting to extend the discussions foundered because of numerous difficulties arising from the optimism as well as the fears raised by the first encounter And with that failure the prospects for another meeting became even more remote Each side offered a somewhat different account of what occurred in recent days Joseph Meissner president of the Right to Life Society of Greater Cleveland coalition of Catholics and nonCatholics insisted that he had needed more time in order to bring together a representative group In a message to Mr Baird Tuesday he also said that an agenda of the proposed meeting must include dis cussion of legislation to insure more counseling for women seeking abortions and to support our conviction that abortions be halted In response Mr Baird flatly rejected these conditions and accused Mr Meissner of deliberately sabotaging the meeting An aide to Mr Baird said he had received assurances late Tuesday from the Rev Frank Kosem secretary to Bishop James A Hickey and one of the two priests who met with Mr Baird last month that the meeting would take place Father Kosem said he had given no such pledge Then as Mr Baird waited at the hotel yesterday the Rev Joseph J Lieberth the director of prolife activities for the diocese and the other participant in the first discussion with Mr Baird telephoned him and said he would not attend Shortly after noon Mr Meissner told Mr Baird the same thing in another telephone conversation The Baird group tended to view the collapse of yesEerdays meeting as a sign that the antiabortion forces were backing down from their vow to continue discussions But in an interview in his chancery office yesterday Father Kosem said that he and other right to life leaders were not reneging and that they were ready to cooperate to bring about a meeting when we are able to get a broadbased group Certain key details in negotiations during the past week including the question of how much time there was to prepare for a meeting were in dispute Mr Baird said he broached the idea of a Wednesday meeting to Father Lieberth last Thursday Mr Meissner said he first learned about the proposal on Monday Meanwhile Father Lieberth maintained that he had mentioned the possibility to Mr Meissner last Friday There has been some opposition in the Catholic Church to holding discussions with Mr Baird But Father Lieberth said that the response had been mostly positive and that church officials had not discouraged him from talking to Mr Baird again At the same time he said he has been advised to avoid alienating people who support us Mr Baird who has waged an attack against the Catholic Churchs stands on artificial contraception and abortion over the years and has become to many symbol of antiCatholicism said yesterday that Father Lieberth was The first priest Ive been able to sit down with for years WASHINGTON March 9 UPI  A group of 26 religious leaders including the heads of four Protestant denominations called on Americans today to refrain from violence in connection with the abortion issue The statement released by the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights said We deplore the use of fear intimidation and harassment to influence public policy on serious social questions Among the signers were Presiding Bishop John M Allin of the Episcopal Church the Rev John T Connor

Letters: On the Packwood‐MovnihariBill,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/11/archives/letters-on-the-packwoodmoynihan-bill-what-tuition-tax-credits-will.html,To the Editor Your March 2 editorial A Discreditable Tuition Bill was a wonderful example of the shared ignorance that increasingly passes for informed journalism The author apparently does not understand the basic principles involved Parents not public education or Horace Mann or President Carter are the primary educators of their children What tax credits will do is break the monopoly of public government education which costs more but accomplishes much less every day It will also enable parents to choose more freely their childs school as they do their childs doctor It will not be a shabby theory that everybody loves a handout but rather an acknowledgment that parents should keep as much of their income as is possible As you encourage funding to aid the poor in their constitutional right to secure an abortion why cant you support a means of assistance to parents to their constitutionally guaranteed right to choose the school of their choice A factual analysis of the economic status of parents who choose private schools might well prove beyond a doubt that the majority are among the poor Moreover the incon sistency of your philosophy and gratuity of your statements in this case are not only unjust to parents they are an insult to your readers Rev THOMAS G GALLAGHER Superintendent of Schools Diocese of Rockville Centre Rockville Centre LI March 3 1978 To the Editor The Times is to be commended for its strong opposition to the several bills that have been introduced by the Congress to allow some form of tax relief for tuition Not only does the proposed legislation benefit higherincome families more than it does those with middle and low incomes insofar as it affects college tuition but it is now irrrevocably tied to some form of Government aid to nonpublic elementary and secondary schools It is particularly urgent therefore for concerned citizens to be aware that over 90 percent of the nonpublic schools in this country are religious in nature Clearly the use of public funds for the support of religious institutions is a violation of our constitutional mandate for separation of church and state and the United States Supreme Court has consistently and rightfully refused to permit taxpayer monies to be used for that purpose It is an added source of concern that the Con gress is so willing to introduce and support legislation which it knows to be unconstitutional BETTY LEA BROUT Pres National Womens Conference of the American Ethical Union New York March 3 1978  To the Editor I was disappointed by your editorial attack on the PackwoodMoynihan taxcredit proposal March 2 not because the bill in the Senate is without flaws but because of your simplistic treatment of a complex issue You imply that the publicly managed schools are or perhaps with greater resources might be the balance wheel of society and by implication independently managed schools could not significantly serve the public interest Are politically managed school bureaucracies organized largely by race or classsegregated communities and operating as virtual monopolies the only way to serve youth in a modern democracy Of course not The Timess rigid editorial worship of the ideology of Horace Mann is out of date THEODORE R SIZER Andover Mass March 3 1978 The writer former dean of Harvards Graduate School of Education is headmaster of Phillips Academy To the Editor Is anything happening with Radio City Music Hall After the initial flurry of actresses public officials real estate biggies and Sunday supplement photo stories all is silence The city is officially passive says The Times Feb 19 magazine     it seems unlikely that anything of a sufficient magnitude will be done to prevent the April 12 closing Can that truly be When Sailors Snug Harbor had to be saved the city found a way When Schermerhorn Row had to be saved the state found a way When Fords Theater had to be saved the Federal Government found a way So where is that old moxie now How curious that so little leadership for the rescue of Radio City Music Hall has come from on high In its absence here are some suggestions from the floor  Separate the Music Hall into two economic units the building itself and the program that goes on inside it  Let the Music Hall building as is become a national museum of the Art Deco style thus rendering itself eligible for subsidy from the National Endowment for the Arts the National Endowment for the Humanities and the recently established Museums Services Institute in HEW and enabling it to remain intact Perhaps put it under jurisdiction of one of New Yorks museums or the Smithsonian Institution which is already an umbrella for the Cooper Hewitt Museum of Art and Design  Let the city reduce or eliminate its real estate taxes on the Music Hall  Let the state help in its way Add a verse to the I Love New York song the Governor sings at parties and use some of the Commerce Departments 4 million promotional budget to aid the Music Hall in its passage to firm financial ground Let the State Arts Council pitch in to develop the kind of program that would draw crowds every night  If a series of spectacular shows of varying kinds is the answer seek out a brilliant entrepreneur of such showS  If exclusive showings of firstrun movies would sustain the hall as has been suggested let resourceful means be brought to the pursuit of that end  Let the unions and the private sector make their contributions When all these ingredients have been assembled let the final ingredientthe binding element to make all jell be added That element is of course the decisive participation of the Rockefellers I profoundly hope that no radical alteration of Radio City Music Hal14either shopping mall within or MOMAstyle office tower on topwill even be considered until the last full measure of devotion has been given to the rescue and preservation of the place as theater of splendor Coda For their great gift of Rockefeller Center including the Music Hall the Rockefeller family has our gratitude it must also accept something else That something else is the general sense that Rockefeller Center as a familiar and beloved institution belongs to the people of New York and should be beyond the authority of any individual or narrow interest group to dispose of in defiance of the popular will That Alton G Marshall president of Rockefeller Center wishes not to preside over a dead facility is understandable With a little more time and the cooperation of all concerned parties New Yorkers rallying at the 11th hour as they always do can find a way to assure the Music Halls re Turn to health JOAN K DAVIDSON New York March 7 1978 The writer president of the J M Kapi Ian Fund is former chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts Toward Public Transit Free for All Corners To the Editor A question to be considered by all New Yorkers from a Jerseyite who buys in New York and would be affected Should you not consider seriously the advisability of providing free transportation for the public in the City of New York With fares now at 50 cents and indications they may well go higher doesnt it make sense to eliminate all fares on subways and buses to make the service free to all corners and cover the expense of operating and maintaining the facilities with a small sales tax on services entertainment and merchandise Free transportation could be a city service with great public relations value Much revenue would be lost from a no fare system However as an offset much could be saved in costs of tokens turnstiles wages and all the other necessary expenses connected with a fareladen system As the present pattern of higher and higher fares results in fewer and fewer users are we not eventually coming To this conclusion GEORGE SCOTT Locust NJ March 2 1978 Selective Discounts To the Editor The campaign of those seeking a discount because they pay in cash seems to have fizzled out I enjoyed their zealous advocacy and arguments against subsidizing creditcard users such as myself Should their spirited campaign be revived I would suggest that they also do battle against those establishments that olfer free parking Elementary justice seems to indicate that those who travel by public transportation or taxicab should be given the cost of the parking fee off their bill Why should some patrons subsidize the car owners FRANCIS X SOMERS New York Feb 24 1978 This Is the Central Story of Legal Abortion To the Editor Janet Battailes excellent report on vandalism in abortion clinics March 2 tells an important story about the lengths to which extremists will go in their effortsin part undoubtedly inspired by widespread antiaborton propagandato deny women access to legal abortion Providers of abortion services view this trend with concern but it is equally important that the reports of such excesses be understood in a broad national context In 1977 more than a million women sought and received abortions in the United States Twothirds of these procedures were conducted in some 250 clinics and the remainder in more than 1000 hospitals and other facilities In fewer than a dozen of these clinics have there been instances of vandalism and in perhaps 20 have there been sitins Many more have been picketed at one time or another by antiabortion demonstrators but interruption of service has been rare The point is that reports on the con tinuing political debate over abortion and more recent reports of criminal vandalism have tended to obscure the reality that more than four million women have been able to secure safe legal abortions since the Supreme Courts momentous rulings five years ago Very few of those we are glad to say have had to suffer either the harassment of extremists or the censure of their communities This is the less visible but central story of legal abortion its establishment as a decent medical service its use by millions who in the old days would have suffered either dangerous illicit procedures or unwanted childbearing and its acceptance by an overwhelming majority of the thousands of communities in which the service is now available FAYE WATTLETON FRANCES KISSLING New York March 3 1978 The writers are respectively president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and executive director of the National Abortion Federation The Pitfalls of Teacher Licensing To the Editor The proposal before the Regents to license teachers will do nothing to improve the quality of education in New York State Licensing is only certification dressed in fancier trappings Certification has not assured quality in teaching nor will licensing because neither focuses on the critical element in teaching  performance Both processes assume that through preparation through some alchemy practiced in teachers colleges one can transform the base metal of an ordinary individual into the precious coin of an accomplished teacher It wont work The unhappy fact is that in the main our most able students are not attracted to teachers colleges They go instead to the better liberal arts and technical institutions and they graduate with degrees in the arts and sciences not in education They avoid the teachers colleges because they find the curriculums intellectually sterile loaded with such affronts to the intelligence as mimeograph operation The requirements proposed for licensing will only involve aspirants to teaching in more of the same stuff Stamping the product professional will alter nothing The independent schools oppose licensing because their success depends in large measure on the freedom of their administrators to choose as teachers the most able those whose natural talents experience and personal character best fit them to teach and to lead the young The identification of those teachers is best accomplished by knowledgeable and sensitive administrators who have the wits to recognize talent when they see it You cannot mechanize the process You cannot insulate it from human judgmentor the risk of error Licensing is a sirens song If it comes to pass and if a professional practices board is established the end result will not be an improvement in education but a securing of power for the teachers union which will dominate the board and control entry into the profession We would do better to turn the energies of the education community to making teaching a calling attractive to the most able those who are willing to see their competence tested by the measure of per formance STEPHEN HINRICHS Executive Director New York State Association of Independent Schools Pittsford NY Feb 24 1978 Bilingual Progress To the Editor Back in the 1760s Oliver Goldsmith in The Vicar of Wakefield told what was regarded as the highly humorous story of foolish George Primrose who went to Amsterdam to teach the Dutchmen English But when he got there and found he could speak to no one he recollected that in order to teach Dutchmen English it was necessary that they should first teach me Dutch How I came to overlook so obvious an objection is to me arnaz ing Too bad the Dutch of Georges day werent imbued with the same liberal concept of bilingual education as the planners of the New York City program George would have prospered JULIA REMINE PIGGIN New York March 4 1978 A Physiologists Work To the Editor When the death of a person merits news coverage in The Times I have always presumed that it provides an accurate and wellbalanced portrayal of the life and accomplishments of the deceased The recent article on Dr Andrew Ivy reminds us of the krebiozen controversy and his association with it but otherwise offers no indication as to who Andrew Ivy was I did not know him personally but in my field his achievements as a gastrointestinal physiologist are well recognized His work led to our current understanding of the roles of the stomach and duodenum in the development of peptic ulcers and thereafter the appropriate medical and surgical treatment Countless numbers of ulcer sufferers have profited by his work Furthermore Dr Ivy was responsible for teaching and inspiring some of our foremost productive research gastroenterologists in the United States many of whom continue to define the physiological and hormonal functions of the gastrointestinal tract in health and disease Gastroenterologists never understood Dr Ivys involvement with krebiozen and most expressed their disapproval But neither have we forgotten his outstanding accomplish ments and how humanity has benefited The sense of proportion was best expressed by the American Gastroenterological Association in 1970 by be stowing upon Dr Ivy its most prestigious honor the Friedenwald Medal I feel that The Times too should sqt the record

Conflicting Voices From Administration,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/11/archives/conflicting-voices-from-administration-news-analysis-for-tightening.html,WASHINGTON March 10The time has come in the life of the Carter Administration when the tidy facade of harmonious collaboration has begun to crack and the Government is speaking with conflicting voices News Analysis The problem goes beyona the peppery dispute between Mark Siegel the White House political aide who has quit over the Administrations Middle East policy and Zbi gniew Brzezinski who as national security adviser is one of the chief architects of that policy It has surfaced in the seesaw statements of high officials on the coal strike costing the President some of his authority in handling that issue It has come tip in the dissonant comments of the State Department and the White House over the implications of Soviet intervention in the Horn of Africa And it shows in the private sniping among the Carter entourage over what some regard as the freewheeling activism of such Cabinet officials as Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Moreover the situation has reached the point where some Carter loyalists feel that the President must now get tough with some of his own subordinates and show the public as well as members of his own administration that he is firmly in charge For Tightening Down Even some of those who take the philosophical view that a certain amount of pushing and hauling is bound to break into the open periodically feel that there needs to be a tightening down Hes given away too much of the Government complained one longtime political associate He understands that hes going to have to get tough A White House aide acknowledged that public relations bobbles on the coal strike strategy had hurt adding Something has to be done about it A third official suggested that not only the President but also his chief staff coordinator Hamilton Jordan should be more vigorous in insisting that subordinates toe the line once the President made a major policy decision In part the current cacaphony in the Administration seems inevitable After 14 months in office accumulated differences at the upper reaches of Government have begun bubbling into view the way they have in other Administrations In part too the problem reflects the enormous tensions that have built up at this moment For the President and his encourage have come to what one White House official called the upordown stage on a number of tough controversial issues like the coal strike the Administrations confrontation with Israel over the terms of a Middle East peace and on arms sales the final maneuvering on the Panama Canal treaties the push to finish off the energy package and strained relations with the Soviet Union The Somali promise to withdraw from Ethiopia has eased the pressures but only modestly All Coming to a Head Three or four big things are coming to a head at the same time one high official said Its a time to have a 10day binge and then wake up and ask Did they ratify the Canal treaty Was there violence in the coalfields The Administrations troubles over coal strategy have arisen more from clumsiness than deliberate open dissent Last Sunday President Carter decided on invoking the TaftHartley Act He rejected recommendations that he seize the coal mines a course favored by the United Mine Workers and by Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall because he feared the miners would expect the Government to offer a more generous contract settlement once it took control To make the TaftHartley strategy stick White House officials insisted that seizure had been ruled out But appearing before reporters Tuesday morning and evening Secretary Marshall and Robert S Strauss the Presidents international trade negotiator and general political troubleshooter made headlines by saying that seizure was still a possibility Both men told of the Presidents unhappiness have apparently apologized to him At last nights dinner for radio and television correspondents Mr Carter passed it all off with a joke Last Sunday he quipped 1 decided on TaftHartley The next day I read that Bob Strauss had decided he would seize the mines and the day after Ray Marshall agreed with him Right now Im undecided Some White House officials insist that little damage has been caused but others are fearful that the comments on seizure may influence some miners to stay away from the mines Its hard to blame Bob Strauss said one Presidential aide He was just a couple of days out of touch The problem is that the word didnt go out There had not been that aggressive attempt to tell people This is the line This is what were saying And theres no substitute for aggressive control In the foreign policy arena the Administration has insisted that its hallmark has been collegial cooperation But lately perceptive differences on matters of substance have emerged in the positions of Secretary of State Cyrus R Vance and Mr Brzezinski on SovietAmerican issues Mr Brzezinski has taken a harder line in public comments and in private arguments as well according to other officials Difference on Arms Talks It was he who publicly raisea the warning that Soviet involvement in Ethiopia could complicate the strategic arms negotiations whereas Mr Vance has refused to endorse such linkage Moreover the White House with Mr Brzezinskis guidance has been more outspoken than the State Department in voicing disappointment over the conclusion of the EastWest conference in Belgrade and in criticizing the Soviet position on human rights So far Mr Carter himself has bridged the differences between the two men and last Monday he took the pains to assert to his regular Cabinet meeting that the two men were backing the same policy But other officials expect the internal tugofwar for the Presidents mind to continue By far the most clearcut protest on policy so far however has been the objection raised publicly as well as privately by Mr Siegel over Middle East policy At a meeting with Jewish groups he burst out in frustration at having to defend the Administrations package deal to sell modern jet fighters to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as Israel Earlier this week he resigned voluntarily and without apparent rancor on either side In times past Mr Carter has shown a cold disdain for outspoken dissent In May 1977 he abruptly transferred Maj Gen John K Singlaub after the officer opposed his policy of withdrawing ground troops from Korea Again last July he was confronted with public criticism from a number of highranking women in his Administration over his stand on Federal financing of abortions After that episode Mr Carter reminded his Cabinet what while he wel corned internal debate before making a policy decision he expected solid support once his policy was determined If officials could not keep their disagreements with him private at that point he suggested they should consider resigning Both he and some of his senior aides are understood to be in a mood to rein force that policy now In the first part of this year one senior White House official said there has been and will continue to be a tightening down and a reminding of people that their first obligation is to the Administrations goals rather than to their own departmental goals
BOOK ENDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/12/archives/book-ends-bringing-the-word-bookstores-publishers-harper-row-west.html,pOSSIBLY onethird of the population is affiliated with fundamentalistevangelical sects and there has been a rapid growth over the past 10 years of religious publishers and bookstores catering to these bornagain Christians Herewith a quick survey of the evangelical field Bookstores The Christian Booksellers Association now has 2500 members and Gary Foster publications director of the association  which is located in Colorado Springs Colo says there are 5000 such bookstores in the United States and Canada Christian bookstores stick pretty much to selling books that appeal to a fundamentalistevangelical audience published by firms they know They tend to distrust newcomers such as Doubleday and Harper  Row and more generally any religious titles of liberal origins however the Christian stores are handling more Catholic titles these days a liberalization Mr Foster applauds life says there are no taboo subjects so long as they are handled in a theologically conservative way book propagating homosexuality say would find disfavor while books on homosexuality as a problem to be solved Christian teachings would be acceptable antihomosexuality crusader Anita Bryants autobiography is a current best seller There are more books these days on sexual problems divorce the family  areas the churches were reluctant touch in the past  and issue books are in vogue Issue books seem to include everything from abortion to diet books which are justified as the Christians responsibility to take care of his body but seem like some of the other selfhelp books to be religious adaptations of genres popular in the secular field Another popular genre is what Mr Foster calls books written by women to women which say life can great it doesnt have to be drudgery  Most popular of all are the inspirational firstperson experiences  testimonials by bornagain Christians from showbiz folk with declining careers who have wrestled with demon booze and pills and then found God to Nixon aide Charles Colsons apologia pro vita sua Born Again and Joni the autobiography Joni Eareckson a 27yearold paraplegic which has sold over two million copies The average Christian bookstore Mr Foster says is momandpop operation grossing l08000112000 annually About half the stores business is in books the rest in religious records greeting cards gift items and the like He estimates their total sales at around 600 million The association receives 30 or 40 inquiries every month from people who want to start a store or rather as many of them might put it who are called to a ministry of selling religious books The Association tries to leaven their faith with some hardnosed business advice  eg they should have 3500050000 startup capitaland provides training courses for newcomers Publishers Total religious book sales in the United States in 1976 were estimated at 274 million compared with total general trade book sales of 862 million and estimates of sales by evangelical publishers range from 100 million on up to over 300 million  the latter figure being an extrapolation from a study of 29 evangelical houses made by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association which was formed in 1979 out in La Habra Calif The assocation now has 36 members including such wellknown evangelical houses as Zondervan Word and Revell as well as Doubleday which recently founded an evangelical line  see the Paperback Talk column on Page 45 and Thomas Nelson a venerable trace house that converted to evangelical publishing and there are about 60 more houses the association considers as potential members according to Donald Brandenburgh executive director What is an evangelical Christian publisher Mr Brandenburgh cited a speech by Clayton Carlson head of Harper  Rows religious books department on the subject Can General Book Publisher Become an Evangelical Publisher Mr Carlsons conclusion was that it was for the reader to decide who is an evangelical publisher Harper  Row West As Mr Carlsons query above indicates general religious publishers today are politely seeking to get a share of the business heretofore dominated by the evangelical publishers Harper  Row is publishing such books as Richard Quebedeauxs The Worldly Evangelicals a study of contemporary evangelists and Is the Homosexual My Neighbor by Letha Scanzoni and Virginia Ramey Mollenkott in which two authors with impeccable evangelical credentials argue that Christianity teaches acceptance not rejection of homosexuals Harper  Row is entering the evangelical field in its own way according to promotion and advertising director James Foster and not abandoning the other constituencies the general religious publisher In a longrange planning report MrCarlson described the different kinds of books the department would be doing as follows  trade books which are sold in general bookstores and include general ie nonreligious books contiguous trade books described as books for the general reader on problems of personal growth and selfawareness Catholic and Jewish books academic books which are scholarIST works on scripture and psychology for theology and graduate students  new age books books on Eastern religions such as Sufism or Zen Buddhism and denominational books  books for mainline Protestant churches Francisco last year for several reasons among them that most of their sales and many of their authors were west of the Hudson also California has long been hospitable to new religious ideas There are already signs that the evangelical Christian boom is leveling off If some other movement comes along which as did other trendy things like encounter sessions and Jerry Brown happens first in California Harper  Row West will presumably be among the first to get the word
Ideas &,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/12/archives/ideas-trends-in-summary-march-of-dimes-ends-its-support-of-genetic.html,Less than a month ago three wellknown geneticists estimated that about a third of genetically caused retardation could be prevented by wider use of known techniques Last week amid growing pressure against the March of Dimes by the National Right to Life Committee and its allies it was disclosed that the March of Dimes intends to phase out its support of genetic services programs Included are programs to detect chromosomal abnormalities in prospective parents and defects in unborn babies Nearly all such services in the United States now depend on March of Dimes support The foundation says its decisiois not a response to pressure and cites instead its policy of limiting support of any program to five years However the organization does not invariably observe ltd fiveyear limit A March of Dimes spokesman said that the agency still believes genetic services are important that it hopes alternate sources of funding will be found for centers it abandons and that there is still a possibility the decision could be reversed On the average white children in the United States do better in school than black ones Why A few psychologists say heredity is largely responsible Most social scientists blame the schools or cite the cultural deprivation suffered by poor minorities A new study done for the Carnegie Council on Children and published last week says the basic reason is the American caste system which historically relegates blacks to the pariah status and for generations has undermined their motivation to learn Early in life says John U Ogbu a Ni gerianborn Americaneducated social anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley black children observe the job experience of parents and other blacks conclude that their own chances in the white world are not very good and come to believe that doing well in school will not help them much Professor Ogbu calls the academic retardation of blacks a functional adaptation to reality The caste system he says forces blacks to channel their competitiveness into areas not regarded as the domain of white competitiveness such as sports Professor Ogbu toes not deny the value of compensatory education but he believes that the only lasting solution is total destruction of the caste system He says there are performance gaps not only between blacks and whites in the United States but also between dominant groups and castelike minorities in Great Britain and New Zealand where thetwo groups belong to different races and in India Israel and Japan where minority and majority are of the same race He considers the Japanese minority known as the Burakumin an encouraging example of what can happen when caste barriers fall In ancient times the Burakumin ranked as subhuman and they are still outcasts in many respects But the gap in achievement disappears when Burakumin move to the United States where Americans treat them exactly like other Japanese immigrants Professor Ogbu says immigrant minorities do better in school than blacks partly because they have not become disillusioned by repeated failure to achieve selfimprovement through education because of caste barriers Professor Ogbus theories are not without antecedents Many social scientists have deplored the dearth of successful blacks to serve as role models for black children And the thesis that American democracy has not eliminated castes was outlined as early as 1937 by the psychologist John Dollard in his now classic study Caste and Class in a Southern Town The theory of plate tectonics holds that over the last 200 million years at least the face of the earth has been radically altered as the six or eight major and many minor plates of the surface have drifted about India crashed into Asia creating the Himalayas Africa split from the Americas but left Boston attached to New England Some geologists believe that parts of Western North America are remains of a splitup continent that once occupied a space near Australia The North American fragment of the hypothetical continent of Pacifica has been named Wrangellia after the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska an area that has puzzled geologists because its rocks are unlike those of its neighbors Parts of Wrangellia are also found on Vancouver Island the Queen Charlotte Islands off British Columbia and perhaps in parts of Washington Idaho and Oregon Other remnants of Pacifica the theory holds are found on the coasts of Siberia and South America Last week other geologists said they doubted that the similarities observed in various areas claimed for Pacifica are great enough to Justify the conclusion that a single former continent could have accounted for them all They hypothesize a number of former Pacific continental blocks all swept from the ocean as the plates migrated and new ocean floor was formed At present the Atlantic Ocean is expanding a few inches each year and the Pacific shrinking as new ocean floor Is formed in the midAtlantic rift valley and the Pacific floor is shoved under the coasts of Asia and South America But only the last 200 million years of continental drift can be observed from study of the sea floor because all the sea floor now existing was formed dun ing that period Many rocks in the continents are billions of years old but whether they have all along been drifting about as they now do is unknown The Japanese who have shown Detroit how to build cars and Rochester how to make cameras have now tried to show Cairo how to construct a pyramid Conceived by a Japanese architect who lives in Egypt sponsored by Japanese television and budgeted at 51 million the pyramid began to rise two weeks ago on a site overlooking the genuine original pyramids at Giza while documentary cameras looked on But all did not go well Planned as a 65foot version of the 482foot pyramid of Cheops the model had to be reduced to 36 feet because of a pyramidinduced rise in the price of limestone We cannot fight against Egyptian merchant tradition the television director said They have the experience of 5000 years A concrete foundation had to be poured and some of the threeton blocks did not fit Efforts to imitate ancient construction techniques did not pan out few laborers could be recruited and stonecarrying wooden sledges broke down Last week the newspaper Al Ahram said the rising pyramid took on the appearance of a deform ity and the Government ordered the pyramid builders to

Pressure Mounts in Albany as Vote On Broad Death Penalty Bill Nears,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/13/archives/pressure-mounts-in-albany-as-vote-on-broad-death-penalty-bill-nears.html,ALBANY March 12With many of its members facing what they say will be the most difficult vote of their careers the Legislature is scheduled to act early this week on a sweeping capitalpunishment bill that would permit executions for those convicted of intentional murders By common agreement among the lawmakers and their aides no other issueexcept for abortionis as emotional and volatile as capital punishment Days before the debate deathpenalty proponents are still unsure whether they can muster the necessary twothirds majorities in both the Assembly and the Senate that will be needed to override Governor Careys expected veto Last year deathpenalty legislation passed by a vote of 39 to 19 in the Republicancontrolled Senate and by 91 to 50 in the Democraticcontrolled Assembly The meastre was killed by Mr Carevs veto For a veto to be overridden the rules require a twothirds approval of all members not simply twothirds of those present Thus 100 votes in the Assembly and 40 votes in the Senate would be needed and the vote this week is expected to be razorthin close to that margin on one side or the other The main reason for the passion is that every poll shows the voters overwhelmingly in favor of capital punishment But a great many Democrats and a few Republicans are opposed to it out of personal conviction that it is either morally wrong or of no value as a deterrent to crime Because of rising voter pressure however some legislators who voted no last year may switch their position this year because the issue has overwhelmed them in their districts Its incredible said a New York City Democrat who asked not to be identified so sensitive was he to his political problems Every adviser I have every person who supports me at home pays Ill be making the biggest mistake of my career if I vote against it Ive never seen such pressure Another unusual aspect of the capital punishment issue is the fact that the majority leadership in both houses has taken a handsoff attitude toward the whole fight For example the Assembly Speaker Stanley Steinguta Brooklyn Democrat who happens to be personally opposed to the death penaltyhas held himself aloof from the negotiations on what sort of bill would be acted on Ironically as a political ally of the Governor Mr Steingut is known to prefer that Mr Careys veto be overridden His logic is said to be that with a death penalty statute on the books voters might not try to remove a Governor regarded as an impediment to popular will on the issue The key to Mr Steinguts strategy was to encourage the drafting of a death penalty bill narrow enough in its application to win the votes to override a veto Last year a bill of very broad scope passed but failed to get the twothirds majorities needed to override because enough members felt it was too sweeping in application Although Mr Steingut wouldnt say so his aides acknowledged the Speaker wanted things to be different this year But neither they nor Mr Steingut reckoned with the emotionalism of the issue What happened was that with Mr Steinguts enouragement Assemblyman Vincent J Graber a Democrat from West Seneca introduced a bill that in several key ways was narrower than last years Last year for example a robbery or burglary accomplice whose partner murdered someone would himself be subject to execution Mr Grabers bill eliminated the possibility Most importantly the same possibility was eliminated from a companion bill introduced in the Senate by Senator Dale M Volker a Republican from Depew Mr Volker and Mr Graber whose districts contain the Attica Correctional Facility have long been leading champions of capital punishment The GraberVolker bills were further endorsed in concept by the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson Republican from Binghamton who voted against the broad version of the death penalty last year For the first several weeks of the legislative session this year it thus looked to many as if the GraberVolker bills would pass and most likely be overridden But then some Republicans began pushing for a much stronger bill Led by Assemblyman Dominick L DiCarlo a Brooklyn Republican death penalty proponents objected that the GraberVolker approach would not apply to intentional murders carried out in the course of a robbery or burglaryunless there was an additional aggravating circumstance such as a prior history of murder or a desire to cause intense suffering Under their bill the Son of Sam could never be executed said Mr DiCarlo who is considered one of the most effective debaters in Albany I think that when people want capital punishment they want it to apply to the guy who holds up a grocery store and kills the owner or the guy who rapes and murders somebody The pressure rose from Mr DiCarlo and his allies most notably Perry B Dur yea of Montauk L1 the Assembly minority leader who is Mr Andersons rival for the Republican gubernatorial nomination Feeling that pressure Mr Anderson sounded out his members and went with a stronger bill Apparently fearing that Mr Grabers original bill would be amended on the floor of the Assemblyin a repetition of what happened last yearMr Steingut also acceded and let the Assembly Codes Committee approve a harsher version of Mr Grabers original bill amended to reflect Mr DiCarlos provisions Now that the harsh bill is up for debate however some Democrats feel they can defeat it because it is too broad There seem to be some waverers said an antideath penalty Democrat Were exploiting what we can to persuade them

Law and Religion Intermingled In Suit on Abortion Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/14/archives/new-jersey-pages-law-and-religion-intermingled-in-suit-on-abortion.html,For many long days since last July Judge John F Dooling Jr has been listening to a case brought by Cora McRae Jane Doe Mary Doe Susan Roe Ann Moe and others that represents a major constitutional challenge to current law restricting the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions The women who are from New York Connecticut and Minnesota and are single and married aged 15 to 25 with up to four children never appear to hear the arguments before Judge Dooling in Federal District Court in Brooklyn Their classaction suit is directed against Health Education and Welfare and several wellknown political figures It contends that thhe restrictions have the effect of enacting into law a religious view of the moment when life begins The suit striking to the heart of one of the most emotional and explosive of current issues is being brought jointly with a halfdozen doctors who feel their right to make medical judgments is being impinged upon by the United Methodist Women and by Planned Parenthood of New York At issue is the latest version of the Hyde Amendment passed by Congress in December which bans Medicaid reimbursement for all abortions except those to save the mothers lifeor under limited conditions her healthand in officially reported cases of rape or incest A basic contention in the McRae et al suilt is that such restrictions violate the First Amendments provision for separation of church and state and that the law resulted from undue religious pressure on the political processes A parallel case brought by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation which has been heard simultaneously during much of the courtroom presentation charges as does the McRae action that the ban on Federal funds denies poor women a right held constitutional for anyone who can pay The citys suit also says that the ban jeopardize the hospital corporations medical obligations This week the constitutional challenge enters a new phase with the end of the plaintiffs presentation  and with the transcript already running more than 3000 pages Their lawyers most of them women and all relatively young have called more than 30 witnesses The defense lawyers have called five Instead of making a major courtroom presentation the defense lawyers expect to rely on submitting depositions and documents as well as their written arguments Whatever Judge Doolings decision all parties expect the case to be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States It already has a judicial history dating to October 1976 Under a preliminary order issued by Judge Dooling the suits succeeded in blocking for 10 months the original Hyde Amendment ban on Federal funds for abortions That order was vacated by the Supreme Court last June because of new circumstances The suits have been updated to apply to Secretary Califano as the current administrator of Medicaid and to the 1978 version of the Hyde Amendmenta compromise that passed in December after months of deadlock between the highly restrictive Housewording and the more premissive Senate proposal Four intervenor defendants have entered the case voluntarily James L Buckley the former Senator from New York Senator Jesse A Helms of North Carolina and Representative henry J Hyde of Illinois were admitted as defendant taxpayers seeking to block Judge Doolings original injunction against the first Hyde Amendment Isabella M Pernicone a Westchester lawyer and member of the Right to Life Committee was granted standing as guardian for unborn children In the case of Cora McRae Planned Parenthood alleged that it had to refuse her abortion becausealthough New York State has thus far continued to underwrite Medicaid abortionsreimbursement by the state was jeopardized by the Federal withdrawal The other individual women plaintiffs were allowed to use pseudonyms and all five testified by affidavit by permission of the Federal attorney for Secretary Califano Doctors for the other women practice in Connecticut Minnesota Georgia Texas and New Mexico which are among the states that have stopped payments for abortions not covered by the Hyde Amendment They testified two appeared in person that they had approved the abortions as medically necessaryand therefore eligible under the Social Security Acteven though they could not certify the pregnancies as life endangering or otherwise eligible under the Hyde Amendments restrictions The constitutional challenge invokes the First Fourth Fifth and Ninth Amendments The suits contend that the Hyde Amendment in limiting the right of abortion as upheld by the Supreme Court for Medicaid patients discriminates against poverty race and minority status It charges sex discrimination on the ground that the Social Security Act provides Medicaid for all medically necessary services for men And it holds that the required reporting of rape and incest violates victims rights to privacy due process and equal protection In the most recent phase the chief courtroom lawyers for Cora McRae et alRhonda Copelen of the Center for Constitutional Rights and Janet Benshoal of the American Civil Liberties Unionhave been zeroing in on the religious aspects of the case Witnesses from United Methodist Women said the Hyde Amendment would deprive poor women among their 12 milas well as infringe on their religious as well as infringing on their religious belief in freedom of conscience Other United Methodist Women members they said were Federal taxpayers who objected to the Hyde Amendments interference with responsible parenthood as well as to paying the added costs for society resulting from the restriction of abortion Carol Werner chief Washington lobbymore liberal version of the Hyde Amendment ist for the National Abortion Rights Action League spent nearly a day on the stand as a witness called by the plaintiffs lawyers Contending that the Hyde Amendment violates the religious neutrality of medical services intended by the Social Security Act the

Law and Religion Intermingled In Suit on Abortion Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/14/archives/law-and-religion-intermingled-in-suit-on-abortion-ban-undue.html,For many long days since last July Judge John F Dooling Jr has been listening to a case brought by Cora McRae Jane Doe Mary Doe Susan Roe Ann Moe and others that represents a major constitutional challenge to current law restricting the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions The women who are from New York Connecticut and Minnesota and are single and married aged 15 to 25 with up to four children never appear to hear the arguments before Judge Dooling in Federal District Court in Brooklyn Their classaction suit is directed against Health Education and Welfare and several wellknown political figures It contends that thhe restrictions have the effect of enacting into law a religious view of the moment when life begins The suit striking to the heart of one of the most emotional and explosive of current issues is being brought jointly with a halfdozen doctors who feel their right to make medical judgments is being impinged upon by the United Methodist Women and by Planned Parenthood of New York At issue is the latest version of the Hyde Amendment passed by Congress in December which bans Medicaid reimbursement for all abortions except those to save the mothers lifeor under limited conditions her healthand in officially reported cases of rape or incest A basic contention in the McRae et al suilt is that such restrictions violate the First Amendments provision for separation of church and state and that the law resulted from undue religious pressure on the political processes A parallel case brought by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation which has been heard simultaneously during much of the courtroom presentation charges as does the McRae action that the ban on Federal funds denies poor women a right held constitutional for anyone who can pay The citys suit also says that the ban jeopardize the hospital corporations medical obligations This week the constitutional challenge enters a new phase with the end of the plaintiffs presentation and with the transcript already running more than 3000 pages Their lawyers most of them women and all relatively young have called more than 30 witnesses The defense lawyers have called five Instead of making a major courtroom presentation the defense lawyers expect to rely on submitting depositions and documents as well as their written arguments Whatever Judge Doolings decision all parties expect the case to be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States It already has a judicial history dating to October 1976 Under a preliminary order issued by Judge Dooling the suits succeeded in blocking for 10 months the original Hyde Amendment ban on Federal funds for abortions That order was vacated by the Supreme Court last June because of new circumstances The suits have been updated to apply to Secretary Califano as the current administrator of Medicaid and to the 1978 version of the Hyde Amendmenta compromise that passed in December after months of deadlock between the highly restrictive Housewording and the more premissive Senate proposal Four intervenor defendants have entered the case voluntarily James L Buckley the former Senator from New York Senator Jesse A Helms of North Carolina and Representative henry J Hyde of Illinois were admitted as defendant taxpayers seeking to block Judge Doolings original injunction against the first Hyde Amendment Isabella M Pernicone a Westchester lawyer and member of the Right to Life Committee was granted standing as guardian for unborn children In the case of Cora McRae Planned Parenthood alleged that it had to refuse her abortion becausealthough New York State has thus far continued to underwrite Medicaid abortionsreimbursement by the state was jeopardized by the Federal withdrawal The other individual women plaintiffs were allowed to use pseudonyms and all five testified by affidavit by permission of the Federal attorney for Secretary Califano Doctors for the other women practice in Connecticut Minnesota Georgia Texas and New Mexico which are among the states that have stopped payments for abortions not covered by the Hyde Amendment They testified two appeared in person that they had approved the abortions as medically necessaryand therefore eligible under the Social Security Acteven though they could not certify the pregnancies as life endangering or otherwise eligible under the Hyde Ameridments restrictions The constitutional challenge invokes the First Fourth Fifth and Ninth Amendments The suits contend that the Hyde Amendment in limiting the right of abortion as upheld by the Supreme Court for Medicaid patients discriminates against poverty race and minority status It charges sex discrimination on the ground that the Social Security Act provides Medicaid for all medically necessary services for men And it holds that the required reporting of rape and incest violates victims rights to privacy due process and equal protection In the most recent phase the chief courtroom lawyers for Cora McRae et alRhonda Copelen of the Center for Constitutional Rights and Janet Benshoof of the American Civil Liberties Unionhave been zeroing in on the religious aspects of the case Witnesses from United Methodist Women said the Hyde Amendment would deprive poor women among their 12 miles well as infringe on their religious as well as infringing on their religious belief in freedom of conscience Other United Methodist Women members they said were Federal taxpayers who objected to the Hyde Amendments interference with responsible parenthood as well as to paying the added costs for society resulting from the restriction of abortion Carol Werner chief Washington lobbymore liberal version of the Hyde Amendment ist for the National Abortion Rights Action League spent nearly a day on the stand as a

The Editorial Notebook,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/17/archives/the-editorial-notebook-the-retreat-on-abortion-rights.html,For those who believe it Is the right of any woman to choose to have an abortion during the early months of pregnancy the news these days is grim The Supreme Court affirmed this right in 1973 Since then however it has been eroded under heavy attack by those who seek to impose their philosophy of life on everyone else Congress has contributed to the attack by setting new limits on Government support of abortions for poor women To qualify for Medicaid assistance women must now prove that they are in severe physical distress that they would die without an abortion or that they were the victims of rape or incest Additional restrictions will be pressed upon Congress by the foes of abortion this year The first major battle may come next week when the House takes up a new bill protecting the job rights of pregnant women but excluding those who choose an abortion when their lives are not threatened by the pregnancy State and local governments are also feverish with antiabortion activity Increasingly women who seek an abortion must run the gantlet of abuse ranging from personal injury to public humiliation In the past year seven abortion clinics were forced to move or close because of fire or bomb attacks In Akron Ohio the City Council recently passed a highly intrusive ordinance requiring women who seek an abortion to be informed about the biological progress of the fetus and the emotional problems women might face after an abortion Other new ordinances elsewhere force women to wait for days before an abortion or require parental approval for abortions for minors or overregulate abortion clinics to drive them out of business Only about a dozen states including New York are still trying to maintain liberal Medicaid programs without Federal support but they are under increasing political pressure Other states are trying to be even tougher than the Federal Government Michigan and Virginia plan to end all Medicaid payments for abortions except to save the life of the woman Suffolk County in New York wants to override liberal state regulations and impose its own restrictive local rules Thus the dam is not just leaking it is cracking Lawyers who are trying to defend the right to abortion in dozens of court cases are tired and depressed Abortion has become the most divisive national issue since Vietnam And the battle is likely to intensify during the Congressional election next fall For those who believe in the abortion right there is much to be done They must try to straighten out the debate which has turned on conflicting often religious ideas of when life beginsand when therefore abortion becomes murder The Supreme Court in 1973 could find no clear answer to this question in philosophy theology or justice There still is none Much of the controversy however reflects not just religious scruple but also a yearning for moral punishment Congress spent months last year weighing how much misery and shame should fall on the poor and pregnant before offering Federal help There is a belief in Congressand in Akron and Suffolk Countythat many women think too easily of abortion that they choose it as casually as they choose to have sex But that is simply not true Very few people of either sex want abortions as suchcertainly not women who have had abortions or anyone who has supported a friend through the experience Abortion almost always symbolizes failurethe failure of a contraceptive of a relationship of a family of dream even of a social system Government need not add an extra lash to the whip Those who are most concerned about the rights of women might well consider whether it is not time to turn attentions from the broad subject of equal rights to the specific issue of abortion rights It would be a welcome surprise if the Equal Rights Amendment managed somehow to straggle over the finish line and into the Constitution next year But it would be pyrrhic victory if the enormous energy and resources now being devoted to the ERA left not enough of either to protect the past victories on abortion policy

Health Plan's Prognosis Improves,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/19/archives/connecticut-weekly-health-plans-prognosis-improves-brighter.html,EtOSPITAL officials who had expressed outrage last month at elements of a controversial Federally initiated healthcare reorganization plan for the 19 communities from Greenwich to Stratford are nowwith some exceptions  making statements that indicate a mood of compromise and conciliation Most of the seven hospitals affected by the plan say they are now willing to live with the Federal move which is designed to force regional planning and consolidation in the hope of making local health services more costeffective and responsive to the needs of lowincome people Reflecting this newer mood James Rieder president of Stamford Hospital said I think the lastminute amendments made to the plan by the board of directors of the Southwest Connecticut Health Systems Agency [which drew up the original plan ] were indicative of genuine concern for public opinion in the area We now feel far more confident that we can work with them He was referring to modifications made to specifications that called originally for a reduction in hospital beds in the GreenwichStamford area Because of an outcry from hospital officials and community groups the health agency has now agreed that no reductions will take place before a detailed costanalysis and feasibility study had been completed and the public mood has been taken into account I think they now realize they need public acceptance before making any such moves Mr Rieder said But how do you go about getting public acceptance and how do you measure it understand they are planning some workshops and meetings This is excellent We will cooperate in every way In this regard the outburst brought about a positive change in the attitude of HSA They are now unlikely to be arbitrary in the future Mr Rieder said that hospitals would now have to keep the Health Systems Agency very much in mind before going ahead with expensive new programs and capital purchases  because we will have to demonstrate very thoroughly that there is a need within the region Most of the criticism has come from the two religiously affiliated hospitals involved r St Vincents in Bridgeport and St Joseph in Stamford St Vincents is especially worried about the plans proposals for abortion clinics which as a prolife hospital it cannot support It is also concerned about a plan whose course of action says William Riordan the hospital president is based upon numbers which if proven incorrect could adversely affect this institution and the patients it serves It is impossible he saidto predict the numbers of patients who will use certain services such as obstetrics in the future We are concerned that these figures may be used categorically and that we will be forced to attempt to accept them even when we have reason to challenge their validity At St Joseph Hospital in Stamford there is little sign of compromiie It remains the most opposed to the plan Sister Mary Regina Hynes associate administrator said The plan will probably have no positive impact on improving the quality of the health services delivered to residents of our area It may educe services available and may not affect the cost of these services whatsoever Providers were requested to participate so it would appear as though they had input That input was never seriously considered This is evidenced by the fact that hundreds upon hundreds of individuals turned out at public hearings to suggest modification yet there is no evidence to my knowledge that this testimony was ever reviewed by the board of directors of HSA In fact the written transcripts were not available for review until weeks after the board of directors had voted [to approve the plan] At Greenwich Hospital the chief administrator Edward Jones feels somewhat like Sister Regina although he now puts some faith in upcoming cost and feasibility studies  in which we hope to fully participate He also hopes to have a chance during this interim study period to impress upon the agency again the unique qualities and position of Greenwich Hospital as a single hospital in a community with one of the finest costeffective records in the country Not a man to concede a battle he adds If they do mandate changes that we feel unjustified then we will alert the community again Two hospital administrators who have high praise for the plan which was filed Feb 13 with the Department of Health Education and Welfare are Norman Brady of Norwalk Hospital and Martin Diamond of Park City Hospital in Bridgeport They say they have always been behind the philosophy of regional planning with more emphasis on outreach Mr Brady headed the local Health Services Agency planning committee that drew up the controversial directive for the area He was just the man for the job he says because Norwalk Hospital had been going in the directions favored by agency since 1971 Mr Brady admits that it is still only a blueprint for action and that it is going to take a great deal more discussion understanding and accommodation to make the cutbacks in obstetrical gynecological and pediatric beds advo cated for the greater Bridgeport and GreenwichStamford areas Mr Brady does not believe the proposed changes can be brought about through coercion Instead he said we must all now look to means by which we can come to grips with the more sensitive issues [such as consolidation of services and the proposed abortion clinics] Mr Diamond likes to ponder upon the advantages that can come from such plan I am hoping he said our HSA will now have the kind of clout to obtain reimbursement for the kind of purchases or programs that could only be justified on a regional basisWe should all endeavor to be in a close partnership with HSA It can provide opportunties we never had when we were on our own 
The World Continued,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/19/archives/the-world-continued-france-italy-much-is-the-same-more-is-different.html,PARIS  While last Sundays first round of French national elections showed that half the country at least urgently wants social change todays vote will decide how far It should go at what pace and whos to be in charge Although the odds now favor the current Government coalition which the left opposition has denounced as both unwilling and unable to bring any impertant reform all the major parties have campaigned on the promise of change and modernization It has been in effect a broad recognition of discontent with things as they are with the crucial divisive issue over whether to risk drastic dislocation with the Socialists and Communists or to risk further temporizing with the centerright The signs that after all the predictions French voters will 1 decide against what Government leaders have called a dangerous adventure that could ruin the countrys economy and turn it upside down have been quietly but warmly welcomed by Frances allies and partners Even Communist Eastern Europe has hinted that it wouldnt have liked to face the uncertainties and early instability that a leftist victory in France was likely to bring I It the Government side does win as expected there is sure to be a profound sigh of relief throughout Europe not to speak of Washington But prolonging the Fifth Republics 20 years without a transfer of power would still leave the question of how to break through the political barriers to reform The decay of the Italian social fabric after almost two generations of oneparty dominance has been painfully dramatized by the wave of terrorism now culminating with the kidnapping of the Christian Democratic leader Aldo Moro It has already had an impact on France which had been focussed on its own affairs almost to the exclusion of anything going on next door Politicians feel that the abduction will accentuate the swing against the left in an impulse of immediate revulsion But the Socialist leader Gaston Deferre who already had almost written off his sides chance of winning argued that Italy showed the dangers of waiting too long for  reform In such a case he said the situation risks degeneration so badly that it is difficult to turn it around No doubt it was in part a bit of lastminute campaign desperation There are some fundamental differences between FranceandItalyButthereisalsothestrikingsimilarityofa politicalblockagetothekindofevolutionandaccommodation

existinFrancealthoughthereareareassuchasBrittany LanguedocandmuchofProvencewhichcomplainbitterlyat having been left too far behind In the last generations pell mell urbanindustrial development The deep class consciousness though drastically different in terms of actual living standards for most is perceived in a similar way in the two countries while the role of the Catholic Church is much stronger in Italy Above all the two big Communist parties limit the scope of political alternatives within the existing system in both countries In Italy the driye for sharing power with the Chris tian Democrats has spurred the Communist Party toward a milder more open and more recognizably Western development than the French Communists But it has also left the role of effective opposition increasingly to extremist groups In France avowed extremists remain on the fringes but the Communists have tried harder to absorb them and to incorporate their revolutionary vehemence Far from proposing a leftright alliance  the Italians historic compromise the French Communists have continued to preach class conflict and even made a display of their distaste for alliance with the Socialists justified by the Communist newspaper LHumanite on the eve of elections as merely necessary to beat the right Either way these political forces deny voters in both France and Italy the chance to shift their favors punish old rascals and reward what may be new ones as other electorates occasionally like to do without embarking on fundamental and perhaps irreversible change of the system itself Almost two years ago when it looked as though Italy might give first place to what has been called Europes least disrespectable Communist party in order to show its impa Hence with its least respectable conservative party the dread of the choice finally blocked that trend The same turn back from what had seemed to be a flowing tide is now taking place in France though only election results will show if it has actu ally gone far enough to assure a new majority for the Govern ment That leaves the task of moving with the times and felt national needs to administrations based on strongly conservative foundations whatever the adornments proposed to assure more restless voters that reforms lie ahead Frances President is personally committed to the idea of modernizing French society and dreams as friends put it of prying loose the moderate wing of the Socialist Party to push his plans But so far he has proven far more cautious in substance than in style His strategy in the first half of his sevenyear term was to create an atmosphere of renewal with some bouncy displays of vim and to test the national temper with new personal laws such as divorce and abortion which brought the legal code more or less up to contemporary social custom Beyond that he launched debates on more critical issues such as tax reform and property law in hopes of coaxing forth a consensus of the enlightened and avoiding a confrontation It didnt work The left opposition was not about to help him decant a part of their program substantially diluted at that and the right which had been such an important part of his constituency made clear that its enlightenment definitely did not reach as far as its wallet A behindscenes debate has already begun about the strategy Mr Giscard dEstaing ought to adopt now with only three years left before presidential elections if there is to be a chance of avoiding another headon leftright collision then providing instability doesnt force it earlier Some of his advisers urge a much bolder approach His friend JeanJacques ServanSchreiber a man of many ideas but exemplary ineptitude in presenting them convincingly to the public already came out for a wealth tax during the campaign He also urges decentralization other tax reform election reform in general the kind of measures that would appeal to nonMarxist SocialDemocrats But others urge the opposite tack arguing that there isnt any use in opening the door until you know somebody is going to walk in That in effect is a delayed action approach gambling on the possibility that defeat would splinter the Socialist Party and force its most moderate elements doubtless the ones who have appealed to the new middle classes and many centrists  into a centerleft alliance with Mr Giscard dEstaing Either way the Presidents aggressive rival the neoGaullist leader Jacques Chirac has shown he has no intention of leaving a clear field for this strategy Mr Chirac whose aides spread word during the campaign that the Giscard crowd was really Petainist  an amalgam of ultraright treacherous scarcely patriotic people wrapped in ambiguous historical reflexhas lately been insisting that he would be the true modernizerreformer in Charles de Gaulles tradition of transcending economic and social caste Whether or not he intended to carry that suggestion beyond the hustings Mr Chiracs own marvelously organized political machine rests on a stoutly conservative base and he has not shown himself to be the kind of politician who risks splitting off the support he has in hand by reaching for hesitant backers in the bush In short the desire for reforms that might break open the near deadlock in French politics is not matched by the political capacity to get them underway It may even be that the desire is so evenly matched by fear of change  even within individual hearts  that the deadlock is unbreakable through the normal political process Something like that happened in Italy France is far from such a precipice and has reserves of all sorts to draw upon but its evolution is braked in a somewhat similar way Thats what Mr Deferre and others who have issued the same kind of warning had in mind and its undoubtedly why the left has advanced as much as it has in the last decade A Government victory now would certainly mean that what seemed the impending upheaval has been avoided It wont necessarily assure a fresh start in a promising direction Flora Lewis is European diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times Drawings by Eugene Mlhessco
Behind the Abortion Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/19/archives/long-island-weekly-behind-the-abortion-vote-the-abortion-fight-in.html,THE question you ask yourself is whether you can live with yourself if you let other people kill people said Ann Robinson a leader the Long Island antiabortion movement If I had lived in Germany during World War II would I have had the courage to stand up All you can hope is that when your moral crisis comes you will be on the right side Mrs Robinsons efforts to have what she terms the right side prevail on the abortion question have been highly successful in recent weeks As the head of the Celebrate Life Committee she is among the primary organizers of a campaign that culminated in the vote by the Suf folk County Legislature to cut off Medicaid funds for abortions The measure carried 14 to 3 with one member absent despite legal opinions that state law preempts the county on this question The countys Social Services Commissioner James Kirby has said he will ignore the county resolution because it violates state law a position that seems certain to provoke a court battle The Legislatures vote on Feb 28 which overrode a veto by County Executive John VN Klein has moved many people to wonder about the Legislatures reasons for its action Interviews with several legislators indicate that a flood of antiabortion mail and telephone calls convinced them that their constituents wanted the funds cut off Legislator Ferdinand Giese Republican of East Setau ket who solicited comments from the public through a news release said he had received more than 1000 letters urging him to cut off the Medicaid funds About 200 urged the opposite Eight hours of highly emotional public statements on the issue on Feb 14the day the resolution was first taken up by the Legislaturealso proved very convincing to the legislators they said But why are residents of Suffolk County including housewives like Mrs Robinson of Commack so militant on this issue James Ross chairman of the New York State Coalition for Life and a resident of Melville noted that for his side the basis of the whole state movement is NassauSuffolk Having the antiabortion resolution pass in Suffolk he said is one method by which the righttolife movement hopes to pressure the State Legislature to change the state law which currently permits Medicaidfinanced abortions in cases of rape and incest and whenever the procedure is medically necessary Interviews with leaders on both sides of the issue as well as with legislators sociologists and representatives of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre which covers Nassau and Suffolk except for Fishers Island show that a combination of religious sociological and demographic factors has made the Island a stronghold of antiabortion sentiment Suffolk County became a target for this effort particularly because the members of the County Legislature who are elected in defined districts are much more accessible to their constituents than the Nassau Board of Supervisors The Supervisors as the chief executives of their towns are considered to be more insulated from pressure than the Suffolk legislators Among the factors that appear to make the Island an antiabortion capital is proximity to New York City Mrs Robinson described the city as an abortion mecca where horrendous incidentsincluding she said the abortion of an eightmonth fetushave taken place One Suffolk legislator who asked to remain anonymous because he feared reprisal from antiabortion forces noted that many of the Islands residents were former New Yorkers who had fled the city and had a very negative attitude toward welfare recipients When mixed with a highly moral attitude toward sex this results he said in an unvoiced feeling that those seeking abortions have fooled around so let them pay for it This legislator also noted that opposition to feminism might have been a factor in the adoption by the Suffolk Legislature of its abortion resolution As a result of last Novembers elections the numbertof women in the Legislature declined from four to one But the interviews indicated that the major factors responsible have been religion and the organizing efforts of the Rockville Centre Diocese a contention emphatically denied by leaders of the antiabortion movement Mrs Robinson a Roman Catholic points out that her group is nonsectarian and meets in a Lutheran Church The Suffolk legislator who introduced the resolution Louis P Howard is a Lutheran Opinion polls including The New York TimesCBS poll taken last October have shown that only a slightly higher percentage of Catholics is opposed to public financing of abortions than Protestants there are about half a million Catholics in Suffolk County according to the diocese out of an estimated population of 1315700 The TimesCBS poll found 48 percent of Catholics opposed and 44 percent of Protestants Nevertheless these factors emerged from the interviews Since 1969 the Rockville Centre Diocese has had a prolife coordinator whose job has been to educate Catholics on the churchs opposition to abortion and to help organize prolife groups in each parish In 1972 the coordinator the Rev Paul Driscoll began to work fulltime on this effort In an interview he said that he believed no other diocese in the country had begun such efforts as early as Rockville Centre and that most dioceses did not begin unti11975 IThese parishorganizing efforts have been augmented by letters from the Bishop to the parishioners These letters have been read from pulpits at Sunday masses The Long Island Catholic a diocesan newspaper distributed to all parishioners asks political candidates their positions on political questions including abortion and prints their replies Ann Hamilton of Setauket cocoordinator of the Suffolk Abortion Rights Campaign said that supporters of the right to choose abortion did not have monolithic organization like the Catholic Church on which to base their organizing efforts Mildred Steinberg of East Setauket the other coordinator of the group and Democratic legislator before her defeat last November said she could not get over legislators using their seats to espouse a religious belief Father Driscoll insists however that the connection of the antiabortion movement with the church is overstated We feel this is a civilrights issue he said and that the people who favor abortion have been very successful a9 a political tactic in focusing on our religion Even states that have very insignificant Catholic populations like Arkansas have passed resolutions calling for a constitutional convention on the abortion issue Furthermore Father Driscoll said he does not consider his organizing work violation of the principle of separation of church and state I make a distinction between religious and moral beliefs he said The church should not try to force its religious beliefs on others but I believe this is a moral issue just like Vietnam The issue then as now was Is this the right way to treat our fellow man For Mrs Robinson and others who agree with her trhe issue is murderthe murder of what they call a preborn child But for right to choose proponents such as Mrs Hamiltonwho thought the abortion question was closed after the 1973 Supreme Court rulingthe issue now involves overpopulation teenage pregnancies discrimination against the poor and a possible threat to other civil rights Both now realize that the struggle will be a protracted one

Letter TO THE EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/19/archives/letters-to-the-editor-atlantic-city-and-the-mob-paperback-school-of.html,Atlantic City and the Mob Howard Blums and Jeff Gerths superb investigative article The Mob Gambles on Atlantic City Feb 5 might better have been called The Mob Invests in Atlantic City H H HAMMER New York City As a concerned New Jerseyan currently studying in Massachusetts I am most disappointed in my home states officials for their failure to stem the tide of encroachment by organized crime And in response to your article I have written Gov Brendan Byrne to tell him so It is my hope that revealing articles such as yours will eventually lead if necessary to the repeal of the bill which permits legalized gambling in Atlantic City  anything to prevent organized crime from taking over JOHN J TROCITA Maryknoll Seminary Hingham Mass Atlantic City is not a gram place but a friend and I liked to go down there for winter weekends We went again recently most likely for the last time When the gambling law was passed everyone we spoke with in town was delighted They had voted enthusiastically for the law with the hope that with its passage their lives might improve and they would move with the old city into a new and better future This last time attitudes had changed At a drugstore counter we overheard a gloomy diseussion by a group of what appeared to be boardwalk concessionaires I heard X has sold out Im hanging on but I dont know for how long I wish I had never voted for that law As the old hotels were shut down for renovation or wrecking there was no spillover business for the small businesses which depended on the hotels trade for their survival Evidently beforiE these peoples interests can be served those of the big corporations the mobs and the politicians must first be satisfied CAROL ATKIN New York City Regrettably The New York Times Magazine treated an important story with tabloid sensationalism at the expense of the ItalianAmerican community This group is used to paying for the sins of the Mafia but it hurts more when the crimes of others are by comparison played down Banner headlines and prominent photos screamed a reputed Mafia takeover though the article itself let on that other criminals and shady corporations were grabbing most of the Atlantic City action It took a keen eye however to discover the nonItalian names What stayed with the unwary reader were the Godfather trappings Yes expose the Mafia and all other criminals but do it without smearing ethnic groups EDWARD J MARCHESE Flushing NY Paperback School of Literature I strongly disagree with Mitchell S Rosss assessment of Tom Robbins Prince of the Paperback Literati Feb 12 People who like Mr Rob binss books arent looking for rational truth but for the sliceoflife variety of truth As Mr Ross himself indicates Tom Robbins appeals to the youth market This crowd grew up with outlandish characters and unlikely events being the only things that could be counted on with any certainty They saw Jack Ruby kill Oswald on TV and to this day wonder who killed John Kennedy and why Was there ever a more outlandish character than Nixon And when the President of the United States can say as Carter did to justify his stand on the use of Federal funds for abortion that life isnt fair the conclusion is obvious and almost banal The truth is not that life isnt fair but that life isnt sensible If the President of the United States doesnt have to be sensible does an American novelist The days of the writer as god recounting peoples stories with a total knowledge of each characters point of view are over The expected never materializes the unlikeliest of events occur and often in real life we are left trying to fit together the pieces A novel which represents this confusion is certainly as valid as a novel which adheres to any other style or philosophy of writing ANNE SAIDMAN Brooklyn NY Who reads Tom Robbins Mr Ross I do Who am I A working anthropologist who teaches in the City University of New York system and turns a decent dollar at consulting work as well Yes I read Tom Robbins and Saul Bellow Leon Uris and would you believe it James Joyce too Also Reed Brautigan Faulkner Gardner Vonnegut Doestoyevsky Berger Garcia Marquez and perish science fiction as well Clearly the place Im making for myself in the world is pretty straight compared with those of Tom Robbinss characters but that doesnt preclude my identifying with them Dont I share their sense of the world as a china shop with a bull let loose in it Cant I admire them for taking their pleasure and their enlightenment where they chance Dont I Where Mr Ross sees only chaos some of us see the facile truth that everything is connected to everything else Puerile as that is its a better description of the universe than any being offered by the church the state or General Motors In fact if one accepts that facile truth one is obligated to undertake extreme acts of personal responsibility As for buying paperbacks I do so because I like lowcost books Mine seem to withstand a great deal of rereading and not a little battering Books are for reading Mr Ross not for cherishing as fetishes NAT WANDER New York City If I think Castanedas mysticism is foolishness it has nothing to do with the empathy evoked by Pirsigs struggle for sanity or Vonneguts precious humor So what if they write in the same decade and have been made popular by college students The point is not the debatable importance of this writer or the other but Mitchell Rosss insinuation that these authors as a group are not primarily interested in a fresh penetration of reality His safe critical comment is that Joyce Dreiser Mann and Cervantes do better holding a mirror to humanity What perspicacity I can tell you honestly that as much as I loved The Magic Mountain I was more personally if less profoundly touched by Pirsigs sophomoric often fumbling Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance or Pynchons dynamic Gravitys Rainbow The EODORE BOAVORTH New York City I write to correct an error I made in the piece on Tom Robbins which was published in The Soho Weekly

insensitive female does not care about the agony endured by such an animal in the hours or days required for it to die in a trap might she not be just a little concerned about the future when this

student aid smoking health costs saccharin Government reorganization and urban policy are only some of the controversies he has tackled Last week he opened a whole new area of debate by proposing the biggest change in 90 years in Federal drug law through simplifying regulation of the hundreds of thousands of prescription drugs and overthecounter medicines sold in the United States And in his first year he has by most accounts made more enemies than friends He has been attacked by both sides in the abortion controversy Handicapped people have demonstrated in his front yard Civilrights activists believe he has not gone far enough to promote school desegregation while many white politicians believe he has gone too far His welfare bill has been challenged by those who think it is too generous and by those who find it too stingy The increase Social Security taxes that he won last year has been so widely criticized that it may well be repealed  He has fought with such influential legislators as John Brademas the House Democratic Whip and Al Ullman chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Congressmen from tobacco states fear that his antismoking campaign will bankrupt their constituents Hardly a week has gone by when he has not been at odds with Hamilton Jordan the top White House political aide But through it all he has gained the respect and confidence of the OW man who really counts President Carter Today no other Cabinet member gains the Presidents ear more readily One White House staff member who usually reflects the Presidents thinking calls Mr Califano crazy hyperactive and imbalanced Another says that the Secretary is the most complete egomaniac I have ever met But those same staff members who find Mr Califanos personality so difficult say that they and the President could not be more pleased with his performance Within the Administration for example Mr Califano fought hard against the creation of a separate Cabinet Department of Education a step that would not only take away territory from his department but would also in Mr Califanos view make education programs more difficult to manage But since he lost that fight and the Presidents proposal was made Mr Califano has given it unquestioning support Even more important in the Presidents view White House aides say has been Mr Califanos willingness to take political heat away from the President on controversial issues Al though his position on abortion  he opposes any Government funding for them  is identical to the Presidents it has been Mr Califano and not Mr Carter who has borne the brunt of the pressure from those who disagree In a city of bulging egos it is doubtful that there is anyone more conscious of his press clippings than is Joe Califano Out of town he has been known to send aides 20 miles or more to airports to buy copies of national newspapers He can call more reporters by name than the most experienced publicists in town Watching a Presidential news conference on television in his office a couple of months ago he commented not once about the substance of Presidents Carters statements but remarked over and over about the quality of different camera angles employed by the networks But the secret of his success has Peen his ability to work on the inside first as a Pentagon staff assistant in the Kennedy Administration when he was in his earlythirties then as the principal architect of the Great Society in the Johnson White House and during the eight years of Republican rule as one of the highest paid lawyers and lobbyists the capital By the time of the 1976 election he was 45 years old financially secure and ready to take on one of the biggest jobs in Government Since its creation in 1953 the Department of Health Education and Welfare has grown into the most unwieldy Government agencies a behemoth that sprawls throughout Washington and its suburbs and into every state and county the country spending more than onethird of the entire Federal budget and employing about 150000 people No Secretary before was able to manage it not Wilbur J Cohen the master bureaucrat not Elliot L Richardson the political jackofalltrades not Caspar W Weinberg President Nixons budgetary wizard and most surely not F David Mathews the scholar who sat in the Secretarys office during the Ford Administration What appealed most to me about the job Mr Califano said soon after taking office was the idea that no one could bring HEW under control By God Im going to show people that this place can be managed In regular 16hour working days he has tried to cope with even the most minute details of his department He goes over every regulation line by line tends to the hiring and firing lobbies Congressmen assiduously takes calls from reporters and makes a point to touch every base several times around Benjamin W Heineman Jr his young executive assistant says that Mr Califano is a regular waterbug He skims across the surface faster than anyone else Ive ever seen It is too early to tell whether Mr Califanos efforts to run his department will go for naught Many of his initiatives such as welfare reform and hospital cost containment are trouble in Congress But Mr Califano believes that the issues he is tackling require long gestation periods and that in the end if he works hard enough he will succeed He said that one night recently as he sat behind his desk with autographed photographs himself with Presidents Johnson and Carter on the wall behind his head staring across the room at a framed poster inscribed with a quotation from the poet Robert Browning A mans reach should exceed his grasp David E Rosenbaum is assistant news editor in the Washington bureau of The New York Times Richard TImperlo
"Parkchester Hospital in the Bronx, A Subject of Inquiry, Closes Doors",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/20/archives/parkchester-hospital-in-the-bronx-a-subject-of-inquiry-closes-doors.html,The Parkchester General Hospital a private 208bed facility in the Grand Concourse section of the Bronx closed yesterday discharging the last of its 140 patients most of whom were moved to neighboring hospitals over the weekend The hospital had been the subject of an investigation by New York States Health Department which ordered a 30day closing of its abortion and maternity services in January and which was holding hearings on whether to close them permanently The hospitals administrator Arnold Feinstein said the investigation and the resultant publicity had reduced the number of patients from 165 before the January closing to 115 or 120 directly after dealing the institution a financial blow from which it could not recover LifeThreatening Deficiencies Barbara Thomas a spokesman for the Office of Health Systems Management the regulatory arm of the Health Department said its initial survey of the hospital last July uncovered lifethreatening deficiencies in the counseling lab work and recordkeeping for abortion and maternity patients and in medical efforts to save the lives of viable babies that are sometimes born during late abortions She mentioned as examples of faults of the hospital that prompted the January closing a dearth of counseling for patients before and after abortions and a lack of adequate records on the ages of fetuses and on whether cervical examinations had been performed on the mothers Mr Feinstein called the investigation a beautiful job of harassment and said state doctors and administrators who fol lowed up the initial survey had never bothered to find out whether the hospital had remedied the deficiencies it was cited for although they came in every day reading charts and peering over doctors shoulders The root of the financial damage done to the hospital he said was that most doctors who used its obstetric services took their patients and practices elsewhere during the closing and did not come back Feb 1 even though a State Supreme Court judge held that the health department could not renew its order for closing for another 30 days Mr Feinstein also insisted that the closing was undeserved because the hospital had just passed two Federal inspections for accreditation to receive Medicaid and Medicare patientsone before and one after the state investigation Once the decision had been made to close the whole hospital Mr Feinstein said the patients were discharged and moved by ambulance in a very orderly quiet fashion from the hospital at Westchester and Parker Avenues to neighboring facilitiesWestchester Square Union St Barnabas Bronx Lebanon and Misericordia Hospitals Some were very unhappytheyd stayed here before and were sorry to see it close he said And yesterday afternoon a hospital operator said Theres just six girls and me here working the switchboard Its just a shell They moved the last one out this morning The hospitals owner Dr Bernard Kamer of New Rochelle could not be reached for comment 1
Medicaid Abortions Called Possible Bar To an Albany Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/21/archives/medicaid-abortions-called-possible-bar-toan-albany-budget-trying-to.html,ALBANY March 20The question whether state Medicaid money should be used to pay for abortions has been added by Senate Republicans to the list of possible impediments to agreement on next years state budget Special to The New York Times With only 11 days remaining before the new state fiscal year begins top Republican aides say that 25 to 30 Senators of their party are opposed to continuing the state policy of paying for abortions But how many would translate their opposition into nay votes on the entire localassistance budget which would contain the money cannot be ascertained Trying to End Differences This is going to be a tough one said an aide to Senator Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton the majority leader The feeling is that if they dont get the money out of the budget theyll lose their only shot at itthat the Governor would probably veto any other attempt Governor Carey has said he supports Medicaid financing of abortions to keep women from turning to illicit practitioners The Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut Democrat of Brooklyn has thus far balked at suggestions that he separate this appropriation from the rest of the budget according to legislative aides This latest complication was disclosed as Mr Anderson and Mr Steingut met for more than an hour to begin discussions aimed at working out their differences on the budget An aide to Mr Steingut said therY had outlined the 20 or so major problem areas but had done little to resolve them The nature of the personal income taxreduction and a new education formula continue to top that list Senator Anderson wants to substitute a permanent sharp reduction in taxes on salary income for the one time 5 percent tax credit that the Governor proposed a plan that Mr Carey and his Democratic allies in the Assembly say would be unaffordable in future years

not been able to settle the vexing Issues surrounding abortion Neither have philosophers from THE AMBIVALENCE OF ABORTION By Linda Bird Francke 261 pages 261 pages Random House 10 ABORTION IN AMERICA The Origins and Evolution of National Policy By James C Mohr 331 pages Illustrated  Oxford 1250 Aristotle all the way down to FlipSchlafly So no mere book is going ro do it nor certainly any book reviewer Still between absolute positions pro and con there is plenty of room for argument and plenty of argument indeed has been  raging within that room On the one hand there is a growing belief particularly among RighttoLifers that many women have begun to take too casual an attitude toward abortion that they have come to see it as an easy alternative to contraception  On another hand some feminists can not understand what all the fuss is about They see abortion as simple and absolutely liberating They think that whether a woman is casual about the experience or not is nobodys damn business Between these two positions is where Linda Bird Frankes The Ambivalence of Abortion comes in Miss Francke wants to convey what the actual experience is like She wants to do it with more evidence than was offered her by her own abortion experience which was unhappy A very little ghost kept appearing and waving at her whenever she saw something beautiful like the full moon on the ocean last weekend and which evoked a storm of response when she described it in a Timess Op So after briefly describing the hist ry technimies and current availabilit of abortion she devotes the balano of her book to verbatim statements various people she interviewed He subjects include single women who ha abortions both after and before tht 1973 Supreme Court decision to legal ize abortion and both in their firs and second trimesters as well married women men couples teen agers parents and women lookini back to 30 40 and 50 years ago The results if we can trust them will give comfort to neither the Right toLifers nor the more extreme femi nists If there is any generalization we can draw from the rambling testimonies printed here it is that whatever the reasons were that these people decided to undergo abortionand some of them were casual while most were carefully consideredalmost no one came  away from the experience unscathed Most of the women were hurt physically even in their first trimesters  Many were damaged psychologically too experiencing fear guilt overtheir lost children a subsequent revulsion for sex lowered selfesteem an inability to conceive again and a tendency to withdraw from their partners Many of the men interviewed suffered as well whether they were aware of it or not Indeed the only wholly positive conclusion one can draw from Miss Franckes sampling is that the experience of abortion was cnsistently worse before the 1973 Supreme Court decision than it has If one can trust Miss Franckes evidence Unfortunately one can not enOnly She seems to have an affinity fer hearsay evidence For instance early in her book she announces that In a most disturbing trend  some women are having an amniocentesis which is a test designed to pinpoint possible metabolic and developmental iisarders in the fetus] done solely to letsrmine the sex of the fetus and are opting to abort if it is a girl But how many some women are or how the author knows they are doing this she doesnt bother to say Similarly but far more damagingly there is noevident rationale for her sampling For all we know the interviewees were chosen simply to illustrate what Miss Francke herself believes about the abortion experience I doubt that this is the case but there is no inherent reason why someone strongly opposed to or in favor of abortion couldnt conclude otherwise and dismiss her book A far more interesting and pertinent study of the subject is James CMohrs Abortion in America The Origins and Evolution of National Policy This is a somewhat scholarly but altogether lucid review of American abortion policy in the 19th century by a professor of history at the University of Maryland Baltimore County There isnt space here to describe exactly how Professor Mohr thinks we got from the completely permissive attitude toward abortion that prevailed here until 1840 to the strict prohibition that had triumphed by 1900 The point is that until 1840 a permissive attitude did prevail And while it was in large part the desire of the medical fraternity to professionalize itself and anxiety on the part of uppermiddleclass white AngloSaxon Protestants over their declining birthrates that contributed to the legal proscription of abortion it is ironically these very same groups that are now in favor of abortion and are now in the one case performing it and in the other the recipients of it Does this mean that the present controversy represents one final seizure of a historical aberration Professor Mohr in an afterword called The Roe Decision and the End of an Era suggests that it does  it seems extremely possible that the foregoing book will come to be seen as an examination not of the origins and evolutions of Americas normal or usual abortion policies but rather of how the single greatest period of interruption or deviation from the norm came about Unfortunately his book ent to press before the actions taken by the Su preme Court and theCongress in the early summer of 1977 served to limit the availability of abortion to the poor So Professor Mohr is not in a position to speculate whetherPresident Carter was simply offering us a lesson in moral philosophy when he condoned these actions on  the grounds that there are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cant or whether the Presidents words and the actions of the Court and the Congress actually reflects a 19thcentury attitude in Americans that is more alive than Professor Mohr suspects

Governor Carey and the legislative leaders would be less generous to those earning under 50000 than the Governors original plan and more generous to those earning above 75000 projections by the State Budget Division indicated today Under the revised tax package according to the division the taxes of a family of four with an adjusted gross income of 50000 would be lowered by 235 while the Governors original proposal would have lowered its taxes by 401a difference of 166 But the tax for a family making 75000 would be 67 less than under the Governors plan and a family making 100000 would pay 227

not comment until he had seen the Budget Divisions research The tax reduction was intended by all sides to spur economic development and was to be a particular source of encouragement to middlemanagement and highranking corporate executives The resulting package is more favorable than Mr Careys original plan to those at the top but considerably les favorable to the middlemanagers One making 25000 would save 30 on his tax billless than a wageearner making 10000 The reduction in relief for those in the 25000to50000 bracket is the result of the elimination of the onetime tax credit of between 10 and 100 that Mr Carey had proposed for this year and the delay of an increase in the personal exemption according to tax experts These experts said that because the new reduction was permanent however the gain to taxpayers would be the same over the long run The increased benefit for those making more than 75000 comes from the fact that while most of Mr Careys tax reductions would not have aided those with net taxable incomes of more than 70000 the new plan reduces the top tax rate on income to 12 percent for all those with net taxable incomes of more than 21000 The tax plan

Civil Liberties Union Gives Byrne An ‘Exceptionally Strong’ Record,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/25/archives/new-jersey-pages-civil-liberties-union-gives-byrne-an-exceptionally.html,TRENTON March 24Governor Byrne had an exceptionally strong record and the 197677 Legislature caused great concern and disappointment according to the assessment by the states American Civil Liberties Union on bills it supports Special to The Now York Times David ILochner legislative director of the group said Mr Byrne displayed courage and ended the session on strong upbeat with his pocket vetoes of the death penalty silent meditation and obscenity bills MrHochner said the ACLU had analyzed 17 bills considered in the twoyear session and that the organization supported 10 of them and opposed six Of 10 six were passed and signed intolaw by Mr Byrne Bills prohibiting redlining the refusal by lending institutions to make loans on real estate in declining neighborhoods to permit parents and students to examine school records while limiting access by others to allow radio television and magazine reporters to protect sources of information a protection already available to newspaper reporters to provide greater privacy for women rape victims to make permanent the offices of Public Interest Athocacy and Inmate Advocacy in the Department of the Public Defender and to create a study commission on Individual Liberty and Personal Privacy Four bills supported by the ACLU did not pass These were for making possession of small amounts of marijuana no longer a crime expediting the handling of civil rights complaints expanding the right of expungement from the record of a disorderly person conviction and adopting a new penal code The group said six of the measures it opposed were passed by the Legislature Three were killed by Mr Byrne who refused to act on them during 45day period after the session closed Jan 10 Of the bills Mr Hochner said The silentmeditation bill was viewed as an insidious vehicle for rcintroucing prayer into the public schools The obscenity bill was opposed on the grounds that it would have infringed on tne rignts of citizens to freedom of expression and would have denied due process to individuals charged with possessing or distributing obsence materials The obscenity bill would have allowed people to be prosecuted for violating local standards of decency The two major blots on the Governors record were his signing a bill permitting the release of juvenile court records under certain circumstances and a bill prohibiting the sexual exploitation of children in photographs and films Mr Hochner said The latter bill was opposed by the ACLU not because of its stated purpose of curbing sexual abuse of children with which the ACLU is in sympathy but because its provisions extend to the dissemination of materials and thereby infringe on freedom of speech and freedom of the press His assessment went on During the last session our Governor took many constitutionally sound and morally principled stands on some very thorny issues The Legislature to its credit passed several good bills but also passed several bad ones and it is only because of the Governors leadership that civil liberties didnt suffer further setbacks in New Jersey Moreover the Legislature took a most irresponsible and shortsighted action in passing a bill which petitions Congress to convene a constitutional convention for the purpose of outlawing abortion a fundamental right that is safeguarded to American women by the Supreme Court and which is supported by healthy majority of American women and men This resolution asking for the constitutional convention was sent to Congress The other measure opposed by the ACLU a resolution rescinding the New Jersey Legislatures approval of the proposal Equal Rights Amendment was not brought up for a vote in the Legislature in the 197677 session
NBC Radio Ban on Anti‐Abortion Sermon Contestod,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/25/archives/nbc-radio-ban-on-antiabortion-sermon-contested-most-stations-to.html,The NBC radio networks refusal to carry a broadcast of The Lutheran Hour that contains a sermon opposing abortion has aroused clergymen of several denominations who contend that the networks action is an abridgement of religious freedom Some officials of other churches have been urging the producing organization the International Lutheran Laymens League to challenge the networks decision in the courts as a constitutional issue These churches according to Tommy Thompson manager of domestic radio for the league have offered to contribute legal and financial assistance if the case is pursued Theyre telling us were dropping the ball for everyone if we dont go to court Mr Thompson said But he expressed doubt that the Lutheran ChurchMissouri Synod a conservative branch of the Lutheran denominaton would want to mount a legal case over the broadcast The league is a constituent organization of the Missouri Synod NBC Radio which has carried The Lutheran Hour for 22 years as a Sunday morning broadcast whose air time is paid for by the league had never before found a program in the series unacceptable The network on April 9 will carry a repeat of an earlier sermon by the Rev Dr Oswald C 1 Hoffman the regular speaker for the series in place of the one on abortion NBC said the abortion sermon had been rejected because it violated a longstanding company policy The policy prohibits the sales of air time to any group that would use it to express its views on a controversial issue NBC CBS and ABC all maintain that such issues are best dealt with and can be given the fairest examination in their own news and publicaffairs programming The public interest goal addressed by this policy NBC said in a statement seeks to provide the public with in formation on controversial issues under auspices of distinterested journalists rather than advocates that have the means to buy time to express their views But Dr Everett C Parker director of the Office of ComMunication of the United Church of Christ contends that the policy was misapplied in the case of the Lutheran Hour and that the networks action represents the censoring of a religious sermon Regardless where on stands on the abortion question one has to recognize this as a First Amendment offenseI mean as it affects the freedom of religion and not the freedom of speech said Mr Parker one of the clergymen who have been pushing for a legal challenge of NBCs refusal to carry the broadcast Most Stations to Carry It Despite the networks rejection of the program the antiabortion broadcast will be carried on April 9 on virtually all the stations that normally air The Lutheran Hour Of approximately 950 radio stations that carry the series only 42 receive it on the NBC network The Lutheran Laymens League which purchases the time independently on the other stations pays NBC 75000 for the broadcasts Moreover the league has circumvented the network by purchasing time for the single broadcast on 30 of the stations that normally receive it over NBC lines Those stations like others in the Lutheran Hours own network will have the program sent to them by mail on a disk We never intended to be controversial with this program Mr Thompson remarked Were a very conservative denomination and rather literal in our interpretation of Scripture The address by Dr Hoffman is a positive piece a pro life statement from scriptural sources The title of it is The Sanctity of Life He added It makes no reference to the political debate and recommends no political action If it decries anything it is the development of an abortion inenfailly in this country Mr Thompson said that in the usual procedure the league submitted to NBC a recording of the several weeks in advance of the broadcast and the netWorks rejectionof it camel as a surprise  Weve occasionally disagreed wording in the past Mr Thompson said but nothing worse than that Yotiktthirik_ that after 22 years on the network we might have developed some credibility with NBC He said that after the rejection he asked the network for its internal list of topics to avoid and was told there was no such list Although conceding that the episode has been somewhat disillusioning Mr Thompson said it was_unlikelY that the league would terminate its relationship with NBC over the issue
Behind the Sayisms and Smilisms,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/26/archives/behind-the-sayisms-and-smilisms-carter.html,DURING the remarkable Presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter journalists assigned him observed a candidate who seemed to rule his political life from an emotional cloister the walls of which no reporter was able to penetrate They came to Know his caretully designed campaign style but the boys and girls on the bus who rode behind him use Timothy Crouses phrase never got to know the man from Plains They observed and reported on his disingenuous rhetoric his parabolic symbols and his constant smile But they were never able to nail down who or what he was Indeed a year after his inauguration the people who elected him remain uncertain as to who and what he is Dasher by James Wooten is the most complete exposition yet put down of the complex enigmatic elusive personality who has come from the relative obscurity of a Georgia governorship to lead the free world In Dasher there is no attempt to fill the gap political history created when Theodore H White decided not to chronicle the 1976 making of the President Nor is there any pretense here to making this the definitive Carter biography Much less does Dasher rose as one of those pompous politicized profiles that syndicated columnists periodically produce provide the last word on the Carter Presidency This most simply put is solid and important reportage a journalists vivid account of the life of Jimmy Carter from the cradle to the Oval Office The portrait strips away much of the narcissistic posturing and needless posing that afflicts every politician who dreams of becoming President and that was in the nature of the Carter candidacy The man who found merit and votes in declaiming he was not Washington not of the national Democratic establishment not a lawyer and not a liar now may be understood for a good deal of what he is In the early primary days some saw him as a mystic possessed of a special charisma of isolated contentment Later others suspected a cunning political stratagem of disengagement with the press in order protect the elusive imagery he was creating Finally a few thought he simply was insecure lacking in selfconfidence in dealing with a pack of press wolves who might devour him as they had other candidates of recent memory There were moments as in the Playboy interview when he risked decent exposure and should have been perceived as a man almost as humanly vulnerable as Gerald Ford But he had starved the issuehungry press The sudden realization that the Southern Baptist demagogue spoke the language of the common man was given all the news impact of Richard M Nixons declaring himself not to be a crook Stung but elected by a peanutskinthin margin he fled with his closest adviserprotectors to the White House where no reporter save one has managed to get behind the sayisms symbolisms and smilisms That one is James Wooten a reporter and a Southerner who had come to know Mr Carter while working for The New York TiMes in Atlanta Mr Wooten covered and reported on the phenomenal Presidential quest then Was assigned to follow Mr Carter to the White House There Mr Wooten found himself in pursuit of the undiscovered identity of Jimmy Carter At the same time Mr Carter found himself trusting Mr Wooten at least at times Those close to him took Mr Wooten into their confidence at least occasionally may have been his Southernness his redneck resemblance to Jody Powell or his affectionate regard for the Carter matriarch Miz Lillian that gave him special accessibility to the inner circle For those who are of the South and continue to indulge in the centuryold game of Dixiewatching as historically imposed rite of intellectual masochism there will be the temptation to claim this as a regional book in the tradition of New South authors To the extent that where Mr Wooten comes from and how he talks may have helped him get on Mr Carters warm side and to the degree that his own unique rearing may have allowed him to walk in the Presidents shoes rather than merely trace his steps the point being Southern is worth mentioning But Mr Wooten is not a Southern writer He is a national reporter no less no more He claims to be no more He points out that Mr Carter won not because or even spite of being Southern but because he was more astute than any other candidate at reading the publics fickle mind and at feeding the publics gnawing hunger for a candidate who could be trusted Of course Mr Wooten points out Mr Carter understood that where he came from presented him with campaign problems that had to be solved But his career as a naval engineer trained him well at problemsolvand he solved this one The title of the book was taken from Mr Carters Secret Servicegiven campaign code name and the subtitle includes the moneysmart mention of Roots as is fashionable in publishing since Alex Haley Dasher is less a search for Mr Carters roots than discovery of his nerve ends The discovery will make those who want to keep their Presidents on a pedestal somewhat edgy Mr Wooten in the quest for his story does explore the Carter lineage He opens up the subject as he and Mr Carter are seat partners on a campaign flight and the candidate is speaking fondly of his genealogy His family he tells the reporter has lived in Georgia for more than 200 years He traced the family roots for Mr Wooten offering detailed biographical sketches of ancestors several generations back providing years of birth and dates of death building a quite masterful narrative The Southern instincts of the national reporter led him to ask the natural but theretofore unasked question of the national candidate who was Southern Did any of his ancestors own slaves Mr Wooten describes the reaction His face changed abruptly He had been relaxed coasting pleasantly along on the flow of his tales from the past enjoying himself immensely knowing he was entertaining his companion in the next seat  His translucent eyes turned frost He handed his tray  to a passing stewardess and brushed himself with his napkin  He finally responded without looking in the direction of the question The conversation it seemed was over No no I dont think so  Well actually I dont know  I just dont know about that  Mr Wooten of course found that the Carters typical of Southern agrarian landowners  hardworking hardpraying hardfighting folk  indeed had owned slaves to help them dig success out of the dirt of South Georgia A century after emancipation the Carter heir who would become President remained sensitive to the negative impact slavery might have on his campaign He understood racism as a trigger mechanism in politics As a Georgia Governor he had put up in the State Capitol a portrait of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr but as a candidate shortly before he had solicited and received the support of Roy Harris his states premier racebaiter and had described his predecessorGovernor in these terms Lester Maddox is the embodiment of the Democratic Party Throughout his campaign he had fretted over the racial controversy that erupted in his church in Plains when a black minister the Rev Clement King had sought admission as a member All the Carter clan was upset by it and Miz Lillian who was thought have overcome her Dixie upbringing snarled according to Mr Wooten somebody should have shot that nigger before he came across the lawn As a candidate Mr Carter was equally edgy about more contemporary questions in the public mind I dont give a damn about abortion or amnesty or righttowork laws   he says Theyre impossible pointcal issues Mr Wootens perception of Mr Carters ambition suggests that as candidate he wanted to have it both ways He wanted to have all the votes This he suggests led him into the posture of assuming then reversing positions on abortion righttowork and ethnic purity It led him into claiming as good friends popular singing stars Bob Dylan and John Denver much to their surprise It led a campaign aide to say He really believes he can walk from one room where he met with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and convince them hes against abortion and  enter another room and persuade  the National Organization of Women that hes with them on abortion And his marvelous capacity to rationalize such inconsistencies with conviction means that he can plead with fervor to the electorate If I ever lie to you if I ever mislead you if I ever avoid a controversial issue dont vote for me Thus says Mr Wooten Mr Carter cornered the truth market early in a year in which the voters sought above all else an honest politician With all the Carter quirks and contradictions Mr Wooten poses his book remains in many positive ways a gentle and even sympathetic treatment of a political personality It is in no sense in the genre of Victor Lasky and Ralph DeToledano There is the hunch that Mr Wooten likes Jimmy Carter and likes him because he understands him not in spite of his knowledge of the man Mr Wootens dilemmais sim pie He is honest about the man he likes Jirrimy Carter the candidate who courted the truth market should understand that 
Budget Pact in Albany Raises Aid To Schools With Problem Pupils,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/29/archives/new-jersey-pages-budget-pact-in-albany-raises-aid-to-schools-with.html,ALBANY March 28A drastically revised educationaid formula benefiting school districts with large numbers of academically poor and handicapped students was accepted today by the legislative leaders and Governor Carey The accord overcame a major obstacle in the feverish effort to reach agreement on new state budget in time for the fiscal year that begins Saturday The program would Increase state aid to public schools by 230 million about 80 million more than Governor Carey had requested and would continue the guarantee that no school district would get any less slate money than it got last year New York City would receive an increase of 905 million about 10 million more than under Mr Careys original plan Because academically poor and handicapped students tend to be concentrated more in hardpressed cities the new formula would satisfy Governor Careys intention to shift state education aid from the wealthier suburban areas to those cities And by making the change in the basic operating formula rather than in special categorical programs the program would help insure that New York City will receive the aid it expects from the state to help close its budget gap over the next several years This is the first major change in approach to giving schools state aid since 1962 said Arthur J Kremer Democrat of Long Beach chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee He said was more defensible than the Governors plan to shift aid by using enrollment rather than attendance to count students Upstate Republicans had charged their districts would lose money under that planwhich they felt would encourage truancyand they refused to accept it Negotiations on other remaining aspects of the budget continued around the Capitol today but there was little hope of bringing a completed budget to the floors of the Assembly and Senate before Friday the last possible day to do so Other developments included these sides were close to agreement on an increase in the Tuition Assistance Program of about 8 million which would increase aid to students in public colleges around the state by up to 100 per student The Legislature has already accepted a 300 increase in the maximum Tilltion Asistdnce program grant from 1500 to 1800 chew proposals on how to offer propertytax protection for the elderly were presented but the issue remained unresolved Mr Kremer said that for plan to be accepted it would have to lean heavily toward senior citizens but give benefits to a larger number of Persons The salestax credit on heating fuel remained unresolved tiThe maximum incometax credit for the lowestincome families was increased from 50 to 65 and other changes were still under discussion Mr Kremer said Projections by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee confirmed earlier BudgetDivision estimate that the incometax proposal would benefit those making less than 16000 and more than 50000 proportionately more than the 25000to50000 middle managers at which was to be aimed The agreement was reported to be holding firm nevertheleses because the reatictions at the bottom end satisfied the Assembly Democrats and those at the top end satisfied the Senate Republicans 9The issue of whether the state should continue financing abortions through Medicaid remained an unresolved problem and grew increasingly emotional as dozens of demonstrators favoring and oppcsing the option of abortions lobbied outside the Assembly and Senate chambers In its essence the educationaid plan accepted by the legislative leaders is similar to but more generous than Governor Careys proposal It is a selfadjusting formula that would aid school districts to varying degrees depending on how much property wealth they had per student A district of average wealthabout 60000 worth of property per studentwould receive 49 percent of their first 1450 it spent per student and 20 percent of the next 50 Wealthier districts would receive less than 49 percent and poorer districts would receive more At least part of the Increase will be at the expense of state agencies Mr Kremer said adding that the rest of the increase would be paid for from increased revenues that we have found in the Legislatures review of Mr Careys revenue estimates No district would receive more than a 10 percent increase over last year no matter how much the formula determines it should receive Governor Careys nroposal would have limited increases to 5 percent The agreement also includes a revision of the high tax aid a plan that benefits lowwealth districts with high tax rates to make it more generous The agreement rejected Mr Careys proposal to reduce to 100 per student the minimum aid a school district would receive maintaining instead the current 360 minimum flat grant per student In putting together the new proposal on education aid the Legislature was acutely aware that its actions could be voided by a decision in a pending court case that challenges the states education financing laws Its sweeping revision of the program was partly intended to forestall that I think the judge will take judicial note of what weve done up here Mr Kremer said

receive an increase a 405 million about 10 million more than under Mr Careys original plan Because academically poor and handicapped students tend to be concentrated more in hardpressed cities the new formula would satisfy Governor Careys intention to shift state education aid from the wealthier suburban areas to those cities And by making the change in the basic operating formula rather than in special categorical programs the program would help insure that New York City will receive the aid it expects from the state to help close its budget gap over the next several years This is the first major change in approach to giving schools state aid since 1962 said Arthur J Kremer Democrat of Long Beach chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee He said it was more defensible than the Governors plan to shift aid by using enrollment rather than attendance to count students Upstate Republicans had charged their districts wouldlose money under that planwhich they felt would encourage truancyand they refused to accept it Negotiations on other remaining aspects of the budget continued around the Capitol today but there was little hope of bringing a completed budget to the floorsor the Assembly and Senate before Fiiday the last passible day to do so Other developments included these All sides were close to agreement on an increase in the Tuition Assistance Program of about 8 million which would increase aid to students in public colleges around the state by up to 100 per student The Legislature has already accepted a 300 increase in the maximum Tilltion Asistdnce program grant from 1500 to 1800 chew proposals on how to offer propertytax protection for the elderly were presented but the issue remained unresolved Mr Kremer said that for plan to be accepted it would have to lean heavily toward senior citizens but give benefits to a larger number of Persons The salestax credit on heating fuel remained unresolved tiThe maximum incometax credit for the lowestincome families was increased from 50 to 65 and other changes were still under discussion Mr Kremer said Projections by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee confirmed earlier BudgetDivision estimate that the incometax proposal would benefit those making less than 16000 and more than 50000 proportionately more than the 25000to50000 middle managers at which was to be aimed The agreement was reported to be holding firm nevertheleses because the reatictions at the bottom end satisfied the Assembly Democrats and those at the top end satisfied the Senate Republicans The issue of whether the state should continue financing abortions through Medicaid remained an unresolved problem and grew increasingly emotional as dozens of demonstrators favoring and oppcsing the option of abortions lobbied outside the Assembly and Senate chambers In its essence the educationaid plan accepted by the legislative  leaders is similar to but more generous than Governor Careys proposal It is a selfadjusting formula that would aid school districts to varying degrees depending on how much property wealth they had per student A district of average wealthabout 60000 worth of property per studentwould receive 49 percent of their first 1450 it spent per student and 20 percent of the next 50 Wealthier districts would receive less than 49 percent and poorer districts would receive more At least part of the Increase will be at the expense of state agencies Mr Kremer said adding that the rest of the increase would be paid for from increased revenues that we have found in the Legislatures review of Mr Careys revenue estimates No district would receive more than a 10 percent increase over last year no matter how much the formula determines it should receive Governor Careys nroposal would have limited increases to 5 percent The agreement also includes a revision of the high tax aid a plan that benefits lowwealth districts with high tax rates to make it more generous The agreement rejected Mr Careys proposal to reduce to 100 per student the minimum aid a school district would receive maintaining instead the current 360 minimum flat grant per student In putting together the new proposal on education aid the Legislature was acutely aware that its actions could be voided by a decision in a pending court case that challenges the states education financing laws Its sweeping revision of the program was partly intended to forestall that I think the judge will take judicial note of what weve done up here Mr Kremer said

Last‐Minute Assault on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/31/archives/lastminute-assault-on-abortion.html,Since 1970 New York State has been governed by a pioneer abortion statute that served as a model for the nation It has given all women rich or poor the right to a safe abortion when medically necessary The New York State standard became important again late last year when Washington placed tight restrictions on Federal Medicaid funding of abortion Today only 14 states including New York still provide broad Medicaid abortion coverage for the poor But that is now in danger because of a rare bit legislative maneuvering in Albany scheduled for today Abortion foes in the State Legislature have promised try to add a lastminute amendment to the state budget that would eliminate all state Medicaid funds for abor tions except when the life of the mother is in danger This would be an even tighter standard than the one imposed by Washington The strategy of the abortion foes is as distressing as their purpose They intend to offer the budget amendment from the floor as a way of precluding committee hearings informed debate and the possibility of a sure veto by Governor Carey who opposes the enactment of antiabbrtion legislation that discriminates against the poor The Governor might veto the amendment if it passes but the legality of a veto of such a clause in the budget remains in question There is a clearer course for the Legislature to follow on the amendment Vote it down
Dispute Over Medicaid Abortions Delays Accord on New York Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/31/archives/dispute-over-medicaid-abortions-delays-accord-on-new-york-budget.html,ALBANY Friday March 31With their last compromises completed the legislative leaders formally recommended early today an 11957 billion budget for the 197879 fiscal year But the accord continued to be snarled in an increasingly volatile debate by legislators over whether the state should pay for abortions through Medicaid Overall the committees recommenueu 17 million less in appropriations than Governor Carey had requested Substantial increases in local aid for education and a ghettomedicine program were balanced by dozens of smaller trims in  the operating budgets of state agencies Significant changes were made in the budget of the Office of Mental Health in what appeared to be an effort to slow down the states program of discharging mental patients into communities The Commerce Departments controversial advertising program receives more than its rewested amount but with restrictions to prohibit the use of business promotion funds for political purposes But the abortion issue threatened to prevent speedy passage of a budget that otherwise has the support of most of the legislators Antiabortion forces predicted dently in the Republicancontrolled Senate and less so in the Democraticled Assembly that they could amend the budget in both chambers to delete money for most abortions But leadership sources in the Assembly said they believed they had the votes to defeat the amendment in that chamber Carey Criticizes Maltese Assembly leaders were isaia to oe planning to take up the issue when they were certain they could block the amendment in the belief that its defeat in their house would stall the momentum of the bill in the Senate The amendment would bar money for abortions except to save the life of the mother If one house passes the amendment and the other does not the state could be left with no localassistance budget until the dispute is resolved This is the situation that the legislative leadersall of whom favor retaining Mediaid abortion fundswant most to avoid Whatever the outcome of that issue it was clear last night that final action would not be taken on the budget  in time for the start of the states new fiscal year which begins tomorrow The Legislature is expected to stop the clock to deal with that problem Governor Carey meanwhile charged that an awful lot of the momentum and steam on the abortion issue was coming from the Conservative Party leader Serphin Maltese who the Governor said was threatening legislators Conservative endorsements to get political milage from the issue At a news conference Mr Carey also hinted that he would veto any attempt to make New York States policy on Medicaid abortions more restrictive Antiabortion Forces Undaunted The final financial issues in the budget were agreed to by the Governor and the legislative leaders Wednesday and general endorsements were offered by party conference yesterday Among  the last issues agreed to was the elimination of the toll on the Southern State Parkway on Long Island Neither the passibility of defeat of the abortion amendment in the Assembly or the Governors threatened veto daunted the antiabortion forces Those of us who are in the fight will not yield on it said Senator Sheldon Farber Republican of Queens who is planning to introduce the amendement in that chamber if the debate does not occur during the Jewish Sabbath He said another Senator would offer the amendment if he was not present The Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton met with his conference this evening and decided to let the issue run its course without his intervention in his chamber according to a top aide Mr Anderson had reportedly been hoping to convince his members to separate the amendment from the budget but they balked at doing so without a commitment that the amendment would be brought to the Assembly floor Such a commitment could involve bypassing the committee process and Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut Democrat of Brooklyn has been resolute in refusing to do so Governor Careys office was nevertheless hoping that Mr Anderson would be able to convince his members to separate the amendment from the budget to avoid the possibility of tying up the budgeta situation thatwould add considerable uncertainty to the states upcoming borrowing and the finances of local governments I would hope Mr Anderson would exercise proper precaution and make sure its a chapter amendment said Robert J Morgado secretary to the Governor Opponents of the abortion financing have also resisted taking up the issue as a separate chapter amendment in the belief that while a chapter amendment would certainly be vetoed by Governor Carey he might not be able to veto the excision of the money from the budget But aides to the Governor expressed the belief that Mr Carey could strike out the language restricting abortions thus voiding its effectalthough not restoring the 16 million involved Roger 3 Robach DemocratConservative of Rochester who is spearheading the move to amend the budget in his chamber said his intention was not to hold up the budget but to get a fair hearing on the abortionfinancing issue He said the outcome of the vote in his chamber is going to be close Another opponent of the abortion financing Elizabeth A Connelly Democrat of Staten Island said however that the necessary votes to amend the budget were there
"Legislators, Weary and Wary, Inch Toward an Albany Budget",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/01/archives/legislators-weary-and-wary-inch-toward-an-albany-budget.html,ALBANY Mardi 30It was midnight and Kenneth Shapiro couns1 to the Assembly Speaker was haggling wearily with a member of the Assembly who had been concerned that the state budget might backfire in some totally unforeseen way in his district Listen said the Assemblyman waving a list of budget items that were being reviewed before other Democrats in a conference room a few steps away are you sure there arent any little zingers in here that I have to watch out for No zingers said Mr Shapiro his face a sad mask of fatigue I promise no zingers And so it went this week as agreement on the 12 billion budget nudged microstep by microstep closer to reality in a variety of settings Inside the conference room other leadership aides had been droning on for hours about tax tables and drawng diagrams on the blackboardwhere someone else had doodled a large smiling bearded face looking benignly at a tax chart After a chain of such Democratic and Republican conferences in the last few days aides to both the Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut and the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson had come to feel that the agreement they negotiated on the members behalf was leaving most of them satisfied and the budget passable  Seldom has the Legislature experienced th kind of emotion and drama that swirled around its consideration of Medicaid financed abortions this afternoon and evening After the Democraticcontrolled Assembly rebuffed an attPmpt to delete payment for the abortions in the afternoon more than a dozen Assemblymen pressed into the Senate chamber across from the Capitol where they stood silently against the side and rear walls listening to the debate on the same subject and trading guesses as to which way the vote would go Downstairs Robert J Moreado Governor Careys secretary listened to the tally on a small sneaker in his office afterwards admitting he thought the amendment deletine the abortion money would be defeated After it passed aides to Senator Anderson whose Republican colleagues deserted him on the issue were obviously glum at a turnofevents that would be interpreted as a rebuke to his leardership One offered a small piece of consolation They didnt say it was a rebuke in 1970 when the Senate voted in favor of abortions against the wishes of the majority leader said Richard Roth Mr Andersons press secretary Back then the majority leader was Earl W Brydges Jr a Niagara Falls Republican who opposed abortions as  earnestly as Mr Anderson defended state financing of them tonight There was an irony in Mr Roths comment Moments after he had it the Senate adjourned after paying tribute to the memory of Mr Brydges who died three years ago yesterday  Experienced lobtlrists know hat legislators are to he coaxed end rersuaded with a gentle touch hut the hundreds of antiabortion

pristine Thus it was an unusual scene as rows of glowering women wearing big Right to ife and Safe Abortion buttons lent a raucous air to the chamber At one point about 50 of them gathered at one entrance leaving a path for arriving Senators Most legislators walked quickly by but a few stopped to talk Local television cameras arrived and the women jostled each other for positions before the cameras Nothing you tell me will change my mind Senator Richard Schermerhorn a Republican from CornwallonHudson said calmly to a group of prochoice women I never change my mind  For weeks now the rankandfile members of the Legislature have been kept out of the crucial negotiations on the budget a process that could hardly have accommodated everybody And so the lawmakers have had to be satisfied until the last 48 hours with rumors leaks and informed gossip about the budget they were supposed to be considering In Albany a legislative aide remarked the most precious currency you can have is information If you cant have power you can at least have information What has the Legislature been doing this week while the budget was being considered in this fashion In the Assembly the lawmakers gave overwhelming passage to bills permitting teenage folksingers to sing in bars and making the Environmental Conservation Commission a member of the State Tourism Board The Senate approved such items as a bill to grant free bowandarrow hunting licenses to the elderly and disabled veterans and another enabling eightyearolds to attend boxing and wrestling matches  What do you do if you are the Governor and someone walks out on your dinner  This happened last week when Senator Anderson stormed out before the dessert because the dinner guests including all the legislative leaders would not take up the issue of abortion Afterwards apparently it had been Mr Careys idea to announce publicly that there had been agreement on a taxcut package bi not to announce the abortion dispute It was like he was conducting a seminar said one man who was there Then he said Heres what well do He left it up to Anderson to spoil things  On Tuesday lie and his rival Perry B Duryea Jr the Assembly minority leaderwho along with Mr Anderson would like to run for Governor this year  stood waiting outside Mr Careys office for another leadership meeting Mr Anderson whose candidacy is having trouble getting off the ground told Mr Duryea he thought the Legislature would he adjourned the end of May There isnt a chance in the world of that Mr Duryea said afterward glumly impatient because of his desire to get his own campaign under way Mr Duryea offered to bet Mr Anderson that he was right Mr Anderson declined

tomorrow morning and this part of the fiscal plan will go into effect But because of legislative rules requiring a threeday waiting period before a bill can be passed after an amendment it would be impossible for the Senate to consider the local assistance part of the budget before Tuesday Tuesday was the day by which the state was to have a completed prospectus for the 4 billion spring borrowing That action is now virtually impossible meaning the borrowing may have to be delayed The passage of the amendment in the Senate by a vote of 32 to 23 followed hours of dramatic debate and

FLAT RATES PLANNED ON CARE IN HOSPITALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/01/archives/new-jersey-pages-flat-rates-planned-on-care-in-hospitals-state.html,TRENTON March 31It may one day be as easy as reading from a menu for patients in New Jersey to learn how much a prospective hospital stay will cost Special to The Now York Times The State Health Department has developed a flat rate for 383 different illnesses or surgical procedures and is asking 18 of the states 118 hospitals to charge their Blue Cross patients these rates for the coming year instead of charging by the length of the hospital stay and for separate laboratory and other services For example a simple appendectomy under the new program would cost 521 a simple child delivery 435 an abortion 265 and treatment of a dislocated or sprained sacroiliac 631 The different categories also take into account different ages of patients where that would be a factor Treatment of pneumonia for patients under 31 years old would be 553 but for older patients the cost would be 732 The categories include moresophisticated procedures for treatment of cancers that would cost more than 2000 The categories also take into account complications that may arise For example there are four categories of appendectomies to include peritonitis and complications or both BuiltIn Incentive Cited Donald D Heil director of Health Eco nomic Services for the Health Department said the program had a builtin incentive for the hospitals to reduce costs since they would be able to keep the difference if they could provide the service for less than the flat rate In the second year of the program the rate would be reduced by about 50 percent of the amount the hospitals had saved and the program would go forward with the hospitals continuing to search for ways to lower costs without reducing the quality of care Michael Kalison associate project manager for the experimental program said the flatrate approach returns the responsibility for cost containment from the regulator the state to the hospitals where it belongs All of the standards reflected by the different rates came right out of the industry he said they are the result of one and a half years of studying medical cases and costs with the aid of a computer The 18 hospitals that were asked yesterday to cooperate in the flatrate experiment have helped provide the information that led to the striking of the average case costs They will have 30 days in which to decide whether to participate by accepting the flatrate schedule and agreeing not to charge their Blue Cross patients anything higher US Watches Experiment Officials from the United States Department of Health Education and Wel fare are watching the New Jersey experiment the first of its kind in the country and may allow Medicaid and Medicare patients into the program next year If that occurs approximately 60 percent of the hospital patients in New Jersey would be covered by the program Mr Kalison said the list of flatrate categories is flexibile and expandable He also told representatives of the IS hospitals that they were the vanguard of a trend that could affect the rest of the country Some hospitals may find it easy to provide some of the case treatments for the flat rate or less but discover it was costing them much more than the firm rate to treat other cases Mr Kalison said this would show these hospitals where they must look to bring their cost of services in line with the rest of the industry as reflected by the flat rates Referring to the Blue Cross Mr Heif said For many years third party reimbursements on a perdiem basis seemed the only way to meet hospital costs but the big problem was that it picked up everything and didnt reflect what types of patients were consuming what kinds of hospital resources The statistical analysis of discharg abstracts and hospital billing information has enabled us to separate and identify groups of patients according to diagnosis and to strike reimbursement rates This is a new tool that will be of vast importance not only in standarizing hospital costs but in planning future hospital needs

A Live Question,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/02/archives/a-live-question-the-ambivalence-of-abortion-abortion-in-america.html,SOMETHING like five million children are conceived each year in America Spontaneous miscarriages kill perhaps a million Of the remaining four million one million are deliberately aborted The fact that so many women deliberately abort their unwanted children is profoundly upsetting to many people including a number of those directly involved The righttolife movement has mounted a formidable campaign to make such abortions illegal just as they were in most states before the Supreme Court of the United States struck down state restriction on first and secondtrimester abortions in 1973 According to a December 1977 Gallup Poll this campaign enjoys widespread support Only 19 percent of all adults favor a complete ban on abortions but a majority wants them restricted to women whose pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or who would be physically endangered by carrying the pregnancy to term Fortyseven percent would permit firsttrimester abortion of potentially deformed children and 45 percent would permit abortion when the pregnancy endangered the mothers mental health But if the parents were simply unable to support the child only 31 percent would grant an abortion And only 22 percent favor unrestricted access to abortion even in the first trimester These attitudes have not changed much since 1975 except that those of Roman Catholics have become slightly more liberal and are now virtually indistinguishable from Protestant views on the subject Linda Bird Francke belongs to the minority that wants to let each mother decide for herself whether to carry a fetus to term She is not however one of those who sees abortion as just another form of elective surgery A former Newsweek editor and a mother of three she created a minor furor by publishing an anonymous article on the OpEd page of The New York Times in May 1976 describing an abortion she had had to prevent the birth of an unwanted fourth child Her article described her own ambivalence both before and after the abortion ending with a description of how the little ghost of the aborted child had haunted her afterward The article elicited so much mail pro and con that she decided to interview a large number of people about their experience with abortion The Ambivalence of Abortion is a compilation of these interviews with a fair amount of intelligent commentary by Mrs Francke herself Mrs Francke interviewed women who were about to have abortions women who had just had abortions women who had had abortions before they were legal men whose wives or lovers had had abortions parents whose daughters had had abortions and staff members of abortion clinics Her sample was not designed to be representative of any of these groups Nor does she tell us how she approached them or persuaded them to cooperate Skeptics may therefore suspect that her own experience and feelings had some impact on what she found Nonetheless it would be hard read these stories without accepting her general conclusions that abortion is a traumatic experience with significant longterm effects on many of those involved The most immediate source of trauma is that few pregnant women are completely certain they do not want the child Even when their rational selves can list a hundred reasons why having a child would be undesirable or even disastrous the decision to abort seldom completely wholehearted Those who are absolutely certain they do not want a child presumably make more effective efforts at contraception than the typical couple seeking an abortion Few aborters were even attempting contraception when they conceived their child Many who do not want a child find this fact hard to live with and feel guilty about it Some have continuing fantasies about what the lost child would have been like The decision to abort is often the byproduct of the fact that the parents do not want to make a permanent commitment to each other Twothirds of the women seeking abortions are unmarried Conception forces this question to the surface and both parties may feel that the decision to abort is an implicit statement that they will eventually part Mrs Francke reports that virtually none of the unmarried couples she interviewed have stayed together or married after an abortion Even married couples had often split up This does not of course mean that abortion caused the breakup it may just be a symptom of underlying problems But Mrs Francke also reports that abortion often left both parents with a variety of sexual anxieties which certainly cannot have helped matters Mrs Franckes interviews suggest that a few of those seeking abortion also hold the righttolife view that abortion is murder A few aborters even seem to be righttolife activists Far more common however is the view that though a fetus is not really a person and thus abortion is not really murder it is nonetheless morally wrong For those who feel this way abortion is obviously not just a contraceptive of last resort Rather it is the lesser of two evils and one to be avoided if that is humanly possible Given the widespread reluctance of both males and females to practice contraception however if a birth is to be avoided it is often not humanly possible The idea that abortion is wrong and should be illegal did not become widespread in America until the late 19th century John Mohr who teaches history at the University of Maryland chronicles the change in attitudes in Abortion in America Despite its sweeping title the book covers only the years from 1800 to 1900 with a short postscript on recent developments According to traditional common law abortion was legal before quickening ie the time when mother could feel the fetus move within her Most people assumed that a fetus was not really alive or at least had no soul until quickening The advance of scientific medicine during the 19th century discredited this view convincing almost all regular doctors that a child was alive from the moment of conception onward These regular doctors mounted a strong campaign against abortion starting around 1860 By 1880 they had managed to persuade virtually every state in the country to ban abortion at any stage of pregnancy Why were the regular physicians so opposed to abortion They certainly were not responding to clerical pressure Neither the Catholic nor the Protestant churches were at all active in opposing abortion despite the fact that the Pope had formally proscribed it in 1869 But most doctors felt that clerics were merely reluctant W oppose their parishioners benighted prejudice that a fetus became a person only after had moved for the first time The doctors felt that they knew better and assumed others would see the light once they understood how a fetus really developed This view was reinforced by the fact that Hippocrates unlike most ancient Greeks had opposed abortion and the Hippocratic Oath forbade the practice Many physicians also felt that women who wanted abortions were trying to avoid their natural role as mothers This was undoubtedly trueYet 19thcentury American feminists did not favor abortion They saw it as an undesirable byproduct of the suppression of women and assumed that it would become unnecessary once women were emancipated AntiCatholic and antiimmigrant prejudice also played a part in the imposition of legal restrictions on abortion Early in the 19th century when America was overwhelmingly rural abortion was largely confined to unmarried women and the native Protestant population had one of the highest birth rates in the world By the middle of the century substantial numbers of Protestants wanted to limit the size of their families Given the ineffectiveness of contraception abortion was the only reliable way to do this By 1870 Mr Mohr estimates one pregnancy in three or four was terminated by abortion about the same proportion as today As a result native Protestant fertility fell well below that of immigrants and Catholics Many Protestants favored restrictions on abortion partly because they wanted to keep the country from being taken over by aliens Mr Mohr argues that physicians also opposed abortion because they wanted to consolidate their control over the practice of medicine and drive out the irregular practitioners who performed most abortions But if regular physicians had been willing to do abortions themselves the business would not have fallen into the hands of the irregulars virtin often did their clients grave bodily harm and occasionally even killed them In the last analysis then the physicians refusal to do abortions seems to have stemmed from genuine moral conviction not financial interest professional jealousy Neither Mr Mohrs history nor Mrs Franckes interviews take us very far toward an understanding of the moral issues raised by abortion All sound moral precepts are ultimately based on some variant of the Golden Rule We should treat others as we would wish them to treat us If we apply this concept to abortion we can infer that a mother should treat her fetus as she would have wanted her mother to treat her when she was at a similar stage of development But this has little concrete meaning for when the mother was a firsttrimester fetus she did not want anything in the ordinary meaning of the term Only later when she grew up could she have begun to want her mother to have treated her in one way rather than another The question is precisely whether the fetus should be allowed to reach this later stage when its parents will have to weigh its wants Opponents of abortion sometimes argue of course that a ietus wants to grow up into a real person But every egg and sperm also want to become a person in this sense And if that is the case how can one defend either contraception or celibacy both of which deny life to millions of eggs and sperms that want to become pedple and both of which also involve repression of natural impulses The question of whether abortion is morally wrong depends on when we become human Unfortunately this does not happen all at once as in medieval fantasies of the souls entering the body It happens bit by bit We must therefore make some arbitrary decision about when to confer the right to life Because nature offers no clear guidance about where this line should be drawn the most humane solution is to draw it so as to minimize human suffering I doubt however that opponents of abortion will accept this approach for once you accept it you will almost inevitably be led to precisely the same liberal conclusion the Supreme Court reached five years in Roe v Wade 
INTERVIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/02/archives/westchester-weekly-interview-a-veteran-in-the-fight-against.html,CRESTWOOD IN her brown leather briefcase along with legal documents her house keys and an appointment book Isabella M Pernicone has a small library of published materials on abortion Stored in her head are memories of her 22year fight against abortion The other day when asked what she thought the effect of abortion might have on future societies Mrs Pernicone a lawyer who is in her early 50s reached ino the briefcase and pulled out an article that was published in The Christian Science Monitor in 1970 This was written by a female lawyer and it states that the fall of every civilization was preceded by an ethical moral or social problem Mrs Pernicone said When Rome fell for instance there was widespread abortion homosexuality and a corrupt government I read this article and it frightened me Back in 1956 she had been frightened too She recalled That year I assisted my husband on a case involving trustfund money for a Catholic hospital in New York that was being held in escrow because a group filed a suit arguing that the hospital should not get the money because it refused to perform therapeutic abortions Thats when I first became aware that abortions were being done in hospitals under the guise of dilation and curettage or therapeutic procedures Since then Mrs Pericone now a widow and living here with her two teenage sons has fought to end abortion In 1970 she combined forces with the Right to Life Committee but has preferred to focus her activities on talking to or lecturing friends neighbors coworkers and groups on the issue rather than participate in rallies or protest marches Recently Mrs Pernicone who works as a corporate lawyer for a firm in Stamford Conn was granted standing as guardian for unborn children in classaction suit It was filed by a group of women against the Federal Department of Health Education and Welfare and several political figures The suit which is currently being argued before Judge John F Dooling in Federal District Court in Brooklyn challenges the socalled Hyde Amendment The amendment passed by Congress in December bans Medicaid reimbursement for all abortions except those to save a mothers life  or under limited conditions her health  and in officially reported cases of rape and incest To be granted standing as law guardian for unborn children Mrs Pernicone said means that every human being has a right to be represented and spoken for in a court of law I may be called on to testify If she is requested to appear in court Mrs Pernicone said she would be glad to comply and has prepared a statement I believe that the present law permitting abortions is a negative solution to a most serious social problem Our present society operates on a spirit of expediency and no responsibility We used to believe that with every right there is a concurrent obligation Women are the victims of this thinking They are left with the problem of pregnancy wanted or unwanted Society owes them and their children a better deal  abortion is not the answer Adoption is at least worth a better try Mrs Pernicone said the burden of responsibility has been placed on women with all of the methods of contraception directed at them Men must be made to share more of the responsibility added Mrs Pernicone who tries to instill that conviction in her sons More sex education wont solve the problem The burden is placed upon the parents and the individual And although she sympathizes with those who may be victims of rape incest and unwanted pregnancies she nevertheless believes that none of those situations warrant abortions She argues that the child is not the aggressor in such cases but that the man is  the child is the innocent She added it would be difficult to judge a baby as damaged as the result of a pregnancy by rape Remember in Roots when Kizzy is raped by the slavemaster She doesnt stop loving her son Chicken George because his father raped her Still many believe her stand is not valid and accuse her and other antiabortion advocates of being against groups of minorities and the poor because the Hyde Amendment primarily affects the poor To such charges Mrs Pernicone replies All of us are former unborn children The money they are using to fund these abortions could be used for other social problems Certain minorities feel they are being targeted but this is not the case Others including the complainants in the classaction suit contend the Hyde Amendment violates the religious neutrality of medical services and thereby violates the First Amendment Moreover lawyers in the case are seeking to prove undue influence by religious groups particularly the Roman Catholic Church A lot of Catholics are involved in the The money that finances abortions could be used for other social problems forward to the day her schedule would not be so hectic but that at the same time she enjoyed the work because it keeps me busy and Im fighting for something I believe in Already she has begun work on the socalled Human Life Amendment This amendment should be passed as quickly as possible in order to guarantee to the unborn the rights and privileges under the Constitution she said and to preserve the rights of the retarded indigent aged and terminally ill Im afraid that unless we do something we will in the near future have a middleaged population There wont be any young people around and we will lose the spirit and vitality that is essential to every society

per year Keith Sehnert formerly director of the Center for Continuing Health Education at Georgetown University pioneered selfcare courses eight years ago when he was in private practice in Reston Va More recently he has taught Courses for Activated Patients of all ages For one classroom assignment he asked some older students to bring in the contents of their medicine chests One person appeared with 11 bottles of tablets and capsules and an equal number of medicines Another man brought six bottles of syrups and liquids a few laxatives several anonymous nostrums with their labels long gone and some nitroglycerin pills Each day many of these people ranging in age from their mid60s to mid80s obediently swallowed drugs whose names and functions were virtually unknown to them They were taking two or three different kinds of medicines prescribed by two or three different doctors for two or three different conditionsand often one doctor was unaware of what the others were ordering In Sehnerts classes students learn the dangers of mixing drugs the possible side effects of each drug when taken independently and in combination the hazards of overdoses how to store medications how long to keep them what they ought to cost and what kind of information each patient should require of the prescribing physician After a recent class one woman came up to Sehnert and said I didnt know I was allowed to ask such questions of a doctor  Today we suffer different ills from those we did when the golden age of antibiotics began 40 years ago Then 70 percent of all illness was acutelobar pneumonia scarlet fever rheumatic fever poliomyelitis typhoid fever diphtheria Now nearly 80 percent of all illness in this country is chronic  arthritis alcoholism senility stroke diabetes heart disease and soon Often the medical doctor just relieves some of the pain and minimizes the symptomsbecause thats all he can do Effective therapies today are for the most part carative rather than curativethat is care is involved rather than cure said Dr Lowell Levin associate professor of public health at the Yale University School of Medicine Almost 80 percent of all first visits to primarycare physicians a young internist explained waste the time of the physician and the patient because they concern selflimiting diseases like the common cold that will go away with bed rest aspirin and a good book The patient can care for these things more efficiently than his doctor can And sometimes more safely Too many doctors she went on still prescribe antibiotics for virus infections like colds and the flu And antibiotics cant kill viruses Doctors acknowledge that more than threequarters of first medical visits are a waste of time because they concern minor ailments that the patient himself can treat more efficiently and safely Those in the selfcare movement believe that patients themselves can treat more than half of the most common ailments and injuries as well as or better than doctors can thereby cutting their medical visits by at least 50 percent Since Americans spent 122 billion or 84 percent of the Gross National Product for medical care in 1975 and about 139 billion in 1976 selfcare could go a long way toward stopping the inflationary spiral Medical costs are now expected to exceed 250 billion by the 1980s Healthcare professionals today are dependent on people becoming selfreliant said Yales Lowell Levin one of three coauthors of SelfCare Lay Initiatives in Health According to the few studies made so far in this country and in Britain about 75 percent of all health and medical care is already selfprovided Thats because the bulk of medical problems are selflimiting and really dont require medical intervention  As we increase the publics ability to cope with minor ailments we make more efficient use of professionals The current studies suggest he continued that what people do for themselves prior to seeking professional care is both reasonable and relevant about 90 percent of the time The conception of a mindless irresponsible public simply doesnt pertain Yes people do sometimes do things that are bad for their health but it is not altogether certain that they are unaware of that Health is not lifes highest goal Happiness is Ideally health education like happiness should begin early Selfcare practices converts believe ought to be as much a part of childhood as learning to talk or snuggling with mom and dad To some extent this has already started to happen At Foote Elementary School in New Haven a class of first and second graders participated in a course in selfcare Jonah 6 years old lined up the femur of a disarticulated skeleton See how the round end fits inside this hole in the hip Its called the pelvis he said delightedly Jonah and his classmates carefully examined the skull and every bone of the skeleton then moved on to a session of body awareness and yoga exercises Each child had his own stethoscope and listened to his own voice by placing the instrument under the angle of his jaw Then the children heard the heartbeats in each others chests Its louder on the left side a little girl cried Over the semester each pupil worked on an individual project making explicit drawings of the conception gestation and birth of puppies or displaying a collection of wolf fox and human bones because I like bones or writing a book on the anatomy of the blood cell This crescent inside the cell is the nucleus When we get a cut the fibrin in the blood helps the blood to clot and make scab The teacher Tom Ferguson then a thirdyear medical student at Yale made a videotape record of the classroom project Ferguson originally had conceived of the class to satisfy the Yale Medical Schools dissertation requirement However he has since moved to Inverness Calif north of San Francisco and has decided instead to use the magazine he writes and edits Medical SelfCare as his thesis project Shrewdly timed to take advantage of a booming market it is a quarterly lay medical journal modeled after the Whole Earth Catalogs accesstotools principle If one knows how to find the proper toolsand the books or the experts to teach their uses there is little an individual cannot do for himself Walt Stoll MD a friend of Tom Fergusons teaches every one of his patients selfcare on an individual basis He recently opened a new family practice in Lexington Kythe only such primarycara practice in the whole north end of townafter finishing a stint as an associate director of the Clinical Associates Program at the University of Kentucky Primary care has always been a fundamental of Western medicine Before consulting a specialist a sick person usually turns to a primary practitioner  pediatrician GP gynecologist or occasionally to an internist Previously Stoll had spent 10 years in family practice in Kenton Ohio teaching his patients good health habits and giving them a basic course in medical diagnosis In Lexington as each patient comes into his office Stoll presents him with a pamphlet introducing the concepts of selfcare Then as specific problems arise he teaches his students to evaluate chest pains control their headaches and sinus trouble and use the proper tools to check for the symptoms of ear infections bronchitis and other physical complaints Nevertheless Dr Stoll says only about a third of his patients want to take on the added responsibilities of medical selfcare and work side by side with their doctor The rest prefer the traditional relationshipphysician in command As one man said I dont pay my doctor good money so he can tell me to go home and do it myself All this nonsense about preventing migraines by biofeedback or disk trouble with yoga  Why should I spend so much time to learn to meditate when my doctor can lower my blood pressure with drugs or get rid of my headache with a simple pill Sure and give me a little sympathy to boot Stolls method of medical practice is not uniformly admired by his colleagues either Many doctors agree that the medical history belongs to the patient but when the patient asks to see it they feel threatened You wont understand it they protest Or Whats the matter Dont you trust me Or Leave the worrying to me Although such physicians may publicly espouse patient responsibility among themselves the talk goes off in other directions Medical selfcare may save some money for certain patients said a 47yearold internist in California but unfortunately it also makes them feel like junior doctors Theyre in the same position as a firstyear medical student They have just about the amount of knowledge thats dangerous A doctor who caters to his patients selfdiagnosis is participating in a real folic  deux a mutual madness When you get right down to it the internist said if doctors taught their patients to care for their own colds and all of the aches and pains that we dont know how to handle anyway they would lose between a third and a half of their incomes It would be especially costly in the big cities where there are too many doctors and some of them have had to become conveyor belts churning out responses to piles of minor complaints Ive never heard those fellows say they didnt want to see patients even if their questions are stupid and their illnesses trivial and uninteresting However it is difficult today to find many American physicians who will openly oppose the principles of selfcare The movement originates within the medical system itself accepts the basic premises of modern medicine and advocates understanding rather than overthrowing Indeed many of its most visible proponents are doctors Selfcare does not imply that doctors are unnecessary said Dr James F Fries assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University and coauthor of Take Care of Yourself It is simply an attempt to suggest to people that they use their own resources to deal with those common ailments where the limits of medicine are most obvious and to encourage them to turn to the medical system in acute illness when its extraordinary capabilities are most useful After all we are a culture rooted in the tradition of personal responsibility Grandma knew what to do for a scald or the croup the doctor pointed out but she doesnt live next door anymore Somewhere along the way from then to now we lost confidence in our own judgment But slowly and surely we seem to be getting it back Its not surprising that were returning to home care Whats surprising is that we ever left it Dr Fries declared

LEADERS SEEK AN END TO BUDGET DEADLOCK,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/02/archives/leaders-seek-an-end-to-budget-deadlock-try-to-separate-abortionaid.html,ALBANY April 1Legislative leaders were seeking a way today to separate the highly charged issue of state Medicaid funding of abortions for the poor from the states localaid budget in an effort to resolve a deadlock over the 72 billion appropriation The impasse occurred last night when the Republicandominated Senate voted to amend the budget to restrict the use of Medicaid funds after the Democraticcontrolled Assembly refused to do so The disagreement threw into question the states ability to complete crucial shortterm borrowing that local governments and school districts need by April 17 Out of Andersons Control The emotional moral argument over abortion has taken place every year here since the Legislature legalized it in 1970 But buoyed by a recent United States Supreme Court decision and the success of Congressional tactics to limit Federal aid for abortion opponents took the new strategy this year of trying to attack the issue through the states financial plan A top Republican aide said that intervention by Governor Carey would be necessary for an accord to be reached and an aide to the Governor said Mr Carey was prepared to meet with the legislative leaders on Monday to find a solution It was unclear what that solution would be particularly with the issue out of control of the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton who had unsuccessfully urged that the amendment be considered apart from the budget A highlevel aide to the Assembly leadership citing a decisive 81to66 vote yesterday turning back an attempt to restrict Medicaid abortions said it was hoping that the Senates tactic of attaching the moral issue to the budget would buckle under pressure from local governments and school districts and from the financial community The local governments and school districts need a completed budget to continue their operations and the financial community must be assured of a balanced budget before it can fulfill the states 4 billion shortterm borrow ing needs

which succeeded by a vote of 32 to 23 last night introduced two new localaid budgets One has everything but the Social Services Department appropriation the other retains the Social Services appropriation He said this was an effort to show that those of us who voted for this had no desire to hold up any other portion of the budget Mr Donovan said both houses could pass the uncontroversial portions of the budget allowing school aid and local government assistance to go into effect and could then wrangle over whether the Social Services appropriation should contain money for Medicaid abortions This was viewed as extremely unlikely in the Assembly where leaders insisted adamantly that the Senate had breached the budget agreement Stanley Fink Democrat of Brooklyn and the Assembly majority leader said as his chamber finished the last of 28 budget bills early this morning Im hoping the Senate will come to its senses stop cloaking itself in selfrighteousness and start cloaking itself in fiscal responsibility and pass an agreedupon budget But a Senate aide said Neither house is going to just give up and roll over on its back on this one SpringBorrowing Theart Ctied The immediate effect of the deadlock was to prevent the payment of 90 million in welfare advances to local governments But a spokesman for the Social Service Department said today that Federal advances would continue to be paid and that local governments would be required by state law to continue welfare assistance even if state aid was interrupted temporarily There were indications however that some upstate areas that feel overburdened by welfare costs already were unlikely to do so without the state aid in hand The greatest effect of the delay was In the possibility of jeopardizing the spring borrowing This could leave school districts and local governments throughout the state in financial peril Gedale B Horowitz a senior partner at Salomon Brothers who has been in charge of the underwriting said last night that if the situation is resolved quickly I think the financing can proceed although it would probably cost the state more money in interest costs But he said that because of the number of steps involvedincluding the need to get a rating from Moodys Investors Servicequickly meant before late in the week
SPEAKING PERSONALLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/02/archives/westchester-opinion-speaking-personally-off-to-albany-to-fight-for.html,IT was an unlikely car pool we formed one recent Tuesday morning a young pregnant mother three middleaged housewives and a fatherly obstetrician carrying not a medical bag but a lunchbox Normally at 830 AM on a weekday Ive just sent the youngest of my four children off to school and am trying to decide if the breakfast dishes the laundry pile or another cup of coffee should open stage two of my day But this morning my daughter was off to school a few minutes early and by 9 AM my companions and I were already past Peekskill heading north on the Taconic Parkway toward Albany Our mission to fight for continued Medicaid financing of abortions There we were the five of us  ranging in age from 26 to 62 with 155 children among us spanning 30 years going to Albany to tell the lawmakers it simply is not fair to say that poor women have to have unwanted babies while women who can pay for abortions dont have to One companion a former social worker and soontobe grandmother was furious The Supreme Court removed abortion from the back alleys to medically safe clinics and I cant just sit back and watch an attempt to take that choice away from any woman The doctor also spoke with deep feeling arising from experience When I was at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx in the late 1940s and early 50s at least once every day we were faced with trying to save the life of a woman who had in desperation either tried to abort herself or gone to an unskilled practitioner behind a store That memory is enough to make me come and speak out My own conviction  that a womans reproductive freedom is basic to her whole wellbeing  evolved over 12 years of working in Planned Parenthood clinics as well raising a family of my own When the momentous Supreme Court decision of Jan 22 1973 came down we were celebrating the ninth birthday of our second son On every birthday since I silently celebrate that every child can be born as wanted and loved as he and his siblings are Although our common interest in family planning brought us all together we had all done our share of letter writing over the years none of us had ever actually lobbied in person and so we were feeling slightly insecure about the day ahead Also with us were two women who had not been able to get on the chartered bus that had left White Plains just ahead of us The bus carried 50 more concerned citizens Some were political activists but most were neophytes like us We were there to give strong voice to the plea against discrimination just as others did last week and more will next week making sure that New York legislators get the message Under tremendous pressure from antiabortion forces last summer the New Jersey Legisla ture cut off Medicaid financing That swift and unexpected action has made New Yorkers particularly determined that it wont happen here It was just 11 as we drove under Rockefellers monuments on the South Mall of the Capitol complex At our rendezvous we assembled and listened as Sharon Barnes president of the New York State Affiliate of the National Abortion Rights Action League gave us our assignments We were to go in groups of two or three to the offices of our representatives members of the Health and Social Services committees and leaders of both parties in the Assembly and Senate To bring us up to date she introduced Assemblyman Allan Hevesi of Queens chairman of the Health Committee That committee now has before it a bill that would restrict Medicaid reimbursement for abortion to cases where the womans life would be threatened by childbirth Assemblyman Hevesi thinks the chances are good that the bill will be voted out of committee during this session and be put to a vote in the Legislature Our job was to express support of those who were opposed to the bill and disapproval of the backers but Mr Hevesi emphasized that the outcome will depend on the citizens ability to convince the marginal lawmakers those who have not yet made up their minds He added Its up to you to make the difference Which is exactly why we cameto make the difference The first visit was the hardest we felt a bit like intruders but clearly the secretary was used to her bosss constituents paying a call No he wasnt in the office  committee meetings you know  but she would give him a message and wouldnt we sign the guest book Thanks for stopping by And on to the next As the visits mounted up to a final tally of 18 my partner and I became more fluent and were so pleasantly received that we finally commented to a staff member that we wished all the secretaries had a vote in the Legislature She replied that it was a welcome relief to see and hear so many prochoice advocates On the journey back our obstetrician particularly relished calling on a representative whose two children he had delivered Our pregnant driver told of confronting an Assemblyman in his office As his eyes traveled from her Safe Abortion  Choice for ALL Women button to the bulge under her tunic he stuttered Are  are you   Thats marvelous He declared his prochoice vote on the spot We hadnt won any great victory yet but we knew the battle would be continued next week by others and by still more the week after that There are that many of us who care desperately that every child should be a wanted child

New Fiscal Woes in Albany?,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/03/archives/new-fiscal-woes-in-albany-state-faces-another-potential-financial.html,Once again New York State faces this week still another potential fiscal crisis this time brought on by Republicans in the State Senate who have now held up approval of the states 12 billion budget over their insistence that Medicaid funds for abortions be deleted The resulting Impasse has occurred despite what appeared to be the best efforts of the Republican Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson of Binghamton to keep the abortion dispute from getting out of control News Analysis Mr Andersons dramatic failure to do so illustrates something axiomatic about Albany politics When the emotional content of an issue is great the leadership of the State Legislature can appear remarkably fragile In fact the leadership can come close to collapsing under the strain Moreover for Mr Anderson the revolt of the overwhelming majority of Senate Republicans  however temporarycarries very serious implications about his political future The budget stalemate could strike a fatal blow at his already faltering gubernatorial campaign which has had to remain unannounced because of Mr Andersons inability to raise money Could Destroy Stewardship Even more serious a prolonged rebuff could also destroy Mr Andersons stewardship over the State Senate itself His aides have for some time said that Mr Anderson is considering retiring from the Senate after this year even if he doesnt run for Governor The abortionfight episode could encourage him to do so all the more The Republicans are going to have to make a determination about how theyre going to handle themselves for the rest of the year said a top aide to the Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut Democrat of Brooklyn Mr Andersons Democratic counterpart in the Legslature Weve got to be able to negotiate with a leader knowing his people are behind him Were not going to be able to negotiate with 30 diferent Senators Normally the legislative leaders in Albany wield broad power over the members Because the leaders personally dole out committee chairmanships and other bonuses they can command enormous fealty from their troopsin contrast to the United States Congress where committee chairmen and other powerful members often dictate to the leadership Cannot Exercise Normal Powers Both Mr Anderson and Mr Steingut ako exercise control through the political organizations with which they are allied Neither hesitates to award or withhold favors such as patronage jobs  from Republican or Democratic organizations to deliver votes in their houses At the same time both men announced at the beginning of this year that they would not even attempt to practice their usual powers of persuasion on two moral issues they knew would come upthe death penalty and abortion  even though both are personally not opposed to Medicaid abortions There are some issues where a leader cannot exercise his normal powers said an aide to Mr Anderson A leader isnt chosen by the members to exercise his moral judgment on their behalf Ironically however the current impasse arose because each leaderinvokpay for abortions in the Medicaid propecting the other to cast it aside The abortion issue was destined to sur face this legislative session alter the United States Supreme Court ruled last year that the government can refuse to pay for abortions in the Medicaid program which provides a range of free medical services to poor people After a protracted debate in which the budget of the Department of Health Ed ucation and Welfare was held up for monthsa foreshadowing of the current fight in New YorkCongress deleted abortion financing in the Federal Medicaid program Governor Carey along with Mr Steingut and Mr Anderson nontheless said they favored retaining the state and local financing for abortions here The abortion issue has unique characteristics however Unlike the death penaltyabout which constituents feel strongly on both sides but tend to remain silent about their feelingsthose on both sides of the abortion issue write hundreds of letters and bombard their legislators with emotional appeals to conscience This year rallies have been held on the steps of the Capitol and literally hundreds of lobbyists have combed the corridors to press their points of view Two weeks ago Mr Anderson informed Governor Carey and Mr Steingut that the issue was getting out of control in his house He said he feared that a move would succeed to tie deletion of abortion financing to the state budget The only way to stop the move he said would be for Mr Steingut to allow a separate bill on the issue to come to the floor and be voted on up or down Angry Comment by Steingut Mr Steingut angrily said he would not presume to tell any member of the Assembly Health Committeewhere a separate antiabortion bill had been bottled upto report the bill to the floor Privately he was critical that Mr Anderson had not used his own powers to stop Republicans from holding the state budget hostage to the abortion issue As of now there do not appear to be enough votes in the Assembly to delete Medicaid funds for abortions and there are not enough votes in the Senate to approve such financing And neither leader says he is in a position to twist arms to change members minds Certainly the greatest irony of all is thatno matter how the impasse is resolvedit is unlikely that Medicaid funds for abortions will in the end in fact be deleted This is because even if the Assembly approved a bill deleting the money Governor Carey would probably veto that particular provision He has hinted he would do so on many occasions Because of Mr Careys position Republicans have been assuming all along that Mr Anderson simply wanted an antiabortion provision to succeed so that the Governor would have to endure the political outcry of a veto Mr Anderson denied heatedly that his motivation was so devious This week Mr Anderson and Mr Steingut will be working to separate the volatile issue of abortions from the state budget It may be easier to do so there is a sufficient outcry from counties cities and school districts who are expecting localaid in the next two weeksand cannot receive it without a budgetor from the investment community which cannot assist the state in its huge 4 billion spring borrowing this year without a budget either Thus the current budget crisis is a test of whether the legislative leadership can leadwhether in fact the Legislature can functionwhen emotions are as high as they are

Strange Doings in Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/04/archives/strange-doings-in-albany-a-state-held-hostage.html,The foes of abortion have succeeded in blocking approval of New York States budget holding 72 billion aid to local governments hostage to the cause The budget has been passed by the Assembly but a Senate amendment would prohibit the use of Medicaid funds for abortions except to save the life of the mother Unless the deadlock is broken quickly money for all statefunded local programs will cease to flow and the ability of the state and localities to borrow vitally needed cash will be jeopardized It is depressing enough to find New York pressed follow the example of the Federal Government by cutting off money for abortions for poor women But the Senate amendment goes further Even the victims rape and incest would be denied relief But whatever ones view of the right of poor women too to choose abortion the tactics employed in the Senate are deplorable By attaching this deeply divisive issue to the state budget the senators threaten the process of reasoned government In ordinary circumstances legislators pondering funds for Medicaid abortions would consult their consciences and their constituents They would be aided by committee hearings examining the precise impact of new legislation Now however the Senate and Assembly are being forced to weigh entirely separate and irrelevant issues Delay in passing the budget could dry up funds for schools and clinics and delay welfare payments for food and rent Local school districts lacking state backing might be unable to borrow money and would quite likely be forced to pay higher interest rates for whatever they could borrow The state itself must refinance 4 billion shortterm loans this montha normally routine process but legally impossible until the Legislature has passed a budget It is not Medicaid abortions but the rationality of the political system that is now being tested The Senate and Assembly should unite against such challenge pass the budget and meet the issue on the merits
Donovan's Defiance on Abortion Challenges Anderson Leadership,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/04/archives/donovans-defiance-on-abortion-challenges-anderson-leadership.html,ALBANY April 3For eight long years Senator James H Donovan said today he has been restlessly waiting for a chance to take action against the states unconscionable expenditure of public funds for abortions for Medicaid recipients In the last week Mr Donovan finally got his chance leading a bitter fight that has now tied up approval of the states 12 billion budget and provoked the biggest political brawl of the 1978 legislative session The man behind the fight against abortion is a rangy 54yearold former marine with steelgray hair and a softspoken manner that belies the intensity of his feelings on the subject Mr Donovan a RepublicanConservative from Oneida County in northcentral New Yorka district that includes both the city of Utica and long stretches of rolling woods and farmlandhas never been considered a particularly powerful member of the State Senate though he has served there since 1966 Andersons Appeal to Colleagues But today he is challenging the very foundation of the leadership of the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson of Binghamton whose dramatic appeals to his colleagues to separate the abortion issue from the budget failed Friday night Turning to Mr Donovan Mr Anderson pleaded with his colleagues on the floor of the Senate not to tie the deletion of Medicaid funds for abortions to the approval of the state budget But member after member instead followed Mr Donovans quiet request to stick with me on the vote It was a development that seemed to startle even Mr Donovan himself who afterward accepted the congratulations of colleagues some of whom jokingly talked of him as the next majority leader of the Senate Today after the excitement of the moment cooled down he brushed off such talk and said he had no interest in the job In any case at least one other Republican Senator who voted with Mr Donovan last week suggested today that Mr Anderson could well recoup his losses this week and reverse the Senates position Other Republicans said privately that Mr Donovan was an unlikely successor to Mr Anderson simply because of his reputation for inflexibility Mr Donovan who is not a lawyer started his own contracting company In Utica after World War II but became a fulltime legislator a few years ago He is regarded as conservative on many issues and adamantly defends the interests of upstate vs New York City As chairman of the Senate Eiiutatiba Committee a job Mr Anderson gave him last year Mr Donovan succeeded last month in getting more money for nonbigcity districts than Governor Carey had originally proposed He became perhaps a little more noted because of his unusual defense of the death penalty to a church group in which he said that without capital punishment there would have been no Christianity Where would Christianity be Jesus got 8 to 15 years with time off for good behavior Mr Donovan asked a comment that sparked the ridicule of Governor Carey and others Mr Donovans rhetoric is scarcely less provocatiya on the abortion issue A former businessman he is no fiery orator He spoke of the isSue as a personal one and invoked his own experiences Mr Donovan and his wife residents of Chadwicks have seydn 01111dren
LEVITT PRODS ALBANY ON LOCAL‐AID BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/04/archives/levitt-prods-albany-on-localaid-budget-says-impasse-on-medicaid.html,ALBANY April 3State Comptroller Arthur Levitt today froze state welfare payments to local governments and warned that more than a few days further delay on the localaid budget could force a postponment of the states spring borrowing Mr Levitts move was expected to increase pressure on the Legislature to resolve the Medicaidabortion controversy which has deadlocked the localaid budget In a cautiously worded statement Mr Levitt said that New York City and the states school districts could be hardpressed if the borrowing was stalled delaying a 400 million advance to the oity and 800 million to school districts that is scheduled to be paid on April 17 There was no apparent movement toward ending the impasse which began Friday night when the Senate voted to amend the 72 billion localaid budget to bar the use of Medicaid money for abortions except those medically necessary to save the life of the mother The Assembly had earlier refused to do so and the disagreement left the appropriation without final approval although other elements of the budget for the state fiscal year that began Saturday were approved The suspension of the 634 million welfare paymentthe state share for April for most counties and for the first half of the month for New York Cityposed no immediate danger to relief recipients The Federal share of the welfare funds was paid on time and with local funds would give local governments about threequarters of the amount they will need The Assembly Democratic leaders began their strategy of placing blame for the delay entirely on the Republicancontrolled Senate with the chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee charging that the Senates paralysis over the Medicaidabortion issue not only jeopardized the states finances but could also hurt New Yorks credibility in the financial markets and in Washington The chairman Arthur 7 Kremer Democrat of Long Beach LI said that this crisis is one that has to be detached from the budget and that each passing day raises the prospect that New York State will pay a higher rate of interest in the market for the 4 billion spring borrowing He said each additional percentage point would cost the state about 25 million The Senate remained in adjournment today waiting for the constitutional threeday period that must pass before the amended budget can be reconsidered Republicans were expected to hold a conference onthe issue tomorrow and the full Senate was expected to vote on later in the day The leader of the Senate drive to amend the budget James H Donovan Republican of Chadwicks said he intended to bring the budget containing the restric tion on Medicaid abortions to a vote and send it and the onus for the delay back to the Assembly adding If the Assembly wants to delay its passage bring about a protracted debate and jeopardize the financing for the state they can do it But Senator Donovan has also introduced as a backup bills separating the bulk of the localaid budget from the 18 billion socialservices appropriation and said he would try to have those passed if necessary although he added that there might be constitutional problems Lobbying from schoolidistricts unions and publicinterest groups began today although at a modest pitch Some Republicans predicted that resolution of the issue might be aided by rising pressure from different constituencies and a desire to aid Senator Warren M Anderson Republican of Binghamton the majority leader who has been rebuffed by his members repeatedly in his efforts to separate the abortion issue from the budget Many Republicans want to help him out said cne Senator who voted in favor of the amendment adding If we are in a shambles  you can play Russian roulette only so long The Assembly leadership was planning to bottle up the amended budget if is returnedto that house and to bring a clean version of the localaid appropriation to the floor The leaders hope its passage again without amendment in the Assembly would show the Senate that its efforts to alter the budget were futile an aide said and force it to take up the abortion matter separately

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/05/archives/letters-city-transportation-as-the-bottom-drops-out-on-the-plight.html,To the Editor Your March 27 news article about New Yorks crumbling bridges accurately points out both the enormous decay of the citys entire transportation infrastructure and the inadequacy of the citys response Asking for more Federal money without reforming how it is spent will only enable the city to continue performing its transportation obligations in ways which are inefficient discriminatory and selfdestructive MTA Chairman Fisher absurdly Insists he would spend new transit funds on the Queens SuperExpress line and the Second Avenue Subway despite the MTAs own assertion that needs 10 billion merely to make the existing subways attractive and reliable Governor Carey recently proposed a pathetically inadequate 17 million emergency roadway repair program But New York City needs more than 2 billion over the next 10 years to do the job properly It can guarantee barely 20 percent of this amount As a result our highways and bridges will become increasingly impassable Mayor Koch meanwhile has assumed the bankrupt postures of previous administrations As examples he is continuing Mayor Beames illegal refusal to implement the citys plan to reduce congestion and is making no effort to reform either the MTA or the transportation planning process a process that has already cost New Yorkers more than 100 million Federal dollars in the past 10 years without producing any benefits In 1978 alone residents of the New York metropolitan area will spend 45 billion on transportation of all kinds A measly 6 percent will be spent for public modes Most of the rest will support private cars and the move ment of freight Shifting a mere 4 percent from private to public sectors by appropriate tax measures would virtually eliminate New Yorks transportation crisis Potholes would be filled streets repaired bridges painted and saved subways and buses rehabilitated and congestion reduced Tragically New Yorks current politidal crop lacks not only the vision but the courage to make such changes Before Transportation Secretary Brock Adams forks over any more big bills to New York we strongly suggest he pointedly ask what such money would be used for and what New York and the Federal Government would be getting for funds preordained to be misspent on Goliath egogratifying ventures while the bottom drops out of everything else BRIAN KETCHAM Vice President and Chief Engineer Citizens for Clean Air New York March 27 1978 On the Plight of Our Farmers To the Editor Farmers troubles today are the result of the embargoes of yesterday Embargoes drastically lowered our prices so we could not pay off our debts Our old steady reliable customer Japan immediately invested billions of dollars in the Brazilian soybean industry so that her people would never again face the specter of starvation because of some politicians whim in Washington Today Brazil has risen from almost nothing to the second largest producer of soybeans in the world The longrange effects of those embargoes are being felt now Because the US could no longer be depended on as a source of supply our competition took up the slack President Ford promised farmers an unrestricted market if they would only plant fence row to fence row Then when we were ready to market our grain he declared a moratorium not because of a shortage but to force prices down That was the beginning of our present burdensome surplus We must have some high prices to cover our losses when prices are low The Government forced our prices down How then can we absorb the low ones Shouldnt the Government assume some responsibility for the hardships they have caused Government policies have forced our costs way up ie inflation caused primarily by Government spending more than it takes in excessive regulation huge increases in the minimum wage law Farm machinery costs are double what they were just five years ago Organized labor is now supporting higher prices for farmers They have finally realized that decent prices for farmers immediately translate into jobs for the nonfarm population Most farmers would prefer to keep the Government out of farming but when they push us to the wall we have no alternative Cities are receiving subsidies from the US taxpayer to the tune of 55 billion or a whopping 10 percent of the total Federal budget Now President Carter proposes adding 44 bil lion more to that figure A major portion of New York Citys troubles is due to mismanagement and unrealistically high wages and pensions for its personnel Are these subsidies fair to taxpayers ELEANOR ZIMMERLEIN La Moille Ill March 28 1978 To the Editor Some interesting signs are developing concerning that most fascinating new concept known as givebacks Recent negotiations with the city unions center on the concepts of givebacks Now it seems that Arthur Burns is advocating his own version with a call for the President and Congress to reduce their salaries by 10 percent as an example to the business community If this idea were to catch on perhaps we can return to the day which some of us can remember when dentists cleaned teeth free of charge when repairmen inspected your appliances without a service charge and when bakeries offered a bakers dozen Along with these givebacks there might be a return to former courtesies that seem to go hand in hand SEYMOUR SAROKIN New York March 29 1978 ERA Keystone To Other Rights To the Editor Soma Golden correctly identified the growing challenges to a womans right to choose abortion as an attack against one of womens most basic freedoms  to decide whether and when to bear children [Editorial Notebook March 17] But her suggestion that feminists turn their attention primarily to that issue rather than to the Equal Rights Amendment is shortsighted Feminists are fighting battles on numerous fronts In addition to reproductive freedom there is the right to equal pay and equal educational opportunities to be free from violence in their homes and on the streets to be recognized as equal partners in marriage to express their own sexual preferences to name only few Basic to all of these rights is the right of equality before the law Victory for the Equal Rights Amendment will hardly be pyrrhic it is the keystone to gaining all other rights citizens We cannot stop our efforts to win all of these4battlec But we must recognize that victories on those issues may be local and temporary The only victory that is national in scope and relatively permanent in impact is passage of the ERA When we haVe equality between the sexes written into the Constitution we have a bastion of defense against any attack on our rights Our organization believes therefore that the Equal Rights Amendment must command our most urgent and concentrated efforts We urge all those committed to womens rights to support every effort to ratify the ERA They can do that most immediately by persuading their Representatives and Senators in the US Congress to vote for a sevenyear extension on the deadline for ratification the current bill is HJR 638 A victory for the ERA is a victory for every other womans issue ZELLE W ANDREWS President NOWNew York State White Plains March 21 1978 Of Israel and the American Jewish Community To the Editor As author of the memorandum issued by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations entitled Anwar Sadat Superstar to which Anthony Lewis took such umbrage March 27 may I give three reasons why the terms hardline and obdurate were used to describe the Egyptian President First Mr Sadat abruptly broke off the peace negotiations in Jerusalem after less than two days of talks and refuses to resume them as he informed Ezer Weizman on March 30 Second Mr Sadat insists that Israel agree to return to the pre1967 borders before any negotiation takes place Third Mr Sadat demands establishment of a Palestinian state which threatens not only the existence of Israel but also the peace of the entire region Mr Lewis may consider such positions moderate and forthcoming We do not Your columnist also appears vexed that American Jews have not taken it upon themselves to tell Israel what its foreign policy should be Perhaps it is because they realizeas Mr Lewis does notthat when Israelis exercise the democratic right to express their opinions about their countrys security they are prepared to accept the consequences of those convictions They and their sons and daughters will have to pay in blood should the policies they urge turn out to be wrong But Anthony Lewis sitting in Boston does not put his personal safety at risk or that of his children when he calls on Israel to quit the West Bank And Sir Siegmund Warburg of London whom Mr Lewis admiringly quotes does not hazard his own familys future when he moralizes that safety in this world can never be guaranteed barbed wire This argument is not an appeal to guilt as Mr Lewis calls it It is rather an expression of the good sense of the American Jewish community shared I believe by most Americans which recognizes that the lifeanddeath issues of Israels security must he determined only by those whose own life and death are at stakenot IN American Jews or British Jews or even by newspaper columnists who proclaim the superiority of their geopolitical wisdom and insist they know what is best for Israel RICHARD COHEN New York March 31 1978 The Strong Ties To the Editor Anthony Lewiss March 27 column Americans and Israel takes issue with comments I made in a letter to The Times and calls for a response Israel is the one country in the world which although its creation was initiated and sanctioned by the United Nations has had to fight four wars for its survival in 30 years Its existence remains in jeopardy to this day the visit of President Sadat to Jerusalem notwithstanding The feelings of its people and of Jewish people in this country are deeply interwovenby family ties by culture end by a history old and recent of shared tragedy Mr Lewis compares that country and that situation to Greece for which I have high respect but whose national existence is not endangered and whose people while they have had their fill of war and suffering fortunatelyhave not been the victims of 2000 years of persecution mid most recently attempted genocide The key question that arises from Mr Lewiss column however is more fundamental Is it really process in the American Jewish community that concerns him or is it the substance of Israeli policy I strongly suspect its the latter If Israel had a government whose policies were more in line with Mr Lewiss wishes I doubt that lie would express concern about the democratic processes in the American Jewish community What it all comes down to is what suggested in my letter Jews who have chosen to support Israels survival and security in good days and bad feel that the shaping of her foreign and defense policies must be the task of the people and the institutions or Israel Since Israels is a democratic society they feel assured that this process will yield governments that represent that mixture of firmness sense of responsibility and flexibility that add up to national interest American Jews whatever the disagreement between Rabbi Schindler myself and Mr Lewis will say what they want to say If they have chosen to support Israels national policies it is because they feel they need to all the more so as pressures from the United States the Arab nations and the terrorists mount and as the need for oil has drained the once ample reservoir of good will toward Israel in much of the rest of the world  ROBERT B GOLDMANN New York March 27 1978
APPROVAL OF BUDGET IS VOTED IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/06/archives/approval-of-budget-is-voted-in-albany-medicaid-abortion-ban-is.html,ALBANY Thursday April 6A weary New York State Legislature this morning approved the final portion of the state budget after the Assembly leadership agreed at Governor Careys urging to force the issue of Medicaid payment for abortions to a vote on the Assembly floor as a bill separate from the state budget The approval completed the Legislatures work on the 119 billion budget and cleared the way for the state to enter the credit markets for 4 billion to pay local governments and school districts Governor Carey in a statement said he was delighted The separate amendment which would have limited state payment for abortions to those necessary to prevent the death of the mother failed It was approved in the Senate by a vote of 35 to 22 but was defeated a few minutes later in the Assembly by a vote of 78 to 66 As a result of the amendments defeat the state will continue to pay about half the cost of the approximately 50000 Medicaid abortions performed each year in the state The other half of the cost is generally paid by local governments A Senate vote moments after the defeat of the amendment in the Assembly broke the deadlock over the states 72 billion local aid appropriation which had been delayed since the Senate amended the budget last Friday to bar most Medicaid abortions after the Assembly had refused to do so The impasse had left the state without a budget for its 197879 fiscal year which began Saturday and placed the 4 billion spring borrowing in jeopardy The leader of last weeks successful drive to amend the budget Senator James Donovan Republican of Chadwicks denounced this mornings move to separate the antiabortion amendment from the budget as an attempt to fool the public and to protect the Governor but he added this house has done as much as it can do The vote on this mornings antiabortion amendment which had been the target of furious lobbying over the last several weeks was similar to the vote on the issue last week One notable switch was that of Perry B Duryea the Assembly minority leader who last week voted against the amendment but tonight voted in favor The Montauk Republican is his partys frontrunning candidate for the gubernational nomination The Legislature returned to its session just before midnight last night after the Assemblys Democratic leadership and the Senates Republican leadership had agreed on a carefully choreographed scheme that would give the antiabortion forces some political adavntage in return for allowing the remaining piece of the budget to pass Final approval came at 150 AM The Assemblys abrupt change strategy came after Governor Carey told the Democratic leaders earlier yesterday to take any action necessary to complete passage of the budget including retreating from their previous refusal to circumvent the committee system and forcing a bill barring state payment for most abortions to the floor risking its passage and forcing another politically damaging veto from the Governor Mr Carey told the Democratic leaders this morning that he would veto the measure if it was approved according to participants in the meeting A meassure that would allow state Medicaid payments for only those abortions necessary to prevent the death of the mother was killed in the Assembly Health Committee yesterday An attempt to attach a similar amendment to the budget failed last week after an emotional debate in the Assembly but succeeded in the Senate creating the current stalemate The Assemblys strategy had been to strip the localaid budget of the abortion restriction and send it back to the Republicancontrolled Senate then wait for pressure from the financial community and local governments to force the abortion foes to yield But Mr Careys and his advisers in consultation with the financial community decided there was no more time to wait and prevailed upon the Assembly to change its posture Weve been trying since last Friday to get an agreement one top Assembly aide said Somebody has to play the statesman role Gedale B Horowitz a senior partner at Salomon Brothers who has been leading the underwriting for the spring borrowing said earlier that the budget had to be completed almost immediately if the borrowing was to be completed by April 17 This is to give Moodys Investor Service time to rate the notes and to give the brokerage firms time to sell them with the normal fiveday delivery date

The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/09/archives/the-region-in-summary-budget-passes-with-something-for-both-sides.html,The Legislature in Albany played game of chicken with the states budget deadline last week and the Democrats finally flinched In the end however both sides were reasonably happy with the outcome The issue was Medicaid fundhig for abortions The Democraticcontrolled Assembly was in favor of contiving the program the Republicancontrolled Senate opposed The Assembly had killed in committee a bill calling for the deletion of funds for abortions except in cases where the mothers life was in danger The Senate wanted the Assembly to take a floor vote on the politically charged issue for two reasons First to put on record legislators in favor of the Medicaid funding  some of them are in marginal districts  and second to embarrass Governor Carey should the measure pass He had promised to veto it a move the Republicans would have exploited politically To force the issue to the floor of the Assembly the Senate Republicans tied it as an amendment to the states 119 billion budget which was to be approved by the start of the states fiscal year April 1 For five days the state was without budget as the Assembly and Governor Carey refused to budge They hoped the pressures building from the lack of budget a a threatened delay of a vital 4 billion borrowing program and the delay of hundreds of millions of dollars in local school aid and welfare funds would put sufficient heat on the Senate to give in But the Senate Republicans stayed cool With time now precious the Democrats took the Medicaidban issue to the Assembly floor where it was duly defeated The Republicans satisfied then passed the budget without the amendment The battle left something for both sides  the Republicans got the floor vote in the Assembly Mr Carey and the Democrats saved Medicaid funding for abortions without having to resort to a veto Overshadowed in the jockeying was Source New York State Division of the Budget the fact that a 750 million tax cut politically pleasing to both parties was also approved in the new budget New York Citys Board of Education decided last week that it was safe to stop assigning school teachers on the basis of race and quietly did so There will be no more black box containing assignment slips for minoritygroup teachers and no white box for the others just one box from which all teachers will draw their assignments at random The racial assignment plan designed to increase the number of minority teachers and distribute them more evenly and quickly throughout the school system had been disputed since it was imposed last September under an agreement between the board and the United States Office of Civil Rights The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People among other groups supported it The opposition was centered in primarily white middleclass school districts which contended in court that the intent was to establish unconstitutional racial quotas Some Board of Education members found the plan distasteful too but they feared the alternative the loss of millions in Federal aid Last month however a Federal judge gave the board an out at least temporarily He rejected the Federalcity agreement on procedural ground contending that public hearings should have been held And although the Office of Civil Rights asked the city to keep the racial assignment plan while that decision is being appealed the Board of Education dropped it as soon as it legally could  last Friday It was not immediately clear how many teachers would be affected by the change It was a sadly familiar scene last week thousands of New York City policemen attending a funeral for officers killed in the line of duty On Sunday two were gunned down in Brooklyn in an early morning shootout Twentytwo police officers have now been killed in the last five years in the line of duty The latest incident however may become an important political issue in the coming gubernatorial campaign The man accused of the police killings had been indicted on charges of slaying fellow inmates during the 1971 uprising at Attica He accepted an offer to plead to a lesser charge and was pardoned by Governor Carey in 1976 when the Governor tried to finally close the book on Attica Last week Mr Carey defended his pardon of the suspect Cleveland Davis saying that at the time Mr Davis was already on parole The problem the Governor said was with the parole system and he ordered a study to find out why there are people on parole who walk around with guns in their pockets There was a flap developing however over the question of the pardon It was learned that the special prosecutor whose recommendations Mr Carey gave as his reasons for granting Attica pardons had specifically recommended against clemency for Mr Davis Another issue may prove more politti cally damaging and the killing of the police officers will surely give it impetus  in both parties Mayor Koche attending the police funerals called as he had throughout his campaign for restoring the death penalty in New York State A bill to do just that has been passed in the Legislature after bitter debate and with polls showing 75 percent of the electorate in favor of it Governor Carey steadfast in his opposition has promised to veto the measure Mr Koch said last week I hope the death penalty becomes the law of the state and in the event it werevetoed hope the veto would be overridden The Governor who has all but announced his candidacy is apparently ready to meet the attack In reply to those urging him to sign the bill he said My mind doesnt govern my conscience My conscience governs my mind Sybil R Moses had tried 90 cases as a Bergen County NJ assistant prosecutor but never anything quite like the trial of Dr Mario E Jascalevich the physician accused of killing five hospital patients with injections of curare Nor had she faced an opponent quite like Raymond A Brown a top criminal lawyer whose clients have included Hurricane Carter Given the matchup some theatrics were predictable What was not so predictable perhaps was that it would lead to implications of sexism and accusations of judicial incompetence that for a time last week overshadowed the question of guilt or innocence Mrs Moses contended that Mr Brown had gone too far questioning her ability and openly wondering what a woman was doing in thecourtroom in the first place What disturbed her more however was the attitude of the bench in Mrs Moses opinion Judge William J Arnold had treated her like a novice and had condoned sarcastic remarks and mocking effeminate gestures by not putting a stop to them There was a scene finally The prosetutor stormed from the courtroom then returned the next day with her boss District Attorney Roger W Bre slin Jr to ask that Judge Arnold disqualify himself on the ground that he was incapable of conducting a fair trial Mr Breslin was blunt the judge he recalled had said publicly that he would like to take a nap during the trial and in fact Mr Breslin said the court has appeared to be inattentive He asserted that Judge Arnold lacked the intellectual intensity to hear the complicated case Last week the judge refused to step aside  the court favors no one he said  and the prosecution let it go at that for now Attention once again shifted to the trial itself which is going into its sixth week with months to go Rutherford NJ a bluecollar Bergen County town with a population of 20000 finds itself in an alarming and mysterious medical situation The hid_ dente of some types of cancer in Ai town seems much higher than the national average The town near the heavily industrialized Hackensack Meadowlands has learned thanks to research done by the mothers of two cancer victims that 11 residents have contracted leukemia or Hodgkins disease in the last three years six of them children who attend or did attend the same 776student elementary school The incidence of leukemia and Hodgkins disease in the general population is about 13 per 100 000 The outbreak has understandably frightened parents and students though so far attendance at the school has not declined Looking for an answer local health officials have begun to test the air and water supplies in the town and at the school No unusual radiation has been found For some time state and Federal officials have been looking into the air pollutants and toxic wastes of many of the states industries as part of a study to determine why New Jerseys cancer death rate is the highest in the nation The wastes have been linked by some researchers to the large number of cancer deaths Last Friday the states Department of Environmental Protection took steps to limit air pollution from eight suspected cancercausing chemicals As an example of the magnitude of the problem the agencys proposals could force half the industrial plants in the state to install new antipollution devices Industry complaining that control programs are costing hundreds of millions of dollars now can be expected to put up a hard fight In Rutherford it is problematical whether the cause of the high cancer rate will ever be known Similar clusters of cases have occurred over the last 30 years including one in the Chicago suburb of Niles Ill in the late 1950s That one is still a mystery
Burger Court Is Limiting Its Own Turf,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/09/archives/burger-court-is-limiting-its-own-turf.html,WASHINGTON  Are Federal judges wandering too far afield into chancey areas of policymaking instead of confining themselves narrowly to settling  specific disputes by existing law This recurrent question arose again last week when the United States Supreme Court delivered a stinging lecture to one of the more venturesome of Federal appellate courts Unanimously it instructed the Court Appeals for the District of Columbia to stop blocking the will of Congress by erecting procedural barriers programs it privately opposes in this case nuclear power plants The Supreme Court was about as angry as it ever gets Without a dissent the justices accused the appeals court of reasoning that borders on the Kafkaesque and judicial intervention run riot To many the testy opinion seemed to serve notice on the rest of the Federal judiciary to stay within the carefully prescribed jurisdictional boundaries that the Court under Chief Justice Warren E Burger has been drafting for itself over the last halfdozen years In various ways through its rulings and its exercise procedural options the Burger Court has steadily narrowed the focus of its attention curbing immediate access to the Federal judicial system in constitutional cases promoting the use of state courts decrying but not always avoiding itself  legislating by Federal judges and deferring indefinitely consideration of important public issues All Supreme Courts redefine their turf gradually as their collective philosophy evolves one longtime Court watcher says Some reach out eagerly others gingerly but this Court is clearly pulling back In the name of judicial restraint it is saying it would rather have Congress and the state legislatures decide the tough ones Historically much of the debate over intervention versus restraint centers on an inter pretation of federalism Chief Justice John Marshall generally supported a strong central Government and national rights embodied in the Constitution But his successor Roger Taney believed state governments were sovereign and not subject to Federal intervention His position culminated in the Dred Scott decision of 1857 which barred Congress from outlawing slavery in the territories because blacks were not persons who enjoyed constitutional protection In a speech in 1976 Chief Justice Burger expressed satisfaction that the issue that provoked the Dred Scott Decision should have been resolved as it eventually was by the politicalranches of Government an apparent reference to the Civil War To the consternation but not surprise of his critics Mr Burger went on to say that the problems leading to the Courts school desegregation ruling of 1954 and its oneperson onevote decision of 1962  the dual landmarks of the Warren Court  similarly   theoretically could have been resolved by the political branches long ago And he implied they should have been Because the Court keeps secret how it arrives at decisions no one knows whether Mr Burger has been extraordinarily skillful in pleading his case whether the makeup of the present Courttwo Eisenhower appointees four Nixon appointees and one each by Presidents Kennedy Johnson and Ford  gives him a receptive audience Probably the most authoritative description of policy has come from one of its members Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr The present Court mindful of preserving the vitality of Democratic prqcesses may be more deferential to legislative judgements he told the American Bar Association in 1976 It is more likely to give more weight to federalism And it is more conventional demanding compliance with jurisdictional and standing requirements Supporting this characterization are examples Legislative deference The Court ruled in 1976 that imposition of the death penalty was not inherently unconstitutional The practical effect was to pass back state legislatures the determination of whether capital punishment was an effective crime deterrent Federal jurisdiction In a dozen or more rulings the Federal courts have lost authority over cases involving alleged constitutional rights violations by state or local governments or the military Evading contioversy The justices chobse to hear some 150 cases a year a figure that has not changed much over the years Sometimes though the Burger Court seems to favor the trivial over the significant On one Monday last January it passed over cases involving judicial gag orders on the press the legality of Congressional onehouse vetos and the taxation marriage penalty imposed on wageearners who wed but found calendar space for the legality of an atlarge election to the Dallas City Council a question whether a dispute between two insurance companies should be tried in state or Federal Court and the Governments right to water stock from a stream flowing through a national forest More than its predecessor this Court also tends escape dealing with the controversial issues by summarily affirming or dismissing appeals from lower court rulings without any explanation of its rationale Abstention The Court ruled in 1971 that Federal courts could not interrupt state criminal proceedings to examine charges of constitutional or civil rights violations except under extraordinary circumstances It has since included some civil proceedings Diversion In 1976 in a relatively narrow ruling involving promotion policies of the District of Columbia police force the Court held that Government actions producing a discriminatory result may not be unconstitutional unless they have a discriminatory intent Since then a broad range of discrimination cases has been sent back to the lower courts for reexamination It is not that the Court under Chief Justice Burger refuses to squarely face issues Its rulings on abortion obscenity sexbased discrimination criminallaw procedures politicalcampaign regulations and the Watergate tapes bear out that point But at the same time the Burger Court tends to dabble in the art of avoidance and one question is whether its latest injunction against judicial policymaking will produce ripples in Federal circuit and district courts Probably not But if the warning is repeated and even expanded lowercourt judges

LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/09/archives/long-island-weekly-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-fine-arts.html,It did my heart good to see the recent slew of letters [Opinion Page March 12] protesting the closing of the Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts My daughter and I first visited the museum in December 1977 My daughter a finearts major at one of the Islands leading universities and a frequent visitor to the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art wanted to see what her home turf offered We both were most favorably impressed with the small but excellent selection by modern masters And we were delighted at the elegant wellkept setting the Frick estate gave these gems County Executive Francis T Purcell called this museum a dump If this is so Nassau County would be fortunate to have more dumps like it for all of us lowbrows Viva museum Lets keep the fine arts fine in our county As a member of the Fine Arts Society I agree fully with its decision to withdraw financial and advisory support to the Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts I feel that Mr Purcell and Mrs OBrien [Marcia OBrien director of the Nassau County Office of Cultural Development] should reinstate Ward Mintz with appropriate apologies If their conduct is countenanced the arts will fall victim to the inevitable mediocrity in herent in the political bureaucracy Locust Valley The writer is on the board of directors of the International Foundation for Art Research Nothing beneficial can be achieved by continuing the cascade of criticism against the new administration at the Office of Cultural Development in Nassau County The point has been made that the people of Long Island want museum of fine arts operating at a high level Let us now stop what can only turn into a vendetta without reason Isnt it better to try to develop ways of cooperating with the preseht administration for the achievement of an everincreasing program of art for our community In view of Elton Dublins political association with Assemblyman Irwin J Landes it is understandable that his letter to the editor on Jan 15 is more fiction than fact Mr Landess election victories can be attributed to luck as much as anything else He was elected in 1970 by a fluke when his opponent Vincent R Balletta was the victim of the abortion issue The outcome of that election had nothing to do with the publics perception of Mr Landes as the better man The Landes record virtually nonexistent until 1975 had little  if anything to do with his reelection in 1972 and 1974 In 1972 Mr Landes was the beneficiary of a devastating Republican primary Even so he squeaked in with less than a thousand votes In 1974 Minnie Mouse running as Democrat incumbent in the liberal 16th Assembly District would have won the election Mr Landess Republican opponent was hurt further by the presence of a Conservative candidate on the ballot No wonder Mr Landess margin increased But it did not in 1972 or 1976 In 1976 Jimmy Carter pulled out an unprecedented number of Democratic and independent voters in the 16th the largest area of  which is Great Neck where Democrats outnumber Republicans 4 to 1 However the Landes victory margin was reduced by his Republican opponent Howard Blankman running for office for the first time I suggest that Mr Landess success was based more on his rhetoric than his record especially in view of the recent revelations Republican Committeeman Great Neck South Letters should be addressed to Editor Long Island Weekly News Department The New York Times 229 West 43d Street New York NY 10036 Letters must include the writers address and telephone number for verification The Times reserves the right to edit and condense all letters
Coast Doctor's Murder Trial Draws Abortion Foes’ Notice,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/10/archives/coast-doctors-murder-trial-draws-abortion-foes-notice-saline.html,SANTA ANA Calif April 7A baby rested in her mothers lap this week in a witnesss chair in Superior Court here looked out inquisitively at the crowded courtroom before her and gurgled softly She was an exhibit in an unusual trial for murder The defendant is Dr William B Waddill who a year ago was one of the busiest obstetrician gynecologists in Orange County an affluent fastgrowing area south of Los Angeles He usually delivered 60 or so babies a month and performed many abortions Now Dr Waddill is on trial for murder accused of killing the newborn infant of an 18yearold woman who sought an abortion from him last year She told him that she was unmarried and 22 weeks pregnant I dont want and cant take care of the baby she wrote in requesting the abortion I dont want to carry the baby to full term and have to give it up for adoption Im emotionally unprepared to face consequences and my father is the principal of the high school I attend and the pressure would not be fair to him Apparently Dr Waddills own examination did not refute her judgment that she was just 22 weeks pregnant I made a mistake he said later On March 2 1977 the young woman was admitted to Westminster Community Hospital and Dr Waddill injected a saline or salt solution into her uterus to induce an abortion Instead of a 22weekold fetus she delivered a threepound infant perhaps 28 to 31 weeks old The specifics of the delivery at this point are the subject of the trial Dr Waddill contends that the infant was dead He was convinced he would testify that no infant could survive saline abortion and that if there was any chance of survival the child would have serious brain damage Testifying in his defense Dr Waddill denied that he had choked the baby and described its gasping breath as a death struggle No doctor walking on the face of this earth could have resuscitated that baby he said The prosecution contends however that the child a girl was strangled and would have survived otherwise Dr Waddills account was disputed by a pediatrician Dr Ronald Cornelsen who testified that he had examined the newborn child and found that it was breathing and had a heartbeat He said that he saw Dr Waddill choking the infant and that Dr Waddill talked of drowning it or injecting it with potassium chloride to kill it Dr Cornelsen quoted the obstetrician as saying This baby wont quit breathing Dr Cornelsen said he subsequently taperecorded telephone conversation in which Dr Waddill advised him not to get squirreley and stick to the story we discussed The jury trial which is expected to have at least another week of testimony has attracted wide Interest among some groups opposed to a choice on abortion Most days since the trial began almost three months ago the courtroom has been filled with middleaged women many of whom are taking detailed notes Some antiabortion groups maintain that some fetuses have survived saline abortions most often used in more advanced stages of pregnancy and then have been killed The 1yearold baby who was presented on the witness stand survived a saline abortion and the prosecution presented her as evidence in an effort to counter Dr Waddills position Jurors watched several hours of television tape in which she was tested by a pediatric physical therapist from the University of California Dr Waddills attorney a physician contended that the child had cerebral pAlsy and said  this supported his clients claims The therapist said cerebral palsy was a possible cause of the childs delayed development Thc woman who had the abortion Mary Weaver has not testified in Dr Waddills trial but she has filed a 17 million malpractice suit againSt him contending among other things that he misled her about the duration of her pregnancy Dr Waddill cites disputes he had had with other hospital staff members as the reason for some of his problems He said six IlospItals had turned down his requrest to practice since he was charged in the death but after twice having his privileges removed at Westminster he has been reinstated for all procedures except abortions These right to life people have been critical of me he said Well I believe in my patients right to her life her right to decide what she wants before the embryo some nonliving some nonexistent thing
Race Is Clarified a Mrs. Humphrey Declines to Run,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/10/archives/race-is-clarified-as-mrs-humphrey-declines-to-run-winning.html,MINNEAPOLIS April 9Potential Senate candidates in both of Minnesotas major parties are breathing a lot easier now that Muriel Humphrey has announced that she will not seek election Ito the remaining four yearsof her late husbands term For the last couple of weeks betting had been heavy among knowledgeable political people here that the 66yearold Mrs Humphrey who acknowledges that she has a slight bloodpressure problem would not take on the rigors of a campaign in  which she would have had to overcome a strong opponent in Representative Donald M Fraser to win the nomination of her own DemocraticFarmerLabor Party But until the moment last night when she told a gathering of 4000 party members at the first Hubert H 14umphroy dinner in St Paul of her decision only a handful of friends family members and aides really knew what she would do I Meanwhile although she has been serving in the Senate on an interim ap pointment by Gov Rudy Perpich after her husbands death on Jan 13 recent results of the respected Minnesota Poll had shown Mr Fraser the liberal Fifth District Congressman running neck and neck with her as the choice of the party faithful for the nomination Perhaps even more telling was the strength that Mr Frasers organization had demonstrated at county and legislative district party conventions in winning the commitment of about 40 percent of the delegates to the upcoming Congressional district conventions At the same time Mrs Humphrevs loosely knit followers who were awaiting her decision were Sagely unsuccessful on the county level at gaining delegate commitments or even at having resolutions passed urging her to run But last night Mrs Humphrey radiant and obviously moved by the outpourinl of affection for her and her late husband gave no indication that she had been swayed by any possible political obstacles or by any concern for her health After declaring that she had thoroughly enjoyed the challenges and responsibilities of this important and demanding office she told the audience at the Civic Center Auditorium which included Vice President Mondale that she had reread some ome of Mr Humphreys statements on public life before making her decision While like Hubert 4 feel stirred by the purpose and the promise and the challenge of it she said at this time in my life after 12 campaigns for public office and 33 years of sharing fully with him and his duties as Mayor Senator and Vice President I want to return to Minnesota at the end of the interim period in November and resume life as private person with ample time for my home family and friends The applause was long and loud and heartfelt And no one cheered louder and longer than the backers of Mr Fraser who made up a sizable portion of the crowd For tne consensus among DemocraticFarmerLabor leaders has been that Mrs Humphrey probably could have won the nomination at the June convention she had really set out to work for it Some supporters of Mr Fraser had recently been spreading the word that Mrs Humphrey took the nomination from their candidate they might attempt to block the endorsement of Senator Wendell R Anderson who also faces an election in November I was never a parry to that said Mr Fraser an eightterm Congressman who earlier had reluctantly agreed in the name of party unity not to challenge Mr Anderson for the seat to which he had himself appointed when he resigned as Governor in 1976 following former Senator Mondales election as Vice President In recent days a broad segment of the party leadership conceded although none wanted to he quoted by name that Mr Anderson was in trouble with the voters primarily because of that virtual selfappointment The latest Minnesota Poll published March 19 by The Minneapolis Tribune showed Rudy Boschwitz a wealthy plywood merchant and Republican national committeeman leading Senator Anderson by 48 to 45 percent with 7 percent undecided As for Mr Fraser he now appears likely to get his partys endorsement in June although he may have trouble because of his freedomofchoice position on abortion and his strong environmentalist stands The withdrawal from the race last week of Nicholas Coleman majority leader of the State Senate leaves the antiFraser forces with no ready alternative at the convention But Robert E Short the millionaire Minneapolis businessman lawyer and longtime party contributor has announced plans to run a heavily financed campaign for the Senate nomination in the September primary election Political observers give him little chance of defeating Mr Fraser but they feel that his candidacy maydivide the party further All of this along with Mrs Humphreys withdrawal suddenly makes the race for her Senate seat considerably more attractive to the IndependentRepublicans who had been having trouble coming up with a candidate for the special election On Thursday Robert Brown a former State Senator and former state party chairman said he would seek endorsement for the seat Meanwhile party leaders are attempting to persuade DaVid Durenberger Minneapolis lawyer who had been consistently trailing Representative Albert H Quie in his hid for the gubernatorial nomination to pull out of that race and seek the Senate nomination

Taxes: When Women File,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/11/archives/taxes-when-women-file-medical-expenses-museum-visits-too.html,In the past the annual chore of doing the taxes tended to be left to men but now  reflecting the changing times  more and more women are taking an active interest in this important area of pertonal finance Although the April 17 deadline for filing 1977 tax returns is just six days away there is still time for lastminute filers to run through the following checklist of special tax tips for women prepared with the assistance of Sidney Kess director of taxes for the accounting firm of Main LaFrentz  Company Women who have already filed their returns may find some pointers on how to do things differently year Medical expenses are one category of tax deductible items that can be of great benefit to female taxpayers Its an area where women frequently overlook potential deductions Mr Kess observed Women troubled with physical ailments ranging from bad backs to varicose veins can write Off a wide variety of treatments and devices as long as they are prescribed by a physician Abdominal supports elastic support hose orthopedic shoes and special bed boards have all been held to be deduCtible The Government even allowed one woman who lost her hair because of radiation treatments to deduct the cost of a wig because it was considered essential to her mental health Women wno want to make them selves over with the help of plastic surgery also get a tax benefit from the operation Face lifts and other cosmetic surgery have been deemed deductible because they are procedures that affect the bodily structure tne Internal Revenue Service has ruled Membership in a health club to pursue an exercise regime ordered by doctor is deductible although someone who goes to a luxurious health spa to shed a few pounds probably will have a tough time convincing the Government that it should help pay the bill Birth cont rol pills and other contraceptive devices prescribed by a doctor are tax deductible and so is the cost of an abortion according to Mr Kess But a prospective mother cannot write off the cost of maternity clothes nor can she deduct the fees or a private nurse unless the infant is The cost of professional sex counseling has even been held to be deductible although the IRS did balk at allowing a couple to write off the hotel room they rented for the duration of the therapy Sometimes the law seems downright arbitrary when dealing with expenses connected with calming a rocky marriage Marriage counseling fees are not deductible but psychiatric bills are considered a bona fide medical expense One taxpayer was allowed to deduct the legal fees paid to commit a mentally ill spouse to an institution Sometimes certain portions of legal fees are deductible and its always wise to ask a lawyer to provide an itemized bill breaking out the portion of the fee connected with tax planning If a lawyer has drafted a new will or prepared di vorce or separation papers for instance the portion of the fee that is related to tax or estate planning Is deductible according to Mr Kess Frequently women living alone Some women living alone may qualify for head of household filing status are not aware that they may be eligible for the favorable head of household filing status The advantage is the relatively low tax rate which is better than the rate for single persons but not quite as low as that for married persons filing jointly Mr Kess provided three different examples of common situations that would allow women to claim this filing Status The first case concerns a person who is supporting an aged parent in a nursing home She is eligible as long as she meets the specific tests spelled out in the official IRS instructions pays more than half the cost of maintaining her parent in the nursing home and can claim the parent as a dependent Another case concerns an older mother whose child moves back home after a divorce As long as the mother pays more than half the household expenses she may qualify even if her child is not a dependent IRS regulations specifically exempt unmarried children stepchildren or grandchildren from the dependency requirement The final case concerns a woman who has been deserted by her husband but is still legally married As long as she maintains a home for her children for the entire year and pays more than half the household expenses she too can qualify While most women are aware they can claim a credit for at least some portion of childcare expenses they may not be up to date on changes resulting from recent legislation First the credit which goes up to 800 is available to taxpayers at all income levels so taxpayers who previously were considered too wealthy to qualify now are eligible Say a doctors wife wants to go back to school full time Mr Kess said The couple can now deduct the cost of a baby sitter or housekeeper to look after the children while she is getting her degree And the person who looks after the children does not necessarily have to be an outsider in order for the payments to be tax deductible Relatives including mothers or mothersinlaw may be paid for looking after the children as long as are not dependents and as long as the taxpayer pays Social Security taxes on the relatives salary Second as a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 women can now claim a credit for child care expenses even if the children are not their dependents for tax purposes To do so they must have custody of the children for the greater part of the year and must contribute more than half the cost of maintainine the household Education expenses can also provide a fruitful source of deductions especially for teachers A recent court case held that a French teacher who visited France to improve her knowledge of the language could deduct the cost of the trip So could an elementary school teacher who went to Europe and visited a smorgasbord of museums The teachers school board had allowed the trip as an alternative to her taking courses the court said adding that the womans museum visits helped her to teach art Sometimes women in certain occupations such as nurses and surgeons can deduct the cost of uniforms and special clothing that is used solely in connection with their jobs The courts have gradually broadened the definition of special clothing Famous cases have permitted entertainers to write off the cost of expensive evening gowns used for performances and sided with a fashion coordinator who had to purchase ultrachic clothing for industry meetings Women who are delegates to conventions can deduct the cost of their transportation to and from but those merely attending as general observers cannot In both cases the cost of baby sitters tolook after the children in the womens absence is not deductible

The Perils of E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/11/archives/the-perils-of-era.html,The Equal Rights Amendment Is in trouble After more than six years of battle to win ratification ERA Is still three states short of the necessary 38 Fearing failure some proponents are pressing Congress to postpone the March 1979 deadline and give them another sevenyear try at ratification They point out that the original deadline was get by Congress not by the Constitution and there fore can be reset by Congress Although the last seven constitutional amendments have all passed easily under a sevenyear deadline some boosters contend that ERA is too complex and controversial to be decided upon a mere seven years We have long warmly supported the Equal Rights Amendment A statement that sex may no longer be barrier to equality belongs in the Constitution of a nation that promises equal rights to all but does not grant them to women Such an amendment would reduce the costly timeconsuming casebycase battles necessary now win an end to discrimination based on sex Despite our deep commitment to ERA however we cannot accept the idea of extending the deadline for ratification There is infact little guidance from the authors of the Constitution on the process of amendment except that it is not to be easy or casual it requires the approval threefourths of the state legislatures not merely of majority In 1917 in an effort to assure that a vote would take place in timely fashion Congress set a sevenyear limit that has since become traditional More time than that has never been necessary for ratification We would not tamper lightly with this tradition Seven years offers a reasonable period for discussion and it the period that ERA originally was granted for its ratification test The argument that the proposed 27th Amendment is somehow too complex or divisive to be ratified by the states in seven years does not hold up When ERA was born in 1972 its proponents thought would be quickly ratified Its complexity has not multiplied only the opposition to it has But that is not reason enough to change the deadline There is another practical argument against extension Four of the 35 states that have so far endorsed ERA voted later to rescind that endorsement In one state the recision was vetoed by the acting governor in a move now under challenge in court Although constitutional scholars dispute the validity of recisions a case can be made that none of them should be counted against ERA in the tally next March However if the ratification period is extended the recisions could multiply and the courts would surely find it difficult to extend until 1986 the right of states to switch their votes to support the amendment while denying them the right to switch against it Finally there is a tactical reason to reject the idea extension Too much energy has gone into the fight for passage of the amendment and not enough into battling for other issues particularly the right to abortion which may be more critical to women than ERA Much of what the amendment would achieve can be won other ways though more slowly and less thoroughly We hope and believe that the amendment will some day prevail But it should not prevail at too high a cost

Carter and the Press,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/12/archives/carter-and-the-press-washington.html,WASHINGTON April 11In the last couple of weeks President Carter has been criticized more severely by the press at home and abroad than at any other time since he entered the White House For example he mare a most solemn and impressive speech on the economic problems of the nation before the American Society of Newspaper Editors here yesterday Secretary of State Vance defined the Administrations foreign policy before the same audience But at no point during their formal addresses were they applauded on any single point by the most responsible editors of the nations press This raises some fundamental questions both about the President and the press Is there something about Mr Carter personally that creates doubt about his capacity for leadership Are his policies wrong or poorly presented or merely misunderstood Or is the press underestimating the magnitude and complexity of the problems before him and blaming him for problems that also involve the Congress and public opinion beyond his control At home he has been blamed by Big Business for the inflation by Big Labor for the unemployment by the farmers for prices that are too low and by consumers for prices that are too high The blacks charge that his new policy for the cities is too cheap and meager and the white middle class says he is taxing it out of existence Abroad he is being condemned by the Soviets for being too tough by the Chinese for not being tough enough on Moscow by the Japanese for limiting their exports of steel and TVs by George Meany of the AFLCIO for not limiting imports enough Mr Carter is being criticized by the European allies and particularly the West Germans for interfering in their internal economic policies without getting Washingtons own economic house in order and by the Israelis for demanding too many concessions for Middle East settlement and by the Arab states for financing an Israeli policy he opposes The American press has dealt with all these problems one at a time Reporters are a little like doctors They hear mainly from people who have pain and get a lot of news from losers who have a grievance All of this makes news but doesnt make much sense The men who come forward to speak for a vast continental country like the United States can define policies but cannot really compel the Congress to accept them This is the point that may be underestimated by both the press and the allies They simply do not understand the complications of the American Federal political system The President of the United States can suggest as Mr Carter has what to do about inflation unemployment education abortion health care at home or overseas how to deal with strategic weapons the cruise missile or the neutron artillery warheads But the Congress may have a different notion and these days it usually does The Congress wants to know why Mr Carter hasnt come forward with answers to all the questions And since he hasnt the Republicans see the opportunity to reduce the Democratic majority in Congress in November and maybe even to elect a Republican President in 1950 There is a tendency now to mock Jimmy Carter to suggest that he is not big enough for the job that he is confused and indecisive just at the point when he is beginning to negotiate a strategic arms agreement with the Soviets and revive the negotiations for a compromise in the Middle East Messrs Carter and Vance were almost pleading with the American newspaper editors here to understand all these complicated and dangerous domestic and foreign problems but they didnt seem to make much progress The President and his Secretary of State were almost too serious too meticulous with the details of domestic economics and complicated foreign military weapons The editors seemed almost stunned by the confusion of facts and went away about as confused as when they arrived Maybe this is Jimmy Carters major problem at home and abroad He is very persuasive when he is in a small room expressing his convictions and yearnings to two or three people Even Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany testifies to this but when Mr Carter talks to a large audience there is something about his voice and style that loses them and makes them wonder what he means and where he is going Accordingly Mr Carter is not only getting a had press these days but getting into serious political trouble at home and abroad Even his most enthusiastic supporters complain that he does the right thing many times but does it in the worst possible way The newspaper editors seemed troubled about all this Despite the beauties of the city and the season Jimmy Carter didnt send them away very happy

SCOTTISH ELECTION FATEFUL FOR LABOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/13/archives/scottish-election-fateful-for-labor-government-seeks-to-demonstrate.html,GLASGOW April 12The crisis of the Labor Party in Scotlandand therefore in Britain as a whole because Labor cannot win without Scotlandis writ large this week in the seedy housing project called Drumchapel Billy Connolly the Scottish comedian whose family lives in the project calls it a desert with windows Perched on a windswept hill overlooking the Clyde in northwest Glasgow Drumchapel is the secondlargest housing project in Europe a cheerless assembly of low barrackslike tenements of concrete block It is disfigured by shattered windows broken fences graffiticovered walls and shuttered shops Not a daffodil is blooming there in the Scottish springtime But another touch of yellow is visibledozens of yellow posters urging a vote for Keith Bovey the Scottish National Partys candidate in tomorrows important byelection at Garscadden Drumchapel which occupies the northern half of the Garscadden constituency has always been Labor country it was the promised land built by the welfare state after World War II to free the working class from Glasgows notorious innercity slums Now it too is a sluma slum with a view a slum with fresh air but a slum all the sameand many of its thousands of inhabitants are bitter at those who induced them to move to Drumchapel Labor doesnt care about the people said a woman in Drumchapel as she made her rounds as a bill collector They put you in there and forget about you Like many of her friends she said she was thinking about abandoning her lifelong habit of voting Labor In addition to the standard economic reasons she gave another a Roman Catholic of Irish descent she opposes abortion and Donald Dewar the Labor candidate voted for liberalized abortion in 1967 when he represented another constituency in Parliament Tomorrows byelection will be the first in Scotland since 1973 It is an opportunity for Labor to demonstrate that its hardwon approval of devolution or partial home rule for Scotland and its success in slowing inflation have halted the disastrous erosion in its strength here For the Nationalists Garscadden is a chance to prove that they are still gaining A swing of the size they need to win here if repeated in a general election would cost Labor 20 Scottish seats insure its defeat nationwide and perhaps most important give the Nationalists a majority of national seats and another powerful argument for independence Local politicians consider the contest a tossup with perhaps a slight edge to Mr Dewar He may have been helped slightly by the tax cuts detailed in yesterdays budget message or he may have been hurt by the fact that the cuts were not larger A poll of 521 Garscadden voters taken last weekend for The Glasgow Herald showed Mr Dewar leading Mr Hovey 33 percent to 28 percent with an unusually high figure of 23 percent still undecided Last May the Nationalists took all six Garscadden seats on the Glasgow District Council from Labor Since then a visit from Prime Minister James Callaghan plus progress on inflation and devolution has helped Labor to make a comeback So has a vigorous Conservative campaign lain Lawson the 25yearold Conhservative nominee has no chance of winning but he appears to be picking up some Nationalist votes The major imponderable is abortion The Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child has been extremely active turning out crowds of about 800 at each of two meetings more than any of the candidates have drawn and delivering to every household pamphlets showing an aborted fetus Flourish the journal of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow said recently that abortion was only one issue but it added For Catholics the abortion issue is one of the important issues Since onethird of Garscaddens voters are Catholics that comment was considered politically fateful You cant stand on your head for a few votes Mr Dewar said this week with a trace of exasperation Ive called for changes in the law Ive done all I can to defuse the issue To do more would he to destroy my credibility so Ill simply have to take my chances Should Mr Dewar lose abortion will be one of the main reasons But as one of his strategists commented That will get lost in all the talk about the Nationalist steamroller Mr Callaghan might even decide to wait until next spring for a general election rather than call it as expected for October Mr Bovey an atheist who recently changed his position on abortion to conform to Catholic attitudes has been far less visible than Mr Dewar The Nationalists apparently are afraid that he will commit another gaffe like his statement several weeks ago that he would like to see military contracts phased out at the huge Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde That statement was soon withdrawn Yarrow is the biggest employer in the consituency and all of its contracts are for naval vessels Colin Darroch Mr Boveys manager nonetheless expects his man to win by 2000 to 3000 votes largely because of Nationalist sentiment the housing conditions in the district and unemployment which is running at 14 percent in Garscadden as a whole and at 30 percent in some areas

Assembly Gets Ready for the Last Act,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/16/archives/connecticut-weekly-assembly-gets-ready-for-the-last-act-sessions.html,HARTFORD THE General Assembly moved into the final stage of this years session last week when the deadline passed for the last of 25 legislative committees to propose new laws for consideration by the whole body Now the only way to get new bills before either house will be through difficult parliamentary juggling The scorecard for tallying this sessions vote is taking final shape To date the Assembly has only passed one major piece of legislation the Bottle Bill which requires a fivecent deposit on all beverage cans and bottles sold in the state That leaves dozens of other important issues to be fought out and resolved before the session ends on May 3 Leading the list of priority issues before the Legislature in recent days has been money especially various plans to give millions of it back to voters in this election year One shortlived idea would have put a 20 to 79 check on the mailbox of every homeowner in the state at an overall cost of about 20 million I guess it is really one of lifes ironies William A ONeill the House majority leader said wearily Here we are trying to give money out and the arguments are just as difficult as if we were trying LO raise taxes But the fight over how to spend surplus revenues has been a naturally pleasing battle at least for most Demo crats who outnumber the Republicans in both houses Whenever you can hand money back to the cities and the taxpayers Id say thats a pretty fruitful session said Mr ONeill The new spending proposals were an outgrowth of the predicted state revenue surplus this fiscal year Figures on the surplus have varied at various times in the debate from 766 million to 116 million Both Senate and House leaders predict that the fight over spending will be the major legislative issue catapulted into the election campaign Lewis B Rome a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor who is the Senate minority leader questioned the fiscal soundness of a spending increase The increase proposed by the Democrats is just too much for declining revenues to handle Mr Rome said Such extravagance this year will bring disaster next year when we are left with no surpluses and no bountiful tax revenues to plug up the holes Completely absent from this debate is the reckoning that must be done sooner or later with the question of a state income tax By order of the State Supreme Court Connecticut has to institute a more equal system of quality education in the state which according to some estimates might cost as much as 400 million The leadership of both parties contend that although anything is possible there is little chance of any action in this session on the potentially explosive idea held by a few Republicans of changing the formula for grants to schools this year There is a state study in progress on the school aid problem but there is nothing to prohibit action now on the formula even if the money is unavailable When this debate does surface probably next year it is expected to amount to a royal Donnybrook between cities and the suburbs Among the measures proposed by various committees and passed on to the full Assembly for action this session are An amendment  which would eventually require approval of voters  for merit selection of judges by a special commission A bill requiring annual statewide proficiency examinations for students in grade nine and local tests for some other grades  An unusual proposal to eliminate disparty in sentencing would prescribe sentences based on the crime and circumstances and eliminate parole Unlike mandatory sentencing however judges would have the option of ignoring the guidelines by writing an opinion explaining why they are not applicable The bill which was the product of an 18month study was reported favorably from the joint HouseSenate committee The Senators on the committee however abstained from voting on the measure This created a parliamentary hurdle that Senator Lawrence J DeNardis overcame by gathering enough signatures to place the bill before the Senate as well as the House This is the same legislative path that the Bottle Bill took last year when the measure failed because none of its supporters could find a way to unsnarl the parliamentary knot in which it was entangled Automobile inspections for emissions controls This measure would ward off Federal threats to withhold Connecticuts Federal highway money if action is not taken to clean up the air The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has made the same threat in other states but has not yet denied money to an entire state A smallerscale version of last years proposal to save Connecticuts remaining farmlands With a decreased figure of 5 million a pilot program would be launched to purchase developmental rights on cultivated lands threatened by developers but farmers would be allowed to own and till the land A bill to allow right turns on red lights A bill giving the state legal authority to develop for submission to the Federal Government an economic and environmental plan that tries to protect coastal areas thus entitling the state to Federal monies A bill to revive the Sunday blue laws  An innocuoussounding bill that deals with tips for waiters and waitresses which is viewed by many as a major test of labor loyalty Technically it sets their minimum wage at 71 percent of the national minimum reducing the benefits of their tips A measure that modifies the strict new lobbying law passed last year making it more palatable to the lobbyists Bills that seem dead by virtue of committee action or a vote in one of the chambers include state financing for abortions for poor women cut off by the Federal health program last year gun control a bill to end the required minimum markup of liquor by retailers a bill to equalize insurance rates for city residents proposals that would ban new construction of nuclear power plants and nuclear waste disposal in the state and a marijuana decriminalization effort 
ALBANY REPORTA 10‐Cent Issue Takes Its Toll,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/16/archives/long-island-weekly-albany-report-a-10cent-issue-takes-its-toll.html,IT was not even a twobit issue but it could have held up Governor Careys 12 billion budget The issue was whether users of the Southern State Parkway should have to pay a 10cent toll and though it was hardly as emotionfraught as the conflict over Medicaid abortions that delayed approval of the budget for nearly a week the issues partisan implications were enough to make grown men fight fiercely over a mere dime The battle showed the salutary effect election years sometimes have for voters living in areas  such as the Island  that are regarded as key political battlegrounds In effect Governor Carey proposed to drop the toll from 25 cents to a dime Not to be outdone the Republicans proposed to eliminate the toll entirely Not to be outdone the Democrats agreed on ending the toll In the forefront on the issue were Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer of Long Beach for the Democrats and Senator John D Caemmerer of East Williston for the Republicans Each man was responsible for making sure his party got credit for eliminating a toll that most Long Islanders thought would never go down let alone disappear The battle began in 1975 when the Jones Beach Parkway Authority raised the toll from a dime to a quarter The Legislature tried to have the raise rescinded  They didnt need the money said a top aide to Governor Carey  but Robert Moses who during his career enhanced the powers of the independent authority enormously had already made sure that no one but Authority officials had the power to raise or lower tolls The Court of Appeals declared the Legislatures action unconstituional What Mr Moses had not done however was close off the states authority to buy out the bonds of independent authorities The Governor proposed putting up 45 million to buy the bonds forgiving a 24 million debt the Authority owed to the state and have the states Transportation Department take over the Authoritys roads As part of the deal  the part designed to win friends and influence voters Mr Carey proposed the cut in the Southern State toll and the elimination of both the 25cent toll on the Loop Parkway to Lido Beach and the tolls on the causeways leading to Jones Beach The Republicans in the Senate had been smarting under this thing Mr Kremer said They couldnt oppose the abolition of the Authority without being against motherhood Mr Caemmerer harbored doubts about eliminating the Authority fearing that the state would not take care of its roads as well as the locally based Authority He also wanted the Long Island State Parkway Commission to maintain control over the Jones Beach theater But knowing he could never fight a decrease in tolls he took the offensive labeling the 10cent toll a tax in disguise for the users of the Southern State Parkway If Mr Carey wanted Republican support for his proposal he would have to go along with dropping the toll entirely Along with Senator Norman Levy a Merrick Republican Mr Caemmerer sponsored a bill to eliminate the toll and at the same time keep the theater under local auspices The pressure was now on the Democrats and particularly on Mr Kremer who as chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee has to answer to his Long Island home base to his partys interests in the Assembly and to Governor Careys budgetary worries as well For Mr Caemmerer one of the key arguments was that under Mr Careys original proposals the tolls had come off the highways running through Mr Kremers district but had been left on in Republican areas The Democrats of course denied such blatant partisanship The budget negotiations continued down to the deadline of midnight Friday March 31 and issue after issue was resolved Finally at 6 PM on the Wednesday before the Friday deadline the Governors office decided it could live without the 38 million the toll would have generated Since all the major items were disposed of Mr Kremer said they werent going to hold up the budget for a dime He thereupon triumphantly announced a victory for the Island and Mr Caemmerer declared the victory a Republican conquest Overall the State Department of Transportation will be charged with maintaining the roads and the states Office of Perks and Recreation will con trol the Authoritys property And the tolls disappeared But as is often the case in compromises heavily laden with political implications both sides now have doubts about just exactly what was done I think its unconscionable the way the Governor acted here said Mr Caemmerer who still does not like the fact that local control over the park has been eroded For Mr Caemmerer the issue is a broader one involving a bid by the Parks and Recreation office to take over parks around the state Mr Caemmerer also charged that Mr Carey did not consult his own appointees on the Authority before acting I dont think he comes out of it smelling any good Mr Caemmerer said Mr Careys supporters think the Governor came off well politically but they have other fears I have some reservations about it said a top aide who asked not to be named We may be creating a precedent that would be a real problem The problem the aide said is that the state is considering a takeover of the parkways in Westchester County These parkways are far less modern than those on the Island and could require more money  thus creating the need for tolls which in the wake of the Long Island decision will be harder to impose And where did the 38 million come from in

‘We Ran Out of Controversy’ Bea Arthur Says Farewell to ‘Maude’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/16/archives/we-ran-out-of-controversy-bea-arthur-says-farewell-to-maude.html,Weve accomplished what we set out to accomplish We brought good theater to television I may be kidding myself but I think we gave quality shows to television Also for the very first time we presented somebody who wasnt just a bubblehead out to get laughs For the first time issues were dealt with thoughts were exchanged I think we made television a little more adult I really do LOS ANGELES Beatrice Arthur the speaker lounged comfortably in a livingroom chair in her Sullivan Canyon ranchstyle home A few weeks ago she announced that she had decided to leave Maude after six years on CBS TV As she sipped her strong coffee she reflected on the series the last episode of which will be seen next Saturday night Six years is a long time with anything Miss Arthur said That long in a part can be very rewarding you can grow in it but after a while it has to stop I dont think Maude was a challenge to me anymore Yes the show would continue to be good but where would it go In its first years Maude was one of the most controversial shows on television a sitcom created by Norman Lear as a spinoff from his hit All in the Family Maude a cousin of Archie Bunkers wife Edith was an abrasive quickwitted Roosevelt liberal who took delight in raising everyones consciousness and damned the consequences The show built around her dealt with serious issues and themes through laughter While no one connected with the show is saying so Maude may have become too comfortably establishment in recent seasons winning Emmies where once was picketed and protested It has also dropped disconcertingly low in the ratings However Bea Arthur who played the series outspoken heroine says she is proud of all the shows Yet figuring in her decision to conclude what she calls the six happiest years of my life she says is her unwillingness to slip into creative inertia The first year it seemed to me that every single week we were doing some controversial subjectabortion alcoholism pot she said I remember when a show came around that had nothing to do with anything I said to Norman But we cant do thisits froth He said Why not Were not out to do something heavy every week People will get tired of it Now it isnt so much that we dont tackle as many controversial issues as we once did as that there arent many more controversial issues to tackle The only thing left is hemorrhoids Miss Arthur says the impact of her departure from Maude hasnt fully hit her yet Thats bound to come she said that sense of loss For the time being she is busying herself with cooking shopping picking up her two teenage children from school caring for her two German shepherds and playing house and loving every minute of it Miss Arthurs husband Gene Saks the actordirector is on the road with The Prince of Grand Street preparing the Broadway musical for its May opening Prior to our show sitcoms always had a married couple Miss Arthur said both of whom were terribly attractive and one of whomusually the womanwas the longsuffering adoring wife whose husband bumbled through life and did idiotic things In the case of I Love Lucy it was reversed But this was the first time that two adults came along who were neither I really believe that we had spectacular writers and a spectacular director and a brilliant theatertrained cast It may sound snobbish on my part but we were all from the New York theater I worked with Conrad Bain who plays Dr Harmon [Maudes neighbor] offBroadway 25 years ago It was like having a great repertory company Maude came together hurriedly and without the usual germination process Miss Arthur thinks that may be one key to its success You can think think think and get everything so right that it just doesnt work We literally had just a couple of weeks to get going and maybe that helped she said Miss Arthur had come out to Los Angeles in late 1971 from her Manhattan home to visit her husband who was then directing the film version of Last of the Red Hot Lovers When her old friend Norman Lear heard she was in town he talked her into making an appearance on All in the Family He created for her the character of Edith Bunkers cousin Maude a liberal given to baiting Archie Still fighting mental health eh Archie Fred Silverman who was then in charge of programming for CBS immediately spotted a series Rod Parker who wrote that All in the Family episode and who now serves as executive producer of Maude had only a name an actress and the fact of the characters aggressive liberalism to work with when he was asked to write the show He visited Miss Arthur and her husband in New York talked with them about their ideas and collected impressions of Miss Arthur to use for Maude Findlay The resulting show which had its debut in September 1972 was Maude a situation comedy about a woman over 90 who lived with her fourth husband and divorced daughter with a young son and who displayed a flare for twisting logic when arguing strongly held beliefs The show quickly became a hit What may really have gotten America hooked on Maude was its leaps into thorny political and social issues an enterprise not always compatible with the halfhour sitcom format Solutions arrived at in 24 minutesor even in a twopart episodecan sometimes be facile and simplistic The most famousor infamousepisode depending on ones point of view occurred the first year Maudes Dilemma a twopart show in November 1972 told of Maudes unexpected pregnancy and her subsequent decision to have an abortion The show triggered a storm of protesta few CBS affiliates refused to carry the episodeand achieved a 4 in the Nielsen ratings Today Miss Arthur has second thoughts about that show The reaction knocked me for a loop she said I really hadnt thought about the abortion issue one way or another The only thing we concerned ourselves with was was the show good We thought we did it brilliantly we were so very proud of not copping out with it Then the mail started coming in At first I was terribly hurt Most of the letters accused me of simply allowing the writers to put words in my mouth that I would have never said But it did give me pause The people who wrote to us were not cranks and crazies they were genuinely interested in and felt sincerely about the right to life At this point in my life I dont know if I would permit the show to end the way it did I really dont know Still Miss Arthur says she is encouraged by the overall impact on series television of Maude I believe weand All in the Familyhave changed television she said Think of the subjects that are being tackled now Nothing is taboo Maude was the first time that a woman on television had looked real and it was the first time she said what she felt and could tell her husband to go to hell I would get letters from women saying Not only have I never spoken to my husband that way I never permitted myself to think of doing it Indeed Maudes passions have altered the actress perspectives as well I know Ive been influenced by Maude she said The abortion thing for instance never entered my mind Tackling in depthput in depth in quotessubjects that might have only been lightly discussed previously has changed meI now think more about these matters One close associate of Miss Arthurs has observed that she is more like Maude today than when the show began and that her awareness of life around her is much greater now after six years of playing the activist character Ive seen her grow incredibly as a person during Maude Now that character and she are virtually the same the associate said This season Maude has slipped in the ratings First the show was hurt by competition from NBCs multipart Big Event and to a lesser degree by ABCs Monday Night Football Then the network started switching the time slot finally moving it in January to Saturday night at 930 The week Miss Arthur announced she was leaving the show was 66th in the Nielsens almost the cellar I dont think interest in Maude has lessened Miss Arthur said We were just buffeted around by CBS until my own kids didnt know what night the show was on The final three episodes of Maude send the grayhaired crusader to Washington as a congresswoman Norman Lear instigated the move with two thoughts in mind If Bea Arthur decided to stay on another year the show would benefit from a new supporting cast and location if she left as it turned out she did it would end the series on a high note With Maude safely ensconced in Washington Miss Arthur is looking forward to a nice long rest to be followed by movie and stage projects A CBS special next season is her only commitment to television People ask me if I would do another series she said I cant say no of course but I really doubt if anything as rewarding as Maude would come along for me What I loved about Maude was that it gave me the opportunity to do everythinghigh comedy low farce and drama Im just very very very proud I did it
"E.R.A., Of Course Just No Extension",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/16/archives/era-of-coursejust-no-extension.html,We argued last week against extension of the sevenyear deadline which expires next March for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment Somehow that statement caused some readers to conclude that we have lost enthusiasm for the amendment itself Quite the contrary The amendment is needed and we ardently hope for its ratification by the required three more states by that deadline Sex discrimination is still deeply ingrained in our laws in our customs and in our habits A constitutional declaration at last of the equality of the sexes can be a major weapon in the effort to eradicate that discrimination What troubles us is the effort by some supporters of the amendment to have Congress extend the deadline for ratification for another seven years We regard it as a misguided ploy in the name of a noble cause a lastminute change in the rules that Congress laid down when it offered ERA to the states For half a century seven years have been an adequate time to test the nations sentiment for constitutional amendments To shift nowwith the clock runningto 14 years or even longer would establish a disturbing precedent making amendment in effect an openended neverending political contest What would the ERA supporters think of such a procedure if for more than six years they had successfully resisted an amendment say to outlaw abortion Moreover ERA supporters might consider whether an extension could backfire by allowing more states time to rescind their earlier votes in ERAs favor Such rescisions have not stood up in the past But Congress and the courts might take another view if a state legislature insists on the right to change its mind on a matter first considered almost a decade earlier By holding to the original rules the ERA movement might well attract new respect and some lastminute support in the three states still needed to reach the necessary total of 38 Victory is not Impossible Ratification by Illinois could come in the next few months other pivotal states like North Carolina Georgia and Florida the amendments supporters hope to reverse narrow defeats by unseating a handful of hostile legislators in the November elections It is an odd moment to surrender to a dubious procedural maneuver that would win no friends for ERA Instead of removing the pressure for passage by pushing the deadline into the fog of 1986 the champions of ERA should use the time remaining to underscore the approach of a deadline and to impress on the public the justice of the cause
LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/16/archives/long-island-opinion-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-on-abortion.html,It seems that every so often one of the flightier antiabortionists sees fit to equate the aborting of human embryos with the atrocities of Hitlers Holocaust [Behind the Abortion Vote March 19] How can the one even begin to suggest the other For people to believe that it does is itself a kind of atrocity But quite apart from this why should citystate financing of newborns into unwelcoming householdswhere in many instances the prospect of neglect and brutalization loomsbe considered a sound and moral alternative to abortion Those obsessed with saving the unborn have a way of seeming indifferent to the plights of those already born While no advocate of abortion on demand I wholly support the right of welfare mothers to a choice in the matter Just as I support abortion of pregnancies caused by rape or incest or where the fetus is known to be defective The American dream seems to be alive and well in Suffolk County Its the same dream I grew up with in the 50s in a small town on the North Fork It goes something like this Graduate from high school get married have children buy a house and live reasonably happily ever after This of course is the white girls dream The idea of being unmarried having children being on welfare and struggling to keep a family together and of being black goes beyond the comprehension of these dreamers In the last few years I have sat in the living rooms and kitchens of family and old friends and heard heated debates about rising welfare costs What right do these black women have my friends want to know to come into Suffolk County and collect welfare money to try to raise kids that they shouldnt have had in the first place What right do they have to force tax rates up because of soaring welfare costs Why dont they go back to where they came from That is why it is ludicrous that these people these socalled prolifers were instrumental in the overwhelming vote by the Suffolk County Legislature to end Medicaid abortions We love life they scream But what kind of life are they talking about How many black faces were in that group of roseclutching females on the Tuesday when the Legislature voted These women and indeed the legislators who voted that day have the right to choose the direction of their lives and so do their children They have the right to choose the size of their family and the money to stay within that decision And so do their children If these people are so much in favor of life perhaps they should spend some time with a migrant worker and her kids perhaps they should help set up some birthcontrol clinics perhaps they should go into some of the black areas in the small towns that dot Suffolk County and talk to these women If they are prolife then they should be concerned for all life And since life in America is supposed to include freedom of choice perhaps they should think about this basic freedom the next time theyre waving their flags at a local parade Then maybe these people will begin to realize what life is really all about Considering the title of the article Behind the Abortion Vote it might have been appropriate to mention the fact that nearly all the Suffolk legislators who voted antiabortion are in fact Roman Catholics This cannot by any stretch of the imagination be totally a coincidence More likely at least some of them were in fact voting their religion in contravention of the establishment clause of the First Amendment which requires separation of church and state This is the most serious aspect of the Suffolk legislative action and must be redressed by legal suits and voter action The article Segregation Found Still Widespread [March 26] includes some inaccurate information and thereby does a disservice to those agencies and groups seeking to improve the quality of housing for low and moderateincome people I refer to the citation of the Tristate Planning Commissions dispute with Nassau County over a plan to put 93500 units of housing 90000 of them lowincome into the county In fact the commission is talking about aid to households not new structures Aid to lowincome families may include funds for housing rehabilitation and rent subsidies The number of new subsidized housing units projected is from 500 to 700 a year until the year 2000 In dealing with an issue so often dominated by more heat than light it is important to keep the facts straight

U.S. Senate Campaign for Lindsay Is Planned by Friend of Ex‐Mayor,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/17/archives/us-senate-campaign-for-lindsay-is-planned-by-friend-of-exmayor-new.html,John V Lindsays senatorial ambitions are going public A longtime friend is opening a Citizens forLindsayfortheSenate office about May on 57th Street to promote the former Mayor for the Democratic nomination New York Political Notes for Senator Jacob K Javitss seat in two years The effort by John Holmes a businessman is supposedly totally unauthorized but politicians who have been contacted by the former Mayor who was a virtual political recluse until recently know better Mr Lindsay has been pressuring politicians to intercede for him with the Carter and Carey administrations for a visible post that could be used as political springboard He has even volunteered for a role in Governor Careys reelection campaign but the Governor and his chief strategist David Garth are wary of Mr Lindsays unpopularity in New York City polls Ironically Mr Garth was a leading Lindsay adviser but they had a falling out Mr Lindsay has apparently given up on Mayor Koch who doesnt conceal his disdain for the former Mayor an enmity that goes back to Mr Lindsays tenure in City Hall In the meantime Mr Lindsay is accepting more speaking engagements such as one before 90 members of the Humanist Society last week and is increasingly active in the Association for a Better New York the real estate and business lobby that includes most of the citys big political givers Mr Lindsay shares a bagels and cream cheese breakfast most Wednesdays with the associations executive committee at its Rockefeller Center office although as Mayor he often asserted that the group had narrow interests  While Governor Carey will presumably hear much in the upcoming gubernatorial campaign about his veto of the death penalty his likely Republican opponent Perry B Duryea Jr the Assembly minority leader will have his own problems with his flipflop on the question of Medicaid financing of abortions Mr Duryea initially voted for Medicaid financing two weeks ago But only six days later Mr Duryea under pressure from the Conservative Party flipped to oppose such financing Serphin Maltese the Conservative Party leader was delighted Im gratified that Mr Duryea has come out fundamental agreement with our position in the minds of our party people it has made Perry Duryea a more fa tired candidate Mr Duryea wants the Conservative as well as GOP nomination  At a recent news conference at the Hotel Roosevelt Mr Duryea deplored the possibility that a state trooper had been transferred for ticketing Raymond B Harding the Liberal Party leader and special assistant to the Governor While Mr Duryea was deploring his green Cadillac was parked outside the hotel in a noparking nostanding zone with no driverand no ticket City Comptroller Harrison J Goldin is planning a series of mailingsin addition to the monthly comptrollers report that Is sent to 2011 politicians and others at taxpayer expenseto promote his unannounced candidacy for State Comptroller The proposed mailings were laid out in a recent memorandum to Mr Goldin by one of his political operatives on the city payroll Larry OBrien 37725 special counsel Among 13 proposed mailings are according to the memo a summary of best audits  compendium of newsclips covering highlights of HJGs city comptrollership eg audits crises etc  compendium of excerpts from HJGs better speeches    a traditional campaign brochure    a compendium of clippings regarding recent upstate speeches  a warm personal family biographical sketch with birth notice of the newest Goldin and finally a letter urging a vote for HJG for State Comptroller Presumably some of these blurbs will not be financed by the taxpayers but by a 250aplate small dinner for Jay at the River Club May 8 The hosts according to a letter to potential contributors are four executives of leading brokerage firms  Merrill Lynch Paine Webber Jackson and Curtis Dean Witter Reynolds and Weeden  Cothat underwrite and sell city bonds and notes  Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin one of the leading skeptics on Federal aid for New York City was on the receiving end last week of an inimitable lecture by the gravelvoiced Brooklyn Democratic leader Meade H Esposito Waving a long unlit cigar under Mr Proxmires nose Mr Esposito warned the Senator Dont muck around with New York City Mr Esposito and Vincent F Albano Jr the Manhattan Republican leader cohosted the cocktail party for members of Congress as their contribution to the effort to help the city solve its fiscal problems  The plans of Democratic state chairman Dominic Baranello and other party leaders to make it more difficult for a candidate to get on the state primary ballot will have to wait a year at least Mr Baranello had suggested eliminating or at least tightening up the rule that gave a place on the ballot to any candidate receiving 25 percent of the state committee vote on any ballot at its designating meeting The result has been a multitude of candidates I dont think it would be fair to change the rules in the middle of the game said Mr Baranello referring to the already under way state campaign He didnt say that Governor Careys secretary Robert Morgado had torpedoed the proposal at the behest of the Governor because it would only start an intraparty ruckus at a time when the Governor wanted only unity and bliss on behalf of his reelection
Teen‐Agers Discuss Sexuality in the 70's,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/17/archives/teenagers-discuss-sexuality-in-the-70s-says-both-must-agree.html,ROCHESTER April 15  The program was entitled MAN 78 the acronym signifying Male Adolescent Needs but it might have been more aptly called TeenAgers 78 Its organizers had expected the meeting to take a hard look at the sexual role and responsibilities of young males instead 176 teenagers and their leaders discussed virtually Every aspect of sex from parental disapproval to homosexuality MAN 78 was organized by Planned Parenthood of Rochester and Monroe County as part of a comprehensive program the organization has been conducting with a 102500 grant from the United States Department of Health Education and Welfare intended to help curb the soaring pregnancy rate among teenagers Teenage mothers in this country give birth to art estimated 600000 babies every year with another 300000 undergoing abortion In Monroe County 2319 adolescent pregnancies and 1130 births were recorded for 1976 Many population experts have bell come convinced recently that it is crucial to reach the forgotten partner of pregnancy  the boy  to successfully reverse the trend And although clinics and agencies around the country now offer special services to boys todays conference was considered a pioneering effort The contraceptive will be more fully itilized if both partners agree on it David E Cruthis executive director of the Planned Parenthood branch here said as he watched the young people sign in today at a University of Rochester building It is not difficult to persuade boys that there is something in responsible attitudes for them They are afraid of becoming fathers or catching venereal diseases They are becoming more concerned about acting in a sensitive way than about just scoring  Although attitudes may be changing teenage males are not yet ready to express themselves candidly in public if their participation in the conference was an accurate barometer The total attendance of 176 fell far short of the expected 300 and about half were girls  In addition the diverse nature of the topics on the agenda probably distracted participants from the subject of males or made it difficult to separate their problems out of the broader context of contemporary sex In any case the conference did offer an incisive look into what teenagers are thinking The most provocative segment of the program was Puzzles a presentation by the Family Life Theater a project of the family life division of the New York Medical Colleges department of obstetrics and gynecology In a series of vignettes that showed both humor and pathos and used a good deal of street lingo 14 young actors depicted a variety of teenage problems The situations included those of a girl who finds herself pregnant and her boyfriend unwilling to marry or otherwise support her a motherless daughter who pleads for her fathers attention only to see him leave on vet another business trip a boy whose angry mother has discovered by rummaging in his room that he has had a sexual liaison that he has taken nude photographs of his partner and that he smokes marijuana a boy who lies about his seductions to win the approval of his friends and a girl who feels guilty over a lesbian experiment Afterward the audience was invited to ask questions at first of the theatrical characters then of the actors who had played them and had in fact written the skits The subject of homosexuality what was to be called and how it was to be regarded provoked a heated debate between Perry Ashford in the audience and Lance Sykes on the stage During break they rushed to apologize to one another Dr Sol Gordon the keynote speaker who is professor of child and family studies at Syracuse University and director of the Institute for Family Research and Education generated boos albeit restrained ones when he told the audience I dont think that teenagers under 18 should have sex But he added immediately nobody has ever asked for my permission so all I can really say is at least use birth control That teenagers in this western New York State county as elsewhere are sexually active was evident in the afternoon workshop discussions that covered among other issues dating relationships male liberation decision making in sexuality sex education and sexually transmitted diseases Informal conversations indicated that although opinion was sharply divided teenage boys were indeed beginning to acknowledge their responsibility and girls were beginning to expect it of them But the trend still has a way to go to be universal Andrew McDade 15 said Yes theres been a big change among boys The male partner recognizes that hes part of it If hes going to be involved he should also help prevent pregnancy Because there is more access to pregnancy prevention its easy for boys to get contraceptives And its become easier to discuss it with a girl when youre going to have sex You have to discuss it or its a pretty shallow relationship Roy Levy 15 took a different stance Most boys dont want to take the responsibility he said Once its forced upon them  by getting the girl pregnant  then I think about half of them take the responsibility of seeing to it that she has an abortion or help her have the baby Boys do worry about pregnancy It can mess up their lives too A boy at the afternoon workshop on The Males Role in Family Planning who looked barely old enough to shave said If a girl got pregnant I would blame her If she didnt want to get pregnant she shouldnt have done it A 15yearold girl at the same workshop said afterward that she had had sexual relationships with four boys since she turned 14 Three of the four told me `If you get pregnant it will be because you didnt use birth control or you didnt use it right  she said I think you should both use something she added describing a pregnancy scare that turned out to be a false alarm Aleissia Hill 17 and Wilfred Forbes 21 agreed that both partners ought to be responsible for birth control but they didnt have exactly the same views As Miss Hill saw it If were going to have a relationship we become half of each other If were going to be together in life we have to share everything including the responsibility for birth control Mr Forbes conceded that You should have communication you should discuss birth control But the woman should he more involved with that than the man After all she has the pill to take She never has to cover up her natural feelings The couple have a 16monthold daughter

Carey Campaign Apparatus Is Set A Month Before Bid Will Be Official,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/20/archives/carey-campaign-apparatus-is-set-a-month-before-bid-will-be-official.html,A month before the formal announcement of his candidacy for reelection Governor Carey has most of the apparatus in placehis campaign inner circle his headquarters and even his theme that he has made the tough decisions on threatened municipal bankruptcies budget cuts and the death penalty The Governor has also begun mending fences with Democratic politicians who feel he has ignored the party and with lethnic groups particularly IrishAmericans and Italian Americans who have been angered by his decisions on the death penalty and abortion his abandonment of Mario M Cuomos mayoral canididac last year and his blanket condemnation of the Irish Republican Army as terrorists The man most likely to be his Republican opponent Assemblyman Perry B Duryea Jr of Montauk LI has already signaled that he will emphasize crime heavily in his campaign a topic his aides believe that will appeal to these generally moderate and even conservative ethnic groups David Garth the media specialist wif put the Carey campaign package toguther Essentially it will be threepronged effort The Governor and his secretary Robert Morprado will work out of Mr Careys state offices in Albany and Manhattanmaking heavy use of the advantages of incumbency Mr Garth the principal campaign strategist will be operating out of his Fifth Avenue office which served as in effect the think tank for Mayor Kochs campaign last year and the Governors in 1974 Both were successful comefromlbehind efforts John J Burns the campaign manager  and former Democratic state chairman will work out of the formal campaign headquarters at 2 West 45th Street now largely unoccupied floor that is already serving as the base for Carey fundraising and will expand as the campaign develops The Governors son Donald a Fordham student will serve as Mr Burnss assistant Mr Burns has taken a leave from his parttime 520000 lifetime post on the citys Board of Weter Supply Mr Burns a rue politicivn with few enemiesunlike the Governor has altemiy started sonthing Dcmocratic politicians who feel the Governor has ignored them re will attempt to inspire and coordinate their efforts with the Liberal Party and labor and ethnic groups that will he working for the Governors reelection The GarthMorgadoBurns team will preside over a campaign that has already reached some major decisions including the following The Governor kill he portrayed as a man who made in the words of Mr Garth the tough decisions on the bank ruptcy threats to New York City Yon kers and the Urban Development Corpod ration as well as a fiscal conservative who stabilized soaring state budget and welfare rolls He will also be depicted as a man not afraid to make moral and conscience decisions on such emotional subjects as the death penalty The tough decisions motif was reminiscent of former Mayor Abraham D Beanies unsuccessful campaign theme last year Mr Carey does not intend to get in volved in possible primaries for either State Comptroller or Attorney General although the Governors top advisers would prefer to have Mr Cuomo the Secretary of State on the state ticket to appeal to ItalianAmericans the larg est ethnic group in the state The Governor is prepared to spend at least 35 millionabout 2 million less than in 1974 when he was a relative unknown By the end of next month he should have some 700000 already collected after eliminating this month the 1974 campaign debt which started at more than 2 million Radio and television commercials will account for at least a third of the spending The Carey forces will attempt to box Mr Durvca into the right end of the po litical spectrum as Mr Carey did with then Gov Malcolm Wilson in 1974 Mr Careys budget trimming and tax cutting will be a prime vehicle for attempting to attract moderate voters The Carey campaign will remain in low gear until September unless a virtually unknown Brooklyn Democrat State Sena for Jeremiah B Bloom makes good his threat to challenge the Governors relomination in the September primary Senator Bloom who was an original supporter of Mr Carey four years ago has been angry with Mr Carey ever since he was passed over for Senate minority leader in favor of a then political maverick State Senator Manfred Ohrenstcin of Manhattan A source of pressure on Senator Bloom could be his county leader Meade H Esposito who has had problems himself with the Governor ever since he initially opposed him in 1974 in favor of Howard J Samuels Mr Esposito is now a Carey fan how ever after what he described as a peace cession several months ago at a Manhattan restaurant that had been arranged by two Brooklyn Democrats Harold L Fisher chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Stanley Steingut the Assembly Speaker The campaign inner circle represents a subtantial change from 1974 when Mr Burns was hacking Mr Samuels and Mr Morgado was an obscure state official The key Eiures in that campaign were Mr Garth the late Alex Rose the Liberal Party leader

LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/23/archives/long-island-opinion-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-police-action.html,The Nassau and Suffolk County police departments must love us local citizens We are such a soft touch we allow a secret negotiator to give 3000 raises in base pay I suspect the secret bargain must have been to try to make it up in speeding tickets So now we have half of our police force lurking in 30 mph zones waiting to catch us going 35 mph on the way to work while the other half are sitting in offices processing papers for the traffic courts Then on their overtime they go around and write up the reports from all of us on the robberies arson and vandalism cases that occur after they are home from their 9to5 ticketing stint When are we going to demand answers to the hard questions If we are paying top dollar in the country for police skills why arent these policemen being utilized for the tasks for which they were trained Why not match duty time to crime time Why isnt 80 percent of the police force on duty when statistically 80 percent of the crime occurs between 4 PM and midnight The schools in the district I teach in are broken into with regularity once week and very often numerous times in one week Supposedly the police force knows who these juveniles doing the breakingin are Yet there is no surveillance on these known suspects Maybe the police should be paid according to arrests not traffic tickets to lawabiding citizens At first glance I was impressed by the fact that The Times was reporting on this controversial and important issue [Beyond the Abortion VoteMarch 19] However upon reading further found the article to be not only shallow and less than enlightening but also quite slanted Much space is given to Mrs Robinson and Father Driscoll but very little to proponents of abortion financing The article did not note that less than a majority of Catholics 48 percent and less than a majority of Protestants 44 percent according to The TimesCBS poll are opposed to public financing of abortions Unfortunately after the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortions many righttochoose proponents sat back believing the issue to be closed In Suffolk County it is sincerely believed that the majority of the people are for public financing of abortions and the problem is that these people have not up to this point realized the necessity to speak nut My wife and I found the story A Wild Goose Chase With a Difference by Jacqueline E Thomas [March 19] very warm interesting and educational While we do not feed geese or swans on our grounds we have a large variety of smaller birds that are regular yearround customers In the winter when the going gets rough for them we feed crows as well as gulls This is why we enjoy reading stories about bird life Letters should be addressed to Editor Long Island Weekly News Department The New York Times 229 West 43d Street New York NY 10036 Letters moat include the writers address and telephone number for verification The Times reserves the right to edit and condense all lettdrs
Around the Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/23/archives/around-the-nation-desegregation-aides-role-is-widened-in-cleveland.html,CLEVELAND April 22 APFederal District Judge Frank Battisti has stripped Cleveland school officials of control of several key departments in the school system and placed it in the hands the deputy superintendent for the departMent of desegregation which the judge had established to carry out his ordei that schools be desegregated next fall The school board president Arnold Pinkney said it appeared that all meaningful departments of the board would now be under the control of Dr Charles Leftwich the deputy superintendent in the desegregation department Yesterday the judge directed that the business computer research and development and community relations departments would be under the control of the desegregation department All future desegregation planning will be done only under the direction of Dr Leftwich and his staff Judge Battisti said He also ordered that the Board of Education immediately hire seven people Dr Leftwich has recommended for top administreve posts in the system and that all local state and Federal desegre gation funds be placed in accounts separate from the systems other money A school board member John Gallagher said Im not sure what the role and function of the board and the administration is at this point Mote and more it appears that the Federal court wants to take over the entire system It just doesnt make sense anymore James Hardiman an attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People which started the desegregation action in court said that the board had shown it was either unable or unwilling to carry out desegregation orders SANTA ANA Calif April 22 UPIA jury is to begin deliberations Monday in the murder trial of Dr William B Waddill who is accused of strangling a live baby after an unsuccessful salineabortion The prosecution finished its closing arguments yesterday demanding a verdict of firstdegree murder in the Supet rior Court trial The prosecutor Robert Chatterton said that Dr Waddill stran gled the girl at Westminster Community Hospital because he believed she had suffered brain damage from the salt Solution he injected into the 18yearold mother He was much more concerned with malpractice than the life of a babY on March 2 1977 Mr Chatterton told the jury Dr Waddill has denied that he strangled the infant Judge James K Turner said that he would instruct the jury Monday morning He has said that it could deliver a verdict of first or seconddegree murder or attempted murder Dr Waddill could also be convicted killing the girl if the jury determined that he failed to do everything possible to keep the infant alive after he found she had survived the abortion HONOLULU April 22 APA woman who admitted killing her former husband but who said she did so after numerous beatings has been acquitted of a man slaughter charge by a jury here The

POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/23/archives/long-island-opinion-politics-will-coattails-help-gop-sew-it-up.html,THE coattail theory in politics that a strong run by the top of the ticket helps candidates of the same party at all levels will very likely be thoroughly tested on the Island in November The general assumption of both Republicans and Democratsis that a Long Islincl native son Perry B Duryea of Montauk will be the Republican candi date for Governor and that as a result GOP candidates for Congress and the Legislature on the Island should have an electoral head start on their Democratic opponents This predicted edge could be particularly crucial in Suffolk County where nunincumbent Demoerat will try to retain for the Democratic P4rty the House seat of Otis G Pike who it retiring and where three Assembly members are running in marginal districts Ovvrall the party division in both counties is House of Representatives seats four Democrats and two Republicans State Senate eight Republicans and one Democrat Assembly 13 Republicans and eight Democrats Most of these seats are considered safe for the incumbents except for three Suffolk Democratic Assembly members  Mary Rose McGee of Huntington yaul Harenberg of Bayport and George Hochbrueckner of Coram Mr Harenbergs seat in particular could be in jeopardy for the Democrats because he is considering whether to seek another term He is on leave as department chairman at Bayport High School and his tenure could be endangered if he seek another term in the Legislature  Mrs McGee was first elected two years ago with a fairly healthy 4500vote plurality out of nearly 43000 votes cast while her two colleagues were first selected by narrow margins with Governor Carey in 1974 when he managed the considerable feat of winning both Mts sau and Suffolk normally Republican bastions However not even his best friends expect the Governor to do that well this time and thats the problem for the three legislators There are additional problems in the emotional controversies over the death penalty and Medicaid funds for abortions The three Democrats opposed the death penalty while all Long Island Republicans including Mr Duryea favored it All but two of the Island Democratic legislators Assemblyman Icillo W Bianchi Jr and Lewis J Yevoli voted against the death penalty In addition Governor Carey vetoed the bill so capital punishment can clearly be an issue in the gubernatorial campaign as well as in most of the Islands legislative races The political fallout from the abortionfunds controversy is less evident The vote was along straight party lines among the Islanders in the State Senate with Senator Karen Burstein the lone Democrat favoring Medicaid financing of abortions and Republicans opposing it But in the vote in the Assembly three Republicans including Mr Duryea and six Democrats voted for financing and 10 Republicans and two Democrats against it Mr Duryea possibly under pressure from the Conservative Party switched to oppose Medicaid funding on a second vote As for the marginal districts Mr Hochbrueckner voted against financing of abortions and Mr Harenberg and Mrs McGee in favor The three Democratic legislators have differing views on how they will handle the two issues as well as the Governor in their campaigns for reelection All three conceded that there was little question that the majority of their constituents favored the death penalty Mr Hochbrueckner said he voted against it as a matter of principle and in the belief that it is not a deterrent to crime He said he would trot out his own record and the Governors on anticrime legislation Mr Harenberg said that the death penalty was one of the few questions that has to be decided on conscience and I find that people are reasonable in accepting that Mrs McGee said that she had her own 1  anticrime program including life imprisonment with no parole which she said would provide security for the public The Governor himself could be just as ticklish an issue because it is evident that the Duryea forces are already trying to label him as antiLong Island because of state schoolaid cuts the controversy over Long Island representation on the Tristate Regional Planning Board the performance of the Long Island Rail Road and the release of mental patients into Long Island communities with questionable aftercare Mr Harenberg was the most wary of the Governor I dont think the public will identify me with Carey the Democratic legislator said I dont expect to go overboard in support of him nor will hit him over the head He said that aid to education and the dumping of mental patients on some Long Island communities were troublesome issues for the Governor In contrast Mr Hochbrueckner said that the Governor could win his district and that he could help the Governor by showing as he has done before how state budgets skyrocketed during the Rockfeller administration while Governor Carey has leveled off state spending Carey has done a masterful job of handling the economics Mr Hoch brueckner said Mrs McGee said she would not dissociate herself from the Governor I think he will be a very big winner she added She said he had lowered taxes and kept New York City from flying apart Thats what the Democratic legislators say now But what they say in September and October could be an excellent gauge as to how they and the Governor will do in November If they are hanging onto the Governors coattails it will be strong evidence that he is doing well at least in Suffolk If they act as if they dont know him it will be a signal that Mr Carey has problems  at least in Suffolk

25 Propositions on a 75th Birthday,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/23/archives/25-propositions-on-a-75th-birthday.html,LONDON 1 When mortal men try to live without God they infallibly succumb to megalomania or erotomania or both The raised fist or the raised phallus Nietzsche or D H Lawrence Pascal said this and the contemporary world abundantly bears it out The British writer and social critic Malcolm Muggeridge recently turned 75as good a time as man can imagine unless of course its at 100 to summarize say the 25 most important things one knows Aside front those 25 propositions found below other Muggeridgian wisdom can be found in his twovolume autobiography Citron idles of Wasted Time 2 Life is a drama not a process The Passion of Christa stupendous dramahas enormously enriched our Western civilization spiritually and artistically whereas the theory of evolution which presupposes process at work has swallowed up all human creativity in the quest for knowledge and material prosperity 3 Accumulating knowledge is form of avarice and lends itself to another version of the Midas story This time of a man so avid for knowledge that everything he touches turns to

"The Big Questions - Civil Rights, Vietnam and Nixon - Have Faded",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/23/archives/the-aclu-finds-another-issue-itself.html,More placid times have proven to be be difficult times for the American Civil Liberties Union In the decade of its greatest growth from the early 1960s to the 70s there was no shortage of consuming issues for the organization the civil rights movement the war in Vietnam Richard M Nixon and Watergate In the mood of those days one brochure for recruiting new members began The NixonAgnewMitchell Administration is engaged in a concerted attack on American liberties The aggressiveness paid off The civil liberties union grew in size and influence and its traditional horizon  the defense of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights broadened Then the civil rights movement lost its urgency especially for many whites The war ended President Nixon resigned By 1974 the ACLU which had nearly tripled its membership over 10 years to 275000 found itself without a compelling issue that was also a dramatic rallying point Its leaders have found it hard adjusting to the new climate and this has led to dissension and the resignation of key officials including that last week of its ex ecutive director Aryeh Neier Mr Neiersummed up the difficulties that the organization faces in an annual report that will be distributed next month In 1977 he writes the ACLU was tested by its defense of free speech for the Nazis by misdeeds of some of its former officials by the hostility of the Supreme Court and by a growing anticivil liberties mood in the country Last summer the group was embarrassed by disclosures that some of its officials in the 1950s had fed Information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Its present officials who seized the initiative and made the news public feared that unpleasant repercussions would follow but the adverse effects were mild What the officials had not anticipated was the severe reaction to its defense of American Nazis seeking to march in Skokie Ill a Chicago suburb that has many survivors of Hitlers concentration camps among it s 70000 residents The reaction was so intense that Mr Neier who for several months had been telling associates that he wished to leave postponed the announcement or his resignation until he felt he could declare the situation under control Mr Ncier who officially will leave next fall estimates that nearly 30000 members resigned or did not renew their mem bership as a result of the Nazi controversy To ACLU officials the defense of Nazis was a cutanddried proposition Over its 57 years it routinely had taken on any free speech case in which its help was sought on the principle that free speech denied some ideas jeopardizes all ideas Of the 6000 cases that it handled last year only a few dealt with Nazis However we did a bad job in explaining Skokie says Norman Dorsen a New York University law professor and chairman of the organization What may have been clear as a principle to the groups officials was unsettling to many members a large number whom were Jewish Some of them were attracted to the organization when it was defending antiwar demonstrators and pushing for President Nixons impeachment and Mr Dorsen and Mr Neier believe that more than a few were not adequately informed of what the ACLU stood for So since January the group has distributed 50000 pamphlets describing its purpose with a rundown of Its interests  sexual equality racial justice religious freedom the freedom to control ones body the constitutional rights of students prisoners mental patients service personnel juveniles the elderly and the rights of privacy for all of us As impressive as this list of concerns may be lacks the urgency of a Vietnam war or a Watergate That fact more than disclosures about the FBI or even the Nazis accounts for much of the organize tions decline The group also is stilt involved in many of the new areas developed during the giddy years of expansion Some are far removed from traditional civil liberties concerns Last year for example the organizations South Texas Project won a court case restricting state judges from requiring poor people to pay the cost of their courtappointed lawyers as condition of probation I dont think the ACLU should further extend its reach says Mr Neter who had steered the organization to many of its new interests It must make good on some of the commitments already made But doing that could be hard The organizations leaders sense that the mood in Washington has changed The right of women to obtain abortions was singled out as this years priority because of strong antiabortion actions in Congress The United States Supreme Court has limited the power of Federal courts to deal with civil liberties questions and the Carter Administration has disappointed civil libertarians who had expected a friendlier reception That leaves state courts and legislatures which are more cumbersome to deal with With its 200000 members 75000 fewer than in 1974 and 5000 volunteer lawyers the ACLU has statewide offices and affiliates in nearly 500 cities Often they act autonomously resisting direction from headquarters in New York City Many of the concerns these days go to the core of entire systems  Improving conditions for children for instance  and they require time But the organization has less money and staff to deal with such issues Membership dues payments are down and there less revenue from philanthropic foundations whose contributions had enabled many new programs to be started Last years budget of 77 million was 300000 less than in 1976 Staff members have been laid off others have resigned Melvin L Wulf resigned as legal director last year because he could not get along with Mr Neter and was replaced by Bruce Ennis who had specialized in the rights of mental patients In the Washington office John F Shattuck succeeded Charles Morgan Jr one of the better known civilrights advocates of the 1960s who resigned two years ago after Mr Neier had chastized him for publicly supporting Jimmy Carter for President Thus with Mr Neiers resignation three men who helped guide the ACLU in its period of greatest growth will have left It will be up to Mr Neiers replacement to buttress sagging finances and staff morale harness combative personalities and overcome the fallout from Skokie Torn Goldstein writes on law for The New York Times

Presidential Overtones,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/28/archives/presidential-overtones-in-the-nation.html,HOUSTONHeres how the United States Senate campaign in Texas this year might affect Presidential politics and vice versa Representative Bob Krueger a shrewd and articulate young conservative once the dean of arts and sciences at Duke University is favored to win the Democratic nomination to oppose Republican John Towers bid for a fourth term and Mr Krueger has not concealed his ambition to move on from the Senate to the White House perhaps as soon as 1984 Wormer Republican gubernatorial candidate Hank Grover a devoted Ronald Reagan supporter is running as an independent against Mr Tower who backed Gerald Ford in 1976 If Mr Grover siphons off enough Reagan supporters to defeat Mr Tower or pulls off an upset victory in the third biggest state one of Mr Reagans strongestRepublican prospects for 1980 could be significantly affected Circumstantial evidence suggests that John B Connally Jr the DemocratturnedRepublican who still is a major fundraising force in Texas would shed no tears if John Tower were defeated that would leave Mr Connally as the probable leader of Texas Republicans and to that extent boost his own 1980 Presidential ambitions Some Texas political sources believe for example that a number of substantial contributors to Bob Kruegers primary campaign might not be backing him if Mr Connally had exerted his full influence for Mr Tower Others point out that some of Mr Connallys traditional allies are still owed money from Hank Grovers 1972 gubernatorial campaign but that no real pressure seems to have been brought on Mr Grover to drop his independent candidacy  Mr Grover a gregarious conservative and veteran of legislative service here came within a whisker of winning the governorship in 1972 losing by only 93000 votes out of about 25 million cast He ranks himself after John Tower the best Republican votegetter in Texas and his independent campaign could turn out to be the key w the election He might for one thing he the spoiler who defeats Mr Tower by taking as little as 10 percent of the Republican potential If about 2 million voters turn out in a nonPresidential year Mr Grovera renowned campaigneris a good bet to take at least 200000 of them merely by getting on the ballot That could mean a victory for Bob Krueger and a secret triumph for John Connally Of this possibility Mr Grover remarks cheerfully Towers going to lose anyway no matter what I do With the same degree of confidence he thinks he has a real shot at winning a proposition thats hard to test since independent candidacies have heretofore been unheard of in Texas To understand Mr Grovers strategy however its necessary to understand a Texas registration system which does not demand party identification Registered voters simply choose which party primary they want to vote ineven separate polling places are providedthen vote for whom they please in general elections In 1972 for example only 125000 voters participated in the Republican primary that nominated Hank Grover but that fall he polled nearly 16 million votes against Dolph Briscoe who is running this year for a fourth term In 1974 the Republican primary vote fell below 100000 but more than 400000 Texans voted in the 1976 ReaganFord Presidential primary Mr Grover feared the hardcore Republican vote of about 100000 or so would turn back any primary insurgency against an incumbent Senator But in the general election with three candidates in the race and perhaps 2 million vote turnout he calculates that someone could win with as few as 700000 votes less than half the number he polled in 1972 when he was aided by the Nixon landslide but not at all by John Tower or John Connally As for reports that regular Republican contributors and workers will oppose him as a spoiler Mr Grover says he doesnt doubt it there just arent enough of them to worry about he argues He has a fundraising scheme that he believes will raise upward of a million dollars mostly from Texans who would see a victory for him as the first step toward nominating Mr Reagan for President in 1980 Mr Grover thinks the fact that both Mr Krueger and John Tower have supported Federal funds for abortions is a Texas sleeper issue He believes Mr Tower is ripe for defeat because of his opposition to Ronald Reagan in 1976 what Mr Grover calls his failure to maintain a loyal personal following among Texas voters personal problems that include a recent divorce and what may yet he disclosed as involvement in the Koreagate scandal Finally Mr Grovers venture relies on the belief that Bob Krueger will have to move left in the fall campaign to get out the Democratic votethus leaving Hank Grover and John Tower to tight it out for the conservative vote Ill surprise everybody Mr Grover says chuckling I always do
The Buck Stops There,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/29/archives/the-buck-stops-there.html,ALBANYThe New York State Senate sits in one of the worlds most beautiful rooms Its full graceful proportions its solid but intricate woodwork and its deep red motif harmonize  The Buck Stops There imparting the authority and inspiring the awe we feel in Renaissance rooms of state And there is as well the aura and excitement of power that persist even in the less stately atmosphere of representative government n the 1970s But much of that sense of authority and power slipped away during the SenateAssembly stalemate on Medicaid funding for abortions The Democraticcontrolled Assembly wanted to continue the program the Republicancontrolled Senate opposed it For five days of political deadlock New York State into its new fiscal year had no budgetit was without the money to support local government and was on the brink of urgent state borrowing without a completed fiscal plan In short we had enmeshed the state budget in a religioupt and moral issue that was not negotiable not even debatable As if in confirmation the two citizen sides to the abortion issue confronted eachother literally in the approaches to the chamber forming a gantlet through which we passed each day during the stalemate In the end the Medicaid funds for abortion were retained How did we get to the impasse Without discussing the abortion issue I think the answer involves a new public view of the Legislaturea view that has changed subtly but significantly in my 20 years in the State Senate Put simply the more society has relaxed its own standards of morality as it undeniably has since the 60s the more it has looked to elected officials to provide moral alternatives equal in force and rigidity to those it has discarded Thus the Legislature is called upon not just to debate the abortion issue separately as we would have done 10 or 20 years ago but to lock it into the very budget of government as a kind of moral veto And legislators are judged on other issues such as school financing and nuclear power not by the results of deliberation but upon their moral commitment Under the pressure of purity the Legislature has imposed higher and higher standards on its own conduct and operations over the last 10 years Committee meetings and votes are now totally open to public scrutiny and lobbying pressure Legislative records have become accessible in mountains of computer printouts Ethical standards financial disclosure and election expenditures are regulated in a severe and complex way to the point of incomprehensibility Needless to say the publics attitude toward the Legislature remains sarcastic at best insulting at worst Its not just Watergate The 60s involved a critical attack on the old certainties of home religion and community The void of value has not been filled  people still insist that problems be solved in the nostalgic context of religion ideology and social order The public wants Presidents legislators and mayors to restore the identifiable and clear choices that have been lost But the men and women who legislate from day to day in an atmosphere of rapidly changing standards must still try to serve the traditions] function of representative government by finding areas of acceptable compromise Unfortunately consensus is not enoughit simply dooms the public to a disappointment the more bitter because legislative compromise offers no moral certainty It is only when we are plunged into deep stalemate like the budgetabortion question that the public on both sides of the issue gets its ideological moneys worth The Senate chamber  high and hushedempties as the days business is completed Its wood panels heavy chandeliers huge clocks and deep Tudor fireplaces still reflect the awe and authority of venerated institutions Piles of billsthe focus of all of our energiesremain on our desks after we leave our efforts to continue the legislative process in a conflicted wcrld But that process can only work effectively if it is not judged by standards that the public has discarded for itscf
Campus Vacations: For Body and Mind; A Survey of Campus Vacations That Exercise the Mind and Body; Photographs by Hugh Smyser (top); Robert J. Iz zo Cower left,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/30/archives/campus-vacations-for-body-and-mind-a-survey-of-campus-vacations.html,Last summer while her husband and three children spent their customary vacation week in the mountains Patience Powell of Takoma Wash went back to the University of Washington campus for the first time since shed graduated in 1961 She lived in a dormi tory with a bathroom down the hall ate breakfast in the cafeteria spent much of each day in lectures seminars and discussion groups And she found the week so exhiliarating that she actually seems sorry that a longplanned tour of Europe will prevent her from returning to Seattle this summer Ive been to Acapulco and Honolulu and Las Vegas and I am bored with watching other people lying in the sun Mrs Powell says I wouldnt have missed this for anything A Philadelphia financial analyst Michael Stone alternates his vacations one year a cruise or_ family visit the next year a week at Brown Universitys Summer College In some ways he feels like a student again confronting reading lists debating world issues over beer with friends browsing through the bookstore only now you can afford the books other aspects of university life like coed dormitories require some adjustment For me the big payoff is the people that show up a very stimulating crowd says Mr Stone who is 34 This appeals to the kind of person who watches educational television instead of Laverne  Shirley Travelers interested in adding some intellectual exercise to their vacations have seen their options increase dramatically in the last several years The number of colleges offering noncredit summer programs has multiplied as the interest in continuing education swells A decade ago there were only half a dozen summer colleges this year vacationers can choose among large and small urban and rural schools across the country hear Erik Erikson lecture on the life cycle at Brown or attend seminars on The Church and the Quality of Life at Notre Dame spend their free time kayaking on the Connecticut River near Dartmouth or touring the Capitol with a group from the American University One reason the idea has caught on with colleges is that regular summer sessions for students do not fill all those vacated classrooms and residence halls Luring families onto campus gives the local economy a shot in the arm and provides salaries for faculty and students Cornells very popular fourweek program for example grossed 250000 last year the administrator G Michael McHugh reports The Ithaca Chamber of Commerce is happy about it and so is Buildings and Maintenance the Food Service everybody he exults Moreover with financial pressures making schools even more anxious than usual for the goodwill and support of alumni vacation colleges have proved to be lowkey but effective public relations tools A large proportion of such programs participants are alumni and the administrators hope isthat after week or two of mingling with the faculty attending receptions at the Presidents house and enjoying the campus they will be more inclined to respond to future fundraising campaigns For their part the college vacationers can take advantage of some packagescombining academic sessions sports and recreation a good dose culture and a bit of sightseeingprices that are moderate or sometimes downright cheap Most colleges offer childrens programs so that families can vacation together A number of schools have patterned their programs after the Cornell Alumni University the largest in the countryattracting nearly 900 adults and 400 children last summer At Cornelllike nrograms discussed here it is opennonalumni toostudents enroll for to four weeks between July 9 and Aug5 The major theme this year is freedom and to say that the approach is interdisciplinary is to understate the case A faculty team including a historian an ecologist a psychologist and the chairman of the classics department will lecture and lead discussion groups on societal freedom while during alternate weeks a geneticist a communications professor two lecturers on marriage and a Russianliterature scholar will corcentrate on individual freedm But si udents can instead choose one ofthe four specialized courses offered each week in subjects ranging from Chinese cooking to beginning birdwatching to Moliere While all this is going onand the schedule may leave little time for excur sions to the Corning Glass Center or  state parkschildren aged 3 though 16 have their own agenda Their activities supervised by professiona

vacationing adults at Cornell Mr McHugh learned through a survey were in business and finance education or homemaking with smaller groups of doctors lawyers engineers 49 retir0es and three ministers

Women's Cause Gets a Lift On Pension Plans,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/30/archives/womens-cause-gets-a-lift-on-pension-plans-engineering-free-trade.html,Actuarial penalties may seem small price for women to pay for the privilege of living longer on the average than men but many women have now been relieved of even that burden The Supreme Court ruled last week that an employer whose pension plan charges women more than men is committing illegal sex discrimination The Court voted 6 to 2 that such a plan violated the Civil Rights Act of 1969 which bans discrimination in employment based on sex The majority said the decision did not mean that Congress intended to revolutionize the insurance and pension Industries when it passed the law insurance companies who calculate the cost of retirement plans will still be allowed to take account of different life expectancies and consider the ratio of men to women in work force But the same rate must be charged to all einployees Under the new ruling men will to some extent subsidize womens pensiont Is that fair Associate Justice John Paul Stevens who wrote the majority opinion suggested that better risks always subsidize poorer risks healthy people subsidize unhealthy and so on Nothing more than habit makes one subsidy seem less fair than another he wrote Chief Justice Warren E Burger dissenting along with Associate Justice William H Rehnquist thought it was plenty unfair He called the decisions effect on pension plans revolutionary and discriminatory  this time favorable to women at the expense of men In 1964 the National Society of Professional Engineers adopted a rule forbidding members to discuss costs and fees with prospective clients or to bid competitively against each other The Supreme Court has unanimously sent the engineers back to the marketplace by finding the engineers canon a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 The courts opinion by Justice Stevens allowed that the restriction was something short of actual pricefixing but said no elaborate industry analysis was required to demonstrate its anticompetitive character The decision was in keeping with Court decisions to do away with rules of professional associations that limit competition usually on the ground that lower prices lead to inferior work In 1975 for example the Court abolished minimum fee schedules set by the legal profession and lawyers are no better or worse than before One by one the progressive causes of the late 60s and early 70s are being caught in the snap of a backlash the proposed Equal Rights Amendment liberalized abortion laws school busing and other desegregation measures But few issues inspire greater passion or more quotation whether from the Bible or the Constitution than the matter of homosexual rights Thus it was in a supercharged atmosphere with one side shouting perverts and the other fascists  that voters in St Paul last week repealed a fouryearold city ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of affectional or sex ual preference The emotions in St Paul were familiar Supporters of apeal spoke of morality and protecting children from homosexual teachers  opponents put the question in the context of human rights Either way the arguments have become more insistent since what may be called the Anita Bryant phenomenon led last summer to the repeal of a homosexual rights ordinance in Dade County Miami Fla In the next three weeks voters in Wichita Kati 614 will decide whether to repeal similar ord1hanceS and efforts are under way to put the issue on the ballot in Seattle which has two homosexual rights laws In California an`attempt has begun to put before voters an initiative permitting dismissal of homosexual teachers At least 37 municipalities in the United States have homosexual rights ordinances Oily two Are in the relatively libeial New Wilt region both in college towns Ithaca NY and Alfred NY
"At Yeshiva, Study For Study's Sake",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/30/archives/at-yeshiva-study-for-studys-sake.html,IN an era of vocationalism in higher education Yeshiva University has revived a centuriesold academic designation that will not help a student get a job or earn money It is called tHe chaver program and in the words of Dr Norman Lamm president of the university it is a course of study simply for the sake of study Whatever the reasons for todays extreme preprofessionalism and whether it is justified or not it is squeezing out of the curriculum not just the humanities as subject matter but the whole concept of studying for the pleasure of studying Dr Lamm said Beginning next September the uniVarsity will offer study for the pleasure of study for college graduates who are bound for careers in business medicine law or the behavioral sciences Students accepted to the chaver program will take a oneyear break between college and graduate school for an intensive examination of Jewish studies as they relate to their chosen profession The candidates will have a course of study that will include Talmud Bible and Jewish philosophy  much like the course followed by rabbinical students  but there will be an added component geared to their careers The medical student for example will study the works of Maimonides the 12th entury Talmudist and physician From these and other sources the student will study the Jewish perspective on such issues as abortion euthenasia triage and organ transplants The law student for example will study the shulchan Arukh the 16thcentury code of law compiled by Rabbi Joseph Karo that discusses evidence contracts and torts The goal of the program according to Dr Lamm is to help mold professionals who will see not only a patient or client but a sensitive feeling human being indeed an image of God The chaver program will be offered tuitionfree at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary an affiliate of Yeshiva University The seminary in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan was founded 80 years ago This is the first time that Yeshiva University and probably any American institution is offering the designation of chaver but it is not a new notion The term chaver  literally friend  is designation hundreds of years old that signifies exceptional talmudic scholarly accomplishment Upon the formalization of rabbinic license in Germany and France from the 19th century forward chaver denoted one who attained the status of a scholar but who was not permitted to decide upon matters of Jewish law until he received rabbinic ordination Still the title gained a special place in Jewish society for those who could not or would not reach rabbinic stature Chaverin the plural form  were given special honors in the synagogue and often participated as civic leaders and delegates to various secular councils In Italy of the 16th and 17th centuries chaver was conferred with much pageantry and in some instances a physician would be accorded the title The title however gradually lost its significance throughout Europe and in the 19th century it no longer conveyed a serious reflection of Torah study From then and into modern times the title has generally been accorded on an honorific basis to layorganization and synagogue leaders The chaver concept is being revived by the seminary Dr Lamm said because it is vital that the professional have a solid grounding in Judaic law and thought to serve as the moral foundation of his career and as a guidepost to his practice Under the new program after the year of intensive study the chaver candidate will continue a program of Jewish studies on his own while attending professional school The curriculum will be organized by the student working in conjunction with faculty members at the seminary At the time the student completes graduate school he will return to the seminary for a period of two to four weeks of summation to gain the title chaver The beauty of this new program is in its very inutility Dr Lamm said The curriculum will enhance the students moral sensitivity and deepen his intellectual capacities but it will not mal him more money or get him a promotion He will be giving up a year of his life just for the honor of being a student

HEREDITY INSURANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/30/archives/heredity-insurance-new-and-revolutionary-tests-are-reassuring.html,New and revolutionary tests are reassuring wouldbe parents that they wont pass on certain genetic disorders to their offspring Even though Alvin Brill had directed many other TV shows before one that he did for WTOPTV in Washington DC about five years ago remained particularly vivid in his mind It was a show about a family that had lost a child to a vicious genetic disease called TaySachs The parents had made home movies of this child Brill recalls You could see her deteriorate into a vegeta Maya Pines frequently writes about medicine and psychology for this Magazine ble She was fine until she was about 6 months old but then she began to lose control of her muscles Her head started rolling around She became blind then paralyzed and finally died in an institution at the age of 3 The show pointed out that such suffering can now be avoided since new tests allow doctors to spot carriers of the TaySachs geneand only the offspring of two carriers run any risk of having the disease It also explained that most of the carriers are Jews of Ashkenazi or Eastern European origin When Brill and his wife began to think about having a family their first move was to call up the National TaySachs and Allied Diseases Foundation which is based in New York Shortly afterward they lined up with hundreds of other young couples in the basement of a temple in Silver Spring Md and paid 750 each to have their blood tested for TaySachs From their point of view it was just a precautionsomething they would recommend to all Jewish couples of childbearing age They were flabbergasted when a doctor from the Johns Hopkins Medical School called to inform them that they were both carriers of TaySachs He said that with each pregnancy thered be one chance in four that our child would have TaySachs recalls Ilene Brill But to me that would be like playing Russian roulette with our childrens lives I wouldnt want to bring a child into the world who is doomed to die within three to four years Like the Brills close to a million healthy men and women have submitted to some kind of genetic test in the last decade They have been screened for sickle cell anemia a blood disease Cooleys anemia a more acute blood disease formerly called thalassemia TaySachs and other heredity disorders usually before planning a family Thousands of pregnant women have had their stomachs pierced for samples of amniotic fluid to insure that their babies would be born free from Downs syndrome mongolism Others have had special blood tests to make sure that their fetuses were not suffering from spina bifida a crippling and partly hereditary defect In addition millions of newborns have been tested for such devastating diseases as PKU phenylketonuria the inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine maplesyrupurine disease the inability to break down other amino acids or thyroid deficiency cretinism all of which produce mental retardation unless they are treated in time Although these diseases were considered inevitable only a few years ago now they can be prevented or con Most of these genetic tests are cheap safe and highly cost effective They may represent the greatest advance in health care in a generation Their use has been spreading rapidly though unevenly around the country and with many additional tests expected soon genetic screening is likely to sweep through our healthcare system in the next few years But it is also stirring up a caldron of emotions and controversies about bad genes the right to bear defective children the right to be informed of health risks the role of doctors and government agencies of abortion Even the most successful of all genetic screening programs the one for TaySachs has had its problems Psychologists in Canada found that schoolchildren who learned they carried the TaySachs gene felt depressed and inferior while their classmates who did not have it felt superior saying they would not want to marry anyone who carried this gene Couples who decide to have prenatal Tay Sachs tests sometimes incur the wrath of an older more religious generation My fathers reaction when he first found out that I was going to have the test was that we shouldnt do it because we would be interfering with Gods will says a young woman who took the test anyway and whose child turned Nevertheless TaySachs disease has been largely prevented in the past six years As soon as the blood test for carriers became available in 1971 a small group of parents whose babies were dying or had already died of TaySachs started a drive to screen young couples in the WashingtonBaltimore area Dr Michael Kaback a geneticist who was then at Johns Hopkins had the blood samples processed in his lab with an automatic analyzer donated by the parents group The few carriers who were found to be married to other carriers were warned of the risks they faced but told that they could still bear children in full confidence if they had a sample of the amniotic fluid around the fetus withdrawn for analysis through a technique called amniocente Amniocentesisthat was the worst time for me recalls Ilene Brill The point is you have to wait until you are 15 weeks pregnant before you can do it and all this time you dont want to get too excited about being pregnant I didnt even buy any maternity clothes until I had the test There was no doubt in my mind Id have an abortion if the fetus had TaySachs The test itself wasnt painful but quite scary That needle looks ominousit has to be big to hold all the fluid Just seeing this thing thats about a foot long The doctor points it at you and says Lie perfectly still dont move Its just one sharp prick though not much worse than a blood test Then they give you a BandAid and 20 minutes later you go home But you have to wait two to three weeks for the results was walking around on pins and needles Finally after she learned that all was well she ran out to buy her maternity clothes Before these tests existed couples who had had one child die of a genetic disease generally remained childless they could not risk going through such agony again There was no way I would ever repeat that experience knowingly says Kay Katz who lost a child to TaySachs and is now president of the National TaySachs and Allied Diseases Association Amniocentesis gives such couples the courage to try again so on balance many more children have been born thanks to genetic screening than have been aborted and TaySachs screening has now spread to many parts of the United States as well as to Canada England and South Africa It is a very rare dis ease however only 50 to 60 cases of it occurred in the United States every year before the testing began In most cases of genetic defects parents dont find out that they are at risk until it is too late Obstetricians are notorious for failing to warn patients about the dangers of hereditary disease Many hate to make pregnant women anxious others dont discuss the tests because they object to abortion A recent study of women who were screened for TaySachs showed that only 4 percent came because their physicians had recommended it and even these had had to asktheir doctors about it first  not one doctor had actually suggested the test Several obstetricians are now being sued for malpractice because of such omissions which led to the birth of babies who had TaySachs or other disorders Some children have even sued doctors for giving them wrongful life on the theory that their suffering is so great they should never have been born Last year for instance a New York judge ruled in favor of parents who presented such a claim on behalf of their second child a little girl who died at 3 from a painful inherited disorder called polyscystic kidneys Although their first child had died of the same disease the obstetrician had encouraged them to conceive again andwithout ever bothering to make any testsassured them that their next child would not Each state has different laws about screenine for hereditary diseases but most of the laws are inadequate New York State requires all newborns some preschool children and some couples who apply for marriage licenses to take a variety of genetic tests but then provides no followup services for people who have been found at risk Massachusetts screens for the largest number of disorders including some which can neither be prevented nor treated In Maryland where a citizens commission made all screening voluntary hundreds of newborns have not been tested for PKU despite the ease and harmlessness of the test Mass screening for genetic diseases actually began in the mid1960s when an inexpensive and reliable test was developed for PKU The test offered the first opportunity to prevent mental retardation through diet a special diet that had to be started soon after birth to be effective Within a short time thousands of newborns had their heels pricked to provide a drop of blood for the test By now more than 10 million infants have been screened and about 1000 persons saved from mental retardation While each test costs much less than a dollar the condition is so rare that it has averaged about 50000 to find each case However the failure to spot the defect in time would have led to the need for lifelong care in an institution costing at least five times as much Furthermore it is now possible to test for several genetic diseases simultaneously which vastly reduces the cost for each case The real impact of mass screening has not yet been felt however It will come when the two most widespread genetic diseasessicklecell anemia and cystic fibrosisbecome detectable before birth Sicklecell anemia affects 50000 Americans mostly blacks and more than two million Americans carry the gene for it As with TaySachs car riers can be identified through a blood test But here the resemblance between the two diseases stops for there is not yet any accepted way to tell beforehand whether the child of two carriers will or wont have sicklecell disease Nor is the disease necessarily fatal With each pregnancy the child of two carriers has one chance in four of inheriting a potentially lethal chronic anemia with jaundice severe pains in the abdomen and joints and poor resistance to infection because of a defect in hemoglobin the molecule which carries oxygen in red blood cells As a result of this defect the red blood cells twist into a sickle shape and either clump together obstructing the smaller blood vessels or break down too quickly producing anemia About 5 percent of the children who are born with the disease actually die before the age of 4 But people with mild cases do survive and some lead almost normal lives which puts sicklecell anemia in quite a differ This leaves carrier couples in a quandary Should they deny themselves the right to have a family Should they adopt a child Should they try what is sometimes called halfadoptionartifical insemination Or should they take a chance Initially the black community was enthusiastic about the opportunity to get Federal and state funds to test for this longneglected disease Responding to pressure from politicians black activists and black legislators a dozen states hurriedly passed sicklecell bills between 1970 and 1972 often without any debate Hundreds of programs were set up without sufficient preparation Almost immediately they were engulfed in controversy It seems that many people including doctors confused the sicklecell trait of healthy carriers with sicklecell disease which can strike the offspring of two carriers so that thousands of people were needlessly frightened Thus children who were found to have the trait were often kept out of gym classes for fear that the stress of physical exercise might provoke an attack of the disease Workers in chemical plants were fired from highrisk but highpaying jobs for similar reasons And insurance companies demanded that people with the trait pay higher premiums Some people even thought that the trait was contagious We had a little girl about 11 years old who came to our clinic with her mother recalls Dr Robert F Murray Jr chief of medical genetics at Howard University Medical School She didnt want to touch her mother anymore because shed been told she got the sicklecell gene from her and she confused gene with germ Nowadays when couples find out that both of them have the sicklecell trait they tend to put the whole thing out of their minds says Dr Murray Sometimes they begin by saying they wont have any children but as time goes by the odds start to look betterthree out of fourand they decide to try it at least once Only 20 percent or less will have no children he says The others will decide to take chance Unlike TaySachs sicklecell disease cannot be detected from the fetal cells that float in the amniotic fluid the diagnosis requires fetal blood In the past few years researchers at Yale University and other centers have succeeded in getting samples of such blood with the aid of a fetoscope a slender fiberoptic instrument which allows them to see their target inside the uterus Once the blood sample has been obtained the test is simple and accurate and even though the technique is still in its infancy it looks promising If it becomes safe enough for wider use a large number of black families may decide to take advantage of it leading to a new wave of abortions among black women This would undoubtedly provoke I think thered be a very mixed reaction to such tests in the black community says Dr Murray Im thinking about a young man in my lab who has sicklecell anemia Sure he has pain but hes a delightful person Hes not retarded Hes not deformed He works he contributes he can live a meaningful life Where are we going to draw the line Suppose we find a test for juvenile diabetes should we abort all fetuses that have the disease The full force of this problem may soon hit millions of Americans who had never given it a thought before Just as most black families lived in happy ignorance of sicklecell anemia for generations white families are generally unaware of their risks of bearing a child with cystic fibrosis the commonest genetic disease among AngloSaxons Yet a staggering total of 10 million Americansone in 20 whitesare carriers of this fatal disorder in which the cells of the body produce a very thick tenacious mucus which progressively clogs the lungs and the intestinal tract If two carriers marry their children have one chance in four of inheriting the disease Until a decade ago all children who had cystic fibrosis died before the age of 5 or 6 today many live to their teens though very few reach adulthood They must spend hours daily undergoing bronchial drainage and other intensive therapy and have frequent crises which require hospitali Nothing would cause more shock waves among young white couples than a test to detect carriers of cystic fibrosis This would force millions of young people to face some difficult issues about their responsibilities to the unborn At present there is no way to know who carries the gene for the disease until it is too late and no prenatal test since the basic biochemical defect remains a mystery But if such tests were developed so many people would discover they are carriers of cystic fibrosis that it would suddenly come home to us that we all have four to eight bad genes which under certain circumstances can cause serious trouble says Dr Fred Bergmann director of the genetics program at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences in Bethesda Probably most white couples would want to be tested and then they would have to make Theologians and philosophers have given considerable thought to the quandary of people who run a high risk of bearing children with serious genetic defects In a 1957 encyclical for instance Pope Pius XII went on record in favor of screening for thalassemia a disease which is common among Mediterranean people and in favor of premarital counseling to discourage marriage among carriers One result unfortunately was to brand many young women who had the thalassemia gene as undesirable mates Of course people who practice birth control have other options Paul Ramsey a theologian at Princeton University who favors birth control but opposes abortion recently wrote that we ought not to choose for another the hazards he must bear while choosing at the same time to give him life in which to bear them A further option is now through prenatal diagnosis As with TaySachs abortion may then be the only means of averting much misery Either before pregnancy or before giving birth therefore the carriers of certain genetic defects can make sure they dont pass them on But other genetic defects are not inherited instead they come from accidents during the formation of an egg or sperm For example Downs syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome in each celland there is no way parents can prevent it before conception However anmniocentesis now reveals whether a fetus is affected and gives parents the option of having an abortion Every year 5000 American babies are born with the characteristic facial features and mental retardation of Downs syndrome The defect  formerly called mongolism appears predominantly among the children of older mothers Women over the age of 35 have one chance in 60 of bearing a child with Downs syndrome 10 times more than the average and the odds continue to climb with age reaching one in 20 when the mother is 90 years old or older These risks are exceedingly highfar higher than many women would take knowingly Yet fewer than 5 percent of women over the age of 35 who become pregnant actually take advantage of amniocentesismostly because they are unaware When Dr Theodore Cooper was the assistant secretary for Health two years ago he urged the Public Health Service to spread the word about the safety and usefulness of amniocentesis for older women He also recommended that the Government help pay for the procedure when needed so as to remove any financial barriers to it The Carter Administration however has said nothing about encouraging amniocentesis for older women Congress has stopped Medicaid payments for abortion except where the mothers life is at stake or she risks severe and permanent health damage specifically eliminating all references to the health of the fetus And the righttolife movement has gained strength intimidating many suporters of amniocentesis and abortion As a result amniocentesis remains limited largely to middleclass women those who know enough to ask for it and who can afford to pay the 150 to 300 fee plus 200 to 300 for an examination of the fetal cells plus the cost of an abortion should one prove necessary Poor women over the age of 35 generally do not know that they are at high risknor in many cases do they even see an obstetrician in time to do anything about it for the test must be given between the 15th and 18th weeks of pregnancy to be of any use It is a dismal record since more than half of the 5000 children who are born with Downs syndrome every year are the offspring of mothers over the age of 35 and the poor are the least able Many of these problems could be eliminated overnight if doctors could do a prenatal diagnosis from a few drops of the pregnant womans blood Such diagnosis is already possible for spina bifida a crippling condition particularly prevalent in Ireland and anencephaly lack of the major portion of the brain Both are revealed by high levels of a protein alphafetoprotein or AFP which leaks from the malformed fetus into the mothers blood AFP tests have become standard procedures in England where obstetricians administer them to their patients in early pregnancy but few American women have access to them As tests for various genetic diseases proliferate it is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with them one by one It is equally difficult to decide whether genetic screening should be compulsory as are some premarital tests for VD or voluntary who should be screened for what and at what age who should pay for the tests and who should be responsible for their administration When faced with these questions in 1973 the state of Maryland found an original solution It set up an independent citizens group the Maryland Commission on Hereditary Disorders not merely to give advice but to make all the important decisions about the states genetic screening and to write the appropriate regulations The commissioners knew that even though Federal money was available for sicklecell screening tests for other genetic diseases were not equally funded It was time to get out of the diseaseofthemonth club concluded a Johns Hopkins geneticist Dr Neil A Holtzman H the blacks had their disease the Jews had their disease the Italians had their disease and each was handled separately one community was going to be pitted against another bethere unlimited resources he said And he emphasized that people need protection from inadequate or inappropriate screening Partly through his influence Marylands citizens commission was set up For the first time decisionmaking authority moved from the health profession to people in the community noted Dr Holtzman with satisfaction Only four of the 11 commissioners including Dr Holtzman are physicians the others include housewives and lawyers Moving slowly but carefully the group studies each genetic test and insists on proper followups And its meetings are open to the public At a recent meeting in the woodpaneled conference room of the Governors office in Baltimore members of the commission received the happy news that a pilot program they had approved only last yearto test newborns for thyroid deficiencyhad already saved four children from mental retardation Using the drop of blood thats taken for PKU screening these tests cost the health department only 50 cents extra per infant the cost of the medicine was negligible and there was no known risk in the treatment Nevertheless the commissions advisory committee reported certain essential followup tests had not been carried out and decided that a new procedure would have to be developed before the thyroid tests moved out of We really are hammering out how policy on these issues should be made says Dr Holtzman We want to start out with having something to offer We insist on getting informed consent from everyone even for PKU tests And our definition of screening includes a lot of education and counseling We dont want to make women so worried about genetic defects that they will be afraid to have any children all Its a hard balance to find and each new genetic test brings its own problems But certainly a unified approach to genetic screening helps to keep each test in perspective Marylands approach has now been copied by the state of California The Federal Government has followed suit with a 4 million appropriation under the National Genetic Diseases Act of 1976 for a coordinated program of testing counseling and education for all genetic diseases As scientists develop ever more links between our genes and our health such programs are to 
Counseling Teen‐Agers on Contraception,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/30/archives/long-island-weekly-counseling-teenagers-on-contraception.html,EAST MEADOW THE mother was insistent She had reason to believe that her teenage son and his girlfriend were sexually active and she wanted them to go to the Adolescent Clinic run by the Nassau County Family Planning Project at Nassau County Medical Center here for help That was unusual said Janet Doig the medical social worker at the clinic Weve had only a handful of cases where the parents become involved either calling for appointments or coming in with the kids Generally the girls come in alone although many times they show up with their partners Not just for moral support either The boys sit through the rap sessions and films and confer with the girls on what would be the best method for them The clinic has been in operation since February under a grant of 50000 from the Department of Health Education and Welfare Suffolk County also received 92000 from HEW and opened its first adolescent facility in Wyandanch last week It answers what William G Theyskins administrative director of the medical centers division of family planning called a definite need Nassau has the highest pregnancy rate for ages 10 to 19 in the state outside New York City which indicated he said that special attention had to be paid to teenagers Since April of 77 when a court decision held that underage girls could be given birthcontrol advice without parental consent he said we have been providing this confidential service here and at various planning clinics run by the Department of Health But we felt that adolescents needed different treatment a nonjudgmental approach provided by professionals specially trained to be sensitive to these young people We felt that by offering them their own facility with contact only with their peers and by emphasizing the confidential nature of the service we could reduce the number of teenage pregnancies  and thus the number of teenage abortions in the county The confidential nature of the clinic is paramount according to the administrators Suffolk County which gives birthcontrol information to teenagers at the 10 familyplanning sites operated by the County Health Department does not ask parents for consent or advise them that their children are receiving aid Although we dont ask the kids if their parents know they are sexually ac tive Mrs Doig said from our rap sessions we get the feeling that in the vast majority of cases the parents are not aware But its possible that parents just dont want to admit it to themselves So we have no way of knowing how many would object to our service or how many are actually saying Thank goodness to themselves We did have one case however where the mother found her daughters pills and threw them out warning her to stop fooling around The next visit the girl came in pregnant In its first two months operating with a threehour session once a week the clinic has seen almost 50 girls several as young as 13 but most between the ages of 15 and 17 Though ppen to boys as well the clinic has not attracted them except when they accompany a partner Contraception the observers say seems to be considered a female responsibility among the young Charges for services at the East Meadow site  where 90 percent of the clientele has been white middleclass its administrators say  are on a sliding scale but usually are free since few of the youngsters are wageearners In Suffolk there is no charge at all The procedure for visiting the East Meadow clinic is simple An appointment must be made in advance  there is currently a waiting list of about two months and a second day will be added at the now onceweekly clinic within the next six weeks When the girl comes in she is met at the reception desk by `We dont get into values Thats not why we are here to be judgmental We only discuss objective facts young woman geared to working with young people who asks her to till out demographic form This can get sticky at times said Sarah Sabin assistant administrator of the project because frequently the girls wont  are unable to  give us a phone number Since we need one in case we have to advise them about tests or remind them about followup appointments we will take the number of a trusted friend or arrange some kind of signal to have them call us back Gathered together in small groups Mrs Doig said the youngsters then attend a discussion session led by a health educator a social worker and a family planning counselor in which they try to get an idea of where theyre at Most have been sexually active for while and have come to us during an ongoing relationship Mrs Doig said Theyre not promiscuous Generally its one partner at a time The discussion sessions are informational discussing the reproductive system and outlining various methods of birth control Films supplement the talk We dont get into values Mrs Doig said Thats not why we are here to be judgmental We only discuss objective facts The informational section is followed by a meeting with a nurse who takes the girls medical history and a complete gynecological examination by a physician The nurse then takes over again counseling the girl on the method Until recent reports became public calling its safety into question the pill was the dominant choice Today more adolescents are inquiring about diaphragms though most still choose the pill Girls chosing the pill are given an appointment in six weeks at which time they are given a sixmonth supply Those

LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/30/archives/long-island-weekly-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-on-voting-and.html,I infer from Helen Barabinos letter [April 16] that Catholics should not vote according to their religious beliefs  indeed that they should be legally restrained from doing so Perhaps in order to totally satisfy her Catholics should be forbidden to hold public office Of course Catholics are not the only people who have religious convictions and sometimes vote them Would it not then be even safer to withhold such office from anyone having any religion whatever Little Neck STEPHANIE S CORDES Dillon Supported On Staff Dismissals District Attorney Denis Dillon of Nassau County made another difficult but commendable choice in dismissing six assistant district attorneys for smoking marijuana Although Mr Dillon has supported the decriminalization of marijuana and has close personal relationships with his employees he had the courage to support the integrity of the criminaljustice system Consistent with his other decisions such as hiring assistant district attorneys on merit not politics Mr Dillon is determined to make decisions in the public interest This is not to say that the laws against possession of marijuana are rational But if anyone must respect the irrational laws of this state it must be the prosecutors who enforce them Almost every young person sympathizes with the assistants who were dismissed but Denis Dillon cannot be criticized for his determined effort to allow people to have confidence in their own govern ment Hempstead JON BRAMNICK I was surprised and disappointed to see one of the most bigoted chauvinistic articles I have ever read in the April Long Island Weekly I am referring to At Home Au Revoir Au Pair Despair by Anatole Broyard From the point where he writes it even crossed my mind that Iphigene the ati pair girl in the immemorial tradition of Colette might seduce my son  I started having suspicions which turned to disgust on finding out his son was 4 at the time which were confirmed by such statements as for one thing I could not understand a word of her English she was French after all nor could she grasp my French which was whose fault  after all he had spent two summers in France And then when she acts in a perfectly normal manner for an 18yearold girl in a strange home he complains that she showed an almost paranoid fear of exposure pulling her drapes locking the bathroom door as well as her bedroom and traveling the 10 feet between these two doors swathed in a thick floor length highcollared bathrobe He had probably expected lacy lingerie and innocent exposures Of course he did try to get along with her but obviously it was impossible because they didnt even have any basis for conversation after all she hadnt read the same French books seen the same films or even visited the same restaurants She either should have had the same interests obviously or maybe a list of what he wanted her to have read and seen before she came here The whole article was on that level and New Yorkers are supposed to be so sophisticated I believe there are still narrowminded people like that around but I cannot understand why you would print something like this which gives the appearance that at least some sections of The New York Times are bogged down in the Middle Dark Ages Roosevelt Island A MIYAZAKI
POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/30/archives/long-island-weekly-politics-john-lindsay-candidate-maybe.html,WHEN John V Lindsay travels to Kings Park to make a speech hes running for something other than a Long Island Rail Road train even if he doesnt say so The former Mayors latest signal of his interest in the 1980 Democratic nomination to the United States Senate seat of Jacob K Javits was a speech one evening last week before about 150 members  double the usual crowd  of the Smithtown Democratic Committee at a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Kings Park Mr Lindsays prime contact with Smithtown is Patrick Vecchio his former police security officer and the new Democratic Supervisor of Smithtown Mr Lindsay acknowledged the rumors of his Senate ambitions right at the start of his 40minute talk He said his answer to them was yes and no He said that when its yes its because you get sore about certain things you see going on Sounding very much like politician out of office he referred to so much mediocrity at so many levels of government and a lack of leadership in government But he added that his answer on his prospective candidacy right now was a flat no However he quickly opened an escape hatch for that disclaimer by declaring Thats not to say that a year and a half from now I wouldnt change my mind Everything else Mr Lindsay said added up to at least an attempt to test his appeal and to open the option of a run for the Senate According to some of his friends he sees the contest as an opportunity to vindicate himself and rehabilitate his reputation `Now no but thats not to say I wouldnt change my mind In any event he was homey like a candidate  often talking about his wife and kids and relating to the Long Island audience by frequent references to Mr Vecchio Mr Lindsays childhood summers in Oyster Bay and his newly purchased weekend retreat in Bridgehampton  the first time in our lives where there is a plot of green grass With his audience sitting at tables set up for another evenings bingo session Mr Lindsay devoted most of his talk to a rambling discourse on New Yorks high taxes and energy costs which discourage business  the need to equalize taxes within the Northeast region without any specifics and the danger of citizens revolt against high property taxes The problems were presented but with few solutions other than a generally conservative pitch for lower taxes  a far cry from Mr Lindsays earlier reputation as a liberal big spender There was only a fleeting reference to New York Citys problems and no mention of citysuburb relations subjects on which the former Mayor is presumably expert but that might trigger strong reactions and critiques of his stewardship as Mayor Indeed he barely mentioned his eight years in City Hall Mr Lindsay steered well clear of any current controversial subjects  the death penalty abortion the Mideast the neutron bomb or energy consumption Presumably he feels he should not make any enemies at this point He broadly hinted at his political ambitions when he referred  like an old fighter reliving his best fights  to his initial squeak capture of the Republican nomination for Congress in the Silk Stocking district 20 years ago and his massive plurality in the 1964 Congressional election when he said he rolled up the highest majority of any member of the House Perhaps significantly he criticized the members of the New York delegation to the Senate and House  a delegation he presumably would like to join for assertedly failing to get ahold of themselves and start uniting for the benefit of New York Mr Lindsay was not interrupted once by applause during his 40 minutes and only three questions were asked in questionandanswer period He was only politely applauded before and after his speech Yet he had drawn a crowd But several politicians in the audience noted that politicians with celebrity appeal such as Bella Abzug and Mr Lindsay often had difficulty translating this appeal and audience curiosity into enthusiasm and support Mr Lindsay obviously has his work cut out for him in the next two years if he does want to be United States Senator from New York  Sandy Huffaker
Anderson Apparently Weathering Storm Over Medicaid Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/01/archives/anderson-apparently-weathering-storm-over-medicaid-abortions-albany.html,ALBANY April 28The battle over Medicaidfinanced abortions rocked the State Legislature early this month shaking the leadership of Warren M Anderson the Senate majority leader who was dramatically rebuffed by his fellow Republicans in a the eve of the passage of the state budget Although tempestuous showdown on Mr Anderson eventually persuaded his colleagues to stop holding the budget hostage over the issue many legislators questioned whether the episode would shatter his ability to lead for the rest of the year That was a few weeks ago of course and it now appears that time really does heal many wounds in Albany I think his leadership was strengthened not weakened said a partisan of the Binghamton Senator whose views were nonetheless echoed by other more objective observers At first Mr Anderson had been so badly bruised that his two chief parliamentary foes  Senators James H Donovan of Chadwicks and John D Caemmerer of East Williston LIcould be seen celebrating after their initial victory joking about which one of them would be the new majority leader and which would be his counsel Mr Caemmerers opposition had sharp edge because he is allied with the Nassau County Republican organization which these days is working hard for Mr Andersons rival for the gubernatorial nomination Perry B Duryea of Montauk LI the Assembly minority leader But eventually Mr Anderson did win persuading most Republicans to vote with him on a key motion that Mr Caemmerer argued for in heated sarcastic tones Afterward Mr Caemmerer dismissed any talk that he wanted to replace Mr Anderson as majority leader next year If he wants to run hell have my full support he said Mr Caemmerer lost in the end because Republicans felt they had to rally around their leader or watch their power eroded by disunity But the episode may well have positioned Mr Caemmerer for a shot at Mr Andersons job should Mr Anderson retire from the Senate this year Mr Andersons gubernatorial campaign is viewed as all but moribund and his aides say he has not faced the decision whether to seek reelection in the Senate By contrast Mr Duryeas campaign got a lift last week from a poll taken by the Civil Service Employees Association showing him ahead of Governor Carey whose candidacy for reelection is expected within two weeks With Mr Duryea thus poised to leave the Assembly even if he loses in his bid for Governor there should be a fair amount of scrambling to succeed him as party leader there The leading candidate is thought to be Dominick L DiCarlo of Brooklyn a fiery orator whose main disadvan tage is that he comes from New York City which is not exactly considered a Republican power base Another possibility is James L Emery of Geneseo who is running Mr Duryeas gubernatorial campaign but who suffered If the new leader comes from Long Island which some say is likely the most probable candidates would be John J Flanagan of Huntington or Joseph M Reilly of Glen Cove  As he himself is trying to forget Senator Roy M Goodman the Manhattan Republican ran for Mayor last November and got a whopping 4 percent of the vote But he might have got even less if some residents of Manhattans West Side had heard him describe their neighborhood during a debate over the Westway recently There is no point of the world and I have seen a great deal of it which festers more than that area Mr Gooch man said arguing that the giant highway would rejuvenate the West Side It is the quintessential disgrace of the planet there is nothing worse It is revolting it is absolutely disgusting At another point he catalogued the neighborhoods rot the disgusting smelleriferous rot with the prostitutes and pimps and the bums and the lice and the cockroaches and the filth and the decay and the decadence and the lousiness and the atrociousness Paint of personal privilege shouted Senator Manfred Ohrenstein a Manhattan Democrat interrupting Mr Goodman You are talking about the place I call my home

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/03/archives/letters-how-not-to-unite-the-koreas-of-birching-and-human-rights.html,To the Editor I wish to comment on Prof Gregory Hendersons recent OpEd article Toward Korean Peace Professor Henderson is saying in effect that since North Korea refuses to talk to the South Koreans the US should talk to North Korea initiate trade and cultural contacts and force the North Koreans to talk to the South Koreans by tying the withdrawal of US troops to the resumption of NorthSouth talks Professor Hendersons intention to bring the North and South Korean Governments together is a lofty one But what happens to South Korea while the US and North Korea are engaged in the long process of contact I believe he meant negotiations and engage in trade and other contacts Suppose the agreements reached between the US and North Korea are unacceptable to South Korea Suppose North Korea still refuses to engage in talks with South Korea even after the US and North Korea normalize their relations Would South Korea be content with the developments reduce arms budgets and work toward peace Would such a situation serve to restore democracy in South Korea and defuse the heightened tension I think not Professor Henderson also argues that the US is headed not for parity but for superiority for South Korea in arms Every document I have read reports that the North Korean air force and navy are superior to those of South Korea and that only in combination with the US forces in Korea does South Korea maintain parity with the North As I understand it the current budget for military aid is to augment South Koreas weaknesses visvis North Koreas military buildup This is a matter I am sure that will receive the careful scrutiny of Secretary Brown as well as those in Congress I certainly would not jump to conclusions on the basis of a rhetorical statement of a government leader or on the basis of published budgetary figures An arms race of course should not take place But arms reduction requires a political atmosphere A strong united but neutralized Korea the goal Professor Henderson seeks cannot be established unless both Koreas commit themselves to live in peace for the time being and start the painful but necessary process of bilateral negotiations and contacts The initial round of talks in 1972 failed partly because both sides started with inflated hopes Nov is the time for both sides to recognize the situation for what it is and start to lay cornerstones one by one Allies on both sides can contribute to the cause of peace and eventual unification of Korea by bringing about an atmosphere of peace and by encouraging both sides to enin bilateral To the Editor The ordering of priorities of the European Court of Human Rights makes a travesty of serious concerns for improvement of the condition of peoples throughout the world Its formal trial and condemnation of the innocuous Isle of Man [news story April 26] for applying the branches of birch to the posteriors of youthful male offenders convicted of crimes of violence ignores the serious questions of human degradation and genocide practiced by totalitarian regimes No doubt the tiny island maintained the paddling in lieu of confinement as an accepted community standard else they would have done away with it And who would disagree that the three swatsthough painful for a momentmay be a far less painful administration of justice in the long run when compared with the handling of juvenile cases elsewhere in the European community Birching as corporal punishment is certainly no miniholocaust and is an unworthy target of the European tribunal when the pages of The Times report daily the sufferings of the persecuted in dictator states Great Britain and the Isle of Man should throw the decision back to the European Court of Human Rights with a demand that the continent first put its own house in order and face up to the real priorities of the human rights move ment  To the Editor Instead of waxing indignant over three strokes of the birch in the Isle of Man a sentence that would have been scoffed at by any English schoolboy of my own generation human rights courts might consider the new third world where something akin to whipping actually exists and is not a matter of choice Both Nigeria and Uganda employ it the former at roadside for traffic offenders Pakistan administers the cane to rapists in public sports arenas to the cheers of assembled schoolchildren and doesnt worry overmuch about the culprits mental anguish beforehand either From Jamaica to Guyana strokes are ordered by local magistrates generally for violent assault against women as the axBritish Caribbean island restores what the liberal colonists outlawed Perhaps in this as in other matters our black brothers know best To the Editor CBS tackled one of the most controversial issues since Dred Scott when it presented Bill Moyerss report on The Politics of Abortion on April 22 The program underscored the inadequacy of treating a complex topic in one short hour less of course commercial interruptions I suppose it is fair to assume Mr Moyerss endoftheprogram summary which seemed to accept the proposition that prolifers seek to impose their peculiar religious beliefs upon a secular society was dictated by the necessarily superficial exploration of the issues The scenes of violence at abortion clinics marchers and sitins were certainly interesting but the enormously important philosophical and legal issues were heavily tilted against the prolife forces For example an interview with an abortion clinic operator evoked the comment that you cant legislate morality accompanied by his citation of Prohibition as a sorry example of the last time Congress tried it I expected Mr Moyers to ask him what he thought the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was all aboutwhether the clergy marching at Selma or the boycott of lettuce and grapes were in violation of the First Amendment  Why didnt anyone ask whether the Abolitionists who fought slavery were illegally trying to impose their theology on the nation Arent moral perceptions contained in our countrys founding documents  All men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with cer tain inalienable rights  Does this language violate the wall of separation between church and state What basis supports President Car ters global human rights crusade if not a moral view of the dignity of all men everywhere It is unscientific nonsense to deny the fact that the beginning of human life is a biological question The Fifth Commandment tells us Thou shalt not kill but biology rather than theology teaches that fetus is human life Even Planned Parenthood literature used to admit this fact The medical testimony in support of this is vast and overwhelming For all its effort CBS failed to reach the bottom line which most simply stated is To deny a voice and vote to those who seek to infuse moral values into our laws is to leave naked force as the sole arbiter between right and wrong Did we learn nothing from the Holocaust To the Editor Believe me President Carter has more to worry about than the threemartini lunch Nowadays busy business people must schedule meetings before the 9to5 workday starts Its happening everywhere the threesausage breakfast To the Editor Current criticism of President Carter claims he has yet to show himself leader Traditionally leaders head crusades and crusades rally haters The trouble with Jimmy Carter is his incapacity or unwillingness to incite some of us to hate others He doesnt set Democrats against Republicans business against labor poor against rich blacks against whites Arabs against Jews nonCommunists against Communists It Is ironic that these failures are seen as Carters weakness Almost everyone seems disappointed that he believes in practicing Christianity in politics as well as in personal life It will be an interesting commentary on our nation if he turns out to be our President for only one term To the Editor I am not surprised at the naivet of Shihtsin Tungs proposed plan letter April 22 for a move toward united China but I am surprised at the naivete of your editorial judgment in giving his letter such prominence Mr Tungs idea is long on idealism short on reality His utopian scheme of creating a state of mutual recognition of the two regimes and their coexistence for a specified period of time can hardly be accepted by either Peking or Taiwan Furthermore why would Peking 29 years in power and secure in her grip of the land and the people want to submit to plebiscite supervised by the United Nations And why would she proud of her independence and her achievement of selfreliance want to yield to US insistence on making this plan work Indeed in Mr Tungs own words who wants to ones own bead To the Editor Aside from the masstransit money the highly touted gift from Westway planners seems to be the waterfront development they offer As an attentive if young student of history bet that  Suddenly there wont be any money for building construction  Any buildings that are built will be renting on a par with conventional luxury construction  The planned parks will never be built as designed  Whatever parks are built will actually lessen waterfront access in comparison to the existing conditions If we want to revitalize the West Side industrial district lets run light rail rapid transit from Columbus Circle down 11th Avenue over to Madison Square and extend the 42d Street Queensborough line and the 14th Street Canarsie lines over to the river Then private investment can take over as it did on the Upper West Side after construction of the Ninth Avenue El 1880 and the Broadway IRT 1904 What disturbs me most about the Westway plan is its implicit contempt for the fringe areas it attempts to obliterate to my mind the same thinking that perceives wilderness areas as wasted space If we ever remove all our edges we are going to find ourselves with no center either To the Editor I read with interest and some amusement Andrew J Biemillers letter dealing with Labor Law Reform April 21 While we can all appreciate the need for good employee working conditions it appears that Mr Biemillers reference to the abuse of law and order by management is extremely narrow in viewpoint Was Mr Biemiller out of this country when we witnessed the complete disregard of a legally issued injunction during the recent coal miners strike as well as repeated violations of New Yorks Taylor Law provision over past years His statement that business like citizens should obey the law apparently does not to his mind apply to his constituency

groundless but added that movie audiences were not getting enough information through the letters G PG R and X In particular the subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee felt the ratings board should explain to the public the reasons for its PGs and Rs the two categories that blur into each other While we found no evidence of discrimination said Representative Marty Russo Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the committee we did find that there was a great deal of confusion about how the system works The big question remainswhy cant the raters explain their ratings They already do when they fill out cards listing their reaction to a certain film at the original rating screening Why are they unable to make this information public It seems so simple to do responded Jack Valenti who left his job as special assistant to President Johnson to become president of the association in 1966 We could make it RV for violence RS for sex RL for language But how much more would that tell you What kind of violence How much sex Are there a few unacceptable words or is the picture full of them Or perhaps we could give a oneline description Six months ago we took 100 pctures and tried to devise oneline reasons for each rating But describing why becomes pejorative That scene where a cop hits someone in the stomach with a nightstick may only take up 30 seconds in the film Mr Valentis soiution is to leave such descriptions to the press Ive often suggested that the critic is the most objective viewer Parents Magazine and the Catholic Newsletter tell their readers why a film is rated PG So do about a dozen newspapers including The New York Times Publicly at least employees and former employees of both the association and the rating board echoed Mr Valenti Privately some hint that giving more information might not be as complicated as Mr Valenti thinks The chairman of the classifications and rating commiittee of the National Association of Theater Owners Bernie Diamond has a gut reaction there should be more information He suggests that the reason for the rating could be made available to the theater operators via the press book and they could then give the information to any patrons who asked for it A sampling or motion picture executives finds them cautiously favorable toward the idea of giving more information  or cautiously unfavorable The strongest statement for leaving things as they are came from Daniel Melnick head of production at Columbia who said that basically Im opposed to anything that reinforces any bureaucracy and the rating board is a bureaucracy Richard Zanuck head of ZanuckBrown Productions is all for disseminating information and yet my instinct tells me that keeping it general is better Michael Eisner president of Paramount thinks it would be unwieldy to define the reasons Mike Medavoy head of production at Orion would favor some form of public knowledge as to what the R meansin simple terms And Alan Ladd Jr president of 20th CenturyFox wouldnt object to the raters reasons being available at the theater box office if its feasible One senses in many interviews with association members the residual caution of someone who has already been burned To understand this dont rock the boat attitude one must see Hollywood as it has always seen itselfa fragile maiden with the slavering wolf of Government censorship chained only a few feet away Hollywood has been combating outside censorship for more than 70 years Because movies started as cheap and not quite respectable amusement for the lower classes the Establishment was critical of them as early as 1907 when Chicago passed a censorship ordinance By the mid1930s the Catholic Legion of Decency Was able to boycott successfully theaters that played pictures of which it disapproved In selfdefense Hollywood in 1930 instituted its own production code which required moviemakers to submit books before they became scripts scripts before they became films and films before they were released Among other things the Production Code proscribed lustful and openmouthed kissing drug addiction the use of impure love as a subject for comedy law enforcement officers dying at the hands of criminals onscreen any identification of a brothel and the use of the words ehippie pansy SOB alley cat abortion nerts hell damn fanny and cat The system worked well until Otto Prerninger refused to remove the words professional virgin from his film The Moen Is Blue in 1953 The picture went out without a production code seal and made money Cardinal Spellman made it an occasion of sin to see the picture said Arthur Krim who was chairman of United Artists that released The Moon Is Blue He referred to the then Archbishop of New York Francis Cardinal Spellman He stood in front of theaters in New York Unfortunately he didnt stand in front of theaters in Europe so the picture didnt do very well there Mr Krims joke is part of the basic truth that American morals had begun to loosen up At about the same time the studios were forced to sell off their theaters by the Justice Department They no longer had any way of keeping pictures out of the marketplace The Production Code was amended stretched reinterpreted and finally abandoned Although the current rating system tries very hard to stay on bland middle groundWe are not censors we are not concerned with what adults see we only give guidelines to parentsit is perceived as heir to many of the sins of its father Robert Radnitz an independent producer Sounder calls it an unacceptable form of censorship while a group of Middle Western theater owners has  censured Mr Heffner for giving a PG rating to Mr Radnitzs current film A Hero Aint Nothin but a Sandwich The theater owners feel that any film like this one with a fourletter synonym for sexual intercourse should be restricted New Wests film critic Stephen Farber who spent six months as a member of the ratings board worries that the board offers precensorship because during his tenure it often looked at scripts and gave guidance as to possible ratings Ed Sands president of EMI Films is unhappy because under the chairmanship of Mr Heffner the board refuses to look at scripts For independent producers what rating you get Is crucial in an economic sense The rating administration used to be more free with their advice EMLs new film Convoy directed by Sam Peckinpah received an R rating last week But our deal with United Artists said the picture must bear a PG rating Convoys R was based on the only strict rule followed by the boardthat certain sexually tinged words get an automatic R rating That automatic R can be reversed on appeal All the Presidents Men was the first film to have its automatic R repealed Since then The Front Small Change The Last Tycoon Looking Up A Bridge Too Far A Hero Aint Nothin but a Sandwich The Grateful Dead and The Last Waltz have been reclassified Since Convoys R was based on one joking expletive EMI intends to cut the offending word rather than go through the appeals process Beyond the automatic language rule there is only the subjective judgment of the four middleaged men and the three young women who constitute the current ratings board Under the chairmanship of psychiatrist Aaron Stern the board tended to count nipples There is a perhaps apochryphal story attributed to Jack Nicholson that if you see a nipple then its an X But if someone comes along and cuts it off then its an R Under Mr Heffner who became chairman in 1974 violence is treated harshly Violence that was once comfortably ensconced in a PG is now an R says Mr Heffner He speaks of a new climate of opinion of a sensitization lo violence on the part of parents But the philosophy and sophistication of the members of the rating board also play a part in the ratings and it is obvious that Mr Heffner a Rutgers University professor who was trained as a historian has little fear of nudity and a relatively low tolerance for violence Barry Lyndon and Lies My Father Told Me had the kind of nudity that had always automatically gotten an R he said But we felt that in the context of these pictures parents wouldnt feel their brief nudity deserved R The board rates an average of 400 to 500 pictures a year For the rating service the maker of each film pays a fee based on the cost of his film and the size of his company The fee ranges from 8000 to 800 but it is occasionally reduced to 50 if a film maker has run out of money In 1977 378 films were rated The G ratingsuitable for general audience  was given to 45 PG to 149 R to 160 and X to 24 The PG was applied to among others Brigitte Bardots And God Created Womana steamingly sexy movie when it was first released in 1956 If any changes come in the rating system they will come slowly and softly creeping in the back door But at least one change is on the horizon Mr Heffner has shaken up the rating board by putting an end date on the terms of each of its members 111C51 of whom have been on the board for more than six years In the future there will be a sixmonth trial period followed by a maximum term of three years We are trying in our ratingS to represent a changing parental pcpulation Mr Heffner says Thus it makes sense to make changes in the composition of the board And there has been some very preliminary conversation about refining the PG rating by dividing it into a 12andunder category and another category for children
Excerpts From Debate of Three Rivals for Democratic Nomination for U.S. Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/03/archives/new-jersey-pages-excepts-from-debate-of-three-rivals-for-democratic.html,Following are excerpts from a debate at The New York Times among the three candidates for the Democratic nomination for United States Senator from New JerseyRichard C Leone Alexander J Menza and Bill Bradley Q What can you offer New Jersey that we cant get from Clifford Case MENZA Cliff Case is starting to think that hes Civil Service I dont think the Cliff Cases contribute at all toward the problems of New Jersey I always pose the question of what piece of major legislation has he passed into law in the last 12 years The response is always silence Theres more to being in the US Senate than voting I think that Cliff Case lacks vision and energy to a great extent I dont think he has done anything I think I could bring in a new attitude to the US Senate I have the experience of being in government for a long time I think I could make a difference I think I could contribute BRADLEY I think that different times inspire different kinds of leadership And when Cliff Case went to Washington back in 1954 New Jersey was one of the more prosperous states in the country The Northeast was one of the more prosperous sections Thats no longer the case We have the secondhighest unemployment rate and one of the higher inflation rates And I think that over the years his interest has been primarily in foreign affairs And that he hasnt really involved 1pimself in the kind of responsive representation that I believe the people of New Jersey deserve LEONE There are four or five important things a Senator does One of them is showing up for the final vote I dont have a great quarrel with Clifford Cases voting record I think hes a decent man and I agree with a good deal of what hes done in that area But the reality is that the other things a Senator does have not been important to Clifford Case Since Daniel Webster youve had Taft a Vandenburg a Jackson whoeverSenators come to dominate a particular area of public policy They be come the leaders Its one of the few jobs in American politics which allows you that luxury They shape the whole response to one of societys important policiesor maybe more Williams has done it in mass transit the rights of the migrant workers or senior citizens the Elder Americans Act Case has not chosen that route And finally I think Senators in addition to representing a national interst and having some world view have to fertesent their states Casa does not involve himself very much in that He wont get ipvolved in fighting for a Picatinny Arsenal or a Camden VA hospital or in trying to affect the way the Federal Government invests its funds Hd doesnt perceive that as part of his role He has a right to that judgment But I say that it borders on not caring enough about New Jersey and it certainly is a kind of luxury we cant afford with our politics Q What is the mayor issue in this Democratic primary MENZA Well I think its experirmcc obviously The US Senate is not the place for onthejob training Ive been in government for a leng time Ive run four or five times Ive won every election I have the experience in government I think thats the big difference You know its one thing to learn your political science out of a book its another thing in fact to do it Its another thing to say youre going to do something its another thing getting up in front of the microphone with your legs shaking and voice cracking and voting your conscience BRADLEY I dont think you need a specialized skill to be a US Senator In fact we need more people from diverse backgrounds I think that Ive had an incredibly diverse background of working experience Ive had six months of every year to work in a lot of different environments Ive taught school in the streets of Harlem I was a radio reporter in Europe for two years I was an assistant to the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington I wrote a book 1 worked in organizations to develop healthcare and a criminal justice system I took specific study trips all over the world for 10 years Ive had Peace CorpsI was asked to consider that by the Carter Administration Ted Kennedy offered me a position on the Joint EconomicCommission I really dont believe that because someones been a State Senator or State Treasurer for a while that he will be any  more skilled at putting staff together and directing it than someone whos had a very diverse background So I view it as a strength and not a weakness Q Are any one of the candidates who are relatively young here by some standards going to raise the tacky issue of Senator Cases age MENZA Im not because Im much older than these two gentlemen LEONE Im not because I dont think ilhgtsGrier as I said earlier if Case had used his SesitoriTy well it could be an asset Some people get better ac they get older Case hasnt Hes about the same as a Senator now as he was tO or 20 years ago which is that hehas a limited concepflon of tnat job I dcnt see that as a critical issue or even an important one Q If indeed you are a US Senator for instance the Mideast arms package what is your approach to it MENZA I can understand some people believe that the sale of the arms to Saudi ArabiaF15 fightersis goad thing for the balance of power Im opposed to it however And the reason Im opposed to it very simply is because I start with a major premise about Israel Perhaps Im much more of a hawk about Israel than even many people who live there And after 2000 years of persecution Israel must survive 1 would vote aghinst the arms to Saudi Arabia and Egypt I believe they were illadvised at this time Theres no doubt in my mind that theyre illadvised at this time I think they dramatically in my opinion threaten peace negotiations LEONE I think that the difficulty with American policy in the Middle East in the last six to eight monthsthe United States has always had and I believe must maintain a moral commitment to the security of Israel It must do what is necessary to maintain that security I think thats a strong position in practical terms as well because it does not make it possible for the people in that part of the world who want a military solution to believe that if they simply wait or push the United States will put certain kinds of pressure on Israel to become a party to detailed negotiations Now Israel had some entitlement to those new warplanes out of the Sinai accord It seems to me a major shift in policy short of an agreement for the United States to begin to sell F5s to Egypt and F15s to Saudi Arabia for two different reasons the Saudi Arabian sale troubles me a lot because it is an introduction of a new and sophisticated airplane into that part of the world something I think we should move rather slowly on I think we reap the whirlwind when we try to offset our balance of payments by simply selling arms to other people BRADLEY I see the Carter Administration policy as being misdirected and being one of trying to pressure Israel into making concessions beginning with the postponement of the sale shortly after coming into the Administration followed by his veto of the sale of weapons to South America followed by the SovietAmerican accord on the Palestinians The latest is the package deal I believe that it is shortsighted of the United States to try to interject itself that deeply in the specific detailed negotiating process I think ultimately it will have to be the Israelis and Jordanians and Syrians and Lebanese and Egyptians that will have decide on where the boundaries shall lie because ultimately theyll have live with those agreedupon boundaries I view the package deal as disturbing of that process and I would strongly oppose it Q How do you feel about Federal payment for abortions MENZA Im in favor of Federal pay ment for abortions As a matter of fact I voted against cutting off those funds when I was in the State Senate I think its only fair its right obviously LEONE Im in favor of Federal payment for abortions BRADLEY I agree Q How about gun control MENZA Not only did I vote for it I introduced three bills on gun control LEONE Well I would support stronger national law on gun control something similar to the New Jersey law in fact which requires people to get a license before they can buy gun BRADLEY I would support stronger legislation A Summing Up of ezrapaign Q Is there anything you want to add or say about the campaign your candidacy or anything about the election that we have not asked you BRADLEY Yes I would like to say that I am very pleased that in the four counties with Op highest number of Democratic votes in the primary that we are having open primaries I think that is a very important development because it allows the rankandfile Democrats in New Jersey to have real say in who will be the next Demotrade nominee for the US Senate to oppose Clifford Case LEONE I just think that the critical question over the next five weeks whether people look beyond an outward appearanc e of candidates who generally tend to agree and look for proof evidence that we can get a job clone that we mean what we say and that our records count for something I really believe that the Democratic Party will be best served in November by a crndidate who can go to the pecple and say not just that I want to be a Senator but that I want to be a Senator because I want to continue to do what Ive been doing for Nev Jersey MENZA I found in the last few months campaigning in talking to a great many people that people are vely concerned about the quality of life Theyre asking questions that are very important to them  inflation unerrployment the economyHow do I get to work with the high price of gaso line Putting them in simplistic questions but theyre more than simplistic questions Hey I just cant afford my food bill any more What are you going to do But if Ive discovered anything iri politics for a very long time that very simply that there arent any pana ceas There arent any quick glib answers to very difficult questions So Im going to the public and saying the bets I can do is to try very hard and the best 1 can do is to demonstrate that I care very much about my fellow citizens I do not want people to vote for me because I have a name There is a difference between having a set of interesting experiences   and having experience THE SENATE is no place for onthejob training
Views of a Civilized Man.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/03/archives/views-of-a-civilized-man-a-civilized-man-views-life-and-art.html,LONDON Lord Clark better known as Kenneth Clark of Civilisation lived until recently in a castle Saltwood Kent where Queen Elizabeth I dined with Sir Walter Raleigh and the three knights Henry II slept before murdering Thomas a Becket nearby Canterbury But then said Lord Clark his first wife Jane became ill and couldnt manage the stairs so he built bungalow on the other side of the moat He said it looki rather Japanesey  Ive been much influenced by Japanese architecture Ive turned the castle over my son Alan who is an MP but I still use the courtyard and keep my library in the Great Hall Lady Clark died two years ago after a marriage of 49 years Lord Clark also owns a flat in Mayfair where he often studies and writes The Other Half the second volume of his autobiography has just been published starts at the outbreak of World War II when he was director of Londons National Gallery and ends in the late 60s when the television series Civilisation had made him one of the most famous men in the world Lord Clark is now 74 yearsold and frail He has just recovered from a serious operation However during recent interview casually dressed in gray slacks opennecked shirt and sweater he was still suave aloof fastidious or as a friend said impossibly implausibly supernaturally debonair  Seated on a Sheraton sofa in the drawing room of his London flat amid watercolors and drawings by Renoir Seurat Michelangelo and Cezanne Lord Clark talked about Civilisation and its extraordinary success Everywhere but France he said of that success The French werent at all pleased to have it and put on late at night Why Because they cannot bear anyone who is not French talking about civilization His bluegray eyes twinkled He still receives dozens of letters he said from people who were stirred by the program Not fan letters just people saying how theyd been encouraged to believe in human beings again Its an odd response to seeing great works of art But what do these people get from the telly most nights abortion crime starvation They may well have come to feel What the hell Whats the use of being a man  He said that the number of porters and taxi drivers who still recogniie him is staggering They stop me the street and want to discuss old masters he said It shows Im getting somewhere and that people can really absorb new things if given a chance What of the carping of academics and newspaper critics who scorned the progratri as a mass of superficialities not scholarly enough and labeled Lord Clark a popularizer There was it wintry smile They may have some validity he said Perhaps there were certain passages where the subject was too complicated and should have been better treated or not at all I did feel I rather underplayed poetry I was so anxious to have visual sequences all the time I ought perhaps to have done more with Shakespeare and Elizabethan England and the Book of Common Prayer The observation seemed a curious mixture of modesty and condescension But Ive never claimed to be an expert on everything although Im delighted to be called a popularizer Lord Clark went on Popularizing art is my profession Ive always wanted to communicate my delight in art to as many people as possible His daughter Colette the first woman to be a director of Covent Garden and a twin of Lord Clarks younger son Colin a television producer recalled that when the children were young their father neyer talked down to them It was always as if we were as intelligent as he was his daughter said The effect was to make you clever without realizing it He always insisted that you have to learn taste you are not born with it  Kenneth Clark  K as he is known to his friends  had a strange intensely onely childhood He started life rich but nouveau riche he said My greatgreatgrandfather had made a fortune by inventing the cotton spool in the first decade of the 1800s to replace he silk supply cut off by Napoleon His father was devoted to yachting and gambling and became one of the few who literally broke the bank at Monte Carlo Kenneth Clark said that he was brought up in the vulgar disgraceful overfed godless social order that we call Edwardian at its most questionable Left for the most part in the care of servants he grew used to solitude He maintained that his success on television was because as an only child I got into the habit of going for long walks and talking to myself Television is a form of soliloquy At age 7 he said he realized that he had an unnatural responsiveness to works of art It was a sort of freak aptitude a gift which has kept me on course all my life At 8 he started to draw but the longer he tried the worse the drawing Happily my essays on art showed that I could write he said so I decided to follow Arnold Bennetts advice `If an Englishman feels equally drawn to painting and writing he should write Ive never regretted it I still feel that writing a wellturned sentence or wellconstructed paragraph is one of the greatest pleasures of life He was educated at Oxford where he met Jane Martin a beautiful woman who was to become at one time chairman of the Society of London Fashion Designers  he went on to Florence to help Bernard Berenson the critic and art btsturian revise one of his books  Frrm then on Kenneth Clarks life was a series of triumphs When he was 26 his book The Gothic Revival was published At 27 he became director of the Ashmoleon Museum in Oxford at 31 he took over and reorganized the National Gallery for which he was awarded knighthood During this period World War II began and he was evacuated with the paintings to a remote Welsh valley where he hid them in caves in a hill It was all very beautiful he said a valley where every rock seemed to be placed in exact proportion to the hills beyond I still dream about those Welsh landscapes What else does he dream about Oh food Ive always dreamt of food At least once a week Wonderful meals jugged hare venison figs with prosciutto And women He laughed delightedly Yes I dream about women though perhaps less than I used to Women he knew Yes though occasionally a complete stranger will appear a woman Ive invented  thats the greatest pleasure Are these women dressed Oh always dressed  Then the author of The Nude prefers to dream of women dressed Yes you see in The Nude I was concentrating on what I gave as a subtitle  the study of ideal form Most nude women are not ideal They are a bit of disappointment undressed Better to keep them clothed Ah yes After the war he resigned from the National Gallery in favor of tile Slade Professorship of Fine Arts at Oxford where his witty lectures to undergraduates are recalled fondly today Later he took on the chairmanship of Britains grantdispensing Arts Council Lord Clark has always preferred to associate with artists what he considers the philistine upper classes bore him he said Top people he has observed had charming manners but they were as ignorant as swans He scorns fancy talk Fine sensibilities good conversation and all that can be among the results of civilization but what makes a civilization is vigor energy vitality Now that we only believe in material products we are in danger of losing the sense of humility that comes from imagining something beyond and larger than oneself There are disturbing signs that our civilization may be disintegrating Civilizations are fragile things and a feeling of hopelessness can overtake people even with a high degree of material comfort  He holds nine British and two American honorary degrees but the sedentary role of scholar and critic has never satis fled him Academics are always stuffy and nervous and caught up on some minute point he said Frightfully dreary I get on best with showbiz people Theyre larger than life and always dotngabsolutely unexpected and incredible filings They are monsters total egomaniacs  far more appealing to an old sinner like me In 1969 after his tour de force Civilisaticin he was designated a peer He would have preferred he said not to accept it I come from one of those proud industrial families in Scotland where it is considered disreputable  only gogetters and pushers accept peerages My father always said nobody with peerage had ever written to him except to ask for money But Harold Wilson wrote me one of his wheedling letters he wrote very good wheedling letters and I thought it would be highhat not to accept So now I go to the House of Lords once a year and make a speech on something I feel strongly about Last November he married again The new Lady Clark is a widowed Frenchwoman Nolwen de Janze Rice stylish grayhaired and a farmer She produces cereal crops in Normandy said Lord Clark proudly The manor called Parvondeval  bottom of the valley  dates from 1200 Well be getting the best of both words commuting between France and England Ive always liked a bargain he added glancing across the room at Cezanne watercolor that he bought in Paris in 1929 for the equivalent of 30 But I havent been in an auction house since the war he went on I gave it up when the thing became a racket Art today is sold like used cars I still go to Chartres cathedral each year and to the Parthenon every three years Very good Keeps your standards high You cant go any higher He writes for several hours each morning then again from 5 to 7 by which time I feel in desperate need of whisky and soda I shant do any more television he said Its too timeconsuming and havent much longer to live Besides dont think theyd ask me He is however at work on a book on selfportraits which is almost finished He said of the project Nobody has ever done a book about selfportraits The public loves them they are always interested in how an artist sees himself Yet its a surprisingly difficult thing you see because so many pictures have been called selfportraits when they are not You know the Leonardo da Vinci selfportrait  the old man with a beard Well all the evidence is that it cant possibly be a selfportrait Its a drawing done about 1510 and at that time da Vinci was only in his 60s  When the book is finished he said he planned another on the conception of feminine beauty through the ages Rather nice subject isnt it Amazing no one has done it before Theyve shirked it you see Too big a subject to do properly But Ive always been rash Ive always had a kind of insane confidence that I can bring a thing off My wife is disappointed that I know nothing about farming he continued I shall learn I take a delight in new problems for their own sake in succeeding in tasks no matter how apparently incongruous He rose stiffly from the sofa And now I must go buy food for lunch There were three people in the next room who could have done it for him but borrowing money from his secretary he insisted on doing the shopping himself Hardly surprising that a friend once said If all else had failed K Clark has the ability to have made an absolutely firstclass butler
Connecticut Legislature Adjourns Its 1978 Session; Gets Governor's Praises for Its ‘Record of Progress’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/04/archives/connecticut-legislature-adjourns-its-1978-session-gets-governors.html,HARTFORD May 3After whistling a chorus of the states new song Yankee Doodle listening to Gov Ella T Grassos farewell address and killing several important bills on the calendar the Connecticut General Assembly tonight officially adjourned its 1978 session Governor Grasso cupped the congenial bipartisan round of congratulatory speeches in her remarks She noted that throughout this session the long and proud Connecticut heritage of cooperation and responsibility has been extended She listed many of the major bills passed by the Assembly calling it a record of progress and responsibility and added that the budget which has been adopted reflects a positive response by the government to the needs of our citizens the tax dollars of the people have been directed to many valuabbe and vital programs The Only Discordant Note The only discordant not came when about a dozen urban legislators stalked out of the House chamber because Democratic leaders in the chamber refused to et them bring up for consideration a bill setting up a separate state housing department The bill designed to put more emphasis on the need for housing in the cities had won Senate approval I feel the whole General Assembly just put us down said Representative Margaret E Morton Among the bills that died today were major measures on sentencing reform alterations in the juvenilejustice system and revisions in the liquor law The sentencing bill attempted to eliminate disparity in sentencing by prescribing sentences based on the crime and circumstances Unlike mandatory sentencing the bill would have given judges the option of ignoring the guidelines for sentencing by simply writing an opinion explaining why the chart was not applicable Also killed was a bill that would have automatically transferred from Juvenile Court to Superior Court cases involving a child 14 or older accused of a second serious crime Under existing law a person over 14 accused of murder or a second offense punishable by 20 years or more in jail can be transferred by a Juvenile Court judge to Superior Court but the bill would have made the transfer mandatory Fate of LiquorPrice Bill The measure aimed at reducing liquor prices became so snarled because of the many amendments attached to it that the Senate decided not to try to patch it together hastily on the last day of this threemonth session The bill which was returned to committee would have eliminated the current mandatory minimum markup on liquor at the wholesale and retail levels Electionyear politics dominated this constitutionallymandated short session of the Legislature and the major battle centered on plans to spend millions of dollars in additional money on old and new programs without raising taxes With the Republican minority charging that the Democrats were trying to buy the November election for Governor the General Assembly passed a record 21 billion budget that included 68 million in new spending for cities Other notable bills passed in this ses sion included the following The choice of Yankee Doodle as the state song mandatory autoemissions tests for nearly every car in the state beginning in 1980 reinstatement of the blue law banning Sunday shopping ex cept between Thanksgiving and New Years and two environmental billsone requiring a 5cent deposit on all beverage containers sold in the state starting in 1980 and the other taxing businesses for a 3 million fund to clean up litter However every state officeholder including the Governor is up for reelection this year and the Assembly managed to avoid dealing with some of the most controversial issues The IncomeTax Question There was a little debate but no effort to act on a question that is probably in every residents mind Will the state have to institute an income tax to comply With the Connecticut Supreme Courts order to equalize the quality of education in various cities and towns The measure that would have financed abortions for poor women in the aftermath of the Federal Governments decisicin not to pay for abortions never got out of committee Among other issues left to be resolved next year were a constitutional amendment to form a commission that would select judges on their merit efforts to revise the ethics law for lobbyists and the most important consumer bill of the year according to consumer groups which would require all consumer contracts to be written in simple English Late last night the House of Representatives gave final approval to a bill affecting the productliability law which consumer groups strenuously opposed but which business and insurance lobbyists insist was a big compromise
FRANCE JAILS RAPISTS AFTER PIVOTAL CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/04/archives/france-jails-rapists-after-pivotal-case-precedent-set-by-criminal.html,AIXENPROVENCE France May 3  A precedentsetting rape case that has dragged through a series of courts for nearly four years to become a cause clbre in France concluded here today with sentences ranging from four to six years in prison for three local men The case was the first in French legal history in which rape victims succeeded in being heard by the Cours dAssises the criminal court that judges serious crimes Although rape is a felony under French law in the rare cases that had previously come to trial the charges were reduced by the courts to assault and battery which is treated as a misdemeanor That the plaintiffs two Belgian women AnneMarie Tonglet and Aracelli Castellano said they were lesbians enabled their attorney to nullify the principal defense in the case  the implied consent of the women Amid nationwide publicity two days of demonstrations and a parade of star witnesses flown in from Paris to this sundrenched town 20 miles north of Marseilles the trial was also a confrontation between French feminists and the Mediterranean male attitudes prevailing here Incidents of Violence Provoked Local men provoked incidents of violence during the twoday trial menacing threatening and at times striking women lawyers journalists and spectators Four complaints against the atmosphere of hostility in Aix were lodged by lawyers Much of the violence was directed toward the plaintiffs their families and Gisle Halimi the controversial lawyer whose previous legal victories included the landmark case that led to legalization of abortion in France During the first day of the rape trial 12 hours of testimony and crossexamination brought out that the two Belgian women arrived in Morgiou a fishing village near Marseilles on Aug 21 1974 with the intention of camping there While Miss Tonglet was unloading equipment from the car she was approached by one of the defendants Serge Petrilli then 22 years old According to the testimony of both Miss Tonglet vigorously rejected Mr Petrillis advances and he departed He returned a halfhour later to be met with the same reaction At about 1 AM Mr Petrilli recruited two friends to accompany him to the womens tent by then pitched on the beach The men entered the tent against the womens wishes and Miss Tonglet struck Guy Roger then 29 with a hammer There followed a series of blows and threats ending in repeated sexual assaults on both women by the three men lasting until 5 AM The women then went to the police Fact of Case Admitted The accused men admitted the facts of the case arguing only that since the women had finally yielded they were consenting Mr Petrilli was convicted of rape and Mr Roger and Albert Mouglalis the third defendant of attempted rape Under French law rape occurs only when there is penetration and subsequent ejaculation Neither penetration alone nor other sexual abuses constitute rape here The defense consisted primarily of drawing attention to the cultural gap between the accused  to whom their lawyers referred frequently as imbeciles and dumb  and the victims Miss Tonglet a professor of biology and Miss Castellano who takes care of newborn babies The defense lawyers noting that the women were lesbians who slept nude and were traveling alone together said that these were not morals familiar to their clients Were in Provence said Francois Tubiana one of the defense lawyers These men are not capable of understanding the psychology of such women The defense also asserted repeatedly that the French womens movement was interfering with justice This is no longer the trial of two young women but of all women observed JeanClaude Simoni the lawyer for Mr Roger during one of several demonstrations outside the courtroom
Catholic Bishops Are Told of Evangelistic Plans,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/04/archives/catholic-bishops-are-told-of-evangelistic-plans-conflicts-on.html,CHICAGO May 3  The Roman Catholic Church plans a special effort to evangelize unchurched Christians the National Conference of Catholic Bishops was told today at its spring meeting The conference set up an Office of Evangelization in November and plans to hold a series of regional meetings next year to discuss the 68 million nonCatholic Christians in the nation who are not church members and the 12 million Catholics who do not attend church However Archbishop Francis T Hurley chairman of the evangelization committee conceded that tactics would have to be different from those used by Catholics in recent decades In that time attendance at mass has slipped drastically particularly among the young Conflicts on Abortion He cited a recent Gallup Poll estimating that 26 percent of Catholics over 18 years of age were essentially churchless and that the figure reaches 40 percent among those between 18 and 30 We used to say We will make a Catholic out of you said Archbishop Hurley of Anchorage Alaska but that was in the 30s and 40s Now we say We have something special to share with you We want to invite people not recruit them People always decided on their own The difference is the way we approach it A recent Gallup Poll indicated that 44 percent of practicing Catholics would prefer some moderation of the churchs stand on abortion Other polls show that many Catholics are also concerned over the churchs stand on contraception There is no indication at this meeting that these stands are changing Archbishop Hurley did not rule out efforts to reach the 11 million nonChristian worshipers in the United States but as most Catholic leaders have done in recent years he stressed an effort among those who already claim a nominal faith in Christ The best way to start is with personal evangelization he said with an emphasis on daily living experience This emphasis is consistent with the mood of this convention at which plans will be announced tomorrow for carrying out the goals of the churchs 1976 CalltoAction Conference in Detroit Talk on Evangelizing A broad family ministry plan which would call upon lay Catholics to form local groups to provide skilled help for families with problems is also being discussed Some bishops here seem to concede that the Catholic public listens less to the clergy than in the past and that renaissance in Catholic values must come from the laity not from the clergy The 250 bishops in attendance heard a talk on evangelizing from one of their colleagues Archbishop Fulton J Sheen who will be 83 years old next week Bishop Sheen who once enthralled national television audiences with his farranging discourses seemed to enthrall his colleagues today by telling them that people were in a new stage of religious needs The new approach is people are ready to hear about Christ he said The time is right to talk about sin our Savior and redemption The only way to win audiences is to tell people about the life and death of Christ Every other approach is a waste Also today Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York the chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee for ProLife Activities told his colleagues about Catholic efforts for antiabortion laws Cardinal Cooke also displayed a series of proabortion cartoons and literature distributed by the Planned Parenthood Association of Chica go Which he called vicious and antiCatholic The Planned Parenthood group issued a statement saying that the material was tasteless and offensive and does not reflect the associations views The statement said the material which made fun of Catholic public officials and Catholic clergy was issued by a person in a lowerechelon position who no longer works for the association
ALBANY IS CRITICIZED ON REQUEST BY M.A.C.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/04/archives/albany-is-criticized-on-request-by-mac-legislature-is-pathetic.html,With the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation attacking the State Legislature as pathetic the board formally asked the lawmakers yesterday to authorize a new MAC bond that would be sold to pension funds this month to keep the city out of bankruptcy Despite continued appeals for speed on the loans tin pension fund trustees have not yet committed themselves to purchase the bonds even if the Legislature creates them Although fund officials had agreed in 1975 to lend the money to the city they are stalling to enhance their bargaining position with the city in contract talks and in discussions on a fiscal monitor to succeed the Emergency Financial Control Board The city needs the money this month to meet an 81 million general payroll on May 26 and a 665 million teachers payroll June 1 The citys projection of a cash balance of more than 600 million on June 30 assumes that it will get the pension fund loan in May so it cannot use the cash balance to tide it over the payrolls coming due Under the plan advanced by the MAC chairman Felix G Rohatyn 683 million of new thirdresolution MAC bonds would be offered to the pension funds which have balked at lending money directly to the city while its financial future remains uncertain after June 30the end of the fiscal year and the expiration date of the current Federal loan program At the MAC board meeting Mr Rohatyn directed some bitter words at what he considered the Legislatures footdragging on creating the new bonds and on increasing the MACs borrowing authority so it could sell them Ive lived under fascism so I know democracy is better Mr Rohatyn said But you have to have lived under fascism to know it TradeOff Suggestion Rejected When Deputy Mayor Philip L Toia suggested that the MAC bill was being delayed in the traditional endofsession horsetrading Mr Rohatyn snapped Were not going to trade off MAC against Medicaid abortions or any thing that theyre horsing around with Theyre not doing us any favors We are trying to keep the city solvent I have a commitment from the Governor to put this thing through and I expect it to go through The issue of this months pension fund loans was raised by the City Comptroller Harrison J Goldin who is also a union trustee He said that his fiduciary responsibility to the pension funds would prohibit him from voting to lend money to the city without an indication that Congress would pass the loan legislation now before it to create a loan program to replace the expiring one Goldin advisers said the Comptrollers main concern was his coming race for State Comptroller and the need to look as fiduciarily responsible as Arthur Levitt the incumbent Although the pension funds have not threatened to withhold the loans William T Scott of the United Federation of Teachers explained that the funds had the same worry that Mr Goldin expressed Mr Rohatyns plan would have the MAC buy the citys bonds and finance the sale by selling its own thirdresolution bonds to the pension funds First resolution MAC bonds are backed by the city sales tax and the stocktransfer tax Secondresolution bonds are backed by state percapita aid to the city The thirdresolution bonds would be backed by the spillover of taxes and per capita aid a capital reserve fund a state moral obligation pledge and the city bonds that the MAC would buy In addition to creating the new bond the Legislature is being asked to increase the MACs borrowing authority from the present 58 billion to 888 billion
Court Upsets Massachusetts Law For Parental Approval of Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/04/archives/court-upsets-massachusetts-law-for-parental-approval-of-abortion.html,BOSTON May 3 UPIA Massachusetts law requiring girls under the age of 18 years to have their parents approval before getting an abortion was ruled unconstitutional by a Federal court today The Federal District Court said that the law discriminated against minors A minor has a constitutional right to an abortion the court said in a 19page majority opinion signed by two members of the threejudge panel The states power to limit this right should extend only to protect the minor from the special consequences of her minorityimmaturity and the lack of informed understanding We find no reasonable basis for Massachusetts distinguishing between a minor and an adult given a finding of maturity and informed consent the court said
Are Mormons Against Feminism? Not Exactly,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/05/archives/are-mormons-against-feminism-not-exactly-softspoken-homespun-manner.html,Barbara B Smith the topranking Mormon woman tends to wince these days whenever she hears feminists complain that the Mormon Church has become the newest enemy of the womens movement The church is strongly opposed to the equal rights amendment she conceded in an interview here recently It is also against abortion And homosexuals men and women are disfellowshipped if they make no attempts to change their life styles she said But we are for womens rights in principle insisted Mrs Smith who is president of the Relief Society the womens arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints Mormons I dont think theres anyone who feels any stronger thanwe do about equal pay for equal work equal educational opportunities and equal credit treatment We just feel that the ERA is not the way to achieve these things she went on We already have Federal legislation that gives women those rights There are times women need preferential treatment such as support from their husbands the right to child custody and alimony in divorce cases and exemption from combat duty and we feel these rights would be jeopardized by the ERA As for abortion Mrs Smith who is the mother of seven and the grandmother of 18 with two on the way said We think its taking a life We believe in teaching our young people not to have relationships before marriage and chastity after marriage There is no need for abortion if people are taught morality Softspoken Homespun Manner The 56yearold Mrs Smith who lives in Salt Lake City looked like the Hollywood version of the glamorous grandmother Her silvery hair was worn in a bouffant style and her stylish vested bluegray suit gave her a crisp nononsense look that somehow didnt jibe with her softspoken homespun manner She was in New York mainly to talk about the Relief Societys new milliondollar Monument to Women a 13statue sculpture garden the size of a football field that will be dedicated on June 28 in Nauvoo Ill before 7500 invited guests The sculpture garden was built in Nauvoo she said because it was the world headquarters of the Mormon Church when the Relief Society was founded there in 1892 by Joseph Smith he Mormon prophet Today the organization has 1485500 women members in 70 countries including Marie Osmond the singer and Lenore Romney wife of the politician George Romney We tried to show that women of the present are what they are because of Women of the past Mrs Smith said as she thumbed through photographs of the bronze statues which show women mainly in the traditional roles of wife mother grandmother teacher and nurturer The Mormon Church began to be viewed as a major foe of the womens movement last summer when 19000 women  12000 of them Mormons registered for the state convention in Utah that piecetled last falls International Womens Year meeting in 1ious ton It was by far the largest state convention held and many Mormon women who attended said they had come in response to their churchs call to insure the support of correct principles Denies a Plot As a result 12 of the 19 Utah delegates elected to go to Houston were Mormon women and the entire delegation took a strong antiERA prolife stand in Houston It was not a Mormon plot Mrs Smith insisted when asked about news reports that had characterized it that way It was just a response to the churchs request to attend the meeting She added that 70 percent of the states population belongs to the Mormon Church Asked about charges that rightwing extremists had used the Mormon women at the convention Mrs Smith replied I guess that happened somewhat But the thrilling thing about the meeting she added was that our women went home anxious to know more about the concerns of women I was so thrilled with what happened there that I encouraged our women in other states to attend their conventions The Mormon Church current membership is about four million has long put great emphasis on the family she said with the womans ideal role seen as wife and mother Every Monday night Mormon families hold what is called a family home evening in which parents and children gather in the home for prayer family discussions songfests and games At the weekly Relief Society meetings Mormon women study their religion the first week of each month homemaking and family health on the second week social relations on the third and cul tural refinement on the fourth The cycle is then repeated Mrs Smith said the family health lesson often included instructions on the Mormons health code in which members abstain from alcohol tobacco and drugs use meat sparingly eat moderately and fast for at least one 24hour period each month Money that ordinarily would have been spent on the missed meal is donated to the church for the locallevel poor Mrs Smith said Mormon families are urged to keep a oneyear supply of food stored in their homes in case of weather emergencies war or depression or if the breadwinner becomes ill or loses his job This is one thing that a lot of people dont understand Mrs Smith said frowning They think were hoarding food but were not Its an emergency program only and we also keep a several months supply of clothing and cash for this purpose Is there a place for single widowed and divorced women in the familyoriented Relief Society Yes we try hard to meet their needs Mrs Smith said We have special Relief Society sessions at night for working women and on Sunday mornings for young adult women Even if theyre not married we all have a commonality as women we all live and die One of Mrs Smiths official suggestions during her four years in office is that two women who are heads of households team up to share jobs and child care Its becoming much more common she said They live in separate homes but share the babytending service The important thing is the quality of family care One area where the Church Of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints has beert heavily criticized is for not allowing either women or blacks in the priesthood It will always be closed to women Mrs Smith said matteroffactly But women can talk from podiums or pray in church or go out on missions Missionaries go into the field for two years usually between the ages of 19 and 21 with his or her own financial support to recruit new members Mrs Smith who married at the age of 19 and never attended college is the wife of Douglas Hill Smith president of the Beneficial Life Insurance Company and the Utah Home Fire Insurance Company A lifelong Mormon her ancestors became members of the church seven years after it was organized and moved westward from New York City to the Rocky Mountains Despite her constant travels all over the world Mrs Smith said she has no household help in her small house in Salt Lake City and does most of the cooking when shes at home Only one of our seven children is at home now she said and both she and my husband help with the housework Mrs Smith said with a smile that none of her daughters or daughtersinlaw could be described as feminists But if they were would she encourage them to speak out in areas where they disagreed with the church She paused briefly Then I have always thought people should speak their own opinions she said softly even if they dont share mine

Running Scared On Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/06/archives/running-scared-on-abortion.html,I have a very cold feeling in the bottom of my stomach Like a naive fool I suppose I had believed that the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision guaranteeing women the right to choose whether to bear children or end unwanted pregnancies through abortion was such a reasonable decision that it would not be tampered with After all who knew better whether a child would benefit from being born to be loved cherished supported and given every advantage that could be mustered up than the woman who would become forever its mother And if she chose to spare a life that would entail neglect extreme poverty or loneliness because the mother was either too young or too old too poor or too insecure had too many children already or who had been abandoned by the childs father that was obviously her choice And the Supreme Court confirmed the legality of that choice Now in a groundswell of hysterical hypocrisy that decision is being mocked by those who would take the law in their own hands and impose the beliefs of some on the wombs of all Clinics in Ohio have been bombed gasoline thrown in the faces of operatingroom technicians iodine solutions splashed on the walls and carpets Four bottles of gasoline tossed through the windows of a clinic in Omaha burned out 75 peecent of the clinic while in Vermont a fire shut the Vermont Womens Health Center for seven months all in the name of the beauty of life Yet there are 6000 legally free and clear orphans in New York City alone who have yet to be adopted In Suffolk County where I live the legislature recently voted to cut off state Medicaid funds for abortions for poor women even though their own counsel had warned them such an action was illegal and in Akron Ohio where Im glad I dont live the City Council passed what is probably an unconstitutional ordinance requiring local clinics to show pictures of the weektoweek stages of fetal development to their clients and to require notification of the spouses of women seeking abortion No matter that he might be a drunk unemployed or already a father Many times over The woman must not be allowed to make decisions for herself This is called compulsory pregnancy I shouldnt be this stunned at the course of hypocritical events of course After all I had gone to the National Womens Conference in Houston and was on the floor when the reproductivefreedom plank was ntroduced While prochoice delegates sported restrained buttons bearing the legend Never Again under the silhouette of a coat hanger the symbolic and often actual instrument of illegal abortion righttolife advocates paraded their usual flotilla of oversize pictures of dead fetuses one with the words Dont worry Mommv I wont wake you up tonight by crying But that very afternoon at the Phyllis Schlafly antiEqual Rights Amendment antiabortion counterconvenCon the man standing next to me snorting a Save Our Children button first scolded his 8yearold son for wiggling then hauled off and whacked him across the head when the child persisted Dialogue had completely broken down to be replaced with stonewalling monologues When later I timidly confronted Mildred Jefferson the formidable president of National RighttoLife with various studies that not only concluded that pregnant teonage girls were in great physical jeopardy themselves but that their babies had twice the risk of being stillborn or dangerously premature my words fell on unhearing ears Those studios are all wrong she said Thats all there is to it And thats all there was to it No discussion No ambivalence Subject closed before it had hardly been opened With one abortion for every three live births in the United States today with one million teenage pregnanciesone out of every 10 teenage girlsa year with one out of three married couples practicing contraception facing an unwanted pregnancy within five years how can we not talk about abortion reasonably and with sensitivity What has happened to us that we batter each other with rhetoric and statistics and even violently while we ignore the fact that were all human beings an in the face of an unwanted pregnancy dealing with perhaps the most profound ctecisica of our lives The future for choice and expression seems even darker In January the Senate passed a bill that contained a section titled Mailing importing or transporting obscene matter The bill now before the House of Representatives reads in part Every  book  giving information  where or by whom any act or operation of any kind for the provision or produc ing of abortion will be done or performed or how or by what means abortion may be produced  is declared to be nonmailable matter If this bill passes the House any person or organization sending information on abortion facilities and availability will be guilty of a Class felony subject to tfive years in jail and a fine of 10000
Mistrial Declared for Doctor Accused of Killing Baby,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/06/archives/mistrial-declared-for-doctor-accused-of-killing-baby.html,LOS ANGELES May 5Superior Court Judge James Turner declared a mistrial today in the murder case of Dr William Waddill Jr after the jurors advised the judge that they were deadlocked 7to5 in favor of acquittal Dr Waddill an obstetrician in suburban Orange County was accused of murdering an infant that survived a legal saline abortion he had administered to an unwed 18yearold woman on March 2  1977 Because the testimony often graphic had dramatized the tenuous nature of life in the latter stages of pregnancy the trial became a cause for antiabortionists around the country in furthering their efforts to limit access to abortions Im disappointed Dr Waddill said after the jury was discharged One of his lawyers had said the defense had scored a moral victory but the 42yearold physician disagreed Its not a victory he said adding Its not a victory for the District Attorneys office either The District Attorneys office said it would decide next week whether to seek a new trial Dr Waddill was ordered to return to the court May 15 Jurors had debated for almost 11 days when they sent a message to Judge Turner this afternoon that they were deadlocked He urged them to keep trying and deliberations resumed But the jury soon sent a new message saying that it was hopeless to continue In the course of his 14week trial Dr Waddill said that the mother of the child had told him she was 22 weeks pregnant After he performed an abortion and left the Westminister Community Hospital she delivered a baby that was estimated by experts to be at least 28 weeks old Dr Waddill testified that when he returned to the hospital he found an infant that was virtually dead gasping and moving its arms and legs as though dying He was convinced he said that the infants brain had been irreversibly damaged by the salt solution that he had injected into the young womans uterus But a pediatrician who was at the hospital testified that Dr Waddill said the child was not dead and that he was worried about a law suit The pediatrician said that Dr Waddill attempted to strangle the infant Even during the jurys deliberations the long trial was marked by confusion over definitions for life and death Judge Turner called in jurors Wednesday to give them a revised definition of death The definnlon ne outlined Wednesday eliminated the issue of an act of omission Death occurred he said then when there was a total and nonreversible cessation of all brain function Jurors today said they were confused by the new definition Before they said they were briefly split 9to3 in favor of conviction That split was based on the judges initial statement that Dr Waddill could be found guilty if the jurors determined he had not done everything in his power to help the infant they said

Wedneiday an unknown number of solar enthusiasts estimated by one organ Izei at 30 to 35 million  gathered accoss the nation to watch the sun come up look at demonstrations of solar technology and otherwise celebrate Sun Day an occasion conceived to draw attention to the potential of solar energy and encourage greater Federal commitment to its development The movements objects include legislation for a solar energy Ink to provide low interest loans for solar heating installa tions and right to sunlight laws to ensur4 that no one casts a shadow on his neikhbors solar collector In response President Carter said he bad found another 100 million for Governinent solar research next fiscal year bringing the total in the proposed budget somewhere near 500 million 216cited a recent study by the Council on Environmental Quality estimating that solar energy could meet one quer ter of American energy needs by 2000 and half by 2020 The cheapest solar electricity cells now cost 10 or 12 per peak watt their output at noon on a sunny day and will not be considered competitive with earth electricity until that price reaches about 50 cents Many researchers believe such a price will be reached sometime in the 1980s Defining Learning is a Liberal Art The doyourown thing mood of the 1980s was nowhere more prevalent than in the nations universities Many colleges abandoned strict course requirements and let students study almost anything they thought was relevant One result as Dean Henry Rosovsky of Harvard wrote in 1964 was that to be an educated man or woman doesnt mean anything To remedy that situation took time but Harvards Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted last week to turn back to basics and establish a structured core curriculum Harvard was not the first university to display the new academic attitude buts its membership in the group will probably validate the shift as they say in sociology seminars for many other institutions At the heart of the curriculum is new definition of an educated person that calls for an informed acquaintance with five academic areas literature and the arts history social and philosophical analysis science and mathematics and foreign languages and culture Beginning with the class of 1986 Students will have to choose six to eight courses  about a quarter of their undergraduate program  from these areas Since the new definition also requires depth in some field of knowledge students will spend half their time on a major subject The program is intended to strike balance between laissezfaire and the assertion of faculty authority Some faculty members apparently wanted the university to exert even more or At least a different kind of authority William Bossert a professor of applied mathematics said that The core takes a clear stand in praise of mediocrity However it was adopted by decisive 185 to 65 and a planned student demonstration against it never took place because opponents could not muster enough support French Feminists Gain a Victory Until Valery Giscard dEstaing became President of France in 1974 the French feminist movement made little headway Since then with his blessing the climate of public opinion has changed The sale of contraceptives was legalized in 1974 and abortion became legal in 1975 Now the feminists have succeeded in making the French judicial system take rape seriously Rape Is a felony under French law but rape cases seldom come to trial When they do the charge is usually reduced to assault and battery and the penalty if any is negligible Not so in a landmark case decided last week In AixenProvence a bastion of Mediterranean male chauvinism three men were sentenced to four to six years in prison for raping two women tourists It was the first time a rape case had been triedl in the Cour dAssises the court that judges serious crimes The case might have turned out differently if the plaintiffs had not been lesbians since that fact made it difficult to argue that they had consented The case had been before the courts for four years and had attracted nationwide publicity While the trial went on feminists demonstrated and local males threatened and sometimes physically attacked women lawyers and reporters The plaintiffs were represented by Gisle Halimi a feminist lawyer who won a pivotal abortion case In 1972 and is given much of the credit for the legalization of abortion Cutthroat Rivalry By Men in White For those who read The Double Helix the message was clear Scientific competition can be relentless petty and vain What James Watson one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA did in describing his race for the Nobel prize with Francis Crick reporter Nicholas Wade has now done in an account of the race between Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally to isolate hormones produced by the brain In the three latest issues of Science magazine Mr Wade says that the competition between the two endocrinologists lasted for more than 20 years At the finish they ran neckandneck sharing a Nobel prize last year for their work on hormones that help to control body temperature growth and reproduction Dr Guillemin Frenchborn and sophisticated urbane and charming denied any ill feeling but a colleague said They were bitter rivals to put it mildly Dr Schally Polishborn and excitable said that he and Dr Guillemin couldnt stand each other and that there had been many years of vicious attacks and bitter retaliation Each of the scientists working in his own lab with his own team of experts needed hundreds of thousands of hypothalami parts of the brain that were thought to control the pituitary by secreting hormones Dr Guillemin got his hypothalami from sheep from which the hypothalamus is easy to extract Dr Schally got his from pigseven though the pigs anatomy makes it difficult to remove the hypothalamus without mutilating it As he explained If I were working on sheep too my contribution would be worthless Fortunately for DrSchally Oscar Mayer and Company gave him a million Rig hypo thalami a gift that left Dr Schally with more money to spend on staff Guillemin was paying 90 cents a hypothalamus he said but I could pay all my money for salaries Although scientific courtesy usually demands it the two rivals did not always share information or materials because that would have been like giving someone a gun so he can shoot you Dr Schally said In their scientific papers each sometimes failed t cite the others work If he wanted to have this cold war I gave him a sample of his own medicine he said Some scientists believed that this competitiveness was destructive to the two rivals work Others disagreed Said one Their rivalry stimulated both men to do their very best andto check each others work Still the two decades were not without lighter moments During one scientific meeting a colleague tried to ease the tension between Dr Schally and Dr Guillemin by reading some lines he had written Up in my head  Just over my tongue A little thing from my brain is hung To make it work there are factors new That tell it when and how much to pitu
1978 Assembly: Some Hits And Some Misses,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/07/archives/connecticut-weekly-1978-assembly-some-hits-and-some-misses-hits-and.html,HARTFORD CONNECTICUTS legislators went home last week to start running for reelection leaving behind a threemontb record dominated by their decision to spend millions of additional tax dollars without raising taxes There were a few innovative pieces of legislation but the main preoccupation of the General Assembly this year seemed to be tinkering with old laws and issues while avoiding tough questions that might be dragged into the campaign A major concern of every voter  whether the state can meet the Connecticut Supreme Courts order to equalize the quality of education in public schools across the state without an income tax was raised by a few members in debates but most lawmakers clearly wanted to ignore the issue until next year With the Republicans chanting that the Democrats were trying to buy the election for Governor the Assembly passed and the Governor signed a 2135 billion budget the largest in the states history On less weighty matters the Assembly after holding auditions in the House chamber decided to make Yankee Doodle the state song The new bills that were passed that could have direct effect on the lives and pocketbooks of nearly every resident of the state include reinstatement of the blue law banning Sunday shopping the requirement for a 5cent deposit on all beverage containers sold in the state and mandatory autoemissions test for every vehicle manufactured after Jan 11968 There were notable defeats for several other controversial proposals A plan for state financing for abortions for lowincome women who have been excluded from the Federal health program was defeated as was a proposed constitutional amendment to set up a citizens panel to make merit selection of judges Other bills that were defeated included an effort to reconcile the freedomofinformation and privacy laws and a plan backed by lobbyists to rectify what they saw as some of the faults in the ethics law governing lobbying activities that was passed last year The most controversial legislative battles of the session were fought around various proposals for the spending of the millions of dollars in surplus state revenues that unexpectedly cropped up this election year Governor Grassos plan to use 50 million of the state surplus to cut the sales tax from 7 percent to 65 percent failed early in the session Following that she and the Democratic leaders arrived at an equally unsuccessful substitute plan to send a rebate check ranging from 20 to 79 to everyone who pays property taxes in the state fora total of 20 million In the end the Assembly agreed to a budget that raises welfare payments by 10 percent provides additional financing for education and various social services and welfare programs and provides 68 million in new spending for cities The Democratic desire to put some money directly back into the pockets of voters was satisfied when the Assembly agreed to give cities and towns 20 million earmarked for local propertytax relief with the stipulation that tax assessors add a statement to propertytax bills that will go out in October  one month before the election explaining how the new money eased local finances The mayors and first selectmen around the state love the idea of course Some have already begun to search for ways to put the extra money in local treasuries for dispersal next year  when they will be up for reelection  rather than this October as the legislators had intended During the final Senate debate on the propertytax relief measure Senator Richard C Bozzuto a Watertown Republican attacked the payments as one of the most blatant pieces of political chicanery which we had to deal with this political year But the Senates president pro tern Joseph J Fauliso a Hartford Democrat reminded the Republicans that in 1974 the last year of Gov Thomas Meskills administration the Republican majorities in the General Assembly sent a similar payment of 6 million to localities He added with a grin They thought itsvas good in 1974 we think its excellent in 1978 The Governor signed the budget but her spokesman said she wanted to study many of the other measures before deciding whether to approve them Among other major actions taken by the Legislature this year were these BLUE LAWS Heeding demands from store employees who dont like to be ordered to work on Sundays and from some centralcitybusiness groups the General Assembly approved legislation that would if signed by the Governor reimpose the states blue law restricting many large stores from opening on Sundays A 1976 state court decision declared the existing law on Sunday closings was unconstitutional for part of the state thus making the existing statute unenforceable Supporters of the ban on Sunday shopping believe that the new version will lead to a more definitive court Under the new rheasure which would take effect Oct 1 large retail storescouldsell goods and services on Sundays between Thanksgiving and Christmas The new version like the existing law continues to exempt from the ban on Sunday sales such things as retail food stores with fewer than five employees retail drugstores motorvehicle service stations restaurants motels and hotels ambulance and funeral services and agriculture  Also added to the bill was a provision saying that no person shall be liable to prosecution who among other things concientiously believes that the Sabbath begins at sundown on Friday night and actually refrains from work labor or business during said period RIGHT TURNS ON RED LIGHTS Connecticut would join 48 other states in allowing motorists to make right turns on the red light under legislation sent to the Governor This would leave only Massachusetts New York City and the District of Columbia without rightturnonred laws To allow the state and localities time to change road signs the new legilation would take effect July 1 1979 and a motorist could make a right turn on a red light after stopping to allow pedestrian and vehicle traffic to clear the intersection unless asign specifically prohibited such turns Supporters said it would save fuel and reduce air pollution from cars waiting in line to make turns FARMLAND PRESERVATION What started out two years igo as a 00 million proposal to protect the states dwindling acreage of farmland emerged from the General Assembly this session as a scaleddown 5 million pilot program lasting through 1980 The state borrowing was authorized to enable the Commissioner of Agri culture to buy and thus protect the development rights to perhaps 3000 acres of farmland In addition the state would develop maps of state farm acreage that wouldbe used to draw up a larger land preservation Program for future consideration COASTAL AREA MANAGEMENT Reflecting concerns from shoreline towns that their zoning and planning powers might be usurped the General Assembly approved a drastically curtailed bill for coastalarea management that in effect creates a legislative committee to study the issues and make recommendations for next years session The original proposal would have created a board to oversee the management and development of shoreline activities in the towns alone Lone Island Sound BOTTLE BILL A sixyear battle over banning throwaway beer and soda containers ended this session with the General  Assembly passing two major bills which had started out being substitutes for each other After an intensive lobbying effort by citizens groups and environmentalists the Legislature passed the socalled Bottle Bill requiring a 5cent deposit on all beverage containers sold in the state starting Jan 1 1980 Then with surprising ease the General Assembly also passed the socalled antilitter bill which taxes businesses to pay for a 3 millionayear litter cleanup also starting in 1980 The antilitter measure had been supported by the container and beverage industry as an alternative to the bottle bill As it turned out all sides managed to pass what they wanted although efforts could be made next year to alter one or both measures before they take effect AUTO EMISSION TESTS Under threats from the Federal Government to withhold highway and environmental money unless Connecticut cleaned up its air the Assembly passed a bill requiring annual autoemission tests for more than 15 million motor vehicles in the state that were manufactured after Jan 1 1968 In the rush to meet their mandatory adjournment date some Senators voted for the bill despite their reservations about many amendments tacked on to the measure in the House and there were promises that it would be modified next year before it took effect in 1980 As now amended the bill limits the cost of the test to 5 and the amount of repairs that might be required to 70 PRETTY BABY A bill originally aimed at banning the movie Pretty Baby from Connecticut theaters passed the Assembly but it is unlikely the bill could ever be used to stop the movies showing here As amended the bill expands the criminal statutes prohibiting child pornography but exempts materials or performances with serious educational literary artistic political or scientific value The movie Pretty Baby about a child prostitute was directed by Louis Malle and is widely considered to have artistic value Because it includes no explicit childsex scenes even the bills author doubts it could be used to stop the movie from being shown in the state PRODUCTLIABILITY LAW A bill altering the product liability law which consumer groups strenuously opposed but which business and insurance lobbyists insist was a serious compromise was given final passage late in the session The bill would make it harder for persons injured by defective products to collect damages from manufacturers and their insurers The present law allows consumers to sue for damages even though they have contributed to their injury through their own limited negligence The new legislation revises that section of the law to put more responsibility on consumers for the way they handle a product The bill also says that printed warnings to consumers about the hazards of a product are adequate protection against lawsuits HELP FOR THE RETARDED A bill was passed banning discrimination against the mentally retarded in the job market as well as in public accommodations such as restaurants or hotels The bill does not force employers to hire the mentally retarded for jobs they are unqualified to do but it does provide a legal tool to challenge an employer suspected of unfair discrimination through the Commission of Human Rights and Opportunities Proponents of the measure note that of the 50000 to 100000 retarded living in Connecticut 89 percent are mildly retarded and employable VICTIMS OF CRIME Victims or violent crimes could receive up to 10000 in compensation from a pool financed by fines levied on those convicted It assesses a 10 court cost on all those convicted of any crime or certain motor vehicle offenses A criminal injuries compensation board would determine eligibiity for the compensation funds CIVIC CENTER The state would provide up to 5 million in bonding to rebuild the Hartford Civic Center Coliseum The legislation also establishes an authority independent of the city government to run the civic center UNEMPLOYMENT Over the next 10 years an estimated 100000 jobs would be created under a bill that uses tax incentives and grants to attract business and industry to areas of high unemployment The potential longterm cost of the bill is estimated at 195 million in state and local tax breaks job training and loan subsidies for business However in the first year starting July 1 the program would be expected to cost only 45 million PETER REILLY BILL Prosecutors would be forced to disclose any evidence tending to prove a defendant innocent under a bill passed by the Legislature The socalled Peter Reilly bill would eliminate existing requirements that defendants must request the disclosure of any exculpatory evidence and that there be a judicial finding that the information sought is relevant in a reasonable request Peter Reilly was convicted of murdering his mother in 1979 but the charges were dismissed and in a new trial prosecution evidence was disclosed that tended show his innocence SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION Poor school districts would get more state aid for building projects under a bill passed by the Assembly while the richer towns would be limited The bill would replace the existing 50 percent reimbursement for school construction with a new formula giving towns 90 percent to 80 percent of the proiects costc JUVENILEJUSTICE REFORM A proposal to change the handling of repeat offenders in the juvenilejustice system was killed by the Assembly It would automatically have transferred cases involving serious crimes by young repeat offenders from Juvenile Court to Superior Court Under current law a person over 19 accused of murder or a second offense punishable by 20 or more years in jail can be transferred by a Juvenile Court judge to the Superior Court but the new bill would have made such transfer mandatory According to its proponents about 200 cases a year involving persons aged 19 to 16 would automatically have been transferred under the bill TEACHERS RESIDENCE In a victory for the states 34000 school teachers the Assembly passed a measure banning localities from requiring teachers to live in the town or city where they work Only two cities New Haven and Waterbury now have residency requirements but other places have considered them GARBAGE DUMPING The supremacy of local zoning laws over those of the state was reinforced when the Assembly voted to allow towns to refuse other towns garbage Some small rural towns are now forced under order of the State Department of Environmental Protection to allow the dumping of garbage from big cities The unanswered question now is what the large urban areas are going to do with their garbage since the state has ordered many of them for environmental reasons to close their incinerators and landfills SCHOOL PROFICIENCY TESTS Under a bill passed by the Assembly proficiency tests would be administered to all ninthgraders in the state and to three other grades of the local school boards choice PRESCRIBED SENTENCING On a parliamentary technicality the Senate killed a bill that sought to eliminate disparity in sentencing in criminal cases by prescribing sentences based on the crime and circumstances It would also have eliminated parole Unlike mandatory sentencing judges would have had the option of ignoring the guidelines by writing an opinion explaining why these were not thought to be applicable LIOUOR PRICES A measure originally aimed at lowering liquor prices by eliminating the nowmandatory minimum markup on liquor at the wholesale and retail level became so confused by the numerous amendments that were attached to it that the Senate finally sent it back to committee for more study killing it for this session A bill that would have created a special commission to study gambling in the state was also killed The workfare bill that would have required the state to help local welfare officers in creating work programs for people receiving local welfare aid also failed to pass
Some Way to Punish Sex!,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/08/archives/some-way-to-punish-sex.html,The New York State Senate is about to vote on two bills that would go far to erode the states usually enlightened policies on abortion and family planning One would require teenagers to notify their parents before seeking an abortion The other would limit the availability of overthecounter contraceptives Tile more worrisome billbecause it is said to have good chance of passageis the one that would deny women under 18 an abortion unless their parents are first notified Similar laws have been struck down as unconstitutional in other states A committee of the New York Bar Association has called the bill legally unacceptable noting a Supreme Court ruling that women under 18 have the same right as older women to choose an abortion Adults are required only to consult physician But whatever the legalities the policy is unwise No law will force a teenager to tell her parents that she is pregnant if she is otherwise unable to do so Perhaps a few will be forced to run for parental help But the law would also send some young women into unwanted motherhood and others in search of an abortionist willing to disobey the law and risk their lives After he vetoed a similar measure two years ago Governor Carey set up a special commission to study the matter It proposed new state standards for those who provide abortion services to young women Though some already offer conscientious counseling others do not The commission proposed that a minor seeking an abortion should sign a consent statement to indicate that she had been informed of her rights and choices As part of the process the young woman would be asked to permit notification of a parent or guardian but not to forgo the abortion if she refused The Senate bill on contraceptives is well illconceived It would almost certainly add to the states abortion load by restricting access to contraceptives that are sold without a prescription Pharmacies would continue to sell them but other outlets would first have to purchase a new state license Customers under 16 would not be able to buy birth control devices at all unless accompanied by an adult Far from inhibiting sex as the sponsors intend such restrictions on sales of contraceptives would only risk the faster spread of venereal disease Recognizing that danger the Senate committee suggests spending the license revenue on VD research It is easier to reject this bill than to follow its tortured logic
Few Democrats in Massachusetts W illingto Oppose Senator Brooke,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/08/archives/few-democrats-in-massachusetts-willing-to-oppose-senator-brooke.html,BOSTON May 7Senator Edward W Brooke the only Republican to carry Massachusetts since 1970 does not have a united party behind him Polls show new areas of vulnerability on personal and political issues and among some important population groups But Mr Brooke is a scrapper and none of the Democrats who seem like potentially serious opponents appear to be willing to risk what they already have to run against him this year He does face a contest for renomination however and the current if faint Democratic nightmare is that he might lose to a very conservative broadcaster Avi Nelson while the heavyweight Democratic candidates were ducking the race Mr Brooke became a national figure for other reasons than being the only black in the Senate Last year he led the fight for Federal financing of abortions for poor women There is a chance that antiabortion groups might test their political muscle by pouring money into the Nelson campaign But at the state Republican convention in Springfield yesterday the Senator showed how skillful and how tough a foe he plans to be in the primary campaign The endorsement of Mr Brooke which has no formal effect on the September primary had been assured but it was steamrollered through so artlessly by his allies that Mr Nelsons supporters were furious about not even getting a chance to vote against it They booed the Senator and heckled him complaining about abortion and the Panama Canal and he got angry or let himself get angry telling them In my whole political life I have never booed a Republican candidate And then he warned them that their demands for ideological purity were politically suicidal If I had voted as you would always have me vote I would not be a Republican United States Senator As a minority party in Massachusetts he warned them the Republicans must appeal to the masses of the people to win  And finally he gave them what they had been demanding saying Regardless of the rules I want a rollcall vote from this convention He won the vote 1268 to 664 about the way he had predicted it would go in an interview earlier in the week The endorsement does not assure him of renomination but most experts think his wellfinanced campaign is in little real danger and that the most Mr Nelson can hope for is from 33 to 40 percent of the primary vote The one major uncertainty is what kind of money Mr Nelson can raise with the help of the directmail king Richard A Viguerie of Falls Church Va and what he can do with it He seems unlikely to be able to outspend Mr Brooke who has nearly a halfmillion dollars on hand but the primary turnout is likely to be low and some experts here are warning against writing off Mr Nelson entirely Among the Democrats who is not in the field is at least as interesting as who is running Attorney General Francis X Bellotti and to a lesser extent Lieut Gov Thomas P ONeill 3d and Secretary of State Paul Guzzi all seemed possible winners in polls but each has decided not to run None of them seems consumed by a passion to be in the Senate and each would prefer a future run for the Statehouse For Mr Guzzi and Mr ONeill both in their early 30s the risk of a trouncing that would close future doors instead of running for almost assured reelection did not seem worth it All three are too liberal to exploit the issues Mr Nelson plans to use in challenging Mr Brooke whose voting record is very close to that of the senior Senator from Massachusetts Edward M Kennedy Mr Guzzi said that the first problem was the symbolism and the reality that he is the only black in the Senate Across the state political spectrum this was acknowledged as a key political problem although not as much it was in Mr Brookes 1966 and 1972 races but it does inhibit fundraising for opponents Since Mr Brookes divorce from his Italianborn wife polls have shown a decrease in support from voters of Italian descent Several Democrats have complained that the press has not investigated Mr Brookes personal finances confirming that their polling shows some weakness there but not enough to risk their taking it on directly In court proceedings over Mr Brookes divorce settlement some of hi s critics questioned whether his many years on the public payroll could account for the real estate he had acquired The Senator said last week My family had a little bit of money and he had made some as a lawyer before entering public office The abortion issue has solidified Mr Brooke with many liberals and his voting record on labor issues has won him plenty of contributions from union politicalaction funds He may not have their total confidence but he is no enemy and the ordinary coalition of support a Democrat builds here would be difficult to put together The Democratic field at the moment includes State Representatives Elaine Noble and Michael Connolly Miss Noble has acknowledged that she is a lesbian and Mr Connolly is best known for walk in across the state Eleanor Morgenthau an early supporter of Prisident Carter who is primarily concerned with foreign policy has said she would run and Robert C Wood former president of the University of Massachusetts is considering it John Pierce Lynch

Women's Status a Key Factor in Race by Rep. Burke,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/13/archives/womens-status-a-key-factor-in-race-by-rep-burke-two-liberals-in.html,LOS ANGELESIn three terms in Congress and two highly visible roles at the 1972 and 1976 Democratic conventions Yvonne Brathwaite Burke has come to be recognized as a symbol of the new wave in politics Now in an unusual decision Mrs Burke has chosen to give up her national office for the very uncertain Chance of being the first woman to be elected Attorney General of any state in the nountry Mrs Burke 43 years old faces difficult primary runoff and potentially an even more difficult challenge in the fall The June 6 primary pits two liberal progressiye Democrats with almost identical stands on the issues against each other The two Republicans are both conservative One is the champion of the death penalty the other is prosecutor who won a conviction against Patricia Hearst The fall election observers agree promises to reflect the vast swing of political differences that are Californias trademark with such controversial issues as homosexual rights the death penalty and perhaps even abortion probably in the forefront The key overriding question of interest to many however is whether the status of women has changed enough in peoples minds to overcome the traditionally touch rale image of the Attorney Generals office Women have ieen elected to Con gress to school boards as senators mayors and now theyre ministers said one of the leading Democrats in the state who asked not to be identified But I dont know if people are ready to elect a woman to be the top cop in the state So far they havent I think Yvopnes one of the best politicians we have he said and under the right cirthuwtances the could probably be elected to almost any jsh she wanted Except this one Mrs Burke nublicly maintains that the reason she has come back to state politics is her desire to wield a more direct influence on policy and legislation than she as one of the 435members of the Houie was able to do in Washington Associates say that privately however that she has conceded being unhappy in Washington and fatigued by the physical strain of the biweekly 3000mile trip between here and the capital With a 4yearold daughter and a sixyearold marriage she reportedly was eager to establish a working life back in California When the present Attorney General Evelle Younger announced earlier this year that he was a candidate in the Republican primary for Governor and would not seek reelection she made her decision Significantly her opponent in the June primary Burt Pines the popular Los Angeles City Attorney had already been campaigning for the job for about a year and was then favored to win Mrs Burke denies steadfastly that being a woman is a liability in the race I find it astounding that anyone thinks a woman cannot do that job the said in a recent interview Frankly I think it may be an advantage A woman who his already done g lot of things and proven herself is often put in an even higher category than a man 1sked continually while campaigning whether California voters were ready fox two women to hold the states chief law enforcement jobs with Rose Bird aready appointed Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court she says Two men held the lob for years and nothing had happened If Mrs Burke makes little of her sex as an issue she also scoffs at another potentially serious problem This in volves persistent talk around the state about her husbands former business activities From 1975 to 1976 William Burke 39 was associated with a controversial southern California health care concern called OmniRx The concern now in receivership has come under extensive investigation by a number of state and Federal agencies for possible financial and corporate illegalities Some of these are still continuing Most of the newspaper articles around the state mentioned Mr Burke at the time she announced her candidacy in February They described him specifically as a potential political liability  Frequently asked about this but more by reporters than by voters Mrs Burke invariably says it is a dead issue She says that neither she nor her husband ever had any financial interest in the concern that neither of them was ever questioned in connection with any investigation and that he as a onetime employee and consultant never had any corporate responsibility  Mr Burke who manages two funeral homes here seldom accompanies his wife to campaign functions Mrs Burkes Democratic opponent Mr Pines is very well known in southern California and won reelection last year with an overwhelming 81 percent of the vote And Mrs Burke concedes that she is weak in Los Angeles One of her campaign polls several months ago showed her with a 44 percent nme recognition in the city Her opponent had 80 percent Mr Pines on the other hand is not well known statewide He does have the larger budget of the two however and has hired one of the most expensive political management firms to run his campaign  Ironically both candidates appeal to the Fame traditionally liberal Democratic establishment political experts say The polls show the race neck and neck so far with about 45 percent of the voters undecided Mr Pines has won support from the powerful homosexual community in both Los Angeles and San Francisco and much of what is generally described here as the Jewish money from west Los Angeles Mrs Burke has virtually all of the Democratic political hierarchy behind her The outcome of the Republican race is equally unclear The two contenders are State Senator George Deukmejian of Long Beach the ruthor and leading supporter of the death penalty bill and James L Browning the former United States Attorney who won the conviction of Patricia Yea rst for bank robbery Mr Browning has suggested in his campaign that employers should have more access to potential employees criminal records  Mr Pines the Democrat who opposes this idea cites it as an example of what the fall election portends Whether I or my opponent win he said that race will show fundamental political differences Its not as if a liberal Republican was running There will he a classic leftright split over our views of the law
NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/14/archives/new-jersey-weekly-new-jersey-journal.html,RECENT maneuvering in the State House has all the appearance of the beginning of a campaign to raise state taxes late this year or early next Governot Byrne and Dr Fred G Burke the states Commissioner of Education have cut 27 million from the 128millionayear budget for the education of handicapped children The cuts would be effective for the 197980 school year beginning July 1979 If the funds are to be restored more revenue would be needed Mentalhealth forces are already in motion demanding more money for the state psychiatric hospitals Ann Klein the Commissioner of Human Services has said that the hospitals are so short of money that those not already disaccredited may soon be Without accreditation from the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation which is based in Chicago hospitals are not elgible for Medicaid and Medicaire reimbursements from the Federal Government  A joint committee of the State Senate and Assembly already is studying taxes Increasing the 5 percent state sales tax by a penny would bring in about 200 million a year How much an increased income tax would bring in depends on how much it is raised However in accordance with the State Constitution revenue from the income tax would have to be spent in a way that would reduce local property taxes One reason for the push for new taxes is that the income tax passed in the summer of 1976 is not bringing in as much revenue as had been predicted 800 million next year instead of 1 billion With the state obligated to pay 90 percent of the 33 billionayear in publicschool costs the State Treasury may indeed need more money for the 197980 budget The cold rainy weather of April and May has delayed the harvest of crops in the state The only vegetable going to market at all is spinach and not much of that Usually by now aspargus and lettuce are being offered in quantities The states Department of Agriculture said that some bibb lettuce and small amount of asparagus might be available next week a month or so late The early tomatoes were killed by frosts  The New Brunswick train station was in such bad shape that it cost more than 113000 to spruce it up The walls and floors were filthy and had holes them When the repainted and refloored station was formally unveiled the other day it was

front for a time but ended up sixth  The fight over restricting smoking in public places especially restaurants goes on and on The next round will come Thursday when the states Public Health Council is scheduled to learn from Attorney General John J Degnan whether the regulations it adopted on April 10 are legal There have been complaints that the rulings were never proposed publicly if so they could be voided The opposition to the regulations has come not from the two million or so New Jerseyans who smoke cigarettes but from the Legislature and the New Jersey HotelMotel and Restaurant Association The nosmoking regulations are scheduled to go into effect on July 1 By taking up any deficiencies the rulings on Thursday the Public Health Council will have time to make any needed changes in them for publication in the June issue of the New Jersey Register This would allow the regulations to still become effective on July 1  Assemblywoman Mary Keating Croce Democrat of

POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/14/archives/long-island-weekly-politics-for-duryea-a-career-gamble.html,THE Island is about to lose its most influential state legislator as Perry B Duryea the minority leader and former Speaker of the Assembly prepares to give up his Assembly seat for his bid for Governor He cannot run for both and his term in the Assembly expires at the end of the year In effect Mr Duryea will be throwing the dice with his political career If he loses the gubernatorial election he will be out of public office completely and presumably return to his fishing business in Montauk If he wins he will of course be Governor starting Jan 1 If Mr Duryea does leave office what does it mean for the Island in terms of losing a powerful voice in the Legislature Or put another way what has Mr Duryea done for the Island As with other political questions there are differences of opinion Mr Duryea and his fellow Republicans contend that he has done much for the Island that rankandfile legislator would not have been able to do Democrats not surprisingly disagree Indeed it is obvious that this will be one of the issues in the gubernatorial campaign with both sides already researching the record With the immodesty typical of candidates Mr Duryea recently ticked off long list of his accomplishments for the Island He cited his fights along with the Nassau Republican chairman Joseph M Margiotta for more state school aid We always fought the schoolaid battle Mr Duryea said Without my role it would be far worse than it is He mentioned the tuitionassistance program which provides state aid for college students the growth of Stony Brook as a State University center and the killing of a proposed fourth metropolitan area jetport at Calverton Henry Mund of East Hampton Mr Duryeas longtime executive assistant cited among other accomplishments two major state actions within Mr Duryeas East End district  the placing of an oceanscience laboratory at Montauk and the state purchase of 800 acres of land from ocean to bay at Napeague adjacent to the Hither Hills State Park Arthur Bergmann Suffolks chief deputy County Executive like several others said that the huge healthsciences building at Stony Brook and the handling of local bills that Suffolk County Executive John V N Klein considers important could be credited to Mr Duryea Perrys got the muscle Mr Bergmann said However a decisive dissent was sounded by a Democrat Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer of Long Beach who as chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee is the thirdranking leader of the Democratic majority in the Assembly and thus the most influential Island Democrat in the Legislature Mr Kremer has obviously researched the Duryea record in anticipation of the gubernatorial campaign although he denied that he was acting as a hatchet man for the Governor Speaking of Mr Duryea he said He will not have anything to talk about what he has done for Long Island He said that other than the projects D within Mr Duryeas district such developments as the growth of the State University Center at Stony Brook and state school aid were either purely coincidental or results of former Gov Nelson A Rockefellers efforts to curry the favor of Long Island voters Mr Kremer said that as the minority leader Mr Duryea was relatively powerless and that as Speaker he overextended himself for his district but you cant call that Long Island Mr Kremer laughed as he quipped Carey could say the Long Iland Expressway is his too The truth as it usually does probably lies somewhere between the two viewpoints To at least one observer Mr Duryea and Mr Margiotta were annually in the forefront of the fight for more school aid for the Island and by extension for the rest of the state Credit for the growth of the State University is difficult to assess but politics has certainly been a factor in at least two of the four university centers in the state The late State Senate majority leader Walter J Mahoney of Buffalo is generally credited with promoting the expansion of a nearly bankrupt private university in Buffalo into the State University Center there The university center at Binghamton is at least partly the responsibility of two local boys George L Hinman Mr Rockefellers longtime friend and counsel and the current Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson of Binghamton Yet geography and dispersion of resources also partly explains the location of the university centers in Buffalo Binghamton Albany the state capital and the Island one of the major downstate population centers Still Mr Duryeas influence and power had to he somewhat of a factor in Stony Brooks growth In any event that clout however powerful will be lost in the next Legislature Who will fill the power vacuum If the Democrats retain control of the Assembly as expected Mr Kremer will clearly be the most influential Long Islander in the Legislature As Ways and Means chairman he holds the purse strings in the Assembly since his committee handles every bill dealing with state spending Even a Republican colleague Assemblyman Robert C Wertz of Smithtown acknowledged Kremer will be the most powerful figure He said that Mr Kremer had already been instrumental in added state school aid this year Were it not for Jerry Kremer it would have been a lot lower Mr Wertz added On the Republican side Senator John D Caemmerer of Williston Park likely to be the most influential Long Islander in the Senate majority A former Republican leader of North Hempstead he is close to Mr Margiotta and presides over the tightly disciplined Nassau delegation in the Legislature a role Mr _Margiotta filled until he left the Assembly 18 months ago Mr Caemmerer is even mentioned as a possible Senate majority leader if Mr Anderson retires He led the fight to ban Medicaid financing of abortion over Mr Andersons opposition and at one point directly attacked Senator Anderson on the floor of the Senate  a rare departure from Republican protocol and discipline However the 49yearold Mr Caemmerer would have to overcome at least two hurdles before becoming majority leader These are the tradition that the job should go to an upstater and a suspicion among many Republicans that he is too close indeed subject to some say Mr Margiotta whose heavy hand has not endeared him to many of his fellow Republicans outside the Island Indeed Mr Margiotta lost the bid for Republican state chairman 18 months ago at least partly because of the enemies he has made with his hardnosed attitude within Republican councils 
Drive Begins in Albany to Put Initiatives or Referendums on Ballot,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/14/archives/drivebegins-in-albany-to-put-initiatives-or-referendums-on-ballot.html,ALBANY May 12The first steps in a drive to put initiatives or referendums on the New York State ballot were undertaken this week as legislators heard arguments from groups on both sides of the issue The sponsor of a constitutional amenament providing for such direct legislation Senator Ronald B Stafford Republican of Peru said his bill had no chance of passage this year But he added that he would continue his efforts because it is an evolving idea Under Senator Staffords proposal the initiative process would allow voters to sponsor legislation directly by a petition signed by 5 to 8percent of the number of voters who had voted in the last gubernatorial electiondepending on the type of legislation The referendum process would allow 5 percent of the voters to petition for the right of approving or disapproving existing laws At a Senate hearing the proposal was criticized by spokesmen for several pub1 lieemployee unions They said that the referendum and initiative process would prove too costly to the state which would have to publish referendums statewide and to sponsors and opponents of a measure They argued that the process would make the Legislature less effective and would give too much power to organizations that could afford to mount expensive campaigns publicizing their issues Tiny groups of individuals with finan cial resources said James Featherstonliaugh counsel to the Civil Service Employees Association are allowed to capture the process of legislation simply by spending money and thus making initiative a club in the hands of the very people it was designed to protect against Good government groups however said that the process would result in fair hearing on issues encourage interest in government and allow the voters to bypassan unresponsive Legislature It will return to the people what is basically our right said Paul Feiner Westchester County resident who has lobbied for initiative procedures there Twentythree states now have some form if direct legislation Following were other developments in the capital this week The Senate approved a bill allowing parents to excuse their children from classes that have as their objectives the formation of moral values on human reproduction and that discuss sexual promiscuity methods of contraception and abortion The bill similar versions of which have been vetoed by the Governor faces an uncertain future in the Assembly The Senate overwhelmingly passed resolution proposing that the name of a 96acre state office complex adjacent to the Capitol be renamed Nelson A Rockefeller Plaza The former Republican Governor was the driving force behind construction of the mall which is now officially known as the Empire State Plaza A bill that would change the name has also been introduced The Assembly passed legislation that would place under the Legislatures control all Federal funds spent by the state government much of which is now ap propriated by welfare and schoolaid formulas but some of which is under the Governors discretion The Senate which earlier passed a similar measure is expected to approve this measure and Governor Carey has said he is favorably disposed to it Legislation calling for establishment of a temporary state commission to study the economic needs of the Long Island Sound regionincluding tne possibility of a midSuffolktoConnecticut bridgewas passed by the Senate The bill calls for the committee to report its findings to the Governor by March 31 of the year after its approval A renewed effort to get public approval to extend the states Job Development Authoritys powers to include securing loans to finance expansion of manufacturing plants and other industry was passed by the Assembly Because tjte change would require a constitutional amendment and must be passed by two Legislatures it would be at least another year before the measure could be brought to a public vote again A similar measure was rejected narrowly by the electorate last fall

Waddill Jr would be tried a second time on a charge of murdering a baby girl who survived an abortion attempt Dr Waddills first trial which ended May 5 lasted 16 weeks and there was some question whether the prosection would be willing to go through another potentially long and costly trial But District Attorney Robert Chatterton told newsmen Yes we will try him again Judge H Warren Knight of Superior Court said he would set a new trial date June 2 The central issue in the 42yearold doctors trial was whether the infant was alive when Dr Waddill saw her or whether she had suffered brain

astronomers said the rings were complete and not partial arcs of material Like Saturn Uranuss rings are composed of either ice or iron but are much thinner they said Peter M Goldreich professor of planetary science and astronomy at Caltech disclosed the discoveries Friday at a seminar for Caltech alumni The observations were made on April 10 by Eric Persson of Hale Observatories using the

Assembly Votes Stiffer Penalties for Youth Violence,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/18/archives/assembly-votes-stiffer-penalties-for-youth-violence-amendment-is.html,ALBANY May 17  The Democraticcontrolled Assembly today approved package of bills designed to toughen penalties against juveniles who commit violent crimes and Governor Carey announced a proposal for 52 million in additicnal spending this year on the states criminaljustice system The two moves were part of the now almostdaily effort by Democrats here to offer new evidence of their toughness on the crime issue in an election year when crime is expected to be a major theme And in keeping with the partisan tone the Republicans denounced the Democrats exforts as inadequate and offered their own alternatives Republicans in the Scratet agreed today on the rough outlines of an anticrime package they would unteil tomorrow We will see that we will be aiming at the hard core recidivist and the most violent juvenile and be placing them in secure detention for a longer period of time said Assemblyman Howard L Lasher DemocratLiberal of Brooklyn who sponsored the juvenilecrime package It does nothing and were iust kidding the public Assemblyman Dominick L DiCarlo Republican  Conservative of Brooklyn charged Its a public relations gimmick thats caught on well Amendment Is Offered The Democratic bills would increase sentences requiring secure placement Tor juvenile offenders for longer periods than are now required for juvenile  crimes In addition 13yearolds would be subject to such sentencesfor violent crimes in some cases in which they are not subject now The bill would also permit Family Court judges to set down sentences of up to six months would strengthen the penalties for repeat offenders and would make adjustments in probation more difficult But the Republicans led by Mr Di Carlo charged that the problem lay in the juvenilejustice system itself and offered an amendment to the bill that would move certain categories of juvenile crime  among them murder kidnapping arson crimes with guns and crimes involving serious injury intentionally committed  from the juvenile system to the regular criminaljustice system The juvenile system is not geared to the kind of violent felonies now being committed by juveniles Mr Di Carlo said But the Republican amendments which are embodied in a bill already approved by the Republicancontrolled Senate were ruled not germane and the Democratic bills passed overwzelmingly 20 New Trial Parts Urged The proposals of the two parties on juvenile crime are only part of their onslaught on the crime issue Last week for example the Assembly approved bills providing minimum sentences for certain crimes and creating a new category of violent felonies that would be subject to moresevere penalties The Republican proposals tomorrow will be in response to the Democratic bills Mr Careys spending proposals involved creating 20 new trial parts in addition to those already financed add more spaces for the confinement of violent youths provide more funds for District Attorneys and add 3000 cells to the states prison system by 1982 We must be and are prepared to back up those programs with the resources necessary to guarantee they are carried out Mr Carey said in a statement On another controversial issue with electoral impact Democratic legislative ealers announced their alternative to a Senatepassed bill requiring that parents be notified before a teenager could undergo an abortion The bill which is supported by the Carey administration would require that a doctor inform a teenagers parents that she was having an abortion unless she signed a formal statement requesting that he not do so In addition Mr Carey announced a bill appropriating 1 million for programs necessary to provide services to those pregnant minors who choose to have their babies Its a compromise said Assemblyman Clifford E Wilson DemocratLiberal of Queens who is sponsoring the alternative notification bill Mr Wilson also supports the stronger Senatepassed proposal and said he hoped both bills would be passed But Senator Frank Padavan RepublicanConservative of Queens denounced the alternative as a copout vehicle of voluntary notification Elsewhere in the capital there were these developments FREETRADE ZONE The Senate passed and sent to the Assembly a bill that would free the international loan activities of New York City banks from state and city taxes and regulations Designed to lure the international banking business back to New York the bill is expected to clear the Assembly and be signed by Governor Carey BUFFALO SCHOOLS Governor Carey formally unveiled a 3 million plan designed to save the Buffalo schcol system from bankruptcy GUILTYBUTINSANE CATEGORY The Senate approved a bill that would create a new category of plea guilty but mentally ill als an alternative to not guilty by reason of insanity MALPRACTICE INSURANCE The Senate approved a bill requiring that any payment over 100000 after attorneys fees and expenses in medical malpractice cases for pain and suffering be placed in an investiment fund with the interest paid to the plaintiff quarterly This would reduce the cost of malpractice insurance PLAIN LANGUAGE Governor Carey signed into law a bill that would require that all amendments proposticns

Italy's New Law Not Expected to Reduce Illegal Abortions Significantly,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/20/archives/italys-new-law-not-expected-to-reduce-illegal-abortions.html,ROME May 19Medical and legal specialists here regard the abortion law enacted by the Italian Parliament yesterday as liberal but they expect it to be difficult to carry out These specialists also expect that the bill the first such in this Roman Catholic country will not significantly reduce the number of clandestine abortions The law passed by the Senate yesterday 160 to 148 and by the Chamber of Deputies last month 308 to 275 goes into effect in two weeks It allows a woman over 18 years old to obtain an abortion virtually on demand if having the child would compromise her economic social family or psychological wellbeing After the first 90 days abortion is permitted only if the pregnancy or childbirth seriously threatens the life of the mother or if birth defects are a risk to the mothers physical or mental health Doctors May Refuse Doctors and medical staff may refuse to perform abortions if they register as conscientious objectors within six weeks from yesterday In hospitals where some doctors refuse to perform abortions others must be provided to meet requests for the operation But specialists are concerned that bringing in outside doctors will be complicated and cause delays Abortions performed in staterun hospitals under the new law are covered by the state health insurance plan In a lastminute change the minimum age of women allowed to have abortions on demand was raised from 16 to 18 Minors requesting abortions must have the consent of both parentsa concession by the Communists Socialists and conservatives to the Christian Democrats who opposed legislation permitting any abortions except those in which the life of the mother was in danger Feminists Are Angered The compromise infuriated feminist groups that had called for free and immediate abortion on demand with no questions asked Under the law women must consult a doctor and wait seven days before they can have the operation The greatest number of clandestine abortions are performed on 16toI8yearolds and even younger women a feminist and legal specialist commented The greatest number of women who die from backalley abortions or commit suicide out of shame are the youngest ones Under the new law the selfhelp clinics the younger girls used to go to can no longer perform abortions What are they going to do nowgo back to parsley They need the approval of both parentsboth parents Strong infusions of parsley are supposed to induce hemorrhaging and are used by some women who want to abort The parsley sprig worn in the hair or pinned to blouses at demonstrations has become the symbol of those who favor free choice on abortion Question of Availability Specialists also doubt that abortion will become that much more available In many places the staterun clinics women are supposed to go to for the first consultation do not exist In Rome only 10 out of 33 clinics have been set up so far a specialist said although she conceded that the law provides funds for more clinics In some regions they are nonexistent Medical experts as well as feminists were also worried that the countrys overcrowded and notoriously inefficient bigcity hospitals would be unable to handle the thousands of requests expected each month Now we have to concentrate our efforts on making women aware of their new rights and getting them to demand them another feminist said We also have a lot of work ahead of us to see that the new law is enforced that women are not turned away at the hospital door
Reign of Terror in Italy Bolsters The Catholic‐Communist Alliance,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-reign-of-terror-in-italy-bolsters-the.html,ROME May 19Italy is undergoing a unique experiment an uneasy symbiosis between the strangest Marxist movement in the West and the Roman Catholic party that has furnished all heads of government for the last 32 years The surge of Red Brigades terrorism and the tragedy of Aldo Moro liav strengthened the odd association of the main political forces whose ideological fountainheads are as far apart as the Vatican and Moscow The televised state memorial service for the former Prime Minister in the Basilica of St John Lateran last Saturday made the partnership of Catholic and Marxist politicians visible to millions of Italians There were the foremost Christian Democratic leaders and the secretary general of the Communist Party Enrico Berlinguer who was imperturbable and looking quite at home in a church The aged Pope Paul VI seemed implicitly to approve of the attendance of Mr Berlinguer and other ranking members of his partyand maybe also of their participation in national aefairswhen he blessed all those in the basilica In the piazza outside the white banners of the Christian Democratic Party and the red flags of Communism mingled peacefully as they have done in several antiterrorism rallies in various cities since the Moro kidnanning in March But the new respect that the two parties Me displaying toward each other is willed by their top leaders rather than by theft base Mediumlevel party workers and rank and file in both camps are bafiled by the collaboration after 10 years J cenflict Though there are veterans of old struggles and impatient young activists who are pressing for new confrontations the formula of practical collaboration between Catholics and Communists responds to the requirements of the country said Giovanni Galloni deputy secretary of the Christian Democratic Party adding that the country needs to be united and that in politics one never knows what is provisional and what is not The secretary general of the Christian Democrats Benigno Zaccagnini recently noted a fresh spirit of political and popular solidarity in the face of the terrorist challenge although he warned against confused strategies and impossible ideological admixtures Mr Zaccagnini an old friend of Mr Moros appeared to mean that Christian Democrats and Communists despite their present cooperation should maintain their philosophic and political identities For the first time nonetheless there is no immediate substitute for the partnership between the two biggest parties The Christian Democratic floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies Flaminicio Piccoli acknowledged this by telling the nation in a broadcast that the local elections early in the week in which the Christian Democrats gained over the Communists would not alter the governmental formula He also paid tribute to what he termed the newly won sense of responsibility of the Communist Party which he suggested had alienated extremists Similarly the Communist apparatus insisted that the collaboration with the Christian Democrfats was here to stay If the terrorists in a shortrange strategy aimed at isolating the Communists again they failed In the tortuous and often contradictory calculations of the extremist underground the longterm objectives seem different The theoreticians of the Red Brigades it is said are rationalizing violence as a means to push the Communist Party which they condemn as a tool of imperialism into a fullfledged coalition with the Christian Democrats Then the ultraleftists reckon the Communist apparatus will be exposed as a fullfledged accomplice of capitalism the multinational corporations and police repression and will lose all support in the working class a popular uprising will follow paving the way for a true Communist system Aim Moderation Respectability In contrast with such a lurid scenario Mr Berlinguers party is striving to appear eminently moderate and respectable and it has even begun a rare exercise in selfcriticism Outsiders learn of the reappraisal mainly through the partys theoretical weekly Rinascita which recently conceded that Communists who had explained away the violence of the last few years as the result of plots by disguised Fascists and by secret services might have been wrong and that yes there was authentic subversion from the left In the same vein of selfcriticism Rinascita deplored the obsessive tendency of gerne comrades to depict Italy es a putrid society that was about to fall to pieces Actually it maintained there are great healthy energies in this country Many foreigners who have for years distractedly read about yet another governmental crisis would add chronic political instability to the catalogue of national woes A country where the average life span of an administration is less than 10 months seems brittle and unreliable indeed Strange to say on the other hand the political system since World War Il has been remarkably stable despite the frequent performances of musical chairs Mr Moro was Prime Minister five times for a total of three years and four months and during his 28 years in national politics he also served in Cabinet posts under other prime ministers A small group of Christian Democratic politicians have almost always been in government in one capacity or another for a generation The present Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti who is 59 years old was in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Alcide De Gasped the late founder of the Christian Democratic Party 31 years ago and has belonged to nearly every Cabinet since He probably knows more about how the cumbersome bureaucracy worksor does not workthan anyone else During the current national crisis he has managed to keep his truly Roman calmhe is the first native Roman to be head of government since the period before Fascismwhile muting his caustic wit Another veteran is former Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani An ambitious energetic and flinty tactician he has at times advocated cooperation with leftwing forces and at other times seemed to be a conservative As Speaker of the Senate Mr Fanfani is constitutionally the next in line to the President Giovanni Leone also a former Christian Democratic Prime Minister who is not expected to be a candidate for reelection when his sevenyear term ends in December At age 70 Mr Fanfani may seek the presidency a prize that has eluded him three times and that would almost certainly have gone to Mr Moro Other possible candidates for the presidency are Prime Minister Andreotti and Mr Zaccagnini the Christian Democratic Party secretary A 66yearold pediatrician from Ravenna Mr Zaccagnini known as Honest Zac is one of the most popular party leaders He had long been a close friend of Mr Moros but had always kept out of the partys intereine struggles and intrigues Political stability is one thing however and political effectiveness is quite another and many agree that the Christian Democrats have often been their own worst enemy Factionalism in Governing Party In some periods the Christian Democrats have been split into no fewer than nine fiefs each with an insatiable appetite for funds to finance its propaganda and campaigning and for patronage to pay off political debts The factionalism and lust for influence have long been denounced as major soaces of corruption in the state machinery and in the maze of semiofficial agencies that are known as the subgovernment Furthermore the long chain of scandals in which Christian Democrats have been embroiled over the years has obscured their partys genuine achievements It can take a good deal of the credit for the quick recovery after the ravages of war and for what came to be known as Italys economic miracle of the 1950s and early 60s What have the pious Christian Democrats ever done asked Angela Digennaro a law student from Naples They have made the rich richer spread corruption and never cared for the impoverished of my city or poor people in general Her views may not be just but they echo what many young people think The Christian Democrats are the party of the rich and the priests A party worker who did not want to be named said People still believe that the Pope and the bisops tell us what to do Actually who puts the heat on us are the managers of big industries the trade unions and even the small farmers who are good for hundreds of thousands of votes The importance of the church as a votegetter for the Christian Democrats has undoubtedly diminished since the watershed victory in 1948 at the height of the cold war which had intensified fears of a Communist takeover The Christian Democratic Party is still strongest in the regions where the clergy are most respected and influential such as the mainland near Venice and other areas in the northeast But Rome has a proCommunist Mayor despite the presence of the Vatican and hundreds of church institutions Since the pontificate of John XXIII 195863 the Roman Catholic hierarchy has gradually lessened its support of the party and its candidates A vast majority among the 278 Italian bishops are conservative and show little understanding of the recent changes in popular culture and lifestyle The hierarchy fought the introduction of divorce to the last but could not stave it off and it engaged in a virtual crusade against the abortion measure just approved by Parliament I do not tell my bishop that I let young people play rock music and dance in the parish hall Saturday nights a young priest in a small place near Cassino confided I hope the bishop never finds out If youngsters could not get some fun at the parish they would go to the Communist club There is nothing else to do in our town The Tide Turned in 1948 The Communist Party with its tightly knit grassroots organization is Italys counterchurch he continued It matches each parish with a party section religious faith with a secular faith Like the church the party provides a feeling of togetherness and security that Italians find nowhere else outside their families During the first years after the war Italy seemed fated to be engulfed by Communism in 1948 the tide turned Barred from national government the Communists conquered many city halls and Communist mayors and other local officeholders in the red belt from Bolo gna to Perugia built reputations as efficient and reasonably honest administrators By now more than half of the 56 million Italians live in areas from Turin to Naples where local government is in the hands of Communists Having advanced in about every election in 30 years the Communists represent 34 percent of the voters the Christian Democratic share is 40 percent The Italian party which has long ceased calling for revolution is officially committed to social reforms and professes respect for religion The wife and children of Mr Berlin guer the Communist leader go to mass every Sunday Mr Berlinguer has contributed a new phrase to the convoluted Italian political jargonhistorical compromise meaning an offer of a longterm alliance between the Catholic party and the Communists At first most Christian Democrats scoffed at the proposal but he kept wooing their party For decades Christian Democratic prime ministers had been able to govern with the backing of small moderate parties when these occasional allies lost ground the dominant partys options dwindled Labor Leader Calls for Harder Work At the same time labor unrest mounted The hot autumn of 1969 replete with strikes and industrial sabotage was the turning point Italy ran up a world record in working hours lost in walkouts and absenteeism the economic miracle vanished and la dolce vita the sweet life soured Some Christian Democratic factions and the economic interest groups behind them became convinced that only Mr Berlinguers party could restore discipline and productivity Their attitude reflects acquiescence in a new role for the Communist Party simply because it has muscle in organized labor As if to prove that the party was able to deliver the leader of the strongest labor organization Luciano Lama a Communist stunned Italians earlier this year by telling them bluntly that they must work harder Mr Lamas Italian General Confederation of Labor which claims 43 million members has been allied since 1969 with two former rivalsthe Italian Confederation of Labor Syndicates which claims 28 million and was originally controlled by Christian Democrats and the Italian Union of Labor a moderate leftwing group with 11 million members For some time the two smaller organizations were often more combative than the Communistled confederation All three have lately been outflanked and savagely fought by small ultramdttant groups of workers who beat up foremen wreck machine tools and start fires A showdown occurred at the Alfa Romeo works at Arese near Milan The established unions had agreed with the management of the stateowned concern to do overtime work on six Saturdays to enable it to fill a backlog of orders Farleft labor groups influenced by the Red Brigades branded the overtime pact as a capitalist plot to take work from the many jobless and threatened workers who were to participate Communists manned counterpickets at the plant gates to repel any attack There was none and production was normala sign that the militant mool may be waning and that the large majority of workers properly led will not be intimidated by tha extreme right For months the Communists have also made it plain that they favor sterner security laws to fight the terrorism Such reasonableness has brought the party close to sharing governmental power In tortuous negotiations in which Mr Moro played a key role an agreement was reached earlier this year under which the Communists in Parliament would vote for the Government and would be consulted on all major decisions Not everyone was happy A new group of younger Christian Democratic leaders that has emerged in the past year wants the party to reemphasize the antiCommunist line that was so successful with the voters 30 years ago The Moro case reinforced the neoconservative current which has its center in Milan where one of its leaders is Massimo de Carolis a lawyer and a freshman member of Parliament Another advocate of a tougher antiCommunist line is Umberto Agnelli general manager of Fiat the huge car manufacturer and brother of Giovanni Agnelli its president The rightofcenter faction contends that the partys national leadership has been in power far too long and has made too many deals with Mr Berlinguers apparatus without realizing how the rank and file feel about Communism Mr Berlinguers historical compromise is being criticized also by many Communists though rarely in public For 30 years we were told that the Christian Democratic Party was the enemy said Renato Terzani a pharmacist at Marino in the hills south of Rome Now the Christian Democrats are supposed to be our friends I just do not understand and a lot of other comrades dont Many stay aWay from section meetings and the party has trouble recruiting young members in Marino A Milanese architecture student Franco Pellegrino commented We want revolution to sweep away the Christian Democrats and the entire structure of the unjust Italian society Maybe Berlinguer speaks of an alliance with the Christian Democrats just to get to power To me and my friends such a strategy is Jesuitism Something Entirely New Mr Pellegrino ence active in the Communist Youth Federation and now a member of one of the many small radical groups outside the Communist machine which call themselves autonomi explained that be did not approve of the killing of Mr Moro but sympathized with the objectives of the Red Brigadesdestruction of the existing society to build some thing entirely new He was vague about the architecture of the new society A middleaged Communist official who did not want to be identified remarked The apparatus is facing a tough dilemma either it steps up the fight against extremists inevitably draws even closer to the Christian Democrats and alienates even more comrades or it shifts the party line again to the left and has to jettison Berlinguer So far Mr Berlinguer appears to be in control of the inner councilsthe ninemember secretariat and the 33member directorate Even such former Stalinists in those bodies as Giancarlo Pajetta or the functionary who maintains liaison with Moscow Ugo Pecchioli profess support for the historic compromise Other less known members of the apparatus might change their allegiance quickly if the party was to suffer electoral setbacks and Mr Berlinguers line was challenged Although the party says it favors political pluralism and democratic methods it has never held a really open policy debate and it quickly expels dissenters In Leninist fashion decisions are made by a few powerful people at the top Others Critical of the Soft Line Luigi Longo a wartime resistance leader who was Mr Berlinguers predecessor as secretary generalhe now bears the ceremonial title of party presidentis known to be critical of the soft line Other former Stalinists and new hardliners are believed to be lying low at party headquarters biding their time The party worker who spoke of the dilemma confided that the atmosphere at headquarters was strained Many people like to compare the national crisis to the turbulent period after World War 1 when striking workers and the police and leftists and rightists clashed almost daily until the nation was sickened by all the violence and applauded Mussolinis march on Rome in 1922 Now however the chances of a rightist backlash or a military coup detat seem remote The parties that can be labeled neoFascist do not poll more than 6 percent of the vote though there is an underground that has been setting off bombs and doing other mischief for years but nothing comparable to the deadly efficiency of the Red Brigades A leftofcenter historian who has many  radicals among his students at Rome University Rosario Romeo maintained an interview that there was no rightwing dictator on the horizon and recalled that the republics armed forces had never been seriously involved hi political activity He stressed that what was going to happen still depended above all on the Christian Democrats He recognized that the party had reacted to the Moro kidnapping with a show of unity and had refused to make a deal with the terrorists Nevertheless Prok fessor Rosario insisted the shortterm outlook is grim Asked whether there was any hope at all he replied Yes For the first time in many years politicians seem willing again to assume responsibility
Reign of Terror in Italy Bolsters The Catholic‐Communist Alliance,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/20/archives/reign-of-terror-in-italy-bolsters-the-catholiccommunist-alliance.html,ROME May 19Italy is undergoing a unique experiment an uneasy symbiosis between the strongest Marxist movement in the West and the Roman Catholic party that has furnished all heads of government for the last 32 years The surge of Red Brigades terrorism and the tragedy of Aldo Moro have strengthened the odd association of the main political forces whose ideological fountainheads are as far apart as the Vatican and Moscow The televised state memorial service for the former Prime Minister in the Basilica of St John Lateran last Saturday made the partnership of Catholic and Marxist politicians visible to millions of Italians There were the foremost Christian Democratic leaders and the secretary general of the Communist Party Enrico Berlinguer who was imperturbable and looking quite at home in a church The aged Pope Paul VI seemed implicitly to approve of the attendance of Mr Berlinguer and other ranking members of his partyand maybe also of their participation in national affairswhen he blessed all those in the basilica In the piazza outside the white banners of the Christian Democratic Party and the red flags of Communism mingled peacefully as they have done in several antiterrorism rallies in various cities since the Moro kidnapping in March But the new respect that the two parties are displaying toward each other is willed by their top leaders rather than by their base Mediumlevel party workers and tilt rank and file in both camps are baffled by the collaboration after 30 years af conflict Though there are veterans of old struggles and impatient young activists who are pressing for new confrontations the formula of practical collaboration between Catholics and Communists responds to the requirements of the country said Giovanni Galloni deputy secretary of the Christian Democratic Party adding that the country needs to be united and that in politics one never knows what is provisional and what is not The secretary general of the Christian Democrats Benigno Zaccagnini recently noted a fresh spirit of political and popular solidarity in the face of the terrorist challenge although he warned against confused strategies and impossible ideological admixtures Mr Zaccagnini an old friend of Mr Moros appeared to mean that Christian Democrats and Communists despite their present cooperation should maintain their philosophic and political identities For the first time nonetheless there is no immediate substitute for the partnership between the two biggest parties The Christian Democratic floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies Flaminicio Piccoli acknowledged this by telling the nation in a broadcast that the local elections early in the week in which the Christian Democrats gained over the Communists would not alter the governmental formula He also paid tribute to what he termed the newly won sense of responsibility of the Communist Party which he suggested had alienated extremists Similarly the Communist apparatus insisted that the collaboration with the Christian Democrfats was here to stay If the terrorists in a shortrange strategy aimed at isolating the Communists again they failed In the tortuous and often contradictory calculations of the extremist underground the longterm objectives seem different The theoreticians of the Red Brigades it is said are rationalizing violence as a means to push the Communist Party which they condemn as a tool of imperialism into a fullfledged coalition with the Christian Democrats Then the ultraleftists reckon the Communist apparatus will be exposed as a fullfledged accomplice of capitalism the multinational corporations and police repression and will lose all support in the working class a popular uprising will follow paving the way for a true Communist system Aim Moderation Respectability In contrast with such a lurid scenario Mr Berlinguers party is striving to appear eminently moderate and respectable and it has even begun a rare exercise in selfcriticism Outsiders learn of the reappraisal mainly through the partys theoretical weekly Rinascita which recently conceded that Communists who had explained away the violence of the last few years as the result of plots by disguised Fascists and by secret services might have been wrong and that yes there was authentic subversion from the left In the same vein of selfcriticism Rinascita deplored the obsessive tendency of some comrades to depict Italy es a putrid society that was about to fall to pieces Actually it maintained there are great healthy energies in this country Many foreigners who have for years distractedly read about yet another governmental crisis would add chronic political instability to the catalogue of national woes A country where the average life span of an administration is less than 10 months seems brittle and unreliable indeed Strange to say on the other hand the political system since World War Il has been remarkably stable despite the frequent performances of musical chairs Mr Moro was Prime Minister five times for a total of three years and four months and during his 28 years in national politics he also served in Cabinet posts under other prime ministers A small group of Christian Democratic politicians have almost always been in government in one capacity or another for a generation The present Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti who is 59 years old was in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Alcide De Gasped the late founder of the Christian Democratic Party 31 years ago and has belonged to nearly every Cabinet since He probably knows more about how the cumbersome bureaucracy worksor does not workthan anyone else During the current national crisis he has managed to keep his truly Roman calmhe is the first native Roman to be head of government since the period before Fascismwhile muting his caustic wit Another veteran is former Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani An ambitious energetic and flinty tactician he has at times advocated cooperation with leftwing forces and at other times seemed to be a conservative As Speaker of the Senate Mr Fanfani is constitutionally the next in line to the President Giovanni Leone also a former Christian Democratic Prime Minister who is not expected to be a candidate for reelection when his sevenyear term ends in December At age 70 Mr Fanfani may seek the presidency a prize that has eluded him three times and that would almost certainly have to Mr Moro Other possible candidates for the presidency are Prime Minister Andreotti and Mr Zaccagnini the Christian Democratic Party secretary A 66yearold pediatrician from Ravenna Mr

ART Imitation of Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/westchester-weekly-art-imitation-of-life.html,HARTFORD THE Tapestry Room at the Wadsworth Atheneum no longer houses tapestries as its regular visitors know but instead has American paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries These are temporarily acting as a backdrop to six lifesize figures by Duane Hanson an artist in Americana whose reputation should soon be rivaling Norman Rockwells However with the distraction of the pictures and the crowds that are currently breaking attendance records at this Hartford institution the sculpture is discovered almost inadvertently Spectators find themselves circumventing not other humans but polyester resin facimiles thereof  authentic down to the last wristwatch and pimple As if to add resonance to the Bicentennial rhetoric about whence we have come and wither were going Mr Hansons statue of a construction worker takes a boxlunch break a few feet from Thomas Eakinss portrait of the artist John McClure Hamilton Nearby an obese woman sizzles herself in an imaginary sun with Thomas Coles Etna From Taormina behind her while on the other side of the room an elderly workman droops over a dolly Farther down in the gallery a photographer in full regalia crouches under Revolutionary War scenes by John Trumbull while a glassyeyed waitress loiters within range of the photographers lens A bespectacled young female consumer with pot belly and packages completes the cast which John Singleton Copleys picture of Jeremiah Lee overlooks The very style of Lees elegant silk hose seems to mark the sleaziness of the sculptured figures The figures are in a way leftovers from the Bicentennial party having come from a larger exhibition that ended its tour last month at the Whitney Museum of American Art The exhibition originated in 1976 at the Edward A Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University in Kansas A catalogue written by the director of the Ulrich Museum Martin H Bush is available at the Atheneum The present display which is on view through June was mounted by Matrix an Atheneum project financed by the National Endowment for the Arts Duane Hanson was born in 1925 the son of a Minnesota dairy farmer He showed talent as a child but his rise to fame took quite long by present standards In 1951 after obtaining a Master of Fine Arts degree from Cranbrook Academy in Michigan where he studied under the Swedish sculptor Carl Milles Mr Hanson went East to teach in Connecticut schools His first solo show took place at the Wilton Gallery and his second in Germany where he also taught for a while Neither show was remarkable Evidently this early work revealed a stylistic confusion that was not resolved until the advent of Pop in the 1960s it sanctioned a return to realism of kind Affected in particular by the plaster life casts of George Segal and inspired by the dissent of the time Mr Hanson produced in 1966 his first significant work  a plaster figure of a pregnant girl lying dead under a sheet as a result of a bungled abortion This was naturally a succes de scandale in Florida where it was first exhibited and it was soon followed by pieces dealing with the lot of the destitute the Vietnam War death on the roads rape etc Mr Hanson had perfected the technique of taking molds from live models and casting them in Fiberglass and polyester  Though more literalminded than Bruce Conner and Edward Kienholz he was working the same side of the thematic street as these masters of macabre assemblage Today the sculptor is considered to have mellowed having given up melodrama in favor of meditative studies of the lumpen lowermiddle class He rarely modifies his figures except to insure exactitude and structural soundness and having duplicated his models  eyeglasses strands of hair over bald pate the shadow of a beard  he dresses them with care and leaves them to speak for themselves But the consistent smoothness of skin and desultoriness of stance and expression make them one big depressed family Even if these effigies were less realistic their effect on the audience would doubtless be the same For as ducks can be conned by decoys and broody hens by china eggs humans have only to glimpse rudimentary versions of themselves of the right scale and volume to be taken in  if only momentarily And since no one lives who cant be entertained by verisimilitude a Hanson show is fun Where the issue becomes hairy is of course in the debate over whether it is art  a question that protagonists more sophisticated than Mr Hanson made unanswerable years ago To this reviewer the esthetic deviousness of Mr Hanson mixed with naivet amounts to a kind of art The spirit that animated his early sensational work has really only gone underground Just by making such a big deal out of the ordinary he renders it as horrific as the extraordinary and by concentrating on exactitude he absolves himself from the responsibility of parodying his subjects Moreover the compassion he professes looks in his work more like the condescension toward fat ladies and freaks that Diane Arbus practiced in her photographs Of course America being the biggest of the industrialized nations is bound to have the most nohopers bloated and blotched from junk food foolishly dressed and absorbed in enduring 50 weeks a year of boredom in order to

ALBANY GETS AROUND TO HANDLING OF DOGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/albany-gets-around-to-handling-of-dogs-assembly-votes-and-sends-to.html,ALBANY May 19In the midst of controversies over rent increases and crime the Legislature finally got around this week to one of the most controversial issues of the legislative sessionthe care and handling of dogs Dogs After considerable shouting the Assembly passed and sent to Governor Careys desk a bill that would overhaul New Yorks laws on the licensing and control of dogs for the first time since 1791 The bill which passed by a vote of 100 to 45 would give localities the option of raising fees for dog licensing and would require municipalities to have dogcontrol services and provide incentives to encourage neutering This bill would lead to more humane treatment of dogs than is current under present law said Icilio W Bianchi Jr a Beliport Democrat who sponsored the measure which does not apply to New York City But this was not evident to all of Mr Bianchis colleagues who in response to intensive lobbying from dog owners and some humane societies tossed question after question at him on every imaginable detail of doghandling Critics said the bill would cater to the special interests of professional dog breeders and veterinarians and would resuit in fewer registrations because of in creased costs In addition owners fear that some provisions of the bill would make it easier to have stray dogs killed But supporters including the Humane Society and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals contended that it was actually more humane than current law and would help solve the animal overpopulation problem by lowering licensing fees for neutered dogs In a related development the Senate approved a bill this week exempting blind people accompanied by seeing eye dogs from state lawwhich applies only to New York City and Buffalorequiring that dog owners clean up after their pets The bill would also establish a civil penalty of 100 with an existing criminal penalty against violators of the law Senator Franz Leichter a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill charged that New York City was becoming one big dog latrine Elsewhere in the capital there were these developments A bill requiring that parents be informed before their teenage children could receive abortions was in deep trouble because of an unexpected parliamentary maneuver The bill which has already passed the Senate was approved by the Assembly Health Committee yesterday along with a much milder bill proposed by Governor Carey But instead of being sent directly to the Assembly floor as was anticipated the two bills were sent to the Ways and Means Committee wherejudging by past votes and current positionsthe stricter bill appears doomed to defeat As a result key Assemblymen and aides predicted only the Governors bill which allows minors receiving abortions to sign statements requesting that their parents not be informed is likely to reach the Assembly floor The sponsor of the stricter bill Assemblyman Vincent F Nicolosi a DemocratConservative of Queens said he first learned that the proposal was to be sent to Ways and Means at todays Health Committee meeting The rationale for the parliamentary maneuver which angered some Assemblymen is that the notification bill would require the Health Denartment to print extra forms and therefore carried extra costs that needed to be examined by Ways and Means the Assemblys fiscal committee The bills main hope for emerging lay in the ire of the Assemblymen who want the bill to come to the floor Mr Nicolosi said he doubted that Ways and Means would keep such a controversial issue from coming to a vote Legislative leaders and the Governors office announced agreement on a bill to streamline the procedures for issuing and renewing state business permits The bill would establish an office of business permits in the executive department to assist businesses in obtaining permits and meeting agency requirments and procedures After a threemonth 25000 study by a private accounting firm the Assembly leadership has agreed upon a bill that would reauire the Governor to provide more detailed and uptodate financial information to the Legislatureincluding the type of data that would allow them to discover where the Governor was hiding money in his budget It was described by its proponents as another effort to make the Legislature a coequal branch of government The Senate approved a fouryear extension of law that gives preference to New York State firms in bidding for public contracts The bill would also expand the law to cover public authorities A bill that would forbid the sale of roach clips snorters coke spoons or rolling papers to minors was passed by lthe Senate and sent to the Assembly where it faces an uncertain future
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/the-world-plane-deal-cost-may-be-counted-in-more-than-dollars.html,In Summary The feared Senate vote on the 48 billion Middle East arms package came and went last week 54 to 44 to approve President Carters decision to sell for the first time sophisticated warplanes to two Arab countries as well as to Israel Then the secondguessing began At first glance the Arabs seemed to have gained Egypt will have its 50 F5s and Saudi Arabia its 60 F15s both nations also have reassurance that the United States officially prizes them as brokers of moderation in the Middle East For the Israelis however the meaning of the vote is less clear Israel also got planes 15 F15s and 75 F16s with 20 more F15s added on But the principal issue for Jerusalem now is not the balance of arms It is the turningpoint of its 30yearlong special relationship with Washington There have been disagreements but Israels supporters never lost a vote like this before Their apprehensions about the negative impact of Prime Minister Menachem Begins tough line on the West Bank and the Palestiriians proved well founded Mr Carter won but at a political cost that is difficult to estimate Some members of Congress are more convinced than ever that he too is intransigent he gave in on the 20 F15s but not on linking the sales as a package His lobbying apparatus though effective retained its previous sloppiness the Presidents call to Senator Dale Bumpers Democrat of Arkansas went like this I need your support I told Frank [Moore chief White House Congressional contact man] a week ago you had it I didnt know that  There is also the issue of future American Jewish political support which is traditionally Democratic Vice President Monda les attempt to mollify Jewish leaders in New York last week is a measure of the Administrations concern As fur the big question the effect on prospects for negotiated peace in the Middle East the answer is still open One Administration argument  that defensive weapons for the Saudis are a potentially stabilizing factor because they could help diminish threats to that kingom  was evidently persuasive to the Presidents supporters But probably the clinching argument was persuasive to people on both sides Opponents called it blackmail proponents geopolitical reality Senator John Stennis Democra to Mississippi who voted against summed it up with a word Oil  The Hunt Narrows For Moros Killers Italian authorities frustrated for weeks in their search for the kidnappers and killers of Aldo Moro may have things going their way for a change Police last week discovered three places in Rome where the Red Brigades sometimes met and hid a print shop and two apartments including one where the shops owner and his assistant described by neighbors as the most ordinary boys lived Altogether 10 were arrested and the owner of the print shop is being investigated for connections with the Moro case Officials believe that an IBM typewriter in his shop may be the source of the nine messages released by the Red Brigades during the two months that Mr Moro was a captive It was one of the few times Italian police have scored any points at all in their duel with the Red Brigades Yesterday in a communiqu the Red Brigades promised the duel would continue calling Mr Moros murder the first step in a drive to disarticulate and destroy the state In a report to the Chamber of Deputies last week Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti promised that his Government  which refused to bargain with the kidnappers of Mr Moro the leader of the Mr Andreottis own Christian Democratic Partywould continue Its policy of firmness Sympathy for the Christian Democratit Party seemed to have contributed to the partys gains in local elections last week The Communist Party suffered losses one of the few times since 1948 that the party had done anything but gain on election day Abortion Law Passes Once merely having the Roman Catholic Church against it was enough to foredoom any effort to legalize abortions in Italy banned by Benito Mussolini as a crime against the state But last year the opposition of the church and the Christian Democratic Party notwithstanding a reform bill nearly cleared the Italian Parliament Last weeit the Parliament passed one of the more liberal statutes on the Continent under which free abortions will be available on demand for women 18 years of age or older The debate may not be over however Opponents of abortion say they will try to gather the 500000 signatures on petitions needed to abrogate the law and force a national referendum If the new law survives there are fears it will cause a further overloading of already crowded state medical clinics Additionally because girls under 18 would be required to obtain parental permission for a legal abortion the nowconsiderable reliance on illegal abortions could remain unchanged Sadat Orchestrates More Muted Dissent President Anwar elSadat has concluded that the success of controlled democracy in Egypt may require a little more control and a little less democracy A national referendum today was expected to give the Egyptian leader popular support for that view Mr Sadat had warned recently that a campaign of doubt against his Governments economic and domestic programs had become a threat to unity I say yes to democracy but no to the manipulation and distortion of facts he said in abruptly announcing the referendum last week The move was intended to give Mr Sadat leverage to exclude some outspoken opponents from political life without dismantling the multiparty system that was allowed to emerge last year The referendum asks whether Communists proSoviet leaders and certain prerevolutionary politicians should be permitted to hold responsible positions in the Government the press and other public institutions Mr Sadats principal targets are members of the New Wafd Party including rightwing politicians who were active before the 1952 revolution and the leftist National Progressive Union These groups have generally supported Mr Sadats peace initiatives abroad but they have been sometimes reckless critics of his actions at home Although officials in Cairo gave assurances last week that the referendum was in no way intended to reverse the political liberalization begun by Mr Sadat in 1974 it was generally viewed as a step backward Peking Greets A US Mandarin It is important that we make progress in normalizing relations with China Zbigniew Brzezinski President Carters national security adviser said last month Yesterday arriving in Peking he put it another way The President of the United States desires friendly relations with a strong China He and Chinese leaders are to discuss what Mr Brzezinski called global issues of parallel concern  presumably Korea the American military presence in Asia and relations with the Soviet Union But it is considered unlikely that there will be any attempt to negotiate toward the establishment of full diplomatic ties between China and the United States Since 1949 when the Peoples Republic of China was formed most countries except the United States have recognized Peking instead of Taiwan as Chinas Government Few of Mr Carters constituents are pressing for early recognition of Peking and there is no sign that the Administration is ready to cut diplomatic and military ties to Taiwan a step China has made a condition of full relations Mr Brzezinksi however Is thought to advocate closer relations with China not so much because of the Administrations warm feeling toward that country as because of his coolness toward the Soviet Union Frontal Attack At Orly Airport Not even the tightest of security measures are a guarantee against violence Yesterday as authorities struggled with demonstrators seeking to delay the opening of Tokyos Narita airport art the other side of the world three gunmen attacked passengers waiting to board an El Al jet at Orly airport outside Paris In an episode recalling the 1972 attack in which 27 persons were killed at Tel Avivs airport all three terrorists and one police

Ethical Culture Gala Marks 100th Y ear Of Midtown School,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/ethical-culture-gala-marks-100th-year-of-midtown-school.html,With yesterday officially declared Ethical Culture Schools Day by Mayor Koch thousands of parents alumni students and friends turned out for a gala at the Fieldston School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx to celebrate the founding of the first of the three schools 100 years ago The festivities began at 3 PM with a parade across the Fieldston campus by three 60piece marching bands The schedule included Olympicstyle games with the participants clad in togas and a fireworks display at sunset Celebrants downed pieces of a 1000pound sixfoothigh cake topped with butter cream and then danced away the caicries to disco music This party has been a yearlong project said Jane Gracer director of development for the three schools Today the main celebration but in January we had a gala dinner and in November we have an educational conference on the role of ethics in the schools New York Citys Ethical Culture Schools include two elementary schoolsthe Midtown School at 63d Street and Central Park West and in Riverdale the Fieldston Lower School and a secondary school the Fieldston School All are private nonsectarian coeducational facilities Midtown was founded in 1878 by the Society for Ethical Culture a group that emphasizes humanitarianism What began as a free kindergarten for eight workingclass children grew rapidly eventually annexing the Fieldston School in 1928 and Fieldston Lower School in 1932 As enrollment rose from eight students to 1500 so did the tuition from nothing to up to 3300 depending on the age of the child and the school attended Twentythree percent of the schools students receive scholarship aid The schools have always emphasized three key issues said Mrs Gracer They are ethics an emphasis on learning by doing and scholarship to help people who cant afford highquality education Students are admitted on the basis of high intellectual achievement which Mrs Gracer said was measured through interviews and standardized test results Basic to a Fieldston education are the ethics courses which students are required to take from the first grade on In the early grades issues such as friendship obedience and respect for differences between people are emphasized said Mrs Gracer The highschool courses are very sophisticated touching on such issues as abortion and medical ethics Participation in the community is stressed through senior work projects This year the Midtown sixth graders made rag dolls for patients at the Roosevelt Hospital which they handdelivered Its an ideal situation with a healthy mixture of kids said Jill Kaplan whose two young sons attend Midtown The school is concerned not only with education but with the way kids function in society
Sex and the Teen‐ Ager (For Parents),https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/westchester-opinion-sex-and-the-teenager-for-parents.html,BY ADVISING their teenage children on birth control are parents implicitly giving them permission to have sex and even applying pressure for them to do so How do parents initiate such discussions with their children What about morality  is the new pragmatic attitude toward sex on the part of teenagers undermining their feelings of responsibility for others Those were some of the questions raised by parents who met with educators and professionals at a recent conference at the Scarsdale Public Library to discuss increased sexual activity among teenagers Sexuality is a subject of tremendous concern for young people today and one which the schools and other educational institutions have not yet fully addressed themselves to said Timmy Smallens the librarys program coordinator Kids may be taught a lot of plumbing in their health courses about sex today but thats not enough Parents often feel awkward about discussing sex with them too and as a result theres still a lot of misinformation around Teenage pregnancy abortion veneral disease and promiscuity were high on the list of discussion at the conference which was sponsored by the library and the Mental Health Association of Westchester and also received support from the Scarsdale schools and the Scarsdale Family Counseling Services Mrs Smallens who with Elinor Dicker an education specialist of the Mental Health Association initiated the program said she felt that teenagers and parents were not aware enough of the many community resources and books available in this area Recent statistics tend to bear out Mrs Smallenss observations In 1976 there were 1 million teenage pregnancies in the United States 260000 children were born out of wedlock And out of 3 million cases of venereal disease twothirds involved people under 24 years old It is estimated that half of all teen agers have sexual intercourse before they finish high school and that 30 percent of all sexually active girls become pregnant A study of girls nine to 15 years old indicated that pregnancies had increased at a record rate especially among white girls whose rate of pregnancies doubled from 1968 to 1973 In Westchester 1892 teenage pregnancies were reported in 1976 and according to county health department figures abortion among girls ages 15 to 19 in the county is about double that for girls in other parts of the country While societys attitudes toward sex are more permissive than they were a generation ago and sexual experimentation begins at an earlier age around 19 for 50 percent of the population today as against 22 or 23 in 1998 and 1953 adolescence Dr Everett Dulit director of Adolescent Psychiatry for New York Hospital Westchester Division told the conference is typically a period of uneven growth It is a period he said in which there is a wide range of sexual expressions among them masturbation and some de  of homosexual experimentation Sex is still a difficult and confusing subject for many adolescents he said and one that needs the frank and open dance of parents  encourage communication between parents and adolescents Dr  who is repeat his talk at 815 PM sday at the library urged his audi to get educated and come to  with some of the basic issues  adolescent sexuality today Dont start off by moralizing and doctrinating but listen to your young instead and try to find out where he  from he continued It is  haps almost inevitable that his per  and opinions will be different  yours but the important thing is  the diologue be conducted in an atsphere of mutual respect and es  the group discussions that followed  and community leaders ex an ambivalence in their feelings  adolescent sexuality es a real question about advis ing your child about birth control and making sure he understands how to protect himself one woman said By doing so arent we implicitly giving them permission to have sex and even applying pressure on them to do so Other parents said that they were frustrated by not knowing how to initiate a discussion about sex with their children Wed like to make sure our 14yearold son has the right information about sex another parent said But when my husband tried to bring it up recently our son just kind of turned off and said he already knew about it Birth control was a major source of discussion in one group One of the things that prevents many teenagers from using birth control is the feeling that if they have it they have turned themselves into a sexually available person said Dr Lawrence Jackman a White Plains obstetriciangynecologist and the director of the Human Sexuality Department at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Ive tried to explain to many of my patients that taking the pill doesnt automatically turn them into sexually loose women Its not a license It just gives them the option to be sexually active or not as they choose At another table the concept of morality and its relation to sexual permissiveness was debated Its not that I worry so much about my kids getting the facts straight but what about morality Has that gone out of usage altogether one mother said There seems to be a lot of pragmatism in kids attitudes toward sex today but what about their feelings of responsibility to other people How do we teach those values In the final discussion school personnel therapists and counselors addressed themselves to the need for better and more enlightened sexual education in the school community and the home Every year we see lots of girls at the high school who have had abortions and their mothers never know said Susan Diamond a dean at Scarsdale High School

ART Imitation of Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/connecticut-weekly-art-imitation-of-life.html,HARTFORD THE Tapestry Room at the Wadsworth Atheneum no longer houses tapestries as its regular visitors know but instead has American paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries These are temporarily acting as a backdrop to six lifesize figures by Duane Hanson an artist in Americana whose reputation should soon be rivaling Norman Rockwells However with the distraction of the pictures and the crowds that are currently breaking attendance records at this Hartford institution the sculpture is discovered almost inadvertently Spectators find themselves circumventing not other humans but polyester resin facimiles thereof  authentic down to the last wristwatch and pimple As if to add resonance to the Bicentennial rhetoric about whence we have come and wither were going Mr Hansons statue of a construction worker takes a boxlunch break a few feet from Thomas Eakinss portrait of the artist John McClure Hamilton Nearby an obese woman sizzles herself in an imaginary sun with Thomas Coles Etna From Taormina behind her while on the other side of the room an elderly workman droops over a dolly Farther down in the gallery a photographer in full regalia crouches under Revolutionary War scenes by John Trumbull while a glassyeyed waitress loiters within range of the photographers lens A bespectacled young female consumer with pot belly and packages completes the cast which John Singleton Copleys picture of Jeremiah Lee overlooks The very style of Lees elegant silk hose seems to mark the sleaziness of the sculptured figures The figures are in a way leftovers from the Bicentennial party having come from a larger exhibition that ended its tour last month at the Whitney Museum of American Art The exhibition originated in 1976 at the Edward A Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University in Kansas A catalogue written by the director of the Ulrich Museum Martin H Bush is available at the Atheneum The present display which is on view through June was mounted by Matrix an Atheneum project financed by the National Endowment for the Arts Duane Hanson was born in 1925 the son of a Minnesota dairy farmer He showed talent as a child but his rise to fame took quite long by present standards In 1951 after obtaining a Master of Fine Arts degree from Cranbrook Academy in Michigan where he studied under the Swedish sculptor Carl Milles Mr Hanson went East to teach in Connecticut schools His first solo show took place at the Wilton Gallery and his second in Germany where he also taught for a while Neither show was remarkable Evidently this early work revealed a stylistic confusion that was not resolved until the advent of Pop in the 1960s it sanctioned a return to realism of a kind Affected in particular by the plaster life casts of George Segal and inspired by the dissent of the time Mr Hanson produced in 1966 his first significant work  a plaster figure of a pregnant girl lying dead under a sheet as a result of a bungled abortion This was naturally a succes de scundale in Florida where it was first exhibited and it was soon followed by pieces dealing with the lot of the destitute the Vietnam War death on the roads rape etc Mr Hanson had perfected the technique of taking molds from live models and casting them in Fiberglass and polyester resin Though more literalminded than Bruce Conner and Edward Kienholz he was working the same side of the thematic street as these masters of macabre assemblage Today the sculptor is considered to have mellowed having given up melodrama in favor of meditative studies of the lumpen lowermiddle class He rarely modifies his figures except to insure exactitude and structural soundness and having duplicated his models  eyeglasses strands of hair over bald pate the shadow of a beard  he dresses them with care and leaves them to speak for themselves But the consistent smoothness of skin and desultoriness of stance and expression make them one big depressed family Even if these effigies were less realistic their effect on the audience would doubtless be the same For as ducks can be conned by decoys and broody hens by china eggs humans have only to glimpse rudimentary versions of themselves of the right scale and volume to be taken in  if only momentarily And since no one lives who cant be entertained by verisimilitude a Hanson show is fun Where the issue becomes hairy is of course in the debate over whether it is art  a question that protagonists more sophisticated than Mr Hanson made unanswerable years ago To this reviewer the esthetic deviousness of Mr Hanson mixed with naivet amounts to a kind of art The spirit that animated his early sensational work has really only gone underground Just by making such a big deal out of the ordinary he renders it as horrific as the extraordinary and by concentrating on exactitude he absolves himself from the responsibility of parodying his subjects Moreover the compassion he professes looks in his work more like the condescension toward fat ladies and freaks that Diane Arbus practiced in her photographs Of course America being the biggest of the industrialized nations is bound to have the most nohopers bloated and blotched from junk food foolishly dressed and absorbed in enduring 50 weeks a year of boredom in order to have two weeks of vacation fun followed by sunny retirement Mr Hanson has captured them perfectly except that in his disdain  an attitude permitted artists  he omits the pathos and intimations of dignity that old people possess however absurdly Mourning the human predicament he holds it up to certain ridicule safe in the knowledge that everyone sees the subject of parody and satire as someone else 
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/21/archives/the-nation-under-burger-court-arm-of-the-law-has-more-muscle.html,WASHINGTON  When the United States Supreme Court opened the door last week to more extensive wiretapping criminal suspects few lawyers or political scientists should have been surprised The 7to2 ruling which relaxed considerably Congress insistence that law enforcement agents minimize the interception of private conversations during courtapproved surveillance was one more step in the gradual rewriting of criminal laws under Chief Justice Warren E Burger Continued Chief Justice Burger is about to celebrate his ninth anniversary on the Court but it was not until 197273 that he and three other appointees of President Nixon served their first full term together and formed the nucleus of a lawandorder majority that has since been substantially in control Although the Chief Justice said two years ago that he could detect no significant change in criminallaw decisions from the days of Chief Justice Earl Warren most observers perceive steady movement away from protecting the rights of the accused and toward strengthening the hand of lawenforcement officials The dissenters in last weeks wiretap ruling Associate Justices William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall find themselves often in the minority They are two of four holdovers from the Warren Court and both tend to retain its viewpoint The other two Associate Justices Potter Stewart and Byron R White usually vote with the Nixon justices on criminal cases as to a lesser degree does Associate Justice John Paul Stevens named by President Ford The Chief Justice and his Nixonappointed colleagues Associate Justices Harry A Blackmun Lewis F Powell Jr and William H Rehnquist  voted as a bloc on 76 percent of the criminal cases during the last two full terms Each time they were hr the majority More significantly during the last five terms almost twothirds of their rulings have favored the prosecution little more than onethird favored the accused This record reflects the fact that the Burger Court tends to hear cases in which intermediate courts reversed a defendants conviction and then to favor the prosecution by reversing the lower courts The most notable change in criminal law was the reinstatement of the death penalty In 1972 the justices ruled 5 to 4 that it was cruel and unusual punishment as it was then administered by the states In 1976 with Justices Stewart and White shifting positions and Justice Stevens having replaced William O Douglas the Court voted 7 to 2 that capital punishment could be invoked as a penalty against murder if states applied guidelines taking both exacerbating and mitigating circumstances into account The dissenters as usual were Justices Brennan and Marshall In other critical areas of criminal justice the Burger Court incrementally has made these changes Search and seizure It allowed officials to search a suspects car without a warrant when it had been taken into custody as abandoned permitted grand juries to use illegally obtained evidence that would be inadmissable in court authorized warrantless searches of persons in custody for minor offenses to obtain evidence of more serious crimes Confessions It allowed prosecutors in challenging the credibility of witnesses in court to use confessions obtained without warnings of the right to remain silent permitted prosecution of a witness given qualified immunity if police find independent evidence of the same crime authorized courtroom use of statements made by a defendant who had not been warned of his rights because he came to the police station voluntarily Entrapment It upheld the conviction of a man charged with manufacturing narcotics who was furnished supplies by government agents The Court argued that he had predisposition to commit the crime Later it applied this reasoning to the case of a defendant who had obtained drugs from government agents and sold them to other agents Only outrageous police involvement could constitute a defense the Court said Identification It upheld the a rape suspects conviction based on a yesorno identification by the victim rather than a multiplechoice lineup upheld identification of a defendant on the basis of a single photograph even when the process was suggestive and there was opportunity fora lineup Obscenity It established a new definition of obscenity involving a prurient interest in sex based on standards of the community in which a defendant is being tried Since then it has steadfastly refused to explain or refine that definition In two areas of criminal law abortion and prisoner rights the Burger Courts posture has been quite different has removed criminal penalties for all but endofterm abortions and generally has guaranteed prisoners greater access to the courts and more legal protection The big question is whether the Burger Court has had an impact on either the incidence of crime or the effectiveness of law enforcement That was a concern of Mr Nixon during Ins Presidential 1968 campaign when he made the Warren Court an issue insisting that its decisions had weakened the peace forces by encouraging the criminal forces Certainly statistics dont show that tougher Federal courts deter potential lawbreakers Almost without interruption the Federal Bureau of Investigations index of violent crime rises year after year There is also doubt about whether large numbers of police officers consider themselves liberated from constitutional niceties One law school professor with broad criminal justice experience regards it more of symbolic matter The Supreme Court sets the tone for national attitudes he says Under the Warren Court law enforcement officials developed a sort of siege mentality Under the Burger Court police morale is probably better and to that extent law enforcement more effective Like their predecessors the justices reject the notion that there is an ideological shape to their decisions Each they say stands on its own tightly circumscribed by precedent statutes and the Constitution But at the opposite end of that question stand those who would agree with Finley Peter Dunnes Mr Dooley who found that on important issues the Supreme Court follows the election returns
Issue and Debate Teen‐Age Abortions: Do Parents Have the Right to Be Informed?; Background,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/22/archives/issue-and-debate-teenage-abortions-do-parents-have-the-right-to-be.html,The 16yearold highschool junior sat in a conference room at the Boro Hall Center of Planned Parenthood in Brooklyn the other day and talked about why she had chosen to keep secret from her mother the abort ion she had last fall It was the second one I had the softspoken teenager said I was pregnant once before a year earlier and I told my mother about it She was so hurt I didnt want to hurt her again and I knew that I could come to Planned Parenthood without her consent This time I decided that it was my problem so I would have to solve it myself On the same morning another teenager recuperating from her abortion at the Margaret Sanger Center of Planned Parenthood in Manhattan explained that she had chosen to tell her parents about her pregnancy and her decision to terminate it at six weeks My mother said she thought abortion was a sin but my father said Well fix it this time but not next He came with me today Neither young woman was aware that the freedom she had to determine independently whether or not to inform her parents of her intentions might be taken away from minors in the future if the State Legislature enacts into law several bills under consideration They are designed either to require or to encourage depending on the particular bill notification of parents or legal guardians that a girl under 18 years of age is about to undergo an abortion More than 16000 minors undergo abortions in New York State each year The proposed laws have once again revived the volatile battle on abortion but they have been provoked in large measure by considerations totally unconnected to the concerns of teenagers Observers of the Albany scene agree that two of the bills were in part motivated by a desire to embarrass Governor Carey who will run for reelection this year and is known to be personally opposed to abortion but who has always favored its legality and ready access But of greater moment to the teenagers of this state is the question of what happens when their right to have abortions without the knowledge of their closest of kin  a right so far upheld by the United States Supreme Court  collides with the concerns of their parents for their wellbeing It is a controversy that touches the core of family relationships and defies simplistic answers In July 1976 the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that states may not issue blanket restrictions requiring all single minor women to have parental consent for an abortion But the court clearly left the door to parental influence ajar by intimating that some limited restrictions might be imposed Last week amid charges and countercharges that the Senate Health Committees vote to report out the bill had been rigged the Senate approved by a margin of 36 to 19 a measure that would require physicians to notify parents by registered mail of the physicians intentions to perfom an abortion Exceptions would be granted in certain circumstances An identical bill was reported out of the Assembly Health Committee by a vote of 12 to 9 Thursday But at the last minute the committee also took up for consideration a bill drafted by its chairman Alan G Hevesi Democrat of Queens Dr Kevin Cahill special assistant to the Governor on health affairs and their staff members This bill also reported out of committee by a vote of 12 to 9 requires the patients informed consent and gives the patient if she is deemed by her doctor capable of giving informed consent the right to prohibit him in writing from contacting her parents The bill is known as the Wilson Bill for its sponsor Assemblyman Clifford E Wilson DemocratLiberal of Queens The two other bills are joined as the PadavanNicolosi Bill for their sponsors Senator Frank Padavan RepublicanConservative and Assemblyman Vincent Nicolosi DemocratConservative both of Queens Opponents Those who believe that the rights of minor women to govern the outcome of their pregnancies supersede the rights of their parents to participate in decisions tend to be vehemently opposed to any legislation creating obstacles to abortion They regard the distinction be tween requirements for notification of parents and requirements for consent as more or less a semantic one A requirement for notification is tantamount to consent said Alfred F Moran executive vice president of Planned Parenthood New York City If you notify the parent and they dont respond that is tacit consent If they give their approval of course that is consent and if they say no there is no hospital clinic or doctor that will provide that adolescent with an abortion They are too fearful today of malpractice suits As Dr Joan Morganthau director of adolescent services at Mount Sinai Hospital and the mother of three teenaged daughters said There is clear legal precedent based mainly on the concept of the mature minor for the fact that the physician has an obligation to respect the confidence of the minor But she added Each case must be individualized sometimes the parents definitely need to be involved Most reputable health services that cater to teenagers make serious efforts to involve parents in the belief that they can be supportive But at the same time they recognize how difficult it is for a teenage girl to admit to her parents not only that she is sexually active but that she is pregnant What do you do with the girl who says My father will destroy me I can never go home  asked Barbara Shack legislative director for the New York Civil Liberties Union What would happen in such cases most authorities agreed is that pregnant teenagers would avoid medical facilities altogether until it was too late for the simple suction procedure and then if they elected to abort they would be subject to the far more complicated and riskier saltingout methods Or they would carry the pregnancy to term and give birth to unwanted infants Or they would seek out abortion providers willing to flout the law Proponents Senator Padavan said he had sponsored the more stringent of the bills because parents have the right and re sponsibility at the minimum to be knowledgeable of the fact that an abortion is to be performed on their teenage daughter We say parents are responsible for housing clothing educating and raising their children he continued and if they dont theyre subject to court action So in the instance of pregnancy should they turn over their responsibilities to such organizations as Planned Parenthood Although she said she would have preferred an even stronger bill Jeanne Head chairman of Manhattan Right to Life and an obstetricsgynecology nurse in a private hospital that she would not identify said The performance of an abortion on a teenage minor without at least the knowledge of the people who care most about her deprives her of the counsel and support she needs most at a time of tremendous crisis Everybody assumes that parents dont care We think that the parent who will reject the pregnant teenager is rare They are usually supportive after the initial shock wears off Assemblyman Clifford Wilson who said he lent his name to the alternative bill which is supported by Governor Carey because the only way to defuse the abortion controversy is to find a middle ground and because he said he thought it stood a better chance of being held constitutional is nevertheless convinced that parental rights have priority over those of minors Outlook No one can say yet with any certainty which if any of the bills will be passed by the Legislature signed by the Governor and survive court challenges And what impact the hills if they do become the law of the state would have on family relationships is even less predictable Certainly no one contends that brokendown communications can be mended by legislation Alfred Moran said You cannot pass a law that says to a mother father and daughter You will get along better and confide in each other on sexual matters 
The Value Of Less Freedom,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/24/archives/the-value-of-less-freedom-foreign-affairs.html,LONDONHow free are we The question provokes a reminder of a savage Monty Python skit Two housewives decide to telephone that nice Monsieur Sartre in Paris to settle a philosophical point A lady answers They ask Is M Sartre free Meahing is hethere And they fall off their chairs in hysterical laughter as the reply comes back He s been asking himself that all his life The negative is the easy way to preface an answer to my question I can say The Red Brigades are not freedom Jean Paul Sartre s Maoists are not freedom Eurocomqunism at least at presept is not freedom But to say what freedom is is more difficult The beginnings of an answer emerge with some more questions Does 20thcentury liberalism give us freedom Has the unionization of journalists leading in the case of Britain to the closed shop protected the freedom of their pens against the arbitrary behavior of editors and proprietors or has it made it more difficult for fresh ideas to enter introverted establishments Have modern divorce laws given greater freedom Or is the strain on the increasing number of oneparent households destroying many children s chances of a stable family life which if not altogether happy provides the backbone of emotional security Does freer abortion make it easier for women to avoid the choice between an unwanted child and a backstreet abortionistor has it been offset by the erosion of the respect for life The truth is many modern liberal ideas on freedom appear less convincing than they recently did Indeed perhaps one can go further and say that the evidence of life is pushing us toward arguing for moderately less freedom in the immediate future if we are to avert a dramatic reduction of freedom in the long term A few examples  Less freedom for the automobile Americans alone kill off their fellow countrymen at the rate of 50000 a year No other machine in common use is such a profligate waster of lives and energy Speed limits should come down to 50 miles an hour The minimum age for holding a license should be raised to 18 There should be restrictions on Sunday driving as happened in a number of European countries in the immediate wake of the oil embargo Unless this is done we will never feel properly pressured to invest in alternative modes of transport that will guarantee liberty of movement for our grandchildren  Less freedom for the doctors Too much modern medicine gains its prestige from the size of individual doctor s income and from the accumulation of newly acquired gadgets rather than the application of its inherited wisdom The medical profession must be policed if there is to be enough good but affordable medicine for everybody There should be tough guidelines on when to operate and restrictions on the growing dependence of modern hospitals on expensive machines for diagnosis and treatment Freedom to be unnecessarily ill is no longer tolerable  Less freedom for the march of ur ban technology An end to the false worship of the Golden Calf of economies of scale Not only is the anonymity of work destroying our individualism but we are becoming dangerously dependent on single sources of everything not least water and electricity We are creating hostages for the urban guerrilla of future years  Less freedom for nuclear energy No one has yet effectively answered what one NobelPrizewinning scientist has written Fission energy is safe only if a number of critical devices work as they should if a number of people in key positions follow all their instructions if there Is no sabotage no hijacking of the transports if no reactorfuelreprocessing plants or reprocessing plants or repository anywhere in the world is situated in a region of riots or guerrilla activity and no revolution or war even a conventional one takes place in these regions No acts of God can be permitted If we don t restrict the freedom to create the nuclear genie we will end up being forced to accept out of desperate need for selfprotection vast increases in internal and international surveillance and the surrender to the police of extraordinary powers of entry arrest detention interrogation and even torture How else can the police hope to move fast enough to prevent highly organized criminals and terrorists from capturing positions from which they can effectively blackmail a nation Even in the 1870 s as the debate between Jahn Stuart Mill and JS Stephen made clear freedom was something of an elusive idea Modern technology makes it even more difficult to define But what is clear is that too much freedom at one time forces limits in another
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/24/archives/letters-national-council-of-churches-vs-israel-242-reinterpreted.html,To the Editor Your report May 13 on the National Council of Churches resolution condemning Israels use of cluster bombs in Lebanon once again raises a fundamental question about that organization Will its actions be determined by broad ecumenical principles or by narrow racial andor ideological perspectives Personally I would have been quite willing to add my signature to the resolution if it were not so obviously part of a persistent antiIsrael propaganda campaign within the council Let me elaborate by pointing out the following  In recent years every NCC governing board meeting has been preceded by internal bureaucratic power plays aimed at criticizing Israel This year for instance a concerted effort was made to bring in an extremely onesided report attacking Israel on the question of human rights That one did not make it to the governing board yet In my experience the dynamics at work when such issues are raised within the NCC establishment are not very conducive to civil discourse not to mention ecumenical dialogue  The resolution to which The Times referred originated in the councils Commission on Justice Liberation and Human Fulfillment This commission organized to represent the concerns of oppressed people has unfortunately established a consistent record of condemning cruelties only when perpetrated by countries selected along racial andor ideological lines This has not helped the credibility of the National Council of Churches  Whenever in recent years concerns were raised in the council about antiSemitism the Holocaust or the emergence of neoNazi movements attempts have been made either to trivialize them or to neutralize them by gratuitous remarks that were supposed to present a more balanced picture The recent governing board meeting passed a resolution expressing concern about neoNazi activities in America only after assurances had been given that a statement on the Ku Klux Klan would be issued as well It took a suspension of the rules to achieve that  The refusal to accept the recommendation of the boards Reference Committee which mentioned the fact that men women and children were wantonly killed or maimed in the terrorist attack on Israel as well as during the invasion of Lebanon offers a sad commentary on the councils professed desire to present a balanced picture of issues Also as your reporter pointed out the debate on the resolution condemning Israel was postponed till the final session when many delegates had left The National Council of Churches has lost the confidence of vast numbers of the 40 million Christians it claims to represent and a growing number of them are refusing to support this sort of charade Unfortunately true believers tend to be convinced that the decline of the organization for which they profess to speak is proof positive of the prophetic contribution they are making to church and society In the meantime so much worthwhile ecumenical work is being jeopardized by the manipulations of a few Methinks its time for a loyal opposition to speak up Director or Communications Reformed Church in America New York May 17 1978 To the Editor Much attention has been paid in recent days to the Begin Governments reinterpretation of UN 242 while the Arab reinterpretation has been totally overlooked On his dramatic and historic visit to Jerusalem last November Sadat was hailed for telling the Knesset and the world that the Arabs will recognize Israel if Israel accepts the Arab terms for peace That is Sadat was withdrawing recognition of Israel  a recognition Egypt agreed to 10 years ago in accepting 242 which provided for    respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries only to bestow it again when Israel carried out not 242 but the Arabs own terms for peace Now Anthony Lewis writes from Damascus column May 8 that Syria believes Sadat gave away the Arab card  recognition of Israel Thus Syria too continues to reinterpret 242 Or didnt the Arab states which accepted 242 really withhold acceptance in practice of the portion which grants recognition of Israel And are still withholding it Let us look to emendations from both sides JOAN STERLING CRESPI Princeton N J May 16 1978 To the Editor In his recent article on the OpEd page Charles Peters asserts that a small group of President Carters advisers deliberately misled the President about the cost of welfare reform That is false The estimates were discussed in detail among all the Cabinet officials involved with all the appropriate members of the Presidents staff and finally at some length with the President himself Mr Peterss version of the reasons why the cost estimates are higher now than they were when the program was first announced in August are also inaccurate There are half a dozen different reasons none of which is part of any attempt to deceive For example the Congressional decision to raise the minimum wage by more than the President proposed significantly increased the cost of the jobs aspect of the program Some of the differences are matters of definition For instance the welfare reform proposal contains a change in the tax laws that would apply to families earning incomes of up to 16000 as well as lowincome wage earners We think it is proper to omit the portion that benefits middleincome families when counting the cost of welfare reform Furthermore Congress and the executive branch have traditionally used different methods of estimating future budget costs Neither method is dishonest and both have their uses but these definitional differences account for most of the gap between Administration and Congressional figures of which Mr Peters made so much As for our use of 1978 statistics to price out a program that was not expected to start until 1981 we made clear in our initial presentation that this was what we had done The estimates based on 1981 caseload projections and inflation rates were made public as soon as they were completed Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation HEW Washington May 18 1978 The writer led the HEW work group that devised the welfare reform program To the Editor It is shocking that Tom Wicker would drag the HumphreyTruong spy case into a column [May 2] purportedly about whistleblowing Nothing will give whistleblowing a bad name faster than linking it to spying for the benefit of foreign powers Wicker acknowledges that Ronald Humphrey who is accused of passing classified State Department documents to a foreign agent is not a whistleblower His only justification for devoting nearly onefourth of his column on whistleblowing to this case is the statement that some see in his prosecution a signal of the Carter Administrations determination to crack down on leakers  The implication is that if the Government enforces the statutes on spying for foreign governments this is bad because it might discourage Government employees from exposing abuses within the Government Mr Wicker seems to have his priorities confused If we lose even the will to defend ourselves against spies then the demoralization of America will be complete and our ability to protect ourselves against enemies foreign and domestic will be nonexistent Silver Spring Md May 7 1978 The writer is chairman of Accuracy in Media Inc To the Editor Jessica need not die it an American doctor can save her [Topics May 161 While the issue of free egress from the Soviet Union is of great importance in the case of a sick child the priority is to save a life A doctor who thinks he can effect a cure could be sent to the Soviet Union with any necessary equipment there seems to be no difficulty in getting an American citizen in for the money it would cost to get Jessica and her parents out Are we so heartless that we will stand on political issues while a baby dies Bellerose NY May 16 1978 To the Editor It is a tiring and seemingly unresolvable issue but Representative Henry Hydess May 3 letter on the abortion telecast was the last straw Much to the chagrin of the righteous morality is subjective The writers of the Constitution of this country were wise enough to know this and in each article and amendment of our countrys source of law freedom and rights are not taken away they are given Eating beef or pork is immoral to many religious groups in the world as is celibacy A very large group of people saw the slaughter during the Vietnam War as immoral and yet the very large and wealthy Roman Catholic lobby did very little to end the killing Certain people are said to desire the infusion of moral values into our laws Our laws were well defined 200 years ago They included the concept of freedom for all people and the right to choose a life style Would a 15yearold woman who has become pregnant and is not physically or emotionally prepared for motherhood have to accept the morals of the antiabortionists Would a family of six who can ill afford another child because of our sad economy have to bear the burden of imposed values The Holocaust is often used by the righttolifers as an example of the evils of abortion The regimes of fascism and Communism are the embodiment of suppression of opinion forced by the morals and laws of those theories in power The right to choose is taken away just as the right to choice Is taken away by the antiabortionists Threefourths of my direct ancestral lineage were residents of North America by 1700 I was raised with their lives and what they believed in America has not always risen to its ideals but now is not the time to forsake them entirely Take away choice take away freedom dictate morality and life style and you take away what is America AntiAmericanism has been cloaked in many costumes over the years This is the most insidious Those of us who believe in the right of a woman to choose whether or not she wants a child are not trying to shackle pregnant women and drag them all to abortion clinics We do not want to he shackled and kept away from this choice If the Roman Catholic Church in this country spent the money that it uses for support of the antiabortion groups on education and improving the life style of their living children perhaps life would be better for us all As for the members of our legislature who do not personally support abortions perhaps they should remember that they were elected to represent their constituency not their own personal point of view Nor were they elected to make their views and the views of other lobbyists through verbal manipulation their constituents views America is in crisis and we as Americans must restate and underline the very core of the American belief In individuality and religious moral and political freedom Radnor Pa May 17 1978
Juanita Kreps Lauded For Lifting Agency Status,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/25/archives/juanita-kreps-lauded-for-lifting-agency-status-organized-sessions.html,WASHINGTON May 24Robert S Strauss the Presidents trade and inflation counselor told her she had taken a thirdrate department and made it second rate President Carter himself told her she had taken a thirdrate department and made it first rate Juanita Morris Kreps describes her own performance as the nations 25th Commerce Secretary the first woman and the first Secretary with a doctorate in economics as effective The selfappraisal is perhaps overmodest In 16 months the 57yearold former economics professor dean and vice president of Duke University has been one of the most outspoken and some hasten to add impressive officers of the Carter Administration Most Commerce Secretaries have been nonentities said Dixon Donnelley a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Mrs Kreps has been a personality plus for the department and the Administration Organized Sessions With Carter Late last year when Mr Carters relations with the business community were on the ebb it was she who organized the visits of top business executives to Washington discussion sessions with the President The meetings contributed to changes in the Administrations economic prioritiesthe shift to greater emphasis in the fight against inflation and to greater encouragement of investment There had been talk of a crisis in business confidence Now that talk has waned But even though Mrs Kreps had been a director of several companies and represents a department traditionally identified with husiness interests her approach to the job has not been blindly probusiness Her proposal for instance that the Commerce Department keep a social audit of companies measuring how they fulfill their public responsibilities drew an aroused protest from business That idea has been relegated to a hack burner It was incorrectly perceived Mrs Kreps thinks She expects it will have to simmer some more Polley Called EvenHanded I would call it an evenhanded policy said the governmentaffairs officer of a multinational company noting that Mrs Kreps while advocating the social audit was also among the first Cabinet officers to point to the cost in added inflation of the nations regulatory policies Her demands for an assessment of the benefits of regulation weighed against their inflationary cost have made her an effective spokesperson for business said the executive who preferred not to be named Mrs Kreps has made a significant contribution in other policy areas She pressed for new tax incentives to encourage business investment in President Carters urban revitalization program She elevated the relative importance of the statisticalgathering services of the Commerce Department giving them a greater function in the formation of policy Its a credible performance said Jack Carlson chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce better than many of her predecessors But while applauded from the outside Mrs Krepss power and influence have been eroded from the inside She is no longer in the inner sanctum of economic policymaking Has Kept Her Peace Until six months ago she and Labor Secretary Ray Marshall also an economist with a PhD degree were among the regular members of the interagency Economic Policy Group headed by Treasury Secretary W Michael Blumenthal The group sets the main options for the President at Thursday morning breakfasts at the Treasury It was decided that there were too many at the breakfasts that too little was getting done and that Mrs Kreps and Mr Marshall were expendable Though not too happy about this Mrs Kreps has kept her peace She says she goes to the breakfasts at the Treasury any time something of specific interest to her is coming up For instance she will be deeply involved in preparing the options for the Presidential decision expected in midJune on a national export policy But the exclusion hurts and at times leads to embarrassing missteps For instance she told North Carolina bankers on the morning of May 12 that this is no time to waffle on a major tax cut At 230 that afternoon the White House announced that the President was trimming the size of his taxreduction proposal Reported Deeply Angered She was angry angrier than Ive ever seen her one aide said The decision was made the previous day but the White House staff and her staff had just not come together Genteel restrained civilized Mrs Kreps is not by nature a bureaucratic infighter She does speak her mind however not infrequently to the President To the Presidents assertion that it was difficult finding qualified women for Cabinet posts she replied We have to do a better job of looking She told Mr Carter she did not agree with his position backing the Health Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph A Califano Jr on restricting Federal funds for abortions Mrs Kreps who was born in a Kentucky coalmining community was a teacher for 30 years a specialist in labor economics and the author of learned works with such snappy titles as Sex in the Marketplace American Women at Work Held Posts at 2 Universities She came to Washington from Duke at which she served while also James B Duke Professor of Banking at the University of North Carolina in nearby Chapel Hill Before taking her Government job she had served on the boards of the New York Stock Exchange R J Reynolds Industries the J C Penney Company the Eastman Kodak Company and the North Carolina National Bank She lives alone in an apartment seven and a half minutes from her elegant office The best in town including the Oval Office she boasts with mahogany walls vaulted ceiling and a view of the grassy swards that slope toward the Washington Monument One of her betterknown predecessors Herbert Hoover designed the office She loves her job Its the most exciting experience Ive ever had but she dislikes absences from her husband and family still feels an outsider here and gets back to North Carolina every weekend she can With One of Everything Mrs Kreps quips that her department with its 38500 employees and 13 major divisions is like Noahs Arkthe difference being that where the ark had two of everything the Commerce Department has only one Among other things the department promotes growth of industry and commerce manages a 6 billion public works budget administers the largely mothballed merchant fleet aids ethnic minorities explores maps and charts the seas forecasts the weather takes the census coordinates the measurement of standards and prepares statistics on the nations output of goods and services What she has tried to do her aides say is to give the seemingly disparate divisions a common purpose by getting them to focus more on the commercial and business aspects of their activities Although she has appointed several women to high posts  Courtenay Slater the chief economist and Lucy Falcone the deputy policy planner are two examplesand although she is pressing hard for a woman to fill the empty seat at the Federal Reserve Board Mrs Kreps is not at all encouraged by womens progress in the job market She notes that women are still being hired at lower levels and in many cases are being checked in upward moves She is disturbed also by the time It takes to reach a consensus in government I am struck by how slowly the democratic process really works she says
Pope Attacks New Abortion Law In Italy as Sanction for ‘Crime’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/25/archives/pope-attacks-new-abortion-law-in-italy-as-sanction-for-crime.html,VATICAN CITY May 24 APAddressing a crowd of 10000 today Pope Paul VI attacked abortion as a crime against an innocent and defenseless creature and said that human life was sacred from its beginning in the mothers womb The Popes remarks were ms tirst public comment since the Italian Parliament gave final approval last week to one of Europes most liberal abortion laws The law allows abortion on demand in the first 90 days of pregnancy We cannot forget the duty of every person of us pastors especially to deplore the permissive legislation on abortion the Pope said in an address in Italian during his weekly general audience We must make a new moral affirmation about the sacred inviolability of human life from its beginning in the mothers womb the Pope said
Abortions and the Middle Class,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/25/archives/abortions-and-the-middle-class.html,Three disturbing abortion proposals are now before the House of Representatives One would end health insurance coverage for abortions for military personnel or their dependents A second would permit employers to discriminate against workers who have abortions  even though the Civil Rights Act is to be amended to forbid discrimination against other pregnant workers And the third would tighten still further eligibility standards on Federal Medicaid payments for abortions for the poor All these initiatives represent alarming additional Incursions on the right to have an abortion But all may succeed  because none would seriously affect middleclass Americans Despite the long battle over abortion rights that has deeply divided communities and shaken politicians in this country middleclass American women can still buy safe legal abortions during the early months of pregnancy without any questions asked by anyone other than their own physicians But not the poor severely restricted in their access to Medicaid abortion funds And not the young several states including New York are now considering laws to require teenagers to notify their parents before an abortion can be performed Even the proposed restrictions on civil rights and military insurance would not much affect the middle class Neither change would actually deny any women the right to a safe abortion The Civil Rights bill is intended quite properly to remedy an omission in the 1964 act that forbade employers to discriminate against workers on the basis of sex  but left room for discrimination against the pregnant The Supreme Court ruled that the law allowed a company to exclude pregnancy coverage from its health and disability plans The new law would end such discrimination against the pregnant But it would specifically exclude most women who undergo abortions The end of military insurance for such women would be a similar form of legalized discrimination The change would force women to pay out of pocket for the procedure But since the cost of an abortion rarely exceeds a few hundred dollars the fee would be manageable for most women Families often pay many times that much out of pocket to meet routine maternity costs To the middle class hence abortion remains largely an abstraction not a real costly and personal tragedy As a result the weaker segments of society are left without allies or defense The middle class has a responsibility to its conscience and to its own future free choice in the personal matter of abortion

THE PERPLEXING MR. PROXMIRE,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/the-perplexing-mr-proxmire-with-new-york-facing-bankruptcy-by-hands.html,With New York facing bankruptcy by hands of one of the greatest eccentrics midsummer it is the citys destiny to have its fate in the in the entire history of the United States Senate WASHINGTON He comes out of the early morning mist a solitary figure running as if his life depended on it He has done his 100 pushups and 200 situps 50 at a time and bounds out of his redbrick 190000 home in northwest Washington for the 49mile run to his office Sometimes he is met at his door by one of the more enterprising lobbyists who tries to keep pace with him pleading his case as the Senator turns down Connecticut Avenue runs across Dupont Circle and down Massachusetts Avenue No lobbyist however has yet proved a match for the physical condition of this lean taut 62yearold man It is only a matter of time before the exhausted lobbyist falls by the wayside the victim of too many leisurely lunches at the Sans Souci For Bill Proxmire the senior Senator from Wisconsin it is the same regimen rain or shine in the humid heat of a Washington summer or the unpredictable snows of winter He makes no allowances for the weather any more than he takes notice of the spontaneous unexpected intrusions  and delights  that lead others to change their plans His is a highly ordered life that includes 5669 consecutive rollcall votes since April 1966 and an estimated three million handshakes with voters since he started his political career in 1950 It is a life that has included a hair transplant the first in the history of the United States Senate a face lift and vacations spent hauling garbage and living in firehouses Mr Proxmire won reelection to his fourth term in 1976 with 73 percent of the vote spending only 17773 all his own money Thus Mr Proxmire says his mind is usually clear when he runs to work each morning waving to some of his neighbors admiring a lawn acknowledging a passerbys greeting The time is not spent in idle reverie however The Senator says that he uses the 35minute run at 84 miles an hour to plan his day and to mentally question the witnesses who will be appearing before the Senate Banking Committee which he chairs The Senator arrives at the Capitol at 815 showers washes his own underclothes in an office sink puts on a Robert Hall 55 business suit and has a breakfast of a half grapefruit sproutedwheat bread and sardines and a glass of skim milk It is New York Citys destiny to have its fate in the hands of one of the greatest eccentrics in the history of the United States Senate    Every month since March 1975 Senator Proxmire has given a Golden Fleece Award for the biggest most ridiculous or most ironic example of Government spending or waste The first award went to the National Science Foundation for an 84000 study to determine why people fall in love No one  not even the National Science Foundation  can argue that falling in love is a science the Senator said Even if they spent 84 million or 84 billion they wouldnt get an answer that anyone would believe    Bill Proxmire is the de facto viceroy of New York City a potentate imposed by an alien power in this case the Federal Government As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee he has a crucial voice in the financial future of New York City The current shortterm Federalloan program for 23 billion expires on June 30 and without new Federal legislation providing longterm aid New York faces bankruptcy by the middle of the summer Nowadays few city decisions are made without considering Senator Proxmires response On those occasions when local officials persist in policies that he opposes they invariably reverse themselves His criticism led City Council officials to relinquish a 50percent pay raise they had voted for themselves How lie had asked could they then expect city employees to hold the line in negotiations He was instrumental too in persuading City University to end free tuition One of the problems with Federal aid to the city Mr Proxmire says is the inevitable Federal involvement in the citys internal affairs We have to stick our nose into everything  wage settlements state and local taxes rent control  the works Under our Federal system such fiscal questions as tuition charges for city universities subway fares and salaries for members of the City Council all should he the responsibility of local officials He is then a reluctant viceroy and that is probably why he does so well with the native leaders I like Bill Proxmire Mayor Koch said during a recent lunch at City Hall I like his directness and the fact that he has a good staff He takes a very strong position but theres always room for movement There arc striking similarites between the two men Both are workaholics preferring the simple life and preferring to do things themselves rather than have others wait on them Ed Koch spent weekends shaking hands at subway entrances when Bill Proxmire was shaking hands outside plant gates Both are staight forward nononsense men who say pretty much what is on their minds Both have been sensitive to the desires of their constituents They speak the same language  the language of political professionals Despite the present gloom over the pros pects of Federal aid to New York City the city could have no better negotiator than Ed Koch as far as Bill Proxmire is concerned To Ed Koch Bill Proxmire is the key lf Proxmire were leading this fight we would win hands down he said It was Senator Proxmire who led the last fight in 1975 reversing himself after hearing the pleas of mayors bankers and businessmen who warned that a New York City bankruptcy would have a ripple effect that would spread across the nation He took New Yorks cause as his own even though that was the year before his reelection campaign when being a champion of the city could have hurt him politically back home Today he appears to be more cautious The Senator believes that a New York City bankruptcy this year will not have the same repercussions He suggests that banks will not be imperiled by such an event since most have decreased their New York holdings those that do have substantial investments in the city have them in the form of MAC bonds which are officially state bonds and so are protected from city bankruptcy The Senator also argues that the municipalbond market will not be adversely affected since it is stronger now and investors used to New Yorks problems will not blame other cities for Gothams sins He also feels that a New York City bankruptcy will have a minimal effect on the suppliers of goods purchased by the cityfrom ketchup to subway cars  because the city will be forced to purchase what it needs on a COD basis Furthermore Mr Proxmire believes a New York City bankruptcy would be an object lesson in the perils of living beyond ones means    The Golden Fleece Award in October 1976 was given to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse for a 10900 study to find out if drunk fish are more aggressive than sober fish    How does Bill Proxmire assess the likelihood that the city will receive Federal aid I just dont know says the Senator who contends that extending Federal aid to the city will set a dangerous precedent and encourage other cities to overextend their credit He wonders if a Federal bailout would not undermine the restraints that the city should exercise with regard to the wages of employees and the demands of constituents  Hang the expense the Feds will pick it up He wonders too why New York City the financial capital of the world the headquarters of the nations largest banks lacks the resources to provide for itself He remembers that the last time Governor Carey asked for Federal aid to the city in 1975 he pledged that it would be a oneshot deal and the Senator gave that assurance to his colleagues on the Senate floor The Senator is nut inflexible however Theres no way you can tell the circumstances that are likely to devel op he says You just have to keep going over this thing and determine whether in fact New York can make it by itself Its hard to believe that that great city under these circumstances  were not in a depression the cities generally are doing well  wouldnt be able to come up with the money that it has to have Few in Washington believe that the Federal Government will not provide some fiscal relief to New York City after June 30 and still fewer believe that Mr Proxmire will he an obstacle to Federal aid to the city Mr Proxmires current criticism of New York Citys fiscal problems and his hardline approach to further aid are considered politically necessary in order to persuade his colleagues and the nation that New York is making a genuine effort to put its house in order Unlike 1975 this time around he will have the active support of a Democratic President The likeliest prospect for Ihe city in the opinion of Mayor Koch and Senator Proxmires top aides is for some continuation of the present seasonalloan program    In Vehruary 1977 the Senator gare his Golden Fleece Award to the Law Entarcenwnl Assistance Administralum for a 2711011 study to aelertnine why inmates want to escape from prison This study is a crime the senator said II should be obvious to one and all why someone in jail wants to get out His is a highly ordered life that has included 5669 consecutive rollcall votes three million handshakes a hair transplant a facelift and vacations spent hauling garbage and living in firehouses    Educated at an Eastern prep school where he was voted biggest grind Yale University and the Harvard Business School and a veteran of World War 11 Bill Proxmire decided in 1949 to leave his home in Lake Forest Ill a wealthy suburb of Chicago where his father was a prosperous physician He took a newspaper job in Madison Wis with a view toward entering politics Wisconsin appealed to him primarily because the Democratic party was in disarray  Republicans held all statewide offices His wife the former Elsie Rockefeller a greatgrandniece of John D was a financial and social asset Prox showed up one day and introduced himself recalls the United States Ambassador to Mexico Put rick Lucey former Governor of Wisconsin who was then a freshman in the State Assembly He said Im a cub reporter for The Cap Times but I have a lot of spare time on my hands and Id like to help the Democratic party He wrote weekly press releases and we made up quotes and attributed them to the Democratic legislators Once everyone spotted a phony quote  the man had never said anything literate before The Senator is asked whether in retrospect he thinks there might have been a conflict of interest in working for a newspaper for which he occasionally covered politics and writing press releases for politicians This is the first time thats been raised he says and in retrospect there would seem to be a conflict But politics wasnt my beat I had a broad generalassignment beat with occasional stories on politics including one on Senator [Joseph R] McCarthys failure to file a tax return Mr Proxmire lost his newspaper job after a series of demotions that began when he killed a story about a woman labor organizer found in a mans hotel room He thought she had been framed but the opposition newspaper ran the story across the top of page one Bill Proxmire then got a job as business manager of a laborunion paper and started a radio show called Labor Sounds Off Once a week he designated a man as No Friend of Labor and another as Man of the Week With an eye to public office he designated his old boss  the founder editor and publisher of The Capital Times as the first Man of the Week He was just so impressed Mr Proxmire recalls Here he fired me and I made him a hero The following year in 1950 he won an upset victory for the State Assembly using the 16hour days and relentless handshaking that would be a mark of his political career To win the primary he concentrated on the 15 precincts out of 29 where 80 percent of the Democratic voters lived I went to every farm every house he remembers Id knock on the door and ask them to sign my nominating petitions Then Id send them a little handwritten note recalling part of the conversation Then a week before the primary Id drop them another note reminding them to vote and two days before the election my wife and I made several thousand phone calls He lived in YMCAs and 4anight hotel rooms washed his own underclothes and generally lived the spartan ascetic life that has since been popularized by politicians like Californias Gov Jerry Brown In 52 54 and 56 Bill Proxmire won the Democratic nomination for governor but lost in the general election In 1957 after the death of Joseph R McCarthy he won the Democratic nomination in a special election for the senatorial seat His Republican opponent was Walter Kohler Jr who had defeated him in the governorship races of 52 and 54 Portrayed by Mr Kohler as a threetime loser Bill Proxmire dramatically demonstrated his skill at exploiting that old political maxim If you have a lemon make lemonade Let my opponent have the support of the man who has never proposed to a girl and lost Mr Proxmire said Ill take the losers He can have the support of the man who never owed a note he couldnt pay Ill take the debtors If all those who have ever lost in business love sports or politics will vote for me as one who knows what it is to lose and fight back I will be glad to give my opponent the support of those lucky voters who have never lost anything His years of campaigning paid off He won 58 percent of the vote defeating the man who had beaten him by 400000 votes five years earlier Some said that he had run so often that the voters thought they were voting for an incumbent    The Senator gave a Golden Fleece Award to the Federal Aviation Administration for a 57800 study of 78 body measurements of airline stewardess trainees ostensibly to design safety equipment The study was found to be virtually useless to 55 North American airlines because in the words of the study itself We might expect the stewardess complement of each airline to be anthropometrically uniqee    He came to the Senate in the tradition of the great Wisconsin mavericksthe two Bob La Follettes and Joe McCarthy Wisconsin has an affinity for biggame hunters says Representative Les Aspin a Wisconsin Democrat whose Congressional style is sometimes compared to that of Mr Proxmire for whom he once worked They like a guy to take out after the system Mr Proxmires first target was Lyndon B Johnson the most powerful majority leader in the Senates history big game especially for a freshman senator Lyndon Johnson had initially embraced Bill Proxmire had appointed him to the Banking Committee and the Agriculture Committee wined and dined and anointed him Senator Proxmire coveted a seat on the Finance Committee however and when he was passed over for three senators with less seniority he charged that Mr Johnson had amassed too much power There never has been a time when power has been so sharply concentrated as it is today in the Senate Mr Proxmire said in a Senate speech on Washingtons Birthday which was dubbed Proxmires Farewell Address because of the power of the man under attack The typical Democratic senator has literally nothing to do with determining the legislative program and policies of the party he continued Without frequent caucuses the individual senator cannot exercise his responsibility to hold the leadership accountable He recalls now that it was interesting the way the senators were quietly encouraging me behind the scenes Theyd call me at home I hey wouldnt call me at the office Paul Douglas stood up on the floor and supported me and Wayne Morse did But they were among the very few The attack was effective he believes We began to have caucuses he says Johnsons power began to diminish Two years later when Johnson became Vice President and still wanted to preside over the caucus the members said that that was an absolute violation of the separation of powers and there was no way he could do it     Senator Proxmire awarded a Golden Fleece to the Mr Proxmire feels that bankruptcy would have a minimal effect on suppliers of goods to New York City furthermore he believes it would be an object lesson in the perils of living beyond ones means National Endowment for the Humanities for a 2500 study to determine why people are rude illmannered cheat and lie on the local tennis courts    Bill Proxmires professional penury dates to his 1958 reelection campaign against a 62yearold judge who resigned from the Wisconsin Supreme Court to run for the Senate Richard Nixon then Vice President described the new Senator as a spendthrift and tagged him 35 billion Bill Proxmire of Wisconsin introduced five bills in the last Congress which would have cost by his own estimates 35 billion over a fiveyear period Mr Nixon charged in a speech in Indianapolis You can see what you would get if more senators of that philosophy are elected in November You will be in for a wild spending binge by radical Democrats drunk with visions of votes Hubert H Humphrey countered To be singled out by a barnstorming halftruthtelling Vice President is a singular honor for a man in his first year in the Senate Mr Nixons attack had a lasting effect however With only rare exceptions the Senator from Wisconsin has voted against bigspending bills singling out for special attention the programs of the Defense Department the biggest spender of all His two major Senate victories were the defeat of the supersonic transport and of the C5A The SST really went against the grain says the Senator We were financing a completely private commercial enterprise with hundreds of millions of Federal research dollars The opposition was formidable the aerospace industry organized labor the White House Wall Street financiers Boeing and two of the most powerful senators in Washington  Warren Magnuson and Henry Jackson The victory against the SST was a sign that it was not totally impossible for an abrasive but determined member operating outside the Senate clubwithout trading votes or doing favors and with little support other than public opinion  to win a major fight against powerful interests and establishment senators Its always better when you win a fight that nobody thinks you can win in a million years he says Mr Proxmires other signal victory was curtailing production of the C5A a jumbo transport after the Air Force reluctantly acknowledged a 2 billion cost overrun This was more than we were spending on aid to elementary and secondary education in the entire country the Senator says One other legislative achievement in which the Senator takes great pride is the truthinlending bill A recent study by the Federal Reserve indicates that three times as many people now understand what the true annual rate is what the financial charge is as did before Mr Proxmire says That includes people who are poorly educated and minority groups who have been the most victimized    Senator Proxmire gave a Golden Fleece Award to the Department of Agriculture for a 46000 study that found that it takes 838 TMUs Time Measurement Units each equal to 036 seconds to fry two eggs in a skillet After the award the agency gave up plans for similar studies on lunch and dinner    He does everything alone apart from the party and anyone else says Gaylord Nelson Wisconsins other Senator who is also a Democrat The two men are a study in contrasts The newspaper reporters who cover Wisconsin politics describe Bill Proxmire as an overachiever and Gaylord Nelson as an underachiever Unlike Mr Proxmire Nelson is a relaxed man who enjoys a drink and a joke the company of friends a night on the town and a weekend fishing and hunting Mr Nelson has the affection of Wisconsin politicians and newspaper reporters They are in awe of Mr Proxmire Senator Proxmire does not relax smoke or drink He is by disposition a loner He could have been a hermit says Ellen Proxmire his second wife whom he met in the mid50s when she was the only paid worker in the Wisconsin Democratic party She managed three of his Senate campaigns but gave up politics 12 years ago in favor of her own business Washington WhirlAround which organizes Washington tours conferences and social events The couple are reconciled after a threeandahalfyear separation Bill lives a wellordered life she says Others might stay out late if theyre having a good time and know theyll pay for it the next morning Hell go to bed The death of a dayold son William Wayne for Senator Morse in 1958 did not deter Mr Proxmire from leaving home shortly afterward to campaign in Wisconsin She recalls it as two or three days later He recalls it as two or three weeks later That was Bill says Mrs Proxmire I knew that when I married him His priorities are different from most peoples Otherwise he never would have accomplished what he has accomplished Another son Douglas Clark 16 was named after Senators Paul Douglas and Joseph Clark The Senator also has son Ted 30 and daughter Elsie Cici 29 by his first wife Guests in their home tell of being invited to dinner and being entertained by Ellen Proxmire until mealtime when the Senator makes his entrance and then watching the Senator retire after the meal and before the afterdinner drinks Bill doesnt have a good anchor says a friend of many years Hes convinced that he has no natural ability so he has to work hard He sees himself as a barely competent guy who has to work hard to stay even His whole life is a constant struggle for selfimprovement  physically and mentally He lives in constant fear of backsliding He schedules himself for the entire day down to the smallest detail the friend continues He has to keep himself tightly under control so he doesnt bust loose Like John Kennedy Bill Proxmire grew up with an older brother who overshadowed and tormented him His brother Ted had the graces that he lacked along with superior athletic and scholastic ability Ted died in an Army plane crash in 1939 before the start of World War II A younger sister Adele died of multiple sclerosis after years of debilitating illness    The Golden Fleece Award last month went to the National Institute of Mental Health for a 97000 grant that produced among other reports a study of The Peruvian Brothel a Sexual Dispensary and Social Arena    I believe its of the utmost importance not only to the city of Milwaukee but for all the cities in America for us here to join together Milwaukees Mayor Henry Maier told the City Council last April and if somebody is going to force us into a fight lets fight like hell The somebody referred to was of course Bill Proxmire and the reference was to his vote against the emergency publicworks bill on the grounds that Wisconsin taxpayers would be paying twice as much in taxes as they would receive in benefits The Senator has had a running battle with Mayor Maier whom he privately criticizes for using urbanrenewal funds to rebuild a downtown theater and renovate downtown and middleclass housing The Mayor has declined to be interviewed Mr Proxmire says he opposes President Carters urbanrenewal policy because it mistakenly calls for more money Were spending 60 billion on the cities this year and were not getting results he told a recent luncheon of corporate executives in Racine Wis We should target the funds for people who need help and not try to build up the whole city We let a US Senator taks 19 million away from us said an aggrieved Mayor Maier last April and when the thing finally got corrected and we settled for 12 million everybody in the Common Council and the Mayors office was glad to have that 12 million to help balance our budget The largesse was 7 million short because of the vote of the US Senator from Wisconsin Im asking you not to forget these things so easily because the battle settles right down in your own neighborhoods and your own tax rolls In 1978 79 percent of Urban Development Action grants went to urban downtown development Mr Proxmire says Only 11 percent went to neighborhoods Federal money should be used to help people who cant help themselves    In August 1977 the Golden Fleece Award went to the Department of Transportation for spending 250000 on a report that forecasts transportation needs in the year 2025 In the studys four sciencefiction scenarios the United States undergoes an ice age becomes a dictatorship is transformed into a hippie cutlure and achieves the American dream    Isnt it true that bankruptcy is a more viable option now if the city cant make it on its own than was the case back in 75 Senator Proxmire asked last December in the highceilinged Senate Banking Committee room at the opening of three days of hearings that dealt with the possible renewal of Federal aid to New York Mr Chairman I cannot agree replied Treasury Secretary W Michael Blumenthal I would have to say that at any time bankruptcy for the City of New York would create the most serious difficulties for the Federal Government for the State of New York for the people that live in that area and for the Federal Treasury Mayor Koch had previously told the committee by letter that bankruptcy was unthinkable Do you know of a single vendor who would sell to New York City if we were bankrupt except on a COD basis he asks in an interview If you do he should be in a loony bin If we were bankrupt we would then become a ward of the Federal Government Mayor Koch continues It wouldnt be the welfare population on welfare it would be the City of New York on welfare What businessmen would come here What businessmen would stay here At the second day of the hearings Senator Proxmire reminded Governor Carey that he had pledged in 1975 that we will never need a bailout again and we wont come back for help we are going to make it We have made it the Governor replied lamely The third day Mr Proxmire put this case to David Rockefeller Are we telling other cities that fiscal responsibility is important  but if you dont [make it] you can count on Uncle Sam to come in and provide for a cushion to carry you over Mr Rockefeller replied that each situation has to be assessed on its own merits whether in fact the nation would be benefitted by special assistance in that situation The Senator reserved his sharpest questioning for the bankers and asked Alfred Brittain 3d chairman of the Bankers Trust Company why his bank had reduced its holdings of New York City bonds from 118 million to 58 million He asked Edward Palmer chairman of the executive committee at Citibank why his bank held only 30 million of city bonds in April 1975 We were pretty good salesmen Mr Palmer replied The name of the game if you are underwriting something is to sell it and get it out If it turns out to be a good item you buy some of it back at market and you have it in inventory so when someone calls on the phone you can sell it In this instance  there was no demand no inventory To this the Senator said It looks as if you regarded New York City [bonds] as not a good investment Therefore you held down your commitment to a very low level Is that wrong That is not right Mr Palmer replied  In 1974 we had made  an investmentpolicy decision that we were not going to hold for our own account exempt securities We were not going to add to them  whether New York City New York State Texas Maryland Illinois whatever  There was a variety of reasons  the tax advantage of holding them was reduced At a later point the Senator asked Mr Palmer whether you feel there is any obligation on the part of a large bank such as yours to invest in the citys securities at any time Mr Palmer replied that the securities were sold competitively and that when they could not be sold we demonstrated our ability and willingness to take our proportionate share of those notes that could not be sold publicly A few moments later Mr Palmer explained We are in a business to underwrite and distribute securities and we have no other obligation than that And the Senator replied I understand you are not a social institution not a governmental institution you dont have the social obligations that governmental entities have you are not created for that purpose you have a very clear obligation to your depositors and stockholders But couldnt Citibank do more such as come up with 900 million or 1 billion to invest in the city the Senator asked Mr Palmer replied As we have since 1812 we will be a good citizen of the City of New York    The Golden Fleece Award last October went to the Department of Labor pir a 384918 contract to hire 101 persons under the Conprehensive Employment and Training Act to do a doortodoor survey of the number of dogs cats and horses in the 160000 houses and apartments in Ventura County Calif    Senator Proxmire acknowledges that unlike banks the Federal Government is a social as well as political institution with a broad perspective a court of last resort with responsibility not to a handful of shareholders and depositors but to 200 million Americans The Senator also acknowledges that there is no doubt that the city has made progress It has reduced city employment by 60000 jobs instituted tuition at City University and reformed its budget and accounting systems But he has a large folder of articles clipped from The New York Times in which Controllers Harrison Goldin and Arthur Levitt report various inefficiencies including city sanitation workers playing golf instead of reporting for duty Right now Mr Proxmire simply does not believe that the city needs the 23 billion in longterm loan guarantees proposed by President Carter We figured out the arithmetic this way he says We know that there will be deficits during the next four years We know that there are seasonal needs and very substantial capital needs We figure that what New York City needs in its next capital budget would be taken care of if it could raise 35 billion over the next four years This would come from two sources he continues First by keeping the city pension fund at the level scheduled for fiscal 78 35 percent the city would get 225 billion Second the Municipal Assistance Corporation could sell 500 million of securities each year for 2 billion In 1977 it sold 700 million The city pension funds says Senator Proxmire will have to reinvest 941 million in bonds that will mature in the next four years even though the city pension funds are reluctant to do so considering such a reinvestment imprudent While they now have 3 billion invested in city bonds they have indicated a desire to decrease their present rate of investment Similarly the banks already have reduced their investment in city bonds The Senator believes that the city pension funds and the banks have a high stake in the citys solvency and will eventually respond to the citys fiscal needs Its their city and theyre in a position to avert bankruptcy says the Senator If the city is bankrupt theres a question of whether the city will continue to provide funds to the pension funds To meet seasonal needs the Senator believes that the city could spread out more evenly its collections from property taxes and state aid and obtain a 600million annual line of credit from the banks The banks can afford a lot more than that he says He is not impressed by the bankers reluctance to purchase additional city bonds nor the desire of city pensionfund trustees to cash in their municipal holdings They will be persuaded by the force of circumstances he says I think theyre going to grumble like the dickens but theyll pull through the Senator says There is of course no way to compel the banks or city pension funds  or the Federal Government itself  to come again to the aid of the city but most observers believe that the situation is ripe for compromises Few Proxmire  watchers take his gloomy forecast at face value The Senator has after all demonstrated an uncanny ability to adjust to political imperatives Im a pragmatic eclectic he says when asked to describe his political philosophy I like to feel that we ought to start with the notion that we have a good country but that it can stand improvement Does that mean as some critics have charged that he has no political philosophy I think that Jefferson was in his day a pragmatic eclectic the Senator replies He was on both sides of a lot of issues    One Golden Fleece Award for a study on why nunikeys clench their jaws resulted in an 8 million libel suit which was dismissed by a Federal district judge but is now on appeal Senator Barry Goldwater Republican of Arizona awarded Proxmire a Golden Fleece Award for persuading the Senate to vote to provide funds to defend the lawsuit    In 21 years in the Senate Mr Proxmire has accumulated a record that is difficult to characterize His first vote the day he arrived in August 1957 was for the first civilrights bill to pass the Senate in 80 years Yet civil libertarians might take issue with his opposition to busing and to abortion Nor can liberals or conservatives take heart from his reputation as a fiscal conservative He has opposed not only freespending defense programs but publicworks programs which he believes are too costly and not targeted where they should be  to help the unemployed And although he has been a relentless critic of defense spending Mr Proxmire was an ardent supporter of the Vietnam War until 1970 His votes on consumer issues led Ralph Nader to give him the highest rating among senators and his legislation includes not only the truthinlending bill but also a Fair Credit Reporting Act a Fair Credit Billing Act and a Mobile Home Safety Construction Standards Act Clearly aid to New York City has been the most significant legislation to come before his committee in the three years that he has been chairman All things considered the city could have done a lot worse than have to answer to a Bill Proxmire Some even believe that the city is fortunate to have an eccentric maverick playing such a crucial role in its destiny After all they argue New York City itself is an eccentric maverick among the cities of the world And like New York City Bill Proxmire knows what it is to be friendless and scorned and to labor mightily and score an upset victory And like the city he knows that he cannot do it all by himself Last April the Senator was surrounded by a group of Georgetown University students with whom he had discussed politics and government In the informal bull session that followed the students pressed him for some personal views What for instance did he consider important in life The consummate loner of the United States Senate the man who has sacrificed family and friends for a political career reflected for a few moments The most important thing in life he said is the capacity to feel affection and love for your fellow man and to be willing to do things to help him 
NONFICTION IN BRIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/nonfiction-in-brief.html,THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS TODAY By Henry Fairlie Drawings by Vint Lawrence 216 pp Washington New Republic Books 10 Morality is In I apologize for putting it so vulgarly but we live in an age of fads Universities report increased enrollments in ethics courses The re cent Congress of the Laity in Los Angeles provoked an unprecedented amount of interest Malcolm Muggeridge after years in the wilderness is currently regarded with a respect bordering on veneration And now the Washingtonbased British journalist Henry Fairlie has produced an uncompromisingly moral text The Seven Deadly Sins Today The sins have an oldfashioned ring in case youd forgotten they are Pride Envy Anger Sloth Avarice Gluttony and Lust and function more or less as a schematic framework for Mr Fairlies tirade against society Part of the interest in reading it is seeing how he fits the ancient sin to the contemporary condition For instance he hates shopping malls Avarice conspiracy theories Anger the human potential movement Sloth Jonathan Livingston Seagull Pride and so forth It is difficult to write something like this without sounding like a prig or a spoilsport At times Mr Fairlies language becomes suspiciously pulpitlike Frivolity although not a Deadly Sin yearns to be included He also occasionally indulges in such sweeping generalizations that the reader jumps up and down in indignation We are becoming a breed of junkies And some of his targets verge on absurdity For instance he sees evil in the plethora of cookbooks equating interest in cooking with Gluttony and his pages on abortion will make hackles rise But the book is depressingly accurate about many of our malaises His theme is still The Exhaustion of the Self a chapter title from his earlier book The Spoiled Child of the Western World The retreat into ourselves has blinded us to social injustice he argues Our false concept of individualism is a lifedenying force The most monstrous of its falsehoods is the belief that the individual can find fulfillment and salvation in nothing but his or her self and the denial that we are members one of another His accusations are convincing his solutions offered in a final chapter entitled The Paths of Love less so But that probably does not surprise the author who knows the problem all too well We have all but abandoned the big words to talk of the big things LoyaltyComradeshipPatriotismFidelity We wince when we try to utter them They die lips Hes right FITS AND STARTS The Premature Memoirs of Andrew Ward 177 pp Boston AtlanticLittle Brown 895 Reading a collection of someones articles padded out to make a book is rather like the clich of the Chinese meal lots of dishes but one feels hungry almost immediately afterward Andrew Ward wrote some funny articles that were published in various places The New York Times and The Atlantic Monthly among them and he has now strung them together with new material to form a vaguely chronological memoir of his youth in Connecticut Like Osbert Sitwell and Nancy Mitford Mr Ward is the proud possessor of highly eccentric parents who make excellent writing fodder He also makes the most of his years as a too tall adolescent at Eastern Junior High But there is nothing that remarkable about his background let alone his foreground which as he himself concedes is notable mainly for a clearedup complexion and a sweatervest The sequence of chapters has the faintly disconnected quality inevitable in a collection even if one overlooks such giveaways as the introduction of characters as though they are entirely new when they have already been kicking around in earlier chapters The title Fits and Starts is apt one never quite gets into top The fact that in spite of these cavils the book is such a pleas ure to read proves the familiar contention that style can triumph over content Andrew Ward does write well We were afforded chances to observe the girls exercising in their turbulent Danskins I remember fondly And do not miss the Authors Note It is a perfect parody of those tedious and solemn without whose unfailing support acknowledgments I have a feeling that next time Mr Wards publishers should not let him get away with such a potpourri If he actually writes a whole book theres a chance it might turn out to be as good and as funny as Laughter in the Next Room or The Pursuit of Love RUNNING AND BEING The Total Experience By George A Sheehan MD Drawings by Nora Sheehan 256 pp New York Simon and Schuster 895 I dont run Ill say that again I dont run Im one of the few New Yorkers who does not own a pair of Adidas shoes and a track suit or set my alarm for 6 oclock every morning for my rendezvous with the reservoir And now I know why Dr George A Sheehan has brought out a new book and if this is what running does for you wed better go back to crawling on all fours Dr Sheehan was running when Fixx was still a bad spellers injection of dope He is a 58yearold cardiologist with 12 children who runs a great marathon He has also been confiding his thoughts to thousands of readers in a newspaper column which he compares with pulling the handles of a slot machine And then Bang jackpot the piece is finished whole and true and good he writes in his prologue to the new book Well whole anyway Listen to this When I run the roads I am a saint I am Assisi wearing the least and meanest of clothes Or I am a descendant of  people of the mindMen like Kierkegaard and Emerson and Bertrand Russell Or But I am who I am and can be nothing but that Or Today I took Truth and ran with it on the Ocean Road Or The distance runner is a prophet Like the poet he is the antenna of the race I could go on It must be all those long runs  theyve scrambled the mans mind In case we question his relationship with Kierkegaard and Emerson and Bertrand Russell he gathers together a large number of quotes from Great Minds such as Kant Nietzsche Plato Socrates Ortega y Gasset Suzuki and one Bertram S Brown hes nothing if not eclectic Their works are ruthlessly excavated for material to buttress Dr Sheehans thesis to wit or rather witless that Running is Being that Running is the Total Experience that the Body Maketh Man and that the Boston Celtics are saints Sport will not build a character it will do something better It will make a man free The concepts of physical fitness as a heroic ideal and of the athletescholar have reputable antecedents to be sure In our time the theme was taken to its limits in an astonishing book Sun and Steel by Yukio Mishima And look what happened to him If only Dr Sheehan had limited himself to the interesting things he knows about running such as maximum performance in a race carbohydrate loading metabolic reactions and exercise physiology tests  all of which appear in the second part of this book But I can see him now pounding through the country lanes in the early morning mist panting ever so slightly as the Profound Thoughts come to him one by one Running is an art yes and the runner is an artist Am I not a painter at my craft No make that canvas Yes thats better The runner  is always at his canvas  Jackpot Three cherries Henry Fairlie in The Seven Deadly Sins Today describes the high runners get as a whiffling sensation Thats the sensation I got from reading Dr Sheehans book and as I said I dont run It must be contagious LOVE LAUGHTER AND TEARS My Hollywood Story By Adela Rogers St Johns Illustrated 342 pp New York Doubleday  Co 10 Reckless Clara Bow Madcap Mabel Normand Mack Sennett King of Comedy Mary and Doug the Royal Couple Jean Harlow the Baby Glamorous Gloria Swanson Theyre all here folks in this book about that wonderful place called Hollywood Love laughter and tears And so it was Oh it was And if you modern cynics dont believe it Adela Rogers St Johns is going to tell you over and over until you get it into your silly noggins Of the scandals the tragedies the heartbreaks The love the laughter the tears Music laughter God She seems to like them in threes This is the Hollywood of magic of legend of romance The fact that you may have heard most of these stories before doesnt faze our narrator one teeny bit Who cares if the Jean Harlow story has been told to death excuse the pun and made into a bad movie to boot Whos complaining if the Carole LombardClark Gable love story has been the staple diet of True Romances for years let alone made into another bad movie Mrs St Johns weaves for us once again the tapestry that was Hollywood and the clichs and Capital Letters flow like the love the laughter and the tears The author was a Hearst reporter in the 1920s and 30s She was called the Mother Confessor of Hollywood but evidently the oath to respect privacy of confession did not apply in her case because out it all pours the scandals the tragedies the heartbreaks The trouble is that the stuff of legend wears awfully thin after 342 pages The most unintentionally funny moment in the book comes when she describes Rudolph Valentinos fury when a journalist attacked his virility In nervous hunger he ate huge highly seasoned meals until the sweat broke on his forehead She seems to have been rather a prim lady actually I imagine her in white gloves and a hat I realize that today a lot of readers are more interested in the manure than the rose she sniffs She manages to stick her needle into a few contemporary targets  the presentday obsession with Teeth for instance one more symptom of what she sees as the drab and dreadful end of the Movies 
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/the-nation-in-summary-carter-hits-the-road-using-his-old-triptik.html,President Carter had seen the past and it worked so last week he continued his headlong rush into 1976 More and more Mr Carters political rhetoric has the ring of his successful Presidential campaign a blend of neopopulism plain talk and invocation of lofty purpose The change was hardly accidental Mr Carters advisers are looking for ways to improve his soggy standing in the polls and counteract a sense  in the words of pollster Pat Caddell the Presidents analystthat people are still not sure who he is One solution the White House believes is to pick up the manofthepeople approach that worked so well two years ago There were many flourishes of 1976 on a twoday political trip to Illinois and West Virginia last week To show spontaneity the President discarded a prepared speech on Federalstate relations and fielded questions from the IIlinois Legislature in Springfield To show his concern on a matter of human rights in a state singled out for action by the womens movement he asked the legislators to pass the equal rights amendment To show he knew how to make political gestures neglected before he made sure in Chicago to praise ward politics as practiced by the Cook County Democratic machine Even the shelved speech contained an old Carter theme  he is not a conventional politician and like many of his audiences has trouble with Washington In the prepared text distributed to the legislators he ominously repeated a phrase used in Vietnam and spoke of an iron triangle made up of bureaucracy Congressional committees and wellorganized special interests working to thwart reforms The question is whether having missed a beat he can now return to the rhythms of the campaign and still strike a chord Perhaps not but Mr Carter knows how persuasive a forum the Presidency can be He had asked business leaders to hold down salary increases as an antiinflation measure and last week he got important help from the worlds largest company American Telephone and Telegraph said it would voluntarily keep raises this year for its top 430 executives to less than 5 percent Of course 5 percent of salaries such as the 572000 earned last year by John deButts ATTs chairman is still a lot of money Labors Begin On Labor Law On the top of the United States Senates list of stoptime techniques is the filibuster a device which permits any one Senator to delay a decision on an issue of particular passion by talking about it interminably or until 60 mem Orrin G Hatch bets cry enough Last week the latest such exercise went into its eighth day on a matter some Senators are now passionate about labor law changes Labor says the bill is essentially remedial to insure organizing and collective bargaining Many Republicans maintain that passage would tip the delicate balance between employers and unions damage small businesss and promote more inflation Typically the depth of the concern doesnt much show in the flat characteristically courteous exchanges between the opponents point man Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah and one of the bills sponsors Senator Harrison A Williams Jr Democrat of New Jersey Mr Williams May I ask my friend from Utah whether he would like me to take some time now and fill in until his next speaker arrives to address the question  Mr Hatch Either way If you care to take over or if you care to recess for the day it is all right with me  The passion is in the stakes of the outcome Both labor and business consider the outcome a test not only of present power but future influence on Capitol Hill Labor has been losing recentlyfor instance on common site picketing  even though its traditional ally the Democratic Party controls both Congress and the White House Business bas been doing better  the defeat of the consumer protection agency  and sees an opportunity to take the edge both have thrown their all in Labor im posed a special per capita assessment on workers to help pay for its lobbying business formed the National Action Committee on Labor Law Reform which has encouraged constituent mail The Democratic leadership plans to try ending the filibuster next week Brooke Admits A Cash Coverup Nothing had seemed amiss in the personalfinance reports released by senators nine days ago as part of their new ethics procedures But an item that was not in the report filed by Senator Edward W Brooke of Massachusetts caused him considerable embarrassment last week and threatened his chances for election to a third term Nowhere did Mr Brooke mention as theoretically he should have information he swore to last year during a divorce proceeding  that he owed 49000 to a Massachusetts liquor distributor It did not appear because as Mr Brooke admitted last week it was not true Some of his comments to The Boston Globe suggested that he had deliberately inflated his liabilities to hold down the divorce settlement But at a news conference the Senator claimed almost all of the money had come from his motherinlaw and eventually he intended to pay her back Mr Brookes political standing already had been weakened by his divorce and earlier questions about how he had acquired much of the property he owns The Senator a liberal Republican and the Senates only black has insisted he is not a wealthy man In fact he told his wifes divorce lawyer last year I have consistently had a shortfall in my cash flow Cost Overrun on Defense Budget It was Navy up 23 billion Air Force down 290 million and President Carter maybe 5050 last week The House voted to add a fifth nuclear carrier and a nuclear cruiser that President Carter didnt want to next years military budget and the Office of Management and Budget told the Pentagon that it was cutting in half the money the Air Force had requested to develop the MX mobile intercontinental missile in 1980 When the Pentagon had asked for MX money for 1979 Mr Carter said no As passed by the House 319 to 67 military procurement and research would cost 38 billion 12 billion for research and 26 for assorted new weapons such as the carrier Mr Carters budget intended to hold the line on military programs put the limit at 355 billion the Senate has yet to vote There is more than cost at issue Though advocates of a bigship Navy carried the day Administration strategists question the need for more supercarriers in the kind of brushfire war or patrol missions for which the fleet might be deployed As for the MX designed to be hidden in underground firing tunnels some military planners question both its efficiency and its primarily strategic usefulness During the defense debate Bob Carr Democrat of Michigan and a member of the Armed Service Committee which presented the bill dared the Congressionally unthinkable and offered a 355 billion substitute directly to the floor Committee members were notably affronted but their colleagues defeated the substitute 287 to 115 perhaps indicating that 1 of every 349 members regard the committee as less than sacrosanct For Miss Costanza Bsmnt Rm No Vu Considering the alternatives Midge Costanza should find the White House basement a bargain For a while last week she was in danger of exile to Baltimore  the Executive Office Building across the street In Washington you are where you sit and as a Presidential assistant with choice location near the Oval Office Miss Costanza has not sat well with Mr Carters closest advisers Some regard her as too outspoken others as inept in carrying out duties as liaison with community groups Either way the former vice mayor of Rochester NY has won few friends among the Georgians because of such actions as meeting with Administration women opposed to the Presidents views on abortion Bit by bit she has lost her more important duties mostly to a new White House hand Anne Wexler But the unkindest cut was the eviction notice handed to her by Hamilton Jordan Mr Carters chief of staff without portfolio It is harder to get the Presidents ear from across the street and people may think less of you for it James R Schlesinger refused for the longest time to give up his White House office even though hed been named Energy Secretary and didt belong there So Miss Costanza resisted not so much for herself she said but for the future of domestic human rights and womens issues that are now her main responsibilities The compromise keeps her in the West Wing but in the basement Down the hall is not Mr Carter but the White House mess

Equal Rights Amendment Is Mired In Confused and Emotional Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/equal-rights-amendment-is-mired-in-confused-and-emotional-debate.html,OKLAHOMA CITY May 26A strident sometimes gamy grassroots campaign waged by a proliferation of rightist organizations has placed the sixyearold equal rights amendment for women in serious jeopardy according to both proponents and opponents of the measure Approved by Congress and submitted to the states in 1972 with the blessings of a broad spectrum of public figures the amendment came very close to being ratified by threefourths of the state legislatures last year Backers Call Issues False But now it is mired deeper than ever in controversy and its advocates while acknowledging a certain disarray in their effort are charging that accusations with no relevance to legal rights for womenincluding that the amendment would encourage homosexuality Marxism and unisex bathroomshave mated an emotional climate that makes it difficult to consider the amendment on its merits In Oklahoma one of the 15 states that has not approved the amendment the pitched voices of the radio evangelists carry strong and clear across the flat plains alleging that the measure threatens church and family Legislators are flooded with mail and literature connecting the amendment with lesbianism and seual aberrations Womens Rights The Battle Continues First of a Series Women meet at churches to plot strategy against ratification Rural electric cooperatives print articles in their journals warning of a feminist takeover and of increased dependency on the Federal Government if the amendment is passed Chapters of the Farm Bureau have joined in the outcry It is the same to varying degrees in other states that have become battlegrounds for the amendment A feeling of hurt and anger has settled over the womens movement reminiscent of the feeling that permeated the civil rights struggle before segregation laws were broken down The womens leaders acknowledge that a division within their own ranks over goals and priorities is hampering ratification but they believe that the chief deterrent to passage of the amendment has been unfair or shady legislative practices at best and that the amendment has deliberately been misinterpreted by its opponents Liz Carpenter press secretary to the former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson is considered one of the more optimistic and politically realistic of the national ERA leaders She told a House judiciary subcommmittee in Washington last week A handful of wilful and mischievous mentwo in Florida two in North Carolina five in South Carolina seldom more than a dozen anywhere who are blocking the ERAare using fun and games to maneuver it deciding to stall justice toward women as the expendable issue which can be used to barter for political mischief Betty Friedan whose book The Feminine Mystique sparked the movement more than a decade ago said she fears that if the amendment succumbs to rightwing hysteria 55 years of effort will go down the drain Leaders of the ERA movement have asked Congress to extend the time for ratification beyond the sevenyear dead line of next March 22 and they are asking conventions to boycott cities and states that have not ratified the amendment Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex On the other side antiamendment battles have brought publicity and resources to rightwing organizations such as the John Birch Society organizations that had long been isolated from the mainstream of American politics Nothing has done more to fuel the resurgence of rightwing activism than the equal rights amendment Our final victory over the womens lib Equal Rights Amendment is within our grasp Phyllis Schlafly wrote in a recent letter to contributors to the Stop ERA organization which she heads When that happens you will share in the most remarkable victory of our time because you have been helping to spread the truth about the antifamily nature and the destructive potential of the unisex ERA You will have proved that the truth Is more powerful than the White House the press and the leftwing foundations combined First Proposed in 1923 The amendment which was st proposed in 1923 has been the main objective of the womens rights movement The proposed measure reads Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex As a current focus of controversy it is being compared to the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote which was ratified in 1920 after a 70year battle After all the debate legal scholars have concluded that the amendment would neither be a dramatic breakthrough for women in employment and other areas nor would it bring about the dire things predicted by its opponents such as requiring women to supply half of the family income It would be important the experts say in eliminating many state laws and practices that result in sexual inequality Undoubtedly the amendment would lead to a number of lawsuits as the courts decided how the language in the amendment should be applied Such assurances however have not quelled the hitter opposition nor the determination of the amendments supporters In Illinois alone the amendment has been voted on six times in the House and five times in the Senate Today President Carter in a visit to the state urged the Illinois Legislature to resist political pressures and to ratify the amendment While the national amendment has been pending 14 states have adopted state amendments This is a momentum that proponents of the measure fear will be lost if the national amendment is defeated The Causes of Trouble The last state to ratity me amendment was Indiana which did so in January 1977 bringing the total to 35 or three short of the number required A series of close crucial defeats followed while three statesTennessee Nebraska and Idahovoted to rescind earlier ratification though there is a legal question as to whether the recisions will be permitted to stand In three statesFlorida North Carolina and South Carolinanarrow defeats resulted as legislators changed their votes at the last minute In North Carolina where the measure was approved by the House and then defeated by one vote in the Senate one member Senator James McDuffee who had pledged his commitment to the amendment during his election campaign changed his vote to no based on what he called constituent pressure and changed circumstances The National Womens Political Caucus mounted a campaign against his reelection and in the North Carolina Democratic primary on May 2 he finished last in field of five In some of the states in which the amendment has not been ratified proponents of the measure suspect that payoffs ensured the defeat of the measure but nothing illegal has been proved What has been documented is raw American politics which has at times been dirty Eagle Forum a womens organization headed by Mrs Schlafly has shown to legislators and to the public in nonratifying states the frankest of prolesbian materials in displays that attribute the materials to the International Womens Year Conference in Houston last November For example the materials were shown in Bartlesville Okla last month by the Washington County chapter of the Eagle Forum and the Oklahoma Farm Bureau Women despite objections by proamendment women who contend that the materials did not have the sanction of the conference Mrs Schlafly defended the exhibit on the ground that the material came from one of the booths rented at the conference by homosexual interests I try to be precise she said I dont call anybody a lesbian who isnt a lesbian She said that the women involved made the connection between the materials and the conference which was sponsored by the Federal Government Repudiating the Attack State Representative Cleta Detherage of Oklahoma who is a leading supporter of the amendment said she called the White House to ask what could be done to repudiate the use of prolesbian materials in attacking the amendment She said she was told that the Gay Rights Alliance was handling that issue and that questions should be referred to that organization Well I cant refer people in Oklahoma to them Mrs Detherage said How do you deal with something like that An example from North Carolina and Florida shows some of the political aspects of the fight The Conservative Caucus one of the new activist organizations working from the Washington area and using the directmail facilities of Richard A Viguerie sent 90000 letters to voters in North Carolina and 150000 to those in Florida saying that the amendment would give the Federal bureaucrats and judges large new powers over marriage divorce and other areas now in state hands Howard Phillips the national director of the caucus contended that his mailings were responsible for the defeat of the amendment in those states Members of the legislatures said that they were moved by the telephone calls and letters from constituents that flooded them on the eve of the voting Catching Up With Lies Eleanor Cutri Smeal president of the National Organization for Women said in recent Congressional testimony that catching up with lies was a neverending process In Florida widely distributed flyers charged that the amendment would deny a homemaker Social Security benefits She said that the amendments proponents got out literature countering that point but she doubted that the damage could be undone The mysterious switches of votes and the sudden appearance of strong opposition at crucial times have caused a number of women leaders to suspect a rightwing conspiracy far deeper than what appears on the surface A prime suspect as a participant in this socalled conspiracy has been the insurance industry which has been accused of sex discrimination Studies were made and distributed showing that many of the amendments opponents had ties to insurance companies but the connection did not go further than that The industry has denied any role in the matter Betty Friedan and others believe that Federal agents who infiltrated domestic radical organizations in the 1960s and early 1970s may have been responsible for some of the divisiveness in the womens movement Again the suspicion has not been proved Most in the South Of the 15 states that have not ratified the amendment most are in the South They are Florida Georgia South Carolina North Carolina Virginia Alabama Mississippi Louisiana Arkansas Oklahoma Missouri Illinois Arizona Utah and Nevada Campaigns appealing to fear and parochialism have long been a part of politics in many of those states but they have seldom reached the level seen recently All of the opposition however is not in the manner of such campaigns The straightaway stand against the amendment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints has kept the measure from even coming to a vote in Utah In Chicago a major commttee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops declined on May 1 to endorse the amendment on the ground that it would as one spokesman said pave the way for more abortions The amendment has in fact had to carry the burden of other issues including abortion busing and the homosexual rights movement and the antiamendment groups have categorized them as a single force that they say is destroying American values The Counterattack Proponents are waging a campaign to repudiate the charges that the measure would destroy American values Mrs Carpenter Judy Carter the Presidents daughterinlaw and Erma Bombeck the columnist are among those traveling around the nation trying to make the amendment appear as American as apple pie and pointing out that the measure has the endorsement of a wide range of traditional organizations including the Girl Scouts The proponents have decided not to call up the amendment this year in any state where they do not see ai clear majority and there are no such states Instead the National Womens Political Caucus is pouring money and other assistance into state legislative races to help candidates who support the amendment Yet in some races the amendment has become a silent issue In Oklahoma for example where the amendment was narrowly defeated Mrs Detherage said that many candidates prefer not to talk about it Gloria Craven who is coordinating the League of Women Voters campaign for the amendment in Illinois put it another way We have the verbal support of Governor Thompson and Mayor Bilandic They say they support us but they havent actually gone out stumping for ERA Neither wants the credit neither wants the blame The Polls The amendment has had strong public support according to the polls even in some states where it has not been ratified Proponents have complained for example that while polls in Virginia showed substantial support the measure was narrowly defeated in the Senate and has never been reported out of committee in the House In Missouri where it was defeated in the Senate last year a poll conducted by The St Louis GlobeDemocrat showed that 60 percent of voters polled favored the amendment A national poll taken in February by Louis Harris based on interviews with 1259 adults showed 51 percent supporting the amendment and 34 percent opposing it However this was a decline from a year ago when the favorable margin was 56 percent In the South where ratification is crucial 47 percent favored the amendment while 37 percent opposed it The implication of these findings Mr Harris said is that the ERA may have a more difficult time winning the three states that are needed to make it law than some of its proponents might admit The Boycott Proponents of the measure are putting a lot of faith in their economic boycott More than 50 national organizations ranging from the Anthropological Association to Zero Population Growth have pledged not to bold conventions in states that have not ratified the amendment Rased on reported cancellations the National Organization for Women estimates that the 15 states have lost more than 100 million in convention business Chicago alone is reported to have lost more than 20 million So far however there is no indication of what effect this may have on ratification A lawsuit hats been filed against the boycott but this has not dampened the enthusiasm of its sponsors The move for an extension of the deadline for ratification has added another layer of controversy Congress put a sevenyear limit on the amendment because has been the usual amount of time allotted for amendments Mrs Schlafly got in the first word of opposition to the extension proposal by saying that it was like extending a baseball game three more innings because one team was ahead in the ninth Mrs Smeal responded that the struggle was no game and that the amendment has not had a fair hearing in several states Representative Robert F Drinan Democrat of Massachusetts said that there was no way the proponents of the amendment could have foreseen a national campaign of extortion But many supporters of the amendment oppose extension One reason is the question of recision If Congress extends the time for ratification they say should not also permit states to rescind their votes Expects Favorable Vote If they want to extend the time for ratification thats marvelous said State Representative Georgia Peterson of Utah an opponent of the amendment Every state legislature across the country will rescind Representative Elizabeth Holtzman Democrat of Brooklyn who is the author of the extension resolution said that she expects a favorable vote by the Judiciary subcommittee and approval by the full Congress But legislators in the nonratifying states have mounted a campaign against extension saying that they have spent enough time on the amendment and need to concentrate on other business But the ERA is not going away Representative Robert McClory Republican of Illinois told Mrs Schley A lot of legislators think if we kill the extension it is going away It is not going away

received answers from 97 of the 101 graduates and 24 of the 28 former members Mrs Rogerswho now lives in New Canaan was editor of the college literary magazine and Mrs Mitchell who lives in Cranford NJ  was editor of the college paper The results Mrs Rogers said showed that we were a pretty sensible bunch And how is the class of 1928 different from the class of 1978 The difference is that then we didnt worry about whether we were going to get married or have a job Mrs Rogers said Those that wanted to get married got married and those that wanted to work got a job There was none of this trauma

New York's Churches Make Their Worldly Influence Felt,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/new-yorks-churches-make-their-worldly-influence-felt-influence-some.html,ALBANY May 26  Every week a dozen or so men and women gather in the upstairs room of a wood frame house about a mile from the Capitol to talk politics It is hardly a surprising scene in this political city except that most are members of the clergy and they are all brethren in one of the unlikeliest of lobby groups the forces of organized religion On paper the churches carry little political weight They are generally barred by law from giving money to political candidates may not get involved in campaigns and have no particular areas of expert skill except that they are supposed to be more moral than mostnot always a political advantage And yet representatives of a variety of Protestant Roman Catholic and Jewish groups make rendering to Caesar a fulltime job They repre at churches individual church members and special church organize  like he catholic Conferened  in council of Churches maintain fulltime staffs in Albany Influence Sometimes Strong Generally the views of the religious lobbies rt not decisive on broader questions of policy But on certain issues the influence of the churches is powerful They havent been carrying many heavy issues this year said a top legislative aide but they can be effective on moral issues or certain financial issues like aid to private schools They are also effective in issues of special concern Reform Jewish groups often weigh in with positions on civil liberty matters On abortion the force of the Catholic Church is well known And on the suspenseful day when Governor Careys veto of the death penalty was upheld by a single vote State Senator Vander L Beatty DemocratLiberal of Brooklyn who was wavering on the issue credited the Council of Churches with finally persuading him to oppose capital punishment You dont just tell a minister no he said The lobbying styles of the churcheswhich usually disdain the word lobbyingvary as much as their creeds The moststraightforward effort is that of the Council of Churches which sends out its positions on a wide range of issues on a regular basis and holds its regular meetings Topics of the Council Unit At a typical gathering recently the councils legislative committee discussed bills on the selection and disciplining of judges several pieces of tax and rate legislation that might have an adverse effect on the churches the nonreturnable bottle and Governor Careys Energy Master Plan Some in Albany believe the council which tends to he on the liberal side of most issues though it is critical of casino gambling and pornography minimze its effect by taking up too many issues It dilutes their effectiveness said Assemblyman Howard L Lasher DemocratLiberal of Brooklyn who keeps his eye out for bills that affect Orthodox Jews You see a memo from them every two weeks on some issue or other The Rev Clayton L Knapp who is the councils representative in the Capitol acknowledged the difficulty but believes the churches have no choice Were advocates for the powerless the poor and that takes you into a broad range of issues he said We cant be as technical and precise as wed like to But we have to express the moral concern the fairness concern For Jewish groups legislative concerns take two forms Like the Council of Churches and the Catholic Conference many Jewish agencies become involved in broad policy questions In addition Assemblymen representing districts with large Orthodox Jewish populations are often called upon by their constituents or by Orthodox groups particularly Agudath Israel to defend traditional practice against the incursions of modern life This week for example the Assembly passed a bin sponsored by Assemblyman Samuel Hirsch Democrat of Brooklyn to revise the states executive law and New York Citys Administrative Code to permit the separation of passengers by sex on buses chartered by Orthodox Jews Orthodox men and women Mr Hirsch said cannot sit together and must be separated by a mechiza a dividing curtaro However this appeared to violate a ban on sex discrimination contained in state and city statutes so he and other legislators introduced the bill to clarify these provisions At the other end of the spectrum Rabbi Balfour Brickner director of irterreligious activities for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations said that Reform Jews often became involved in support of liberal positions especially on abortion and capital punishment Support for the Orthodox However he said Reform Jews also became involved in support of the Orthodox whenever their religious practices were threatened by the encroachments of modernity For the Catholic church public attention to its position on the abortion issue has obscured a long history of governmental involvement on other questions particularly those affecting its vast network of educational and social service programs and to its opposition to capital punishment From his office where Pastoral Letters of the American Hierarchy and The Catholic Almanac share bookshelf space with The Legislative Manual and The Almanac of American Politics Charles J Tobin the executive director of the New York State Catholic Conference has a clear view up State Street of the State Capitol where he has been walking the corridors on behalf of Catholic causes since 1954 Mr Tobin said that the close identification of the Catholic Church with the abortion issue may in part flow from the history of the issue The abortion issue is one we have a special responsibility on he said because weve been left very much on our own to speak to the American conscience about it Some Take Other Side This Mr Tobin said has meant less public attention even among Catholics to issues like the death penalty adding Many of our devout Catholic people do not take the same position we do But much of his time is spent on the daytoday tasks of letting the church institutions know what the government particularly the bureaucrcy and regulatory agencies is up to There is finally the special influence of the church in the black community to which Mr Beattys vote stands as a sort of monument State Senator Carl H McCall DemocratLiberal of Manhattan who is also a Methodist minister said that the Church had been politically important as the only independent institution black people had going back to the time of slavery Assemblyman Herman D Farrell Jr DemocratLiberal of Manhattan agreed noting that many of his best campaign workers and precinct captains were also regular churchgoers What I dont want Mr Farrell said is to have my captains choosing between the salvation of their souls in the next life and the salvation of their souls in this life
Spain's Feminist Movement Concentrating on Rape Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/29/archives/spains-feminist-movement-concentrating-on-rape-issue-cannot-deceive.html,BARCELONA Spain  In a back room of the Bar Lasal which is for women only Inma explained to a male visitor the thinking behind a campaign that has galvanized Spains latestarting feminist movement The issue is rape Special to The New York Times Rape is not only the aggression that takes place in the street said the softspoken young woman It is all the aggression that occurs against women from the insults on the sidewalk to the disguised rape that takes place in marriage But even if the penal code is changed and men actually get sent to jail one has to go more deeply into this The bourgeois man who suavely seduces a woman never goes to jail But thats rape too In the hygienically scrubbed Lasal tucked away in Barcelonas grubby Barrio Chino Inma and a handful of other radical feminists coined a rallying cry recently that in its hyperbole caught the Spanish mood of defiance that has crept into the womens movement here Contra violaci6n castration  against rape castration The reaction has been very bad among the men said Inma an ironic smile playing at the edge of her mouth The men think that we are proposing a feminism in which the women are going to dominate them the way they have dominated us This was a symbolic thing We did not want to castrate anybody Trends in Spain have a way of starting in Barcelona and spreading elsewere In Madrid this week Eduardo Montes accused of raping a 12yearold girl may have been unsettled by the sight of an angry group of women shouting tion at him as he passed through the courthouse corridor One placard carried by a member of the group declared Macho your violence is your impotence Another said The night and the streets are ours too Lets take them When policemen tried to remove the picket signs the protesters accused them of siding with the alleged rapist the police desisted The womens movement in Spain which began in 1975 with the decline of Francisco Franco has a sizable agenda by the standards of Western Europe or the United States changing laws A sticker distributed by feminists in Catalonia Spain proclaims Enough of macho violence On divorce abortion birth control and property rights of married women as well as confronting discrimination in jobs in access to credit and in other areas The movement against rape seems to have taken hold because it at once challenges a legal system that rarely punishes male rapists and usually humiliates their female victims and pits Spanish women against Spanish men in an elemental way Cannot Deceive Us To understand rape as an individual phenomenon is a distracting maneuver that cannot deceive us asserts Dones On Lliuta a monthly bulletin published here that is written in Catalan and Spanish Rape has social and political content it is a weapon employed by men to defend their patriarchal society to keep us isolated one from another to lock us up at home in fear of the street and the night There is some controversy over whether the incidence of rape has increased since what Inma the feminist calls this socalled democracy was installed a year ago What is certain is that the press writes about rape and rapists much more than it was allowed to under Franco and that the unwieldy coalition of womens organizations ranging from the OrganizaciOn Feminista Revolucionaria to reformists in various political parties have staged major demonstrations and spraypainted walls in protest against it The result has been to make rape an issue even though the police routinely report only two or three rapes a month across the country In February a 16yearold girl named Carmentxu her face bloody came running in panic from a Barcelona sports field toward a group of young people A police car appeared as the girl screamed that she had been raped and beaten The policemen rather than pursuing the rapist asked Was the act consummated I dont know the girl answered Ive never done it Made a Formal Complaint Most rapesfeminists say 80 percentgo unreported in Spain but Carmentxu happened to meet a group of women activists who encouraged her to make formal complaint and who witnessed what followed First the police reminded her solicitously that she was not compelled to report the case secondly they informed her that since it was Saturday no forensic doctor was on duty to perform a medical examination to see whether she had in fact been raped When she persisted and was finally examined the doctor announced that while semen was present her hymen was unbroken and she therefore remained a virgin By the standards of Spanish law she had not been raped Stories like this are common in Spain There is a woman in Barcelona who faces the possibility of being ]ailed for contempt of court because she is reluctant to let her 4 and 6yearold daughters visit their deranged father who raped them both Another child who had been raped was expelled from her convent school because the school authorities said she might become a bad influence on other children In Las Palmas a policeman was acquitted of raping the sister of a person who had been detained even though he admitted having sexual intercourse with her The reason She had a bad reputation Justice is machista in this country said Isabel Martinez an activist who has studied the problem What especially angers Spanish feminists is the insouciant sometimes conspiratorial reaction of male to the question One of Spains leading cartoonists Chumy Chumez declared to a Barcelona newspaper When I learn that someone has raped a 14yearold girl Im envious truly I know that this may not sit well with some people but I say what I think To me rape seems a good thing from 8 to 14 As in so many areas of Spanish life women and militant feminists are almost breathlessly catching up with the rest of Western Europe making up for four decades lost under Francoism by compressing into months trends and developments that unfolded elsewhere over a period of years Their ability to effect changes remains to be tested The womens movement is fragmented along very sophisticated lines and some of the most determined feminists oppose political lobbying In the face of awesome tasks consciousnessraising often comes first Divorce Subsidizes Marriage Isabel Monteagudo who remembers attending an illegal meeting of 300 feminists in Madrid in 1975 avows today that radicals like herself are not going to fall into reformism on such questions as lobbying for a divorce law We are going to say that divorce is just another way of subsidizing marriage she said speaking in the Barcelona publishing house where she works We do not want power and we do not want discipline The womens movement rejects structures Not all Spanish feminists share this view and many of them are to be found in the ranks of the Socialist and Communist parties though an aversion to party politics seems to be growing at the same time paradoxically that women are employing a version of Marxism to analyze their plight While in the back room of Bar Lasal Inma summed up her views What we want is each woman to be her own protagonist

Helping Couples Cope With the Loss of an Infant,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/29/archives/helping-couples-cope-with-the-loss-of-an-infant-followup-visit-idea.html,On a dreary March day in 1977 Debra Dixon entered the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn to give birth to her first child Seventeen hours later the baby a boy was born dead with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck Almost immediately members of the hospitals bereavement clinic paid visit to Mrs Dixons hospital room Their purpose to help her and her husband deal with the anguish confusion and despair that often accompany the loss of a newborn baby First they asked me how I felt about it Mrs Dixon a 25yearold computer programmer recalled the other day Then they let me talk and talk about it That was the best part of all Team members explained to her how the baby had died urged her to look at the body told her that an autopsy would help give her and her husband peace of mind about the cause of the death and took care of the funeral arrangements A month later team members met with Mrs Dixon again at a followup meeting Once again they let me do all the talking Mrs Dixon recalled Just the fact that they were interested helped get me through the nightmare of losing the baby Mrs Dixon who is now pregnant again is one of about 350 mothers who have received aid and counseling from members of the bereavement clinic since it was founded four years ago at Downstate Medical Center and the neighboring Kings County Hospital Cenler Team members work on a volunteer basis with couples whose babies die before during or within 28 days of birth They do not deal with socalled crib deaths which generally occur in the home when babies are between two months and eight months old Members of the clinic known officially as the perinatal mortality bereavement clinic include Dr Susan S Zilkha an obstetrician and gynecologist Joanne Middleton a nurse midwife Nancy ODonohue a maternity nursing supervisor Carla Mariano and Marian Pettengill both assistant professors of nursing and Tina Quirk mental health specialist The death of a newborn baby is subject that people havent wanted to talk about Miss Pettengill said in a recent informal meeting of the team at the Downstate Medical Center Its like its been kept locked up in the closet She said she thought the fact that some people are now dealing with has more to do with womens rights than it does with more people talking about death The idea for the bereavement clinic originated with Dr Lewis M Cohen now at Tufts University and formerly an assistant instructor in psychiatry at Downstate who observed a bereavement clinic while he was studying in London in 1979 Returning to Downstate he organized a group of staff volunteers to work with mothers of stillborn babies whom he described as women who are neglected and feel neglected Today the cliric is believed to be one of the few of its kind in the United States Its patients 75 percent of whom are black represent various socioeconomic levels ranging front welfare mothers to doctors wives Miss Mariano said Two of the clinics team members visit a mother as soon as possible after her babys death to try to ward off what they call traumatic crises that may result in the mothers having recurring dreams about death crying jags difficulties in eating and sleeping and episodes of depression We try to convince them that these are normal reactions that theyre not crazy Miss ODonohue said and that it will pass in time One of the first things team members often have to deal with is a mothers guilt about her babys death Mothers have been known to blame themselves on the ground that they took drugs during pregnancy or didnt take prescribed vitamins or worked too long or had sex late in the pregnancy or washed the windows or rode the subways or had previous abortion team members said One of our main functions is to listen and to clarify Miss Pettengill said We try to explain to the mothers in simple language why the baby really died sometimes using drawings and other il lust rat ions This team approach helps both doctor and mother Dr Zilkha said because many doctors also suffer from guilt feelings after a babys death and find it difficult to discuss the death with the mother The mothers in turn almost aivtays feel angry  and much of this anger is directed at the doctor In one of the more controversial parts of the program team members urge mothers to view their dead babies bodies Until a few years ago this farely happened because doctors wanted to protect the mothers from this sometimes devastating experience Now it nursing policy at both Kings County and Downstate to offer the mother the chance to see her dead child  and about 80 percent accept the offer We think its terribly important that the mother see the baby Miss ODonohue said If she doesnt she may have fantasies about having given birth to monster and her imagination will be worse than the reality Dr Zilkha said she thought that a mother recovered more quickly if she viewed the body which is usually wrapped in a blanket She generally remembers some positive aspect of her child if she sees it she said Even the baby is severtly deforrqed she will probably pick out something she likes about it such as a nose or an ear Trudy a 36yettrold mother of two from Brooklyn hose 7monthold son died in utero three years ago at Downstate said she was glad that she had decided to view 1er babys body If hadnt I would have thought the whole thing was a dream she said He was fine he was beautiful There was nothing wrong with him and seeing him really made a difference According to team members most parents they work with choose to have their babies buried by he city which means that the infant is placed in small pine coffin and buried in potters field The parents may have a religious service performed if they wish A followup meeting with the mother  and her husband or any other friend or relative she wants to bring along is held in the hospital between four and eight weeks after he delivery At this time the couple are again urged to discuss their feelings about the babys death and how it has since affected their marriage They are also given the results of the autopsy report if they permitted an autopsy to he performed One good thing about an autopsy Miss ODonohue said is that we usually can tell the mother t hat she gave birth to a perfectly formed baby who died due to some external circumstance It can also find genetic malformations congenital heart diseases changes if the mother was diabetic or malnourished and it can help a mother to plan what to do next time One of these womens biggest worries she said is whether to try to get pregnant again  especially if they have lost more than one baby All women who lose a baby at either hospital are referred to the high risk obstetrical clinic if they become pregnant again Most mothers bereavement clinic members have found are able to weather the crisis of a babys death with a minimal amount of help Rarely are more than two counseling sessions needed In more serious cases team members refer patients to other sources in the medical center if further counseling  psychiatric obstetric or genetic seems appropriate Fathers instead of staying in the background often show more grief over a babys death than their wives do Miss Pettengill said One of them Joseph Correa a 27yearold security guard from Brooklyn said he met with team members four times and asked a million and one questions after his 10dayold daughter Michelle died of a blood disorder last year in Kings County Hospital I wanted to know how she died I just had to know the husky darkhaired Mr Correa said I had started blaming myself 1 thought maybe I wasnt giving her the proper vitamins If youre any kind of parent you just have to know dont want this to ever happen again
Backers of Equality Amendment Making Illinois a Prime Target,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/30/archives/new-jersey-pages-backers-of-equality-amendment-making-illinois-a.html,CHICAGO May 29Naomi Ross was disappointed last Wednesday So were Gloria Craven and Sister Maureen Fiedler Special to The New York Times All three arc leaders of the womens movement here and they were waiting for the equal rights amendment to be called to the floor of the Illinois House of Representatives as the grapevine said it would be that afternoon As it happened the amendment was not called up Womens Rights The Battle Continues Third of a Series But such disappointments are nothing new to those who have struggled for six years to clear a path through the thicket of Illinois politics for passage by the legislature of a resolution ratifying the proposed amendment  the only northern industrial state among the 15 that have not approved the amendment is a good place for a closeup examination of the diffieultics proponents face as they make their final concerted effort to get three more states to ratify the amendment before the deadline next March 22 Although the womens movement trying to get Congress to extend the deadline Illinois is one of the prime targets of the effort this year to break the stalemate that has existed since Indiana ratified the amendment in January 1977 The Democrats of Cook County which includes Chicago arc in the view of most proponents of the equal rights amendment high on the list of obstacles to ratification of the amendment There are others conservative downstate Republicans the even more conservative Stop ERA movement led by Phyllis Schlafly of Alton which has worked tirelessly and effectively to bring the right wings considerable political muscle to bear on the issue the threefifths voting rule for constitutional amendments imposed by the new Illinois Constitution adopted in 1970 and the unusual requirement of the same document that each threemember House district have no more than two members from the same party which regularly strengthens the minority in the states House On the other hand some longtime observers of the state political scene think the amendments supporters have been Somewhat naive over the years in trying to win legislators in the roughandtumble political arena of Springfield with cogent arguments demonstrations and boycotts If they were astute politically they would have had it awhile ago one said The way to do it is to wiieel and deal play political hard ball Only in relatively recent times he said have the ERA people thrown their political weight effectively into legislative elections The opposition has indeed been playing political hard ball most observers agree Says Naomi Ross president of the state chapter of the National Organization for Women Illinois is really a microcosm of the nation and we are really a pilot project for the right wing Theyre drawing a bead on Illinois and having some effect in moving the whole state to the right But proponents of the ERA remain convinced that no matter what their other problems are in a Legislature in which the Democrats control both houses the Chicago machine could if really wanted to deliver the votes necessary for passage Inaction Despite Support Still the late Mayor Richard J Daley said he favored the amendment and nothing happened Mayor Michael A Bilandic says he is for it But the result has been the same George W Dunne the Cook County Democratic chairman contends that he wants it And the ERA remains stalled Nancy Shier executive director of the Chicago NOW chapter paused briefly during a demonstration Thursday night outside the Conrad Hilton Hotel where President Carter addressed the Cook County Democrats annual fundraising dinner to expess an opinion long held among ERA supporters Were getting lip service she said The Mayor has tremendous power and so does George Dunne When the Chicago Democrats want something they can get it When the resolution was not brought to a vote in the House on Wednesday she and a lot of the other womens leaders saw it as just another sign that the Chicago machine was still not prepared to go all out for passage Alaia J Greiman a Democrat from suburban Skokie who is the prncipal sponsor of the resolution in the House was not prepared to agree He even denied that there had been a plan to seek a vote Wednesday It was just a rumor he said by telephone from the House floor Wed taken a count to see what it was like Things looked good The political establishment is with us With their help we can win it Theyve come to the conclusion that its good politics But an ERA lobbyist in Springfield who asked not to be quoted by name said that the report was not a rumor We had a couple of absentees she said and we had a couple of shakys There was no way we were going to ask for a vote unless we knew we had it The demonstration outside the Hiltonwhich ERA leaders said they would have called off as an act of good faith if the resolution had passed in the House was a way of telling President Carter that the amendments proponents were counting on him to lend his prestige to their efforts on his visit to Springfield the next day On Friday as he appeared before joint session of the Legislature the President did speak briefly of the Equal Rights Amendment He told the Illinois General Assembly that the eyes of the nation now are focused on the men and women in this chamber What you do here in this chamber in the next few weeks might very well determine whether women do have those equal rights guaranteed in the United States Constitution or whether they do not he said However Mr Carter stopped short of urging ratification of the amendment asking the legislators only to listen to the voters and to keep an open mind I onen thought and an open door Stress on Immediacy Declaring that he was aware that taking a stand on the issue could cause political repercussions from constituents Mr Carter said You share with me that kind of decision that is never easy to make His statements which were broadcast to a crowd outside failed to satisfy some ERA proponents I think Mr Carters comments went around that basic point but never hit right on the head said Judy Goldsmith executive vice president of the National Organization for Women The time now We will not have cne more generation lobbying under stultifying circumstances We will not have our granddaughters standing on these steps But Mrs Craven the League of Women Voters coordinator for the amendment at the state capitol said she thought that a tougher approach by the President strongly urging the legislators to support the resolution might have caused backlash It was a thisisatoughdecisionfolks kind of approach she said and to me it was kind of moving This General Assembly is kind of temperamental think he might have alienated them have watched this Legislature react violently to people Mrs Craven said she now thinks as do most of those working for ratification that a vote will not be taken in the House until next week which most advocates agree is precariously close to the scheduled June 30 legislative adjournment both houses are to act on the measure I am reasonably optimistic Mrs Craven said if we can get both the Governor and Mayor to push for it They have both said theyre in favor of it and will do whatever is necessary to get passed If you find out what that means let me know Gov James R Thompson a Republican has been almost as much of a puzzle to the ERA forces as Mayor Bilandic and the rest of the Democratic leadership The Governor has said repeatedly that he favors passage but there has been no evidence that he has turned around any Republican votes in the Legislature On one occasion during the March primary election campaign the Governor especially irritated ERA supporters Addressing a group of them in Chicago he urged them to focus on the districts to help nominate and elect people who would vote for passage I have tried by my words and my deeds to underscore my commitment to the passage of the amendment he said I will do my level best to use the moral and political force of my office and let the politics take care of itself That same day in a suburban Senate district he endorsed an active opponent of the amendment for a seat being left vacant by the retirement of a supporter The man he backed who won was being opposed by a woman committed to passage Asked about the apparent contradiction Mr Thompson said I am not oneissue oriented In trying to explain such actions most backers of the amendment concede that a vast number of politicians in the state view ERA as a nowin issue one on which their constituents appear to be so evenly divided that a vote either way will produce substantial criticism They hate it said a close aide of Governor Thompson who pleaded for anonymity as he tried to explain the situation Its one of those things that defies logic They play games with it Theyll all trade votes for it The legislators who have been working for it have sold themselves into whoredom time and again to vote for things to get votes for it And they get doublecrossed over and over again Despite the reluctance of many legislators to take a stand on what they consider a controversial issue in their districts the ERA has in the last six years frequently had majority support in both houses as its supporters are convinced it does today Twice in each chamber it has received a majority vote and in 1975 it won with 113 votes in the Hcrise six more than the threefifths needed only to be bottled up in a Senate committee Caution Over Figures This year its backers believe the resolution has 107 to 110 votes in the 177member House and 30 to 32 votes in the 59member Senate But after repeated losses over the years in which votes have been switched and legislators have passed or unexpectedly absented themselves from the floor the amendments supporters are wary about proceeding without the certain knowledge that the Democratic powers have put out the word to approve the measure Asked the other day if the resolution would pass this year George Dunne who as Cook County Democratic chairman inherned the political half of Mayor Daleys empire would say only I hope so I had honed it would have passed last year Mr Dunne went on Unfortunately some of the fellows who come from districts who oppose it were somewhat aroused after the womens convention in Houston about some of the resolutions that were passed about homosexuality and lesbianism Some of them would have wanted to vote for it but now they say What am I going to do I hope we can overcome that That complaint was similar to one sounded by Patricia Manby head of the Stop ERA movement in Rockford who attended the International Womens Year Conference in Houston last fall as an observer You can tell a lot about something by the people who are for it and what they stand for she said We went to a workshop in sexual preference and they had a lesbian female attorney who said We need ERA Its a clash of philosophies Reached by telephone in Washington where she was lobbying against attempts to win a sevenyear extension for ratification Mrs Schlafly the conservative writer and lecturer who is the national leader of Stop ERA said I think they just dont have the votes And we won some spectacular victories in the primaries I think it shows the people dont want ERA Weve voted I I times on it in the Legislature six in he House and five in the Senate If they hay the votes theyd hring it up One of the uncertainties this year is the effect of the boycott sponsored by womens groups against convention cities in states that have not approved the amendment ERA America now lists more than 170 organizations that have joined the boycott which has already cost Chicago about 20 million according to the citys Convention and Tourist Bureau  There is some resentment among some of the legislators about this boycott thing Mr Dunne acknowledged So far there have been no overt signs that the boycott has converted any legislators and Mayor Bilandic and Governor Thompson have both warned that they believe it could create a backlash However when Mr Dunne was asked whether he felt any of the 18 House Democrats from Chicago who have opposed ERA could be switched this year he replied somewhat enigmatically Well I was looking at six people who have some problems in their districts Although labor has slowly been coming around to the support of the amendment Robert Johnston director of Region 4 of the United Automobile Workers of America has long been a strong advocate of it He is opposed to the boycott and other pressure tactics but he said he was optimistic about the resolutions chances in 11inois this year Mr Johnston said he thought the House would pass it by the required threefifths vote and that the Senate rules would he amended to make a majority sufficient for passage there Only in Idaho among the 35 states that have ratified has an extraordinary majority been required And among the states that have not ratified only Illinois and Alabama have such a rule I think its going to pass he said One of the reasons its been difficult is that theyve played politics with it both Republicans and Democrats Some of the antis have tried to link it with abortion and righttolife which its not Referring to the continuing complaints from ERA supporters that they cannot get a firm commitment from political leaders to push the amendment through Mr Johnston concluded I keep telling those people Youve got to let these people play their politics their own way If the Chicago Democrats tell you theyre for you let them do their own way Sister Maureen Fiedler leader of Catholics Act for ERA agrees with Mr Johnston on the abortion issue The connection theyre trying to draw is crazy she said Frankly I think the right wing knows theres no connection Despite the heated opposition Sister Maureen remains optimistic IL looks good as far as I can see she said My feeling is if we can break this thing in will open the floodgates for passage by other states But one of the leading women advo of ERA in the state who is publicly somewhat optimistic about passage paid privately with the promise that she youd not be identified It looks very had I dont think were going to ratify the ERA The vested political interests in this state are against it They dont want it Were not losing on the merits of the issue but on political gamesmanship

this year he replied somewhat enigmatically Well I was looking at six people who have some problems in their districts Although labor has slowly been coming around to the support of the amendment Robert Johnston director of Region 4 of the United Automobile Workers of America has long been a strong advocate of it He is opposed to the boycott and other pressure tactics but he said he was optimistic about the resolutions chances in 11inois this year Mr Johnston said he thought the House would pass it by the required threefifths vote and that the Senate rules would he amended to make a majority sufficient for passage there Only in Idaho among the 35 states that have ratified has an extraordinary majority been required And among the states that have not ratified only Illinois and Alabama have such a rule I think its going to pass he said One of the reasons its been difficult is that theyve played politics with it both Republicans and Democrats Some of the antis have tried to link it with abortion and righttolife which its not Referring to the continuing complaints from ERA supporters that they cannot get a firm commitment from political leaders to push the amendment through Mr Johnston concluded I keep telling those people Youve got to let these people play their politics their own way If the Chicago Democrats tell you theyre for you let them do it their own way Sister Maureen Fiedler leader of Catholics Act for ERA agrees with Mr Johnston on the abortion issue The connection theyre trying to draw is crazy she said Frankly I think the right wing knows theres no connection Despite the heated opposition Sister Maureen remains optimistic IL looks good as far as I can see she said My feeling is if we can break this thing in will open the floodgates for passage by other states But one of the leacling v7onsen advocares of ERA in the state who is publicly somewhat optimistic about passage paid privately with the promise that she would not be identified It looks very had I dont think were going to ratify the ERA The vested political interests in this state are against it They dont want it Were not losing on the merits of the issue but on political gamesmanship

Feminist Drive Is Likely to Persist Even if Rights Amendment Fails,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/31/archives/new-jersey-pages-feminist-drive-is-likely-to-persist-even-if-rights.html,COLUMBIA SC  It is a bright Sunday afternoon in May and the ladies are plotting Barbara Moxon would normally be heading the family life education committee meeting at the Lutheran Church or dandling a grandchild on her knee Keller Bumgardner might be home with her four children or Betty Mandell with her four Instead they have gathered in Mrs Moxons immaculate living room to work on their battle plan Neatly coiffed and demurely dressed with their laps full of questionnaires and checklists these middleaged women hardly look like the partisans they are Far less do they resemble radical lesbians the prototype as some of their adversaries would have it of their ranks For the battle is over the equal rights amendment which the South Carolina Legislature failed to approve last winter after a bitter fight Fighting the Incumbents That defeat has not caused local pro ponents of the legislation to fold their tents and slip away Many have redoubled their efforts on behalf of the cause But as time runs short for the nationwide ratification of the amendment both its advocates and its opponents wonder what will happen to the womens movement if the amendment fails The activities of women in South Carolina may provide some clues The South Carolina Legislature will not convene again until next January and the deadline for ratitication of tne amenument is March 22 Despite the time squeeze its proponents are now busy developing strategies to oust those legislators who voted against it and to elect candidates who support it The obstacles are formidable in conservative South Carolina where the Confederate flag still flies over the state capitol and fundamentalists cite the Bible to explain why women are not equal to men and why the equal rights amendment is a sign that the end of the world is coming quickly But whatever the amendments fate even its staunchest opponents agree that feminism will persist It is a growing force conceded Norma Russell a State Representative who described herself as violently opposed to the amendment Womens Rights The Battle Continues Last of a Series Theyre just falling back and regrouping now said Shirley Holcombe Charleston president for the Citizens for Life a group that opposes abortion She firmly believes that the amendment would benefit only Communists homosexuals and other immoral animalistic people Even if the amendment is not ratified by the requisite 38 states before the deadline Mrs Holcombe declared those groups will just continue to fight for their ideas in a different way She added Nothing will stop them from trying to get done wtat they want to get done Some leaders in the womens movement only wish they could be as certain of that The question of what impact the defeat of the amendment might have on the future of feminism is one that sends Betty Friedan into impassioned speeches these days It will be politically disastrous if the ERA is blocked she exclaimed We will be set back 50 years The ERA would give the constitutional underpinning of the laws on sex discrimination that are already on the books and that are already being eroded by the courts she said If it is blocked I honestly feel that not only will there be further erosion but laws can be outright repealed Without the ERA you have to keep inventing the wheel al over again fighting piece by piece against the erosion of everything weve won instead of getting on to the next set of issues we need to deal with for men as well as women Ellie Smeal president of the National Organization for Women concurs Defeat of the amendment she said might give a false message to the courts and state legislatures that the country does not want to have a policy against sex discrimination The unthinkable risk is that we might go backward in the gains for women Whether or not the legal consequences would be so dire defeat of the equal rights amendment would be a public relations disaster feminist leaders agree Image and Morale at Stake Probably a lot of people would there after see women as a powerless group unable to secure legislation so therefore they dont have to pay any attention to them said United States Attorney Virginia McCarty of Indiana the state that most recently ratified the amendment Such an assumption she believes would be mistaken I dont think the ERA itself was ever a measure of how people felt about womens rights she explained because there were so many foolish misstatements made about it The women worry too about what effect defeat would have on morale within the movement Some people would he very discouraged and bitter for six months and Im sure a few would never come back said Gloria Steinem But theres no turning back No matter how discouraged we get looking at where weve come from is more than enough to keep us moving ahead The New York Times Betty Friedan It wouldnt be terminal in any sense she added Its just tiring and it makes you sad We all grew up reading civics texts about how democratic this country is and its hard to give up that dream even when you know better The grassroots struggle over the amendment has already rudely awakened some women to disillusioning political realities The switching of votes at the last minute by legislators who had promised you their support the compromises and the deals were really a blow said Joy Sovde president of the South Carolina League of Women Voters We really felt like we had been done dirty Getting Involved Politically But as a result whether the amendment passes or not this time around it has politicized many heretofore apolitical women After last Februarys defeat reports Barbara Moxon head of ERASouth Carolina A lot of people said Well Ive never done anything before but I sure will now What do I do Among the results has been the political action committee that is working to replace opponents of the amendment whether in Congress the governors mansion or the statehouse with its supporters Right away we planned a statewide political action workshop to teach women how to lobby work for candidates get on boards and commissions said Mrs Moxon A group of lawyers is examining South Carolina laws for sex discrimination as well as lobbying for legislation on battered wives displaced homemakers abused children and daycare centers or for affirmative action in state agencies Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex Many other state legislatures have been galvanized into action John Thomas Speaker Pro Tern of the Indiana House proudly describes the work of the bipartisan committee he led in investigating discriminatory state laws Close to 200 statutes were eventually changed The fact that the ERA was before the state certainly brought this matter to our attenttion and gave us the impetus to deal with it said Mr Thomas who opposed the amendment He is a strong supporter of states rights and says the fear of Federal intervention is the reason why many legislators have fought the ERA not because of any argument over womens rights Mr Thomas does not believe a final defeat for the amendment would hurt the drive for equality My mother and grandmother were [homemakers he said hut my wife and daughter are professional people and their needs are different The laws have to he changed depending on what human needs are With almost 484 percent of the nations women working outside the home and one in four heads of households women there are fewer and fewer lives that remain unaffected by the womens movement A Taste of Power Women have had a taste of power of acceptance and responsibility said Nancy Papas the ERA lobbyist for the Indiana State Teachers Association They like it and theyre going to keep asking for more Its gone too far ever to be turned back In fact many older feminists cornplain that the younger generation takes all the hardwon progress for granted They dont see the need to keep working for equality according to Betty Friction They think the battle is won I think there are a number of young women who have benefited from the whole womens movement but who dont understand at what cost these gains were I secured adds Virginia McCarty It might well he that the defeat of the amendment would spur them into action But a defeat for the amendment would mean its supporters energies would have to he spent on that one issue instead of other causes for another seven years I see the defeat of the amendment as a tremendous defeat for the other goals of the womens lib movement said Phyllis Schlafly an opponent She said that if her side succeeded in blocking the amendment they would immediately move on to issues such as trying to get an antiabortion human life amendment The effort on the equal rights amendment has brought new unity to the once fragmented womens movement Warring factions have submerged their differences in what they perceive as an emergency effort for a common goal Nor is this attitude limited to avowedly feminist groups Such disparate organizations as the National Coalition of American Nuns the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations thee National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Bnai Brith the Girl Scouts and the Republican and Democratic National Committees have lent their support and in the Process many people became more sensitive to womens issues At the state level the fight for passage of the amendment has created a network of women feminists and nonferninists who got to know each other reported a Hoosier supporter Betty Newcomb president of the American Assocadon for Affirmative Action Now we know who to get in touch with when we need them If the amendment is defeated many such women insist they will just begin the fight again drawing on their new political acumen and alliances It took 70 years for women to get the right to vote Barbara Moxon pointed out You just cant give up fighting for such basic human principle As for whether their own personal commitments would waver many feminists simply smiled shrugged and said You cant go home again Our opponents paint a traditional timebound picture of life Ellie Smeal said but life has changed expectations have changed Even if some of us make mistakes and have setbacks the causes of this wave of feminism are not only prevalent but the needs have increased Even if some of us get tired out she said there will be many others to pack it up and go on Some cannot help looking forward to a time when the womens movement will be obsolete however There are so many different kinds of women and so many different issues the words seem dated now comments Shelia Greenwald executive director of ERAAmerica I dont even know what they mean at this point Such a cross section of women are part of this alliance there are so many women who support the ERA that are against abortion for example Eventually what equality will lead to is that you wont need a womens movement any more The New York Times Eleanor Curti Smeal

law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex Many other state legislatures have been galvanized into action John Thomas Speaker Pro Tern of the Indiana House proudly describes the work of the bipartisan committee he led in investigating discriminatory state laws Close to 200 statutes were eventually changed The fact that the ERA was before the state certainly brought this matter to our attenttion and gave us the impetus to deal with it said Mr Thomas who opposed the amendment He is a strong supporter of states rights and says the fear of Federal intervention is the reason why many legislators have fought the ERA not because of any argument over womens rights Mr Thomas does not believe a final defeat for the amendment would hurt the drive for equality My mother and grandmother were [homemakers he said hut my wife and daughter are professional people and their needs are different The laws have to he changed depending on what human needs are With almost 484 percent of the nations women working outside the home and one in four heads of households women there are fewer and fewer lives that remain unaffected by the womens movement A Taste of Power Women have had a taste of power of acceptance and responsibility said Nancy Papas the ERA lobbyist for the Indiana State Teachers Association They like it and theyre going to keep asking for more Its gone too far ever to be turned back In fact many older feminists cornplain that the younger generation takes all the hardwon progress for granted They dont see the need to keep working for equality according to Betty Friction They think the battle is won I think there are a number of young women who have benefited from the whole womens movement but who dont understand at what cost these gains were I secured adds Virginia McCarty It might well he that the defeat of the amendment would spur them into action But a defeat for the amendment would mean its supporters energies would have to he spent on that one issue instead of other causes for another seven years I see the defeat of the amendment as a tremendous defeat for the other goals of the womens lib movement said Phyllis Schlafly an opponent She said that if her side succeeded in blocking the amendment they would immediately move on to issues such as trying to get an antiabortion human life amendment The effort on the equal rights amendment has brought new unity to the once fragmented womens movement Warring factions have submerged their differences in what they perceive as an emergency effort for a common goal Nor is this attitude limited to avowedly feminist groups Such disparate organizations as the National Coalition of American Nuns the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations thee National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Bnai Brith the Girl Scouts and the Republican and Democratic National Committees have lent their support and in the Process many people became more sensitive to womens issues At the state level the fight for passage of the amendment has created a network of women feminists and nonferninists who got to know each other reported a Hoosier supporter Betty Newcomb president of the American Assocadon for Affirmative Action Now we know who to get in touch with when we need them If the amendment is defeated many such women insist they will just begin the fight again drawing on their new political acumen and alliances It took 70 years for women to get the right to vote Barbara Moxon pointed out You just cant give up fighting for such basic human principle As for whether their own personal commitments would waver many feminists simply smiled shrugged and said You cant go home again Our opponents paint a traditional timebound picture of life Ellie Smeal said but life has changed expectations have changed Even if some of us make mistakes and have setbacks the causes of this wave of feminism are not only prevalent but the needs have increased Even if some of us get tired out she said there will be many others to pack it up and go on Some cannot help looking forward to a time when the womens movement will be obsolete however There are so many different kinds of women and so many different issues the words seem dated now comments Shelia Greenwald executive director of ERAAmerica I dont even know what they mean at this point Such a cross section of women are part of this alliance there are so many women who support the ERA that are against abortion for example Eventually what equality will lead to is that you wont need a womens movement any more The New York Times Eleanor Curti Smeal
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/31/archives/letters-nuclear-deterrence-living-by-the-bomb-of-crime-and.html,To the Editor If it does nothing else the UN special session on disarmament should remind us what an artificial and precarious world we have made for our children This is the season when we tell our new graduates to be positive about their future to work to love to live life to the fullest be a credit to themselves and their country raise families of their own and perhaps to leave the world a little better place than they found it But the sorry fact is that the world we are offering these shiny new graduates teeters on the edge of catastrophe The chance of nuclear war in any week or month or year is tiny But no one can live a life in a year Most of those who have thought about the facts agree that over a period of 20 30 or 90 years the odds favor allout nuclear war By the mad choice of some future Hitler by mischief at lower levels or in some nucleararmed Sarajevo by escalation of conflict in Africa or the Mideast or by sheer accident the real future of the new generation is more than likely to be death in war or dismal struggle in the aftermath of war Which of our children is prepared for this How many are planning careers devoted to improving the chance for peace Which of them is ready to live out his days maimed burned irradiated or blinded Which knows how to grow food in the wilderness or survive in irradiated rubble How many have the equipment or skill to tell if water or soil or crops or rusty food cans are safe or can be made so Which is ready to move away to where  or to dig a hole and live in it perhaps for months or years or to diagnose a fever or heal an open wound in his wife or baby Which of them is ready to organize his fellow survivors for a new start at civilization  or to sink to the life of a savage preying on his fellow beings and being preyed on by them In the absence of thoroughgoing nuclear disarmament to assume a future of peace is obviously naive and unrealistic As things are now nuclear war is likely to be the event of the age that shapes the lives of our children to the core But we hardly treat it as a core problem Twothirds of the people now alive have never known a world without nuclear threat The very concept of a world without poised nuclear missiles and warheads grows dimmer each decade Practically all serious people in Washington and elsewhere regard a nuclearfree world as simpleminded pap suited only for politicians speeches to the UN Even the professed working objective of SALT is not the elimination of nuclear terror called of course nuclear deterrence but its stabilization As I see it we have a choice We can be hit psychologically and stirred to our cores and moved to serious action about nuclear war and nuclear arms now as a matter of top priority in our public policy and private lives Or we can expect to be hit physically in five years or 10 to 20 by the bombs and missiles that we and Moscow have so ingeniously amassed for our defense Nuclear terror  nulear deterrence  means living by the bomb Perhaps it will be only just if our generation which has chosen that path also dies by the bomb But our children Sarasota Fla May 22 1978 Of Crime and Washingtons Priorities To the Editor Robert Brodys recent OpEd narrative of his double mugging was vividly written and distresssing to read It is difficult not to share his indignation about both the crime and the lackadaisical handling of it and the criminal However the strong implication that this is merely a typical Manhattan experience is misleading as well as unfair Crime and cavalier coping with it are endemic throughout the country New York in particular is victimized but not because crime is more rampant here In fact it is not as per capita statistics have repeatedly shown Rather it is because New Yorkers and other city residents particularly those in the Northeast get back so little of their tax money If more of it were used for health education and other necessities of civilized life there would be fewer muggers and more effective police and judicial systems  and our cities including the boroughs of Manhattan and equally crimeridden Queens to which Mr Brody moved would be more livable So long as Washingtons priorities remain the current ones as reflected in our disgraceful tax laws and our support of and largesse to corporate interest groups and whitecolor criminals however the only safe home environments will be those of its beneficiaries  from New York to San Clemente MYRON MATLAW Flushing NY May 17 1978 Sue Coe Feasible Bikeway To the Editor The answer to Stephen L Trokels recent letter inquiring whether a bikeway can be incorporated into Westway is an emphatic yes Westway will create 93 acres of new parkland along the Hudson River between Jay Street in lower Manhattan and 39th Street in midtown As approved by the US Department of Transportation this park will include a bikeway as well as a waterfront promenade running the length of the park Consequently when Westway is completed it will be possible to cycle from midtown to downtown on a bikeway that is attractive safe and completely separataed from vehicular traffic I might point out that in many cases the bikeway will actually be on top of Westway which will be in a tunnel below the parkland We at the New York State Department of Transportation are proud of the fact that we have designed a highway that differs from the traditional urban road cutting a disruptive swath through the urban fabric Instead we have proposed a road which intrudes as little as possible into the heart of our neighborhoods and provides substantial environmental benefits and important urban amenities such as waterfront parkland and bikeway As we proceed with the design of Westway I hope that Mr Trokel and representatives of cycling grdups in the city will meet with us to discuss the details of Westwavs bikeway Project Administrator Westway Project New York May 26 1978 Toward a Plebiscite on Abortion To the Editor The nativist bleat of Germaine L Hodges [letter May 24] does not of itself merit the dignity of any reply but its amplification or display shouldnt go unanswered It may well be past the comprehension of a person so shallow as she to see that Representative Henry Hyde and all other elected officials have constituencies much larger than their voting members Representative Hyde and other conscientious elected public officials happily seem quite aware of their duty to their underage as well as to their adult constituents This is clearly borne out by his principled position toward the unborn who probably will not come of age before he has closed his public life As doubtless many other Times readers have I have grown most weary of the constantly exclusive identification in your columns of the American Roman Catholic Church with the righttolife issue Beyond question that church is in the ranksand prominently at the fore  of this movement but any honest sufficiently serious survey of the members and leadership of all of Americas churches from Orthodox Judaism to the Presbyterian and Evangelical Christian communions  and of the opinions of the nonchurchgoing public in general  would much better demonstrate the sense of the will of citizens throughout the country on this great and crucially important matter Such a survey in the form of a plebiscite is the very goal and political limit of this movement Surely few are better aware of this fact than The New York Times Some of the most technically backward countries of the world today must nevertheless be reckoned with in the worlds councils and in the forums of international opinion precisely because they have at theft disposal this earths greatest natural resource which like petroleum and natural gas remains uniquely nonrenewable individual human life the most terrible of all things to waste I find it most regrettable that your newspapers editorial and reportorial staff has since March 1967 seen fit so actively to promote and espouse such a waste But then when this issue will at length have been decided  as one day it must  all of us shall have to live with our consciences as Representative Hyde very rightly knows BelIErose NY May 24 1978 GOPDeath Wish To the Editor If we had any vestigal doubts that the Republican Party is gripped by a death wish they have been put forever to rest by the performance of Republican worthies Packwood and Brock at Battery Park May 21 There are good arguments for selling no arms to either side in the Middle East but if we are to sell the irresistible logic of the new oil economics requires us to sell to both sides The Administrations position reflects the compelling interest of the nation To deny this reality in an attempt to blandish one specific interest group reflects not only cynicism which seems to be an occupational hazard of politics but also stuniditv which politics never forpives CURTIS F JONES Chapel Hill NC May 24 1978 Mideast Debate An Admonition Worth Heeding To the Editor The Times has been a vigorous proponent of debate within the American Jewish community regarding the policies of the Israeli and American Governments in the Middle East You have deplored the blankcheck support of Israeli policy by American Jews The debate is now raging having been stirred up in no small part by your editorial urgings The Times now seems disturbed by the diversity of views within the American Jewish community There are some Jews who believe American policy is not motivated by lofty ideals but rather by Machiavellian power politics and submission to Arab blackmail There are other Jews who see a manifestation of latent antiSemitism within the highest levels of our Government There are still others who in the wake of Vietnam regard an American commitment as fragile at best And there are those such as Senator Ribicoff who believe American policy to be both in Americas and Israels best interest Now it appears as if The Times wishes to impose limits on the debate The Times so earnestly called for Unfortunately it will not be easy and the fears expressed in your editorial of May 21 may be well founded If The Times does want to minimize the damage I offer two suggestions First restrain your editorial comments regarding the proper role of American Jews in these matters If you wish to influence public opinion direct your remarks to all your readers not specifically to American Jews By separating us out you lend credence to the idea that we are different Americans We are not Secondly exert some influence on columnists such as Anthony Lewis who describe official positions of the Israeli Government as hysterical and find moderation in the views of President Assad and King Hussein There is a history in the Middle East that even Mr Lewis cannot make disappear Mr Lewis may desperately and sincerely want peace to come to the Middle East but he should not allow his longings to distort the unpleasant realities Temperance is an admonition worth heeding by editorial writers columnists and members of the public MARTIN KATZ Mount Vernon NY May 221978 to To the Editor And what if all this fails the Carter policy of arming the Saudis with the most sophisticated combat aircraft Then Israels front line of security will run as it always has not through some frail West Bank settlement or even a wellstocked Saudi air base but through the conscience of the American Presidency and Congress Quote The Timess editorialist May 21 The performance of this conscience while the gas chambers of Treblinka and the crematoriums of Auschwitz worked overtime was not particularly illustrious Nor was it in a more recent context very reliable as far as the fate of the people of Kurdistan or South Vietnam was concerned Such are the realities of life and realpolitik

House Unit Votes Abortion‐Aid Curb,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/02/archives/house-unit-votes-abortionaid-curb.html,WASHINGTON June 1 UPIThe House Appropriations Committee voted today to allow Federal financing of abortions only to save the womans life setting up another legislative battle of the sort that raged for six months last year By voice vote the committee added the provision to legislation financing the departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare for the fiscal year 1979 Unlike last year when the panel took essentially the same action there was no discussion of the merits of the antiabortion language Debate focused in stead on another proposal by Representative Robert H Michel Republican of Illinois relating to fraud mismanagement and abuses in HEW program This years bill for the two departments calls for expenditure of nearly 58 billion in 1979 to finance a wide variety of programs This is an increase of 854 billion over 1978 levels and exceeds President Carters budget request by 643 million The House language would allow federally financed abortions only if the womans life would he endangered by carrying the fetus to full term a rare occurrence This is identical with the stance taken by the House last year at the beginning of the sixmonth fight with the Senate The compromise that settled last years fight allowed Medicaidfinanced abortions in cases of rape and incest provided the victims reported their plight In addition abortions were allowed if severe physical health damage might result from a fullterm pregnancy
Republicans Hold High Hope For Success in South Dakota,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/02/archives/republicans-hold-high-hope-for-success-in-south-dakota-best-chance.html,SIOUX FALLS S D June 1The Republican Party striving earnestly this year to fashion the beginnings of a national comeback can scarcely conceal its glee as it looks ahead to the November election in South Dakota With strong incumbent Democrats voluntarily leaving the Senate and the Governors office and with no indisputable heirsapparent on the horizon Republican campaign strategists speak of their prospects here glowingly Weve got as good a shot in that state as any place in the country Charles Black executive director of the Republican National Committee said this week in a telephone interview from Washington But first the states Republicans like their Democratic rivals have some things to sort ou among themselves in a primary election Tuesday Since Larry Pressler the 36yearold twoterm Republican Representative from the First District is going after the Senate nomination James Abdnor who is in his sixth year as the Representative of the Second District is the only incumbent seeking reelection in the four major races this year Best Chance in Years And Mr Abdnor a 55yearold conservative Republican is also the only candidate from either party in those races who is not faced with a primary challenge Most observers here think the pending retirement after one term of Senator James Abourezk and the appointment of Gov Richard F Kneip as Ambassador to Singapore has handed the Republicans their best opportunity in years to reestablish the dominance they held over the state before George McGovern now in his third Senate term painstakingly in the late 1950s and 1960s built the Democratic Party into a contender Since Mr Abourezk who had previously served one term in the House of Representatives announced in January 1977 that he would leave the Senate next year to return to the practice of law in South Dakota there has been talk that he was nervous about facing Mr Pressler in this Years election Senators Backers Scoff Although polls by the Pressler camp were reported to have shown him with a strong lead over the incumbent Senator most Abourezk supporters scoff at the notion that the outspoken liberal from Rapids City would ever walk away from a fight They tended to take him at his word when he declared that he never expected to make politics a lifetime career and that he was returning to the state because he felt he had neglected his family during his years in Washington With Mr Abourezk out of the way Mr Pressler a Harvard Law School graduate and Rhodes Scholar is widely considered the heavy early iavorite to win the Senate seat In 1974 bucking the Watergate tide he was one of only a handful of Republicans to unseat incumbent Democratic Congressmen He defeated Frank Denholm a lawyer and former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who had been in Congress for two terms In 1976 he got 80 percent of the vote As a Congressman Mr Pressler has been accused repeatedly by Democrats and by conservative Republicans of being more concerned with putting out news releases than with legislation He has also been charged with vascillating frequently on a variety of controversial issues such as abortion and common situs picketing Rival Given Little Chance However Mr Presslers opponent in the primary Ron Williamson 36 a West Point graduate who for five years was executive director of the South Dakota Municipal League is given little chance of defeating him Making Mr Presslers road even easier was the decision of the Republican Senatorial Committee to support him in the primary The committee gave him 15000 And the Republican National Committee has made no secret of its conviction that the Congressman will provide one of its bright spots in the fall 1 really think Pressler is going to be a Senator unless we make some real mistakes there said Mr Black the executive director Hes running strong as spring onions In the Democratic Senate primary Ken Stofferahn 43 a Humboldt farmer and former state representative is locked a battle with Don Barnett 35 a former Mayer of Rapids City The race is considered close Mr Stofferahn who lost a bid for the Republican Senate nomination in 1972 and was Mr Presslers campaign chairman in 1974

Thunder on the Right Has Turned Into an Insistent Rumble,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/04/archives/thunder-on-the-right-has-turned-into-an-insistent-rumble.html,WASHINGTON  Americans for Democratic Action recently put out a booklet entitled A Citizens Guide to the Right Wing which sought to explain the relentless growth of the new right and compared the current danger to the McCarthyism that engulfed the nation in the 1950s Yet by its own analysis the organization that for decades nas stood ior liberalism in American politics concluded that the new right is pretty much the old right with a new set of leaders who like the liberals have learned to be pragmatic and to use new techniques to achieve their ends To be sure they have had some successes in winning legislative battles in Congress in electing conservatives to office and in waging some effective grassroots campaigns such as that against the Equal Rights Amendment which was before the Illinois legislature again last week But the evidence so far does not suggest that the nation is swinging to neoconservatism Compared with the Roosevelthaters of the 1930s the smear artists of the McCarthy era or even the extremism in defense of liberty zealots of the Goldwater period the new leaders seem downright mild They are the predictable products of a time which has seen the maturing of issue politics and a proliferation of power centers The new right organizations were born during Watergate in opposition to the issueoriented groups that had sprung up on the left from Common Cause to womens groups to exercise considerable influence during a weakened Republican Presidency They set up a proliferation of political action committees to lobby and raise money They use the sophisticated directmail techniques developed by Richard A Viguerie a longtime supporter of conservative causes and one of the prominent new leaders They have stayed clear of fighting among themselves and splintering The leaders of the new right differ from those of the old in that whatever they might think they refrain from saying things that anger half the country the John Birch Society persisted in labeling the most respected of political leaders as traitors Their effectiveness has been enhanced by the growth of other conservative institutions such as the American Enterprise Institute in Washington which provides indepth research for the political rightofcenter But the new right will form coalitions with the old right to defeat or enact legislation Representative Philip M Crane Republican of Illinois who is chairman of the American Conservative Union works with them but also within the right wing of the Republican Party They team with such business organizations as the United States Chamber of Commerce in opposition to union legislation Activism on the right coincided with a growth in alienation among Americans who began to feel they cannot trust government and with the rise of emotional issues such as abortion busing and affirmative action for minorities The new organizations capitalize on both targeting their mailings and organizing to millions of people known to feel strongly about certain matters At the same time they campaign for the causes of the old right  a militant foreign policy opposi tion to socialism and to government programs that would in some measure redistribute wealth Though their impact is uncertain newright organizations were involved in the election of conservatives to Congress from normally moderate districts in special elect ions last year in Minnesota Washington and Louisiana in defeating the unionsponsored common site picketing bill and the Administrations legislation for a consumer protection agency and in the defeat in several cities of ordinances forbidding discrimination against homosexuals They are seeking to organize bluecollar workers in opposition to environmental standards that curtail production and jobs Their big effort was against the Panama Canal treaties which they lost narrowly in the Senate But their unrelenting campaign undoubtedly was responsible for much of the mail and protests that held the pacts in jeopardy for months Beneath the surface however there are signs that the country has not changed all that much The new rights leaders view themselves as revolutionaries who want to root out not threatened socialism but what they perceive has been achieved Our enemies are not encroaching socialists Paul M Weyrich of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress says They have already succeeded They view the majority of Americans as conservative ready to join them in a coalition that workson the right much as the liberal coalition worked under Franklin Roosevelt Yet a New York TimesCBS News poll conducted last January showed that while there has been a substantial increase in the number of Americans who call them conservatives a clear majority of liberals and conservatives believe that the government ought to help people get medical care at low cost to require changes if job conditions are hazardous and to see to it that everyone who wants a job can get one The new right is opposed to most government programs as such The ADA study said that progressive legislation is defeated almost daily in Congress whit h is heavily Democratic and is supposedly tuned to the goals of the national party It has become clear however that Republicans in 1974 and 1976 were defeated by nominal Democrats because of Watergate many of whom have turned out to be independent of the national party For a number of years the Congressional Quarterly has recorded the successes and failures of the conservative coalition that now includes the independent Democrats Last year the coalition won 68 percent of the contests with liberals up from 50 percent in 1975 But in 1968 conservatives won 73 percent of their contests and in 1971 83 percent There is a question too about how much depth the right generally has The new right is organizing in almost every state and Congressional district raising money in support of conservative candidates of whatever party The effect will be better known in November But so far they do not have what could he called a large national organization and they are competing with a multitude of other groups many on the left operating in exactly the same manner John Herbers is

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/04/archives/long-island-weekly-long-island-journal.html,WHEN Caroline Kennedy was allowed to pleabargain down a ticket she received for doing 86 miles an hour on the Long Island Island Expressway last year many felt that this was another example of wealths privileges But a spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorneys Office insists that she did not receive preferential treatment and anyone who had ever attended a session of Traffic Court in Hauppauge before May I knows that this is true The routine used to be cut and dried In answer to the call of their names the traffic offenders would answer conference and then go out into the hall for a chat with an assistant district attorney After listening to an explanation or a plea for mercy the prosecutor would usually drop the charge to fewer miles over the limit or to something less serious than speeding State Motor Vehicle Department regulations provide for a review and possible revocation of a drivers license for conviction of speeding at more than 20 miles an hour over the limit so the pleabargaining often meant a great deal to the offenders Since May 1 however drivers caught speeding in Suffolk County have not had the opportunity to pleabargain On that day the police began issuing tickets returnable to the Motor Vehicle Departments Adjudication Bureau There referees not judges have handled all cases except misdemeanors There is no assistance from district attorneys no pleabargaining and no chance for jury trial Assemblyman Robert C Wertz a Republican from Commack voted for the law that created this system only Rochester and New York City also use referees but Mr Wertz now believes was a big mistake The referees are judge jury and prosecutor and I think this starts impinging on the civil rights of people the Assemblyman said With speeding it can mean your livelihood and there should be room for the court to have mercy Mr Wertz believes these civilrights issues overshadow the positive aspects of the new system He has introduced bill to return the system to its previous form and he says he is optimistic that it will at least reach the Assembly floor for a vote  The Huntington Democrats met recently to pick someone to run against Assemblyman John J Flanagan RepublicanConservative of Huntington and the slim chances of the Democrats became clear when district leaders were asked to suggest likely candidates One zone leader said that he was aware of a Democrat named John Flanagan who lived in Huntington Station and he asked Why didnt the Democrats nominate him This proposal was discussed seriously for a few minutes according to some who were there but finally it was decided to nominate someone with credentials in the party if only to go down to defeat at the hands of the popular Mr Flanagan  In another matter concerning Mr Flanagan the Assemblyman was ap proached about running to succeed State Senator Bernard Smith Republican of Northport Mr Smith has privately told friends and Republican leaders that he will not seek another term Mr Flanagan decided to remain in the Assembly where he has built up considerable seniority and would be in line to head an important committee should the Republicans regain control of the house Among the Democrats considering run for Mr Smiths seat is Suffolk County Legislator Robert J Mrazek who would not have to give up his legislative seat to run for the Senate  When Catherine Dillon was testifying in a Federal Court hearing over whether those opposing abortions should be allowed to march in Manhassets Memorial Day Parade she was asked about a conversation she had had with your husband the lawyer Her husband is Thomas J Dillon and he was representing the North Shore Right to Life Committee of which his wife is cochairman The judge Jack B Weinstein ruled the question out of order on both the grounds of a conversation between husband and wife and   He was drowned out by laughter in the Great Neck courtroom before he could add the second ground the confidentiality of conversations between lawyer and client  Joseph R Caputo the Presiding Officer of the Suffolk County Legislature said the lawmakers were keeping close watch on a suit filed by the New York State Coalition for Life The antiabortion group has sued in State Supreme Court before Justice Frank P DeLuca in an attempt to force Suffolk County to comply with a County Legislature resolution that forbids the use of local taxes for abortions Justice DeLuca has scheduled a hearing on the suit for June 8 County Executive John V N Klein vetoed the resolution on the advice of Howard Pachman the County Attorney but the Legislature overrode the veto 19 to 3 Legislator Louis T Howard Republican of Amityville and sponsor of the resolution was the only member to join the antiabortion group in pursuing the issue in court For Mr Howard it is not only the issue of abortion but he said whether the Legislature can be ignored by Mr Klein Mr Caputo who voted for the resolution and the overriding of the veto said it was difficult for the Legislature to go to court against the County Executive since both branches of government were represented by the same man Mr Pachman It would be like having the satnelaivyer represent both the husband and wife in a divorce suit Mr Caputo said Legislator Joseph F Bassano Sr Democrat of Lindenhurst and another supporter of the resolution said the result of the veto and override was a Mexican standoff He added that if it were only county money involved it would be another matter but since state Medicaid funds for abortions were involved the county position would be difficult one to counter He said The next move would have to come from Albany  Suffolk Legislator John J Foley of Blue Point observes that although most lawmaking bodies take the summer off the Suffolk Legislature meets throughout the year And while things may slow down a little Mr Foley notes June July and August provide the beginnings of the budgetary period that ultimately builds to a climax in the fall Theres also some ongoing business and there may well be for example certain questions that come forth on the Southwest Sewer District and attempts to revive the County Environmental Act he said Mr Foley a Democrat added that he would vote in favor of pending legislation to require Legislators and other county officials to disclose their sources of income I would hope we could complete action on that bill before summer actually begins he said Observing that the Legislature had come under heavy criticism lately he urged that the media remind the public that there are 18 members and that each should be held responsible for his actions Everyone

California Referendum on Taxes Symptom of a Nationwide Revolt,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/04/archives/california-referendum-on-taxes-symptom-of-a-nationwide-revolt.html,SAN FRANCISCO June 2Californians are expected to vote Tuesday to slash property taxes in a nationally watched election that represents more than just the irritable mood of the nations largest statethat is in fact the leading edge of a political storm of taxpayer revolt this year Twentythree state legislatures have called for a constitutional amendment to ban Federal deficits and moves to limit local government spending are astir in about half the states The 23 states call for a convention to draft an amendment to the Constitution has gone almost unnoticed but more of the 34 states needed to convene such a meeting are expected to join the parade this year or next Californias Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy said this week that his state would probably act in late summer Before then California will have voted on an initiative designed to cut property taxes to 5 billion frorii 12 billion The measure is expected to carry Tuesday despite warnings by Gov Edmund G Brown Jr that many local governments will immediately face fiscal problems like those of New York City The efforts to curtail taxes or spending vary from state to state Tennessee voted in March to limit the growth in state spending and similar proposals are likely to be on the November ballot in Michigan and Colorado Other tax or spending control plans may come before the voters of Utah Idaho and Oregon this year and such plans are being mapped for other states to consider in 1979 The state movements tend to be supported predominantly by Republicans and conservatives but their leaders try to avoid party labels Im convinced it doesnt really make any difference whether you elect Republicans or Democratsthe deficits are pretty much the same said Richard Headlee chairman of Michigans Taxpayers United for Tax Limitation in an interview in Detroit As Mr Headlee told a conference of antitax antispending forces in Chicago in late May Were like crab grass on the political scene Theres just nobody whos going to stamp us out The movement has its high priest Milton Friedman the Nobel Prizewinning economist He actively pushed for approval of the Tennessee spending limit backs Californias Proposition 13 in television commercials and was the main drawing card at the Chicago meeting But neither he nor the movement as a whole is particularly doctrinaire on tax Iiinitations Mr Friedman supports Californias Proposition 13known also was JarvisGann after its authors Howard Jarvis and Paul Gannalthough its not what Id most prefer to see since limits a particular tax rather than overall Government spending Variations Get Support The National Taxpayers Union the American Conservative Union and the National Committee on Tax Limitation which are national groups backing the tax limitation effort seem content to support variations from their ideal that have some chance of succeeding In fact it is not doctrine but emotion that is behind the movement and California provides the sharpest examples In the southern part of the state homeowners have been scalded by sudden rises in assessments The latest batch of increases in Los Angeles County last month averaged 12Q percent Mrs Lynn Rosner of Encino Calif said her taxes 1800 three years ago would rise to 7000 this year under a new assessment Affording our dream house has turned into a nightmare she said Warnings that sudden tax cuts or spending limits will produce painful reductions in public services fall on the deaf ears of a public that thinks governmerit wastes its money A Frankenstein Emerging In the words of a 69yearold widow from Los Angeless Brentwood area who did not want her name used Politicians talk a lot about what were going to lose if the Jarvis amendment passes but as far as Im concerned we are not getting much now There is opposition to the tax limitation movement Public etloyee unions teachers groups and many chambers of commerce fight them because jobs and benefits seem threatened or because they fear a states economic health will be menaced Opponents are afraid of sudden changes in state and especially local financing processes In a Washington news conference this week John Peterson of the Chicagobased Municipal Finance Officers Association noted that California had long been regarded as a laboratory for change but if Proposition 13 was passed he said there would be a Frankenstein emerging from the swamp of the West Occasionally even a philosophical objecton is heard Morgan Smith a Democratic State Representative who headed Colorados joint budget committee before running for Congress this year argued that all the limitation proposals were an easy way to get out of budgeting Convention Idea Scares Some Fixing permanent limits cn spending would neglect the changing standards of society he said in an interview in Brighton Colo A few years ago no one thought the handicapped had any rights he pointed out Rigid limits are a way of sealing off those people whose rights have not yet been recognized There are three main elements in the antitax antispending movement the effort to get a constitutional amendment requiring that the Federal budget be balanced limits on particular taxes and the more organized effort to enact state spending ceilings The last usually are framed in such a way as to prevent state and local governments expenditures from increasing beyond their share of per capita income in the state No Federal constitutional convention has ever been held although it takes only the requests of 34 state legislatures to require one and antireapportionment forces got 32 legislatures on record in support of one a few years ago An argument frequently made against calling such a convention is that it might reach out to deal with issues other than the one it was called to consider issues such as abortion or the Bill of Rights James Davidson chairman of the National Taxpayers Union hopes his groups effort will lead not to a convention but to Congresss proposing an amendment on its own The 23 resolutions passed so farthat number would be reduced to 22 if a Governors veto in Nevada is found to be properrequest a convention in the event that Congress does not propose an amendment State Senator James Clark of Ellicott City Md the original sponsor of the convention plan predicts that the necessary 34 resolutions can be obtained in a year or so Without a balancethebudget amendment he said the Federal budget will eventually be devoted almost exclusively to paying off the bond holders Paying Off the National Debt Mr Davidson and many of his supporters scoff at arguments that Federal deficits are sometimes necessary to cope with recessions contending that the free market can do the job better but most Washington economists disagree Still the economists arguments have not often been raised in the state legislatures A proposed amendment distributed by the Taxpayers Union would in addition to requiring a balanced budget command surpluses to pay off the national debt  in equal installments over 25 years Alice Psivlin director of the Congressional Budget Office said that approach could he disastrous To force the Government to halance the budget in the face of rising unemployment can only make the unemployment rate rise faster she declared The JarvisGann approach is one that has less currency this year although its success Tuesday might start a bandwagon Neither the Oregon nor the Idaho initiative is yet doing very well in drives for the sigrattires necessary to get on the ballot I Even so supporters of other approaches are hacking Proposition 13 hoping as Mr David on said that JarvisGann will put the fear of God in other places That is likely to he the immediate effect of a victory Tuesday but if government  in California is disrupted to even half the extent that Gov Brown and others predict it may discredit other similar efforts Attention Focused on States Lewis Uhler a Sacramento lawyer who was a prime mover behind the spending limit proposals has d hopeful outlook on even that problem Constitutional tax and spending limitation has become the moderate approach he said in an interview here in contrast to the meatax approach of JarvisGann Before the country gets JarvisGanned this is an approach the Congress is going to have to consider State efforts are getting more attention than the Federal drive In Michigan Mr Headlees group which has not yet collected enough signatures to get on the ballot has rewritten a proposal that was beaten at the polls two years ago The original measure limited the state to spending 83 percent of Michigan per sonal income This years version limits state and local spending to increases based on population and the cost of living above this years state government share of Michigans personal income about 97 In Tennessee personal income was not used as the base for taxable resources the Legislature was given its choice of criteria The proposals now under consideration tend to allow the legislatures more flexibility than earlier versions and to provide more breathing space in emergencies Thus they are harder to attack one Michigan politician conceded this week that he had been looking for a way to argue against Mr Headlees plan but had not found it yet Because of the variety of state laws on constitutional amendmentonly 18 states have some form of direct initiative and referendum by popular voteand because of the hodgepodge of local and state taxing practices a campaign for a Federal constitutional amendment is often easier to mount than a nationwide drive for state limitations especially for state legislators An Attribute in Campaigning For one thing a Federal amendment would not require them or their constituents to give up anything immediately Beyond that such causes have a political value as evidenced by the fact that the chief sponsors of successful amendment proposals this year in the Colorado and Kansas legislatures are now running for governor And there are more modest approaches Colorado has a law passed last year that limits to 7 percent the growth in government spending The drive for a constitutional amendment there this year is based in part on the argument that that law can be repealed In Nebraska signatures are being collected to limit the growth in local spending And in San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson has a similar proposition going for his city In Massachusetts where a laborious constitutional amendment procedure taking a minimum of three years can wear down enthusiasm for change the legislature is expected to vote soon on a propos al that would limit any growth in state spending except for local property tax relief No final action is possible before 1980 In California opponents of Proposition 13 have proposed rather loose limits on local spending increases coupled with more modest cuts in property taxes than the JarvisGann plan would require But their alternative seem unlikely to win the support that Jarvis  Gann has achieved Some claims made for tax limitations go quite far One radio commercial for Proposition 13 for example says that voters have one last chance to protect the American dream of home ownership by voting for the proposition Mr Uhler said at the Chicago session that modern tax rates were 20th century slavery Mr Jarvis argued at a debate in San Mateo this week that after his measure wins the whole United States will be thinking God bless California But there is no possibility that the issue k iust another California political phenomenon One pollster Robert Teeter who has found growing interest in a wide spectrum of states said this week If spending limitation is not an idea whose time has come its an idea whose time is coming Associated Press Howard Jarvis leader of the movement for Proposition 13 United Press International A sign in the front yard of a house In Los Angeles indicates support for taxcut proposition

Needed: More Than a Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/04/archives/long-island-weekly-needed-more-than-a-pill.html,EACH year 5000 Long Island teenagers become pregnant Many of these teenagers lack rudimentary reproductive knowledge a lack that affects the mother the child and the entire community Recently there have been efforts to publicize the problem  and to alter the facts Of these 5000 teenagers 3500 have induced abortions Many who get an abortion seek to be rid of their mistake quickly so they can forget about it and often so their parents dont find out about the pregnancy The girls usually do not want counseling afterward Many of them will get pregnant again because as Jeanette Beardsworth director of the Economic Opportunity Council of Suffolk Family Planning said Some teens have the discernible attitude that if pregnancy should occur they can use abortion as a backup A large number of the babies born to teenagers are unwanted Many of the pregnant girls refuse to accept the reality of their pregnancy because they are either unaware that they are pregnant or ashamed or simply scared Often they hope and believe that the fetus will simply disappear As a result of hiding their condition the teenagers dont get medical care until late in their pregnancy John Connell acting director of NassauSuffolk Birth Right observed that many teenage girls tend to come in for help later in their pregnancies around theseventh or eighth month The physical strain on the teenager who gives birth is enormous because teenagers do not have the physique nec essary to withstand the stresses of pregnancy Their own bodies are not yet fully developed so they are in effect competing with their child for the same necessary nutriments Because of this teenage pregnancies often include such complications as toxemia iron deficiency prolonged labor and anemia Obviously the physical effects on the unborn child are staggering On the Island the incidence of neonatal deaths in teens is higher than in the general childbearing population and the incidence of deaths of infants under a year born to teenagers is higher than in the general childbearing population These statistics are consistent with national statistics In addition to concern about the health of the teenager and the unborn child the community has a financial concern Teenage pregnancies are costly If girl is eligible for Medicaid in New York State a girl under 21 can get aid only if her family meets certain financial criteria or if she can prove she is an emancipated minor then public revenues are used to pay for the abortion The rates for such an operation range from a minimum of 120 for an abortion performed in a clinic when the girl is not more than 12 weeks pregnant to at least 450 for a later abortion For prenatal care and normal delivery the cost about 1000 If the girl keeps her baby and the babys father cannot support her she may then be eligible for monthly public assistance and Medicaid for the child Teenage pregnancy is a problem of such proportions that President Carter has requested 142 million for programs to help prevent it and to help young women who actually become mothers Part of the money is to help expand family planning health centers and re search on the subject Part is also for Medicaid coverage for teenagers to get adequate prenatal care Why dont teenagers use available protective devices to prevent pregnancy Jeanette Beardsworth suggests that teens do not want to plan intercourse because planning reduces spontaneity She adds The Catholic teen may not use contraception because it is against her religion And there is a third reason Some teenage girls become pregnant because they do not understand the reproductive process or the birthcontrol options available When I was a social worker for the Department of Health Services I heard many teenagers misunderstandings about childbirth The most common misunderstandings were these It takes more than one sexual encounter before a woman can become pregnant The bleeding that might occur after an initial sexual encounter is menstrual period It is impossible to become pregnant unless the penis actually enters the vagina If a woman has her period then she definitely cannot be pregnant Where did they learn these erroneous ideas From friends of course but also from the misinterpreted oblique information provided by television movies and science courses in school and even from their own imagination They didnt get any information from parents Most teenagers I spoke to said that parents only talked about sex to tell the teenager that shed better not become pregnant Many girls commented that their parents refusal to discuss sexual facts made sex more mysterious and attractive as an area for experimentation Parents need to feel comfortable when they talk about sex and transmit useful information These girls need more than a warning or a pill John Connell of NassauSuffolk Birth Right sums it up this way You cant just take a 14yearold girl and give her birthcontrol devices What needed is education Insofar as teenage pregnancies are result of a lack of sex education there are available remedies In Nassau County for example a teenage sex clinic opened in February at the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow through funds from a Federal grant This clinic provides counseling services for teens regarding birth control abortion venereal disease and sexeducation programs In addition the Nassau County Department of Health Services now runs coed group for teens on sexuality Both the Nassau and Suffolk County Departments of Health Services have hot lines for pregnancy information These services are available to teens without requiring parental consent There are other potential places for sex education Jeanette Beardsworth reflects the thinking of a number of social workers when she suggests that schools churches and synagogues and the media could be used She concludes There should be a state law mandating sex education Right now there is little education about sex but a lot of sex without educa tion

French Ex‐Premier Seeking to Foster Population Growth,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/06/archives/french-expremier-seeking-to-foster-population-growth-a-downturn-by.html,PARIS June 5Michel Debre former Prime Minister of France is obsessed what he calls the peril of the declining birthrate He rails against television soap operas that portray the typical happy family as a couple with one or two children He has campaigned for bonuses wellpaid pregnancy leaves and tax advantages for women who decide to have three or more children Last month he introduced a bill in Parliament calling for extra votes for citizens who have large families Debres proposals are given little chance of being approved at least for now But after years of being considered an eccentric he has found that his concern over the real possibility of a population decline is being echoed in France and throughout Europe Four European countriesWest Germany East Germany Luxembourg and Austriaalready have stable or declining populations Britain Belgium and France may soon join this group By 1985 Sweden Denmark Norway the Netherlands and Switzerland will probably have balanced birth and death rates A Downturn by 2000 If the trend continues Europe as a whole will experience a population downturn by the year 2000 about four decades before the United States is expected to achieve zero population growth Even now the effects of this demographic trend are being felt on the Continent During the last 15 years social se curity contributions in Western Europe have jumped by an average of S percent year about twice the annual economic growth rate during the same period As the number of aged retired people grows in proportion to the economically active population pension and social security programs are in financial disarray and tax burdens are increasing When I first spoke out some years ago on the low birthrate my colleagues told me that at best I was pursuing lost cause and that at worst T was proving an embarrassment said the 66yearold Mr Debre who has four children and six grandchildren and is one of eight offspring himself But I always had the optimism of someone who knows hes right And now just about everybody is conscious of the problem not only in this country but throughout Europe They may not all agree with me on details but the concern is there Wants National Greatness Mr Debre is an extremist on the issue A fervent follower of the late Charles de Gaulle he does not believe that France can achieve national greatness unless it doubles its population to 100 million in the next century He advocates a theory of history chat attributes the collapse of nations to declining birthrates He cites the concern expressed by Roman rulers during the empires decline the lag in population growth in France in relation to Germany and Britain during the 19th century and the Moslem majority that emerged in recent years in what was once a Christiandominated Lebanon Sure there are places like India that are overpopulated he said But it is folly to say that Europeans should diminish their numbers just because there are too many Asians Mr Debre keeps a list of great FrenchmenRonsard Descartes Richelieuwho would never have been born if their parents had decided to limit themselves to three children In his tours through France he tells workers at textile factories that the surest solution to their problems of declining sales and rising unemployment is more children Just think how many more textiles you would be selling if there were a million more babies a year he says Mr Debre is of course dead set against birth control and abortions He notes that while French women had an average of 29 babies in 1964 the figure was 18 last year and that the popularity of the birthcontrol pill has been one of the greatest factors in this decline Critics Cite Other Needs Mr Debres critics do not contest the demographic downturn but they do question his tactics and maintain that there are more pressing economic and social problems already at hand In a recent paper the General Confederation of Labor the largest French labor group pointed out that the country was still grappling with the effects of the postwar baby boom There are now almost seven million Western Europeans without jobs and people under 25 years of age account for about 40 percent of the unemployed While no one can deny the alarming implications of the birth decline for the future generation our primary concern is to accommodate the present generation of young people many of whom find themselves jobless the labor federation said Some of the measures that European labor unions and governments are proposing seem certain to exacerbate the effects of the demographic decline The French Government approved legislation last year permitting employees in private companies to choose retirement at 60 The aim is to allow companies to replace them with workers under 25 Reluctant to Hire Young But earlier retirements will increase taxes and social security contributions from the slowly growing active population French employers say they are reluctant to hire new younger employees because socialbenefit costs have risen sharply in recent years and now account for as much as 35 percent of labor costs The trend toward earlier retirementand the resulting expensive strain on European economiesis evident throughout the Continent In Italy where retirement for men has been reduced to GO the labor unions are pressing for a further reduction to 55 In West Germany the Netherlands Spain and most of Scandinavia retirement normally takes place at 65 or under and efforts are under way to reduce those age levels Feminists fear that the concern over low birthrates could erode pressure for improved job opportunities for women And they resolutely oppose Mr llehres calls for a rollback in birthcontrol measures and abortion legislation Working vs More Children The number of French working woman increased by a million during the last 10 years and they now account for more than 35 percent of the labor force That period coincided with the abrupt drop in birthrates Women who carry out a continuous economic activity have fewer children no matter what their social level said Michel Levy an official with the National Institute of Demographic Studies Ac cording to the Institute 60 percent of French women continue to work after having their first child but the figure drops to 36 percent after a third infant is born A realistic probirth policy has to avoid imposing on women a choice between work and children because they will more frequently choose the first option no matter how many speeches are made to the contrary said JeanJacques Dupeyroux who heads the labor law department at the University of Paris It is necessary to face up to the facts Notwithstanding the grandiloquent advocates of a higher birthrate for a workingclass family the prospect of a birth can cause the greatest apprehension and even be viewed as a catastrophe Mr Dupeyroux says that despite legislation protecting working mothers pregnancy leave often still leads to an outright dismissal He points out that the Paris region with about 10 million inhabitants offers only 30000 openings in centers for infant day care and that last year the Government allotted less than 50 a month in family allowances for workingclass parents who have had two children Cites Social Climate Mr Dehre maintains that the problem is not only an economic one but that the low birthrates have been created by the whole cultural political and social climate that encourages people to think in terms of small families He would like to see advertisements showing three or four children crammed into an automobile with their parents or television dramas depicting large families He would even apportion political rights according to family size His recently introduced bill would give fathers one additional vote for each son and mothers one additional vote for each daughter in national elections until their children reach voting age Mr Debre concedes that the socalled family vote has never been tried anywhere in the world to his knowledge But he maintains if French democracy needs reforming this is tie way to do it SygmaAlain Nogues Women in Paris demonstrating recently for free abortion and contraception

Abortion Measure Killed in Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/07/archives/abortion-measure-killed-in-albany.html,ALBANY June 6A measure requiring parents to be notified before a teenae woman can have an abortion was killed in committee today by the Assembly over the strenuous objections of Assemblymen ho felt its appearance before the Ways and Means Committee was an attempt to frustrate democracy The measure which would have required physicians either to get parental consent or proof that the parents had been notified before performing an abcrtion on a woman under 18 years old had already gained the overwhelming support of the Senate and had been reported by a close margin from the Assembly Health Committee But on the ground that the procedures the bill entailed would cost the state an extra 50000 a year for forms and administration it was referred to the Wy and Means Committee whose members killed it by a vote of 13 to 10 after lengthy and often acrid debate The sponsor cf the measure Vincent Nicolosi DemocratConservative of Bayside Queens said he would try to craft a compromise between his bill and a lessstringent measure supported by Governor Carey and said he wmild bring it before the Assembly again before the end of the session But it was unclear vhetlitr this would be possible The lessstringent measure would require a teenace woman to sign a statement certifying she had been advsed of the medical procedures to be used their Possible adverse consequences and alter nativcs to abortion it was held by the Ways and Means Committee The debate was conducted in a smokefilled conference room under the scrutiny of television camel7s and dozens of spectators some of whom held up signs dclaring their view of the issue Youre not fooling anyone by putting it into this committee Youre frustrat rig democracy by sending this bill to this committee And Assemblyman Gerald B Solomon Republican of Queensbury protested and said I dont see any fiscal implications Will are the fiscal implications of this bill But the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Arthur 1 Kremer Democrat of Long Beach simply shrugged and said Thats what were going to discuss Glad you could be here Some proponents of the strict abortionconsent measure have charged that it was referred to Ways and Means with the knowledgebased on their past votes and positionsthat its members would kill it avoiding the need for another politically damaging veto by Governor Carey The Governor vetoed a parentalconsent measure two years ago saying he believed it was unconstitutional Although the reason for the bills consideration by the committee was officially fiscal the debate was almost entirely parliamentary and on the substance of the measure And it got so rowdy at times that the chairman had to smack his palm repeatedly on the conference table to bring the members to order

the sleeping giant of 800000 women office workers in the city and suburbs who are overlooked by unionism and often bypassed by the tonier forces of feminism  We are increasingly familiar with the short odds suffered by Seven Sisters alumnae in male executive precincts but what about such women as the Dominican Commercial grads who went forth with white gloves Pitman and the wisdom of the nuns According to government statistics they and their colleagues are being paid 57 cents on the average dollar that goes to the minority of male workers who use the same office skills WOW says it is even worse within the city with women office workers holding 85 percent of the jobs but receiving only 48 percent of what male workers get What is more they are largely sealed off in corporate steerage according to Joy Hornung an organizer for WOW who joined up one frustrating day on Wall Street where she had been an office tempa temporary employe suffering as she recalls unfairly low wages and the occasional scorn of permanent women workers who imagined themselves better off  This corporate steerage is a place of vaguely defined opportunities for job advancement and salary raises a timeless servitude in the sense that many of the women work a full career of 25 years but in pieces built around interruptions of motherhood According to WOW the issue is not so much that the women want to rise up to executive levels What they want is a clearer definition of job responsibility and a definite career ladder through the office with training programs and better dollar recognition of the value of experience Currently WOWs 500 members are pamphleteering the citys major commercial banks with members using their lunch hours to make contacts and obtain firsthand statements on job conditions From these allegations have been formulated of typical sex age and race discrimination suffered by women WOW is submitting these cases to the Treasury Department which is charged with trying to enforce affirmativeaction standards in the banks You must understand that there are 14400 commercial banks in the nation and only 30 people in Treasurys enforcement office Joy Hornung says So we feel we have to focus on this or Treasury will never have the full picture The cases submitted thus far include a black woman named Grace an experienced accounting clerk in her mid40s who has been training black males of similiar education for higher jobs that bank officials are accused of denying to her Similarly a woman in her 50s with 20 years of secretarial experience returning after a short layoff because of her husbands illness is recycled down to a 96aweek pages job and a young secretary taxed gradually and happily with administrative responsibilities is denied formal status and pay When WOW first began consciousness had to be stirred from above with such dramatic things as an experiment in which a male tester left explicit instructions with employment agencies for the age and pulchritude he preferred in his hired women Then two womenone lung experienced the other more tender lookingarrived with qualifications The man who ran the tests couldnt believe it Joy Hornung says He could practically name the measurements he wanted  Similarly WOW has run contests for the most outrageous duties put upon women office workers Unalloyed lustful abuses are referred to another organization Working Women United Institute while job grievances of women professionals and executives are sent to the National Organization for Women The secretarial indignities gleaned for the contests include tweezing out the bosss gray hairs putting drops in bosss ears arranging the delivery of purloined office supplies to bosss home picking up the busy sires wife and new son at the hospital maternity ward and taking bosss coffeestained trousers to the cleaners then having to sit for two hours dictation as he expounds in his boxer shorts Lately however office workers have required less instigation in making contact with WOWs office 680 Lexington Avenue New York NY 10022 telephone 6884160 WOW workers sense a growing economic awareness that the old secondsalary mentality is increasingly intolerable for women in modern singleparent inflationbound roles Still the women in WOW are not very feminist Joy Hornung concedes The abortion issue for example does not appeal much to a group that has a considerable number ofRoman Catholic school graduates she says And if some call themselves girls we figure so what as long as they keep in mind the economic issues she adds What the women of WOW are trying to become is more pragmatic and moneyminded the issue is as plain and unsexy as that

CONTENTS: PAGE 26,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/11/archives/hugh-carey-portrait-of-one-politician-as-a-private-man-carey.html,Cover Neil Selkirk  Picture credits Page 105 Neil Selkir  Carey as head of the clan At the Governors Mansion in Albany he poses with his 12 surviving children assorted brothersinlaw sistersinlaw and grandchildren HUGH CAREY PORTRAIT OF THE POLITICIAN AS A PRIVATE MAN The unkindest thing you could say to Hugh Carey would be that he had no character the next unkindest thing that he had no class These would be unkind things to say to anyone of course but while Nelson Rockefeller secure in the conviction of his blame lessness would have ignored them the present Governor of New York would not Instead he would brood and then he would stick his thumb in your eye Carey is a difficult man  moody enigmatic aloof Carey is never really mean or bad Mario Cuomo New Yorks Secretary of State once said thoughtfully Hes just different Next week the Democratic State John Corry is a reporter and columnist for The New York Times Committee will nominate Carey for reelection Then the Republican State Committee will nominate Perry B Duryea the Minority Leader of the Assembly to run against him At stake is the leadership of a state whose financial crises are felt across the nation and whose urban crises may be unmatched since the London of Dickens or the Fall of Rome The Democrats who will nominate Carey do not necessarily like him and some of them wonder if they even know him Careys own polls meanwhile suggest that Carey is indistinct to the voters in general and they are not entirely sure he can be trusted Certainly he is different Carey is also Irish which says at least something about the difference Hughie is like all the Irish his older brother Ed says He wants to be liked Innumerable legislators labor leaders and former assistants of the Governor disagree Carey they say couldnt care less whether they like him or not in his dealings with them he has sometimes shown the faint amusement or mild disdain of a man visiting the zoo Actually it is not so much that Carey dislikes the people he deals with It is more that he is indifferent to them They are listening for their constituents he is listening for his soul A mentor long departed Carey says told me that the greatest gift in political life in any life is to view yourself objectively  at arms length  to make an assessment of yourself So whom do I rely on I rely on myself While most politicians sustain themselves with claques and coteries Carey hangs in there pretty much alone Still he does not like to go home alone at night and so he will sit and sit not necessarily brooding but as often as not cheerful and expansive Sometimes then he will sing Irish songs The Governor does not have a bad voice and at a fundraising party at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center in January he sang Thank Heaven for Little Girls in the style of Maurice Chevalier Once he sang Something Was Missing from Annie to Frank Sinatra over the telephone because he thought Sinatra should record it Clearly the Governor has verve and it is a considerable part of his charm Carey can also be glowering and unpredictable and when he narrows his eyes and shakes his wattles he can be very nasty An instant later he can be all charm People who have worked with him are unsettled by this This means he is evasive although the evasiveness is not always calculated and it can even be a part of his charm Carey also has a sense of whimsy but it is not always charming sometimes it can be dark and brooding The Irish Macaulay said were distinguished by qualities which tend to make men interesting rather than prosperous In the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf last year the New York Demo Carey as head of the state Drawn into New York Citys financial crisis the Governor confers with MAC chairman Felix G Rohatyn in Washington crats threw a fundraiser called A Tribute to the President While President Carter walked the floor of the ballroom shaking hands and giving everyone the big hello Carey sat with Abe and Mary Beame and a few other people People wandered up to him and exchanged pleasantries and finally Alice Mason came along Miss Mason a realestate broker who raised as much money for Jimmy Carter in New York as anyone was very happy Carter had praised her in his speech that night and later he had hugged and kissed her Good evening Governor Miss Mason said Dont talk to me I could vomit every time I look at you Dont speak to me Carey said He was angry because Miss Mason was not supporting Mario Cuomo for Mayor Well maybe youll speak to me when I support you Miss Mason said If youre not for my man I dont want you or any of your support Carey said A woman who was standing with Miss Mason interceded If you dont need Alice then you dont need us she said Who are you Carey asked We stick together because were one family the woman answered Then the confrontation broke up The next day a friend called Carey and criticized him for his behavior I guess I was impolitic Carey said Then another friend called Carey and told him that the woman with Miss Mason was Ruth Stapleton the Presidents sister For just a moment Carey let that sink in Well how could I tell he said She wasnt smiling Now it is graceless to tell a woman that she makes you want to vomit but it is not bad at all to say that you did not recognize the Presidents sister because she was not showing her teeth There is a little of Jimmy Cagney in the Governor and much of the flippancy too 0 Careys colleagues say that working with him is not always pleasant although they never complain about the dullness of routine Partly because he keeps his own counsel so closely and partly because he is a man of impulse Carey has the constant ability to surprise This drives his administrators nuts The most celebrated instance of Carey keeping his own counsel came on Dec 23 1975 when he tried to dismiss Maurice N Nadjari as special prosecutor Carey did not discuss it first with the men who were supposed to be his wisest and most experienced political advisers  the late Liberal Party leader Alex Rose former Mayor Robert F Wagner and campaign consultant David Garth  and he did not discuss it with Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz who after all was the state official who had the authority to dismiss Nadjari Carey simply acted I gave great weight to the decision Carey says now There are those who said I should have rehearsed it should have reviewed it with the Attorney General but that possibly assumes that the Attorney General would have handled it differently My experience with the Attorney General indicated to me that whatever I had done whenever spoke to him he would not have handled it differently Perhaps Good government did not suffer noticeably when Nadjari finally left office but when Carey made the move against him his political prestige did Political prestige is illusory but consider that in December of 1975 Time Magazine had Carey on its list of contenders for Man of the Year and that Careys confidants and presumably Carey himself were warming themselves with thoughts of his being the Democratic Presidential nominee When he tried to dismiss Nadjari a Republican who was investigating Democrats his prestige suffered his ambition got mislaid Still he had acted in keeping with his character Three days before he tried to dismiss Nadjari Careys first grandchild died of crib death After the funeral Carey went to his home on Shelter Island and there his friends say he stopped by the grave of James Roe Jr A State Supreme Court Justice Roe died in an airplane crash in 1968 and in that last year of his life he stood trial for offering a 10 bribe to two policemen who had given him a speeding ticket Carey an old friend appeared for him as a character witness Roe was cleared of the bribery charge on the day after his death even though the Suffolk County District Attorneys office had prosecuted him with what seemed to be uncommon zeal Maurice Nadjari had been in that office Assistant District Attorney And so Carey mourned the death of his grandchild remembered Jim Roe and got caught in that dark confluence of anger and sorrow that afflicts the Irish when their souls are beset He had to do something and so he went after Nadjari A less temperamental politician  or a less interesting man would have orchestrated it better Carey is supposed to have been the first American soldier to cross the bridge at Remagen in World War II and David Garth once spent days looking in vain for the photographs that were supposed to prove it Carey is moved by rage melancholy guilt pain sentiment and the lust for glory more deeply than most men This is his strength When Carey saysI must respond to those very personal moral judgments that I hold and then opposes the death penalty he is speaking out of conviction Politically of course it is outrageous Perry Duryea will tramp the state for the Republicans this fall and call for the death penalty and most likely it will be the biggest issue in the campaign Carey cannot win votes by opposing it he cannot be himself and it He is Careys two oldest sons died in an automobile accident His wife died of cancer Carey once said I have seen too much of death and when he was reminded of having said it he frowned and said it was easy to make too much Carey with Anne Ford a frequent companion His night life has drawn criticism of a statement like that But Carey does think about death and resurrection they are almost a psalmody in his political statements Carey also believes that sin is real He has a sense of moral responsibility for his own acts and when he talks about helping the aged the poor the retarded and the disturbed his compassion is evident his intent is sincere He did not spend all those years with the nuns in Catholic schools for nothing and he believes that what is important really is important God after all is watching The corollary of this among Irish politicians has been that the purely temporal sometimes leaves them cold Consequently Irish politicians often do not take themselves as seriously as you might think and for Carey cutting a big ceremonial ribbon say with big ceremonial scissors is an exercise in controlled mirth He knows it really isnt important Siinilarly Irish politicians frequently are tolerant of human frailties in themselves and in others and so it is sometimes easier for them to do business with bindlestiffs and rogues This is because God is watching out only for the big malfeasances You had a reputation for being one of the dirtiest politicians ever to come out of Brooklyn it was remarked to Carey not long ago Oh oh Carey said There was a pause a beat There were some pretty dirty campaigns run in those days he finally allowed with muck and mire all over the place put it that way Another pause another beat I tried to keep it clean he said and I hope Ive never done a mean thing never done anything out of a desire to hurt Everyone I ever ran against is in better shape now than when I ran against him  judges on benches lawyers making better livings I never did anything out of a desire to hurt I think Carey is the strangest guy Ive ever met in politics a colleague says Hes highly intelligent but the problem is he doesnt think most things are important Under pressure hes dynamite Hes also great in a back alley Dirty politics  hed say Thats political expediency thats reality thats business But hed never make a really dirty deal I dont think In matters of morality hes classy On the easy stuff hes terrible I dont think hes really close to anyone The colleague does not want to be identified None of Careys colleagues in fact will be identified when they say anything critical about him at all Carey remembers slights and he does not take them lightly After Carey denounced the Irish Republican Army in Dublin on April 22 1977 City Council President Paul ODwyer showed his disapproval by ostentatiously getting up and walking out when Carey gave speech in New York Carey was delighted when ODwyer lost to Carol Bellamy in the Democratic primary One great authority on the Governor who will stand up and be identified however is his older brother Edward M Carey When Hugh Carey ran against Howard Samuels in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1979 Samuels was supposed to be the wealthy candidate Carey was the Congressman from Brooklyn with 12 kids Ed Carey meanwhile was the proprietor of the New England Petroleum Corporation one of the largest private companies in the world grossing more than 8110 million a year in 1979 Ed Carey is very very rich and in 1979 he was very very generous to his brothers campaign Beyond that he is the older brotherthe oldest brother in fact among six brothers In Ireland the oldest brother inherits the farm Ed Carey says In high school I guess I began to exert my own authority Ed Carey is modest man who flies down to Lyford Cay in the Bahamas in the company jet and who otherwise lives quietly on his 19 acres in Cedarhurst L1 Hell he says if they didnt like me in Southampton I wouldnt like them either When Ed Carey sits in his office and decides that he wants a cup of coffee he gets up and fetches it himself There is not much pretense to Ed Carey and Hugh will forever be his younger brother Hughie went into politics without much hope of winning Ed Carey says He was in the chemical business working for me and an increase in his salary and the thought of being in Washington must have been appealing to him When he ran for Congress he asked me if his old job would be open if he lost and I said If you go into politics you go into politics You cut the tie I guess Hughie had the idea in the back of his head all the time Hed say what a great life politics would be and after Europe the Army he said Some day Ill be Governor Hughie came back from the Army with grandiose ideas about getting into petrochemicals He always had grandiose schemes Id sit down and tell him the facts of life Ed Carey is not speaking the slightest bit unkindly it is just that Hughie is his kid brother The stories about him drinking never saw Hughie drunk in 59 years Ed Carey says 1 just dont know what hes doing with some of those people hes with Phonies shallow people New York is full of them True and here is the crunch the nut and the thing that can make you wonder about Hugh Carey What is he doing at those dinner parties and in Southampton anyway 0 We will listen now to Dr Kevin Cahill the Governors adviser on health affairs as well as his confidant and closest friend Dr Cahill does not go to the dinner parties much less Southampton Theres been a perception of Hugh and too many late nights too many tuxedos too many times in the Suzy column Dr Cahill says But it reflects a great innocence on Hughs part something to be treasured Of all Careys friends Dr Cahill is perhaps the most interesting He has pale blue eyes bristling eyebrows and somehow the appearance of a tout at an Irish race track He is a general practitioner with an interest in tropical medicine and as he tells you quickly a rather remarkable practice He says he has treated 29 heads of state that he has written 10 books and 100 magazine articles and that he was once the youngest college professor in America When Carey needs solace Cahill is there I work with Hugh never for Hugh Cahill says My role is philosophical dont trust people who make political judgments Ill say Hugh is this the best we can do Is this the right thing Would Helen have approved  Helen Carey the Governors wife was Dr Cahills patient Ed Careys sun married Continued on Page 95 Now it is not bad at all to say you did not recognize the Presidents sister because she was not showing her teeth There is a little of Cagney in the Governor Carey s media adviser David Garth Cureys superego Dr Kevin M Cahill Carey listens as a valued political ally Robert F Wagner endorses him in 1974 CAREY one of Dr Cahills sisters when she died he married Dr Cahills other sister Cahill is not sure exactly when or where but he thinks he first met Hugh Carey sometime in 1966 By now he has treated all the Careys and he seems to have treated most of Hugh Careys friends too Moreover Cahill was with Carey when he gave the speech in Dublin denouncing the violence in Northern Ireland Together they tramped the hills near a New York ski resort and talked about Maurice Nadjari When Carey wants to hold a truly private meeting away from the Governors office on the Avenue of the Americas he holds it in Cahills office on Fifth Avenue When he wants to get away from everything entirely he may go out to Cahills house in Lido Beach Ll and sleep on a Castro convertible in a room in the basement Cahills children stack their fishing rods in the corner and leave cracker crumbs in the bed The Governor feels at home Obviously because Dr Cahill is so close to Carey there are people who do not like him David Garth for one has spoken about not working for Carey if Cahill is hanging around the campaign but Cahill is still around and so is Garth Some people in the bureaucracy worry that Cahill will speak unkindly about them to Carey They also say that Cahill is forever trying to influence Carey although they are usually a little vague as to exactly how Sometimes they seem to think that Cahill is like Rasputin actually he is a little like Savonarola Im not an innercircle type of man Carey says He suggests that there are many peo Carey switches The Governor turned his back on mayoral candidate Mario Cuomo extreme left last year Carey alienated voters by first supporting Cuomo then dropping him for Koch Carey dumps He tried to oust special prosecutor Maurice Nadjari left who was investigating Democratic officials  among them state chairman Patrick J Cunningham right Carey cooled on Cunningham who resigned No indictments resulted ple in his life and that they are all equidistant In fact Carey travels lightly gathering many acquaintances but retaining few old friends When Carey moved to Albany only his private secretary came along Carey does not inspire longterm relationships and it is possible that he does not think much about them either The Teamster official who criticized him last fall for his social life missed the point The largest share of the blame for New York States failure to recover from the recession said Nicholas Kisburg legislative director of Teamster Joint Council 16 must be laid at the door of our parttime Governor who seems to find a hectic social life  and time to turn P J Clarkes bar into an afterhours joint  more important and interesting than managing the affairs of New York State Kisburg did not document this He said only that he was saying openly what other people were muttering about privately A little later Carey said that he would no longer socialize in public He also said it was a sorry thing that a man could no longer enter licensed premises without having his reputation blackened The assumption of course was that he was boozing worse that it was getting between him and his job In truth Carey will nurse a glass of wine as long as anyone and on two or three glasses of wine his face gets florid and his eyelids droop There have always been stories about the Irish and their fondness for drink There has also always been an antiIrish prejudice that embel lishes and passes on the stories The worst you can say about Carey is that sometimes after lunch sliced steak and verdicchio wine say at Mike Manuches on West 52d Street he gets sleepy This does not much affect his being Gover The hectic social life that Kisburg mentioned does not much affect his being Governor either It does however say something about Carey It says he can kill time as well as the next man The great secret about the upper reaches of New Yorks social life is that nothing important ever happens there But Contacts use each other later Carey is very defensive about his social life I am a man of character and taste and I think my tastes are reflected in the kind of persons with whom I associate he says I think they are fine people and I just think it was improper and I use the word outrageous to allege that after the hard work Ive been doing  Here he goes after Kisburg whose memory still rankles  that someone a particular person would have picked a vulnerability or think thats a vulnerability Now he builds to a peroration  I just find that despicable Carey is resonant with anger and injured innocence In his way he is an oldfashioned man and in the last campaign he was possibly at his most attractive when he would come home to his apartment in Brooklyn at 2 AM and start picking the kids socks up off the floor Sometimes now he will fly back to Albany after midnight so he can have breakfast with his youngest sons in the morning Carey no matter how forcefully he may advocate the Equal Rights Amendment also has a traditional view of women and sometimes when he deals with a woman professional he must stare at the ceiling a lot Once a woman who worked for Carey came into his office accused him of ignoring her and burst into tears Carey immediately made her a deputy secretary to David Burke who was then functioning as his Frequently Carey refers to his late wife Helen who died in March 1974 and not long ago he said that he often considered her when he made decisions When Carey holds a meeting in Dr Cahills office a sign goes up Ad HOC The HOC stands for Helen Owen Carey Carey was also quoted then as saying that he did not think he would ever remarry It is uncharacteristic of Carey whatever his thoughts may be to speak aloud that way and he says now that he was tired when he said it He also says he did not know the reporter he talked to was taking notes Someone printed that dwell upon my departed wife and almost had me in a Neil Simon Chapter Two situation  that I still consider her and that she guides me Carey says Well I dont want that said Up until the time she departed she had a very strong influence on the children Shes not accountable for my political actions  lets put it that way Carey pauses He can be the most loquacious of men and he can speak so rapidly that the secretaries who take his dictation get dull pains When he is uncomfortable however or when he is wrestling with his thoughts he speaks with pauses You can measure his discomfort or how carefully he is choosing his words by the length of his pauses My wife was a strong person he says Another pause Look a woman who shows a great devotion and love to her children and who makes that her career sort of her life is a great woman he says Now the longest pause of all Of course everyone else is afraid to ask me why I see Anne Ford Uzielli especially Perry B Duryea Careys hardline Republican rival this year he says She takes good care of her children and is a fine person Thats one of the reasons   Pause although not so long this time  among other attractive qualities about her Mrs Uzielli or Anne Ford as she prefers to be called since she was divorced is a daughter of Henry Ford and the former Anne McDonnell Mrs Robert F Wagner the former Mayors wife who is a politically influential person in her own right introduced Anne Ford to the Governor at a party for Frank Sinatra and almost immediately thereafter a wiseacre on Careys staff began referring to them as Cash and Carey Technically Mrs Ford is a jet setter but she is not the kind who wants to get her name in the columns or her picture in the papers Ed Carey thinks she is nice This is small Certainly I consider myself a literary person the Gover Hed never make a dirty deal says a colleague In matters of morality hes classy On the easy stuff hes terrible nor is saying now I used to do all my own speeches enjoy being in the company of good minds Who doesnt So depending on whether he and are in central agreement on a given topic I enjoy the company of Jimmy Breslin Sometimes in a phone conversation hell check to see if Ive already read his column before Ive risen for breakfast Peter Maas is another one whose friendship I value highly Breslin is the columnist for The Daily News Maas among other things is the author of The Valachi Papers and Serpico Jimmy Dr Cahil I also says is a good friend and patient and often he calls and gives me a sense of the people in Queens Maas meanwhile says he was a conduit between Mario Cuomo and Governor Carey in the Mayoralty campaign He is not a patient of Dr Cahills although his wife is Maus sometimes goes to dinner parties but Breslin never Careys relationships run in concentric circles Politically however Carey has never had much of an entourage and although he may look like the quintessential Democratic Organization Regular he is not In the beginning in 1960 the Brooklyn Regulars scarcely knew his name but Carey assured them that he would pay his own campaign debts they assuming he would lose nominated him for Congress He beat Francis Dorn the fourterm Republican incumbent by 1097 votes In 1962 he beat Dorn by 383 votes Things were never easy for Carey in Brooklyn I recall one time when a rather wellknown politico a political elder actually not only confronted me but the pastor of our church a large church a considerable church Carey says The pastor wanted to help the Spanish people and the pastor had to remove himself or be Im not an innercircle type of man Carey says When he moved to Albany only his secretary came along removed because he suddenly saw a dwindling congregation You couldnt believe the sanctions in those days There were intense feelings about turning Bay Ridge into a poverty area Carey is speaking in euphemisms He means that his old Congressional district had a lot of hard hats in it Carey opposed the busing of students He said the Civilian Complaint Police Review Board was a bad idea He tried to get Federal aid for parochial schools Luigi Marano his Republican opponent in 1964 still said he was an ultraliberal Meanwhile Carey remained a little estranged from the Regular Democratic Organization In 1969 Carey announced for Mayor and hardly a Democrat except Robert Wagner even noticed Wagner also wanted to run for Mayor and he offered Carey a place on his own ticket as the candidate for City Council President Carey accepted and they both lost in the primary In 1973 Carey again consid ered running for Mayor His big patron then was not a fellow Democrat however it was the Republican Nelson Rockefeller For years because New York needed state aid and because Carey was a member of the Ways and Means Committee and a crony of its chairman Wilbur Mills Carey had been Rockefellers favorite Congressman at times they would talk on almost a daily basis Even now Carey hardly ever criticizes Rockefeller by name now and again he will say something disapproving about my predecessor as in My predecessor almost gave the state away He does not mean Malcolm Wilson whom he seems to have In the interesting Mayoralty politics of 1973 Rockefeller eventually supported Wagner for Mayor Carey waited Abe Beame won Carey meanwhile grew increasingly unhappy in Washington He had always been deferential to his elders and characteristically he had voted against every attempt to upset the House seniority system The Irish have always understood hierarchies However it may have been that his best days in the House were behind him In the 1960s as chairman of the Subcommittee on Education of the Handicapped Carey probably was responsible for more legislation to help the disabled than any other member of Congress This satisfied him he speaks of it now with pride In upholding the House seniority system Carey was naturally doing business with some of the bindlestiffs and rogues It didnt matter God of course was looking out for the Carey is pleased that he will be running against Duryea this fall and not against Warren Anderson the Senate Majority Leader who also wanted the Republican nomination Careys old Congressional district was oddly shaped with the Verrazario Bridge at one end and the Brooklyn Bridge at the other and it was full of Republicans Gerrymandering had made it so After one such gerrymandering Rockefeller invited Carey to a meeting with Duryea to show him a map of the newly defined district When Carey saw the map he was stricken Duryea and his Republican colleagues had made of it a cartographers night Cant you at least give me this one block back Carey said pointing to the map Absolutely not Im elect ing three Assemblymen and losing one Congressman Duryea said cheerfully Carey has not forgotten He has a lust for retribution and when he can he follows Joe Kennedys old advice about not getting mad but instead getting even He wants to beat Duryea In the campaign Duryea will say as he has been saying for the last year that Carey has not stopped the deterioration of the states economy that he has shown incredible insensitivity to the victims of crime that he is soft on crime and that he breaks his promises In this Duryea was going after what Careys own polls and presumably Duryeas too show to be one of Careys great weaknesses He is seen as a man who cannot be entirely trusted and who is capable perhaps of treachery Carey after all walked away from Abe Beame when Beame wanted to succeed himself as Mayor and he chose instead to support Mario Cuomo Then he disowned him Moreover Carey is Irish but he has repudiated the Irish Republican Army and he is Catholic but he has supported the right to abortion Careys complexities work against him Nonetheless for two years in a row New York State has added new jobs to the manufacturing sector and while the unemployment rate in the state stood at 102 percent a year and a half ago it was down by more than onefifth to 74 percent by last winter Perhaps Carey has not stopped the deterioration of the states economy but certainly his Administration has slowed it Meanwhile when Duryea speaks about Carey being soft on crime he is speaking about his opposition to the death penalty which of course will be the campaigns biggest issue This is a pity Whatever Careys misdemeanors it is difficult to think of him as being soft on crime He has called for mandatory prison sentences for those convicted of certain violent crimes life imprison ment for persistent violent offenders and limitations on plea bargaining He also has said he is thinking of asking for a bond issue that would pay Unfortunately perhaps abortion has now become a political issue too In the past Duryea did not seem to disapprove of abortion and in 1970 he was even instrumental in the passage of a bill that per mitted abortions The leaders of the Conservative Party let it be known this year however that they would not back legislators who either opposed the death penalty or supported abortion and hardly anyone thinks a Republican can be elected Governor without the Conservatives In April Duryea apparently underwent an ideological change He voted for a bill that would have prohibited the use of state funds for most abortions Carey on the other hand has supported abortion bills and he has even said that if abortions are legal for women who can afford them then the state should provide money for poor women who cannot President Carter addressing himself to the same question has spoken about lifes inevitable unfairness The interesting thing here of course is that Carey the Catholic father of 12 personally opposes abortions and often says so Duryea is a Protestant without the religious strictures that are on Carey Nonetheless he is now among the antiabortionists What once was a matter of conscience is now a matter of politics Indisputably Careys conscience is his own but in his reelection campaign he is to be advised by others Garth will be the most important adviser while John F Burns a former Democratic state chairman who has taken a leave from his 20000 parttime lifetime job on the citys Board of Water Supply will be the campaign manager Robert Morgado Careys secretary will work with Burns and Garth Meanwhile Robert F Wagner Gerald Cummins the chairman of the State Thruway Authority and Raymond B Harding the new leader of the Liberal Party are supposed to make up a brains trust Breslin will offer advice too Sometimes in a phone conversation the Governor says Jimmy will give me a total agenda for the week on what the state should be doing As always with Carey however the question will be Will he take the advice Often he can be a man of stone Carey is a gifted campaigner and against Howard Samuels in the 1974 primary and Malcolm Wilson in the election he hardly got winded Unhesitatingly he lost 30 pounds in one month limiting himself to one glass of white wine a day while simultaneously suffering the gray in his hair to be dyed black Now it is gray again His daughter Helen told him it looked better that way Uncomplainingly he would rise at 5 AM and then turn blue outside some windswept hamlet in early November Moreover he was witty an argument one reporter wrote for the proposition that only the Irish should ever practice politics One rather imagines that in a campaign he will chew Duryea up into little pieces Duryea is silverhaired and handsome and his greatest asset is simply that he looks like a Governor  no small blessing Duryea is inexperienced as a campaigner having won elections on the East End of Long Island mostly by just being there and recently he flopped in a couple of big speeches At a dinner held by the Legislative Correspondents Association in Albany Duryea began his speech by saying that he hadnt been very good in an appearance before the Chamber of Commerce a few nights before Then forthwith he wasnt very good again It will also be counted against Duryea that despite his now earnestly announced promises to be kind to New York City he has been publicly skeptical about saving the city in the past In 1975 for example he voted against the creation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation It is unlikely that Carey will allow him to forget it Still Duryea will be leading a Republican Party that is reasonably behind him in a state that is generally conservative while Carey will be leading some troops who are not sure they even like him Carey has not done much to build up the Democratic Party in the state and at party functions his eyes sometimes look glazed Worse he has allowed Republicans to stay on in patronage jobs that could be filled by Democrats The late Helen Carey A great woman says her husband Carey stands in the rain beside his wife and children at the 1969 funeral of his two eldest sons victims of an automobile accident The county leaders hate this most of all Recently Dominic Baranello the Democratic state chairman went to Carey with a long list of Republicans whose jobs he wanted Carey however remembered that one Republican was someones godfather or that another was a friend of a friend or maybe that long ago he had gone to church in Bay Ridge Baranello was frustrated Carey was unmoved The consensus is that Carey can be persuaded but only so far and that when he thinks he is being pushed he starts to brood Early in his administration for instance when it was first becoming apparent that New York City was sinking into its own indebtedness it was suggested to Carey that he would have to involve himself in the crisis What do you want me to be  the Mayor of New York he said He thought he was being pushed and it made him angry The Irish are jealous of their own autonomy and among the Irish like Carey there is often an apprehension about other people doing them in The Irish who have this apprehension to a high degree are sometimes called black Irish Carey is black Irish Hell ask for advice only when hes in trouble a colleague says of Carey When Harry ODonnell came in as press secretary hed write memos to Carey that said go here go there and the more hed pressure Carey the less Carey would do Its almost as if hes got to show you he cant be controlled Carey will also drift wrapped in solitude while the government creaks on without him He doesnt communicate to his assistants another colleague says and he doesnt have longrange objectives He doesnt think beyond 48 hours The fate of the city can be hanging in the balance and hell go two weeks without meeting anyone Then when its two out in the ninth he hits the home run The colleague means that when Carey finally does act he can be formidable Not even his most implacable political enemies accuse him of being dilatory during a disaster and sometimes it has seemed that crises and disasters are what the city and state are all about It was headon collision government  bail with one hand steer with the other Carey says about those first hard times That was when the city was going bust one day and Yonkers or some state agency the He surprised even me in the fiscal crisis I didnt know how he was going to handle himself Ed Carey says I think he must have picked up a lot of that stuff in Congress think he did very well Now the Governor has no tougher critic than Ed Carey and what he says about Hugh Carey in general goes There is something in a crisis that inspires Carey and makes him at his best A crisis is corporeal and it allows for neither brooding nor boredom There is no waiting on your soul Unthinkable Carey said when it was suggested that the city be allowed to go bankrupt Suddenly he was all over the place dazzling the bankers calming City Hall hanging on the phone late at night Whenever the crisis slackened Carey would too Sometimes he would almost disappear But during a crisis Carey gets it all together 0 Public life  its a hard game Carey is saying now He is reflecting on the things that he thinks matter Dont let the foundry of life so harden you that you become breakable fragile he says You have to build an alloy in there somewhere and I guess that if you want to ask what that alloy is  its a very deep faith Im not talking about the religion I was born into which I inherited but I have a very deep faith that there is a better life and that there is an eternity and that I have some very good friends there And when the Governor reaches that eternity how does he hope his epitaph will read A pause Once again Carey is wrestling He did his best and he had character he finally says He showed character  Picture Credits 1NEIL SELKIRK 2627THE NEW YORK TIMES GEORGE TAMES NEIL SELKIRK 2829ASSOCIATED PRESS CAMERA 5 THE NEW YORK TIMES CHESTER HIGGINS Jr

give to a woman an abortive remedy On the othhand most new medical school graduates do not take the Hippochatic oath they subscribe instead to a resolution of the World Health Organization that refers not at all to abortion THE BABY IN THE BOTTLE By William A Nolen MD 253 pages Coward McCann  Geoghegan 895 Evenhandedness is William A Nolens rhetorical device for most of his new book The author of The Making of a Surgeon and Surgeon Under the Knife is reexamining the case of Dr Kenneth C Edelin who was accused of manslaughter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts after he had performed an abortion at Boston City Hospital in October 1973 A jury found Dr Edelin guilty the Massachusetts Supreme Court reversed his conviction Dr Nolen having read about the case in the newspapers decided that we the public had not learned as much as we should have And so he has gone over the grand jury and court transcripts and the newspaper and magazine articles He has interviewed counsel for the defense and the prosecution ase well as a number of doctors and nurses in and around Boston Dr Edelin refused to discuss the case and Dr Nolen seems not to have bestirred himself to get in touch with Dr Enrique Giminez whose testimony was so damaging to Dr Edelin at the time and who is now somewhere in Mexico He gives us a little bit of Boston politics in the person of Albert Dapper ONeil and quite a lot about trimesters saline methods and hysterotomies He explains the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade that struck down as unconstitutional every state abortion law in the nation in January 1973 He summarizes both sides of the fetal viability question Was the Subject Alive Throughout The Baby in the Bottle is point counterpoint At issue is not whether Dr Edelin performed an illegal abortion abortions of the sort he performed were legal in Massachusetts in October 1973 At issue is whether the subject or fetus was alive when he opened the mothers uterus whether he then waited three or four minutes before removing it whether he made even a cursory attempt to determine whether the babyit becomes legally a baby when it is removed from its motherwas still alive before it was put in a bottle A monstrous irony is proposed Doctor and mother wanted the fetus dead That was the purpose of the operation Even if the fetus or subject or baby was alive in the few seconds before it went into the bottle it could not Dr Nolen reckons have lasted an hour And yet what is the doctors responsibility To gain that hour This is not the place to debate the ethics of abortion The best book on the subject is still in my opinion Daniel Callahans Abortion Law Choice and Morality which takes sophisticated account of the shifting processes of accommodation between individual rights and social needs by which policy and laws are created I am more concerned in reviewing this book with its method Chapter by chapter Dr Nolen quotes and summarizes and speculates At the end of each chapter he has a conclusion That conclusion may apply to a personality or an issue in the case Thus Hugh Holtrop struck me as a dedicated physician ambivalent about his role as an occasional abortionist and a very compassionate man Or Having read the testimony I am sure I would also have voted to indict The presumption here carefully nurtured by style is of a disinterested intelligence a trained physician reviewing the facts science in action With his ontheonehands and ontheotherhands Dr Nolen asks us to trust him to be fair It is a leap of faith Im not quite prepared to make without a parachute He often asserts without the benefit or decency of a citation or a footnote The guilt feelings of women who spontaneously give birth to fetuses that have died in Wert are less intense and of shorter duration than those of women who have had hysterotomies for the purpose of abortion He is tendentious No one has ever proven that having a baby is any more damaging to a young girls psyche than having an abortion He mentions some specialists with whom he agrees and fails to identify them Mental Telepathy And he reads minds In deciding that Dr Edelin was guilty as charged he tells us what the doctor and his colleagues must have been thinking He is full of I suspect it may well have been might even have it is safe to conclude I dont find it difficult at all to imagine there is little doubt when in theory it might not have been it is not safe to conclude there is plenty of doubt Only at the end of The Baby in the Bottle do we learn that Dr Nolen is an Irish Catholic with six children and regards abortion as repellent While many of my best friends including my father have been Irish Catholics who find abortion repellent this is still information I would have preferred at the beginning of the book I dont know if Dr Nolen began his reexamination of this case already believing Dr Edelin to be guiltybecause I cant read his mind But if I cant read his mind he cant read Dr Edelins Associated

HOUSE VOTES TO CURB FUNDS FOR ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/14/archives/house-votes-to-curb-funds-for-abortions-representatives-challenge.html,WASHINGTON June 13The House voted today to restrict the use of Federal funds for abortions thereby challenging the Senate to a repeat of last years long and often acrimonious debate on the highly controversial issue At the same time the House cut 800 million in funds proposed for expenditure in fiscal 1979 by the Departments of Labor and of Health Education and Welfare Both actions came as Representatives considered the annual appropatatons bill for the two departments As finally passed on a vote of 338 to 61 the measure totaled 579 billion almost 2 billion less than originally proposed Besides the 800 million slashed today 1 billion was cut during debate on the bill last Thursday In neither case was it specified where the cuts were to be made although the House stipulated that no program could be cut by more than five percent Lastminute efforts by the House leadership to head off another battle with the Senate traditionally more liberal on such matters failed when opponens o abortion voted not to adopt the compromise language that ended the 1977 debate That debate which tied up House and Senate conferees for more than six months ended when the conferees finally agreed to allow abortions to be paid for by Medicaid whenever the mothers life was in danger whenever she was the victim of rape or incest or whenever two physicians determined that giving birth would cause her severe and longlasting physical problems The language adopted by the House today was considerably more restrictive than ha and was essentially the same that the House conferees carried into last years battle It stated that none of the funds provided for in this act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term An effort to strike that language failed 287 to 122 An effort to amend the language to read the same as the 1977 compromise provision was also defeated 212 to 198 Federal funds for abortions are paid out mainly through

Spain Seems to Look to Younger Generation for Leaders,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/16/archives/spain-seems-to-look-to-younger-generation-for-leaders-a-voice-of.html,MADRID June 15One year ago Spaniards began the political transformation of their country by casting their ballots in freedom for the first time in four decadesOn this first anniversary of their democracy it seems to at least one thoughtful Spaniard that what is occurring beyond the obvious political changes is a transfer of power from one generation to another Spain has one of the youngest populations in Europe so it is not altogether surprising that the editor of its leading newspaperMadrids daily El Pais is only 33 years oldAfter all King Juan Carlos is 39 Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez is 45 Mire Cii6nzalez the leader of the Socialist opposition is 36 Since the majority of the country is young what you haveisa terrible desire for modernity in all senses said Juan Luis Cebrizln twistiv softly in a swivel chair in the newspapers office late the other nightYou have to be Spanish to understand thisFive years ago you went out to Europe or America and you were ashamed to present your passport even if you were very patriotic and loved your countryThe feeling of inferiority and isolation in which we Spaniards were raised was Try strong On his littered desk lay a number of books on China lastminute cramming for an imminent tripImagine said Mr Cebriansippine a beerday after tomorrow the King is going to China Not so long agoin 1970 eight years aPothere was a state of emergency and all the students and professors who had pictures of Mao burned them because they were sure reasons to co to jailWe tend to forget that the last executions of the Franco regime took place in October 1975And there is another very important thing that we are still getting used to that this country has lost its fearWe lived with a tremendous fear until Franco died A Voice of Change Five months after the Caudillos death anneared El Paisa stylishliberal minded daily that quickly established itself as a reasoned voice of changeand soon as one of the best newspapers in Western EuropeWith a circulation of 150000 a staff of 93 journalistsincluding 10 foreign correspondentsEl Pais is in its editors phrase progressive in the intellectual and sociological not political sense It is to the left of the right said MrCebriAn with a grin A former philosophy student the slight wiry editor who recently traded in a wispy heard for a solid mustachf is well positioned to observe the generational shift in Spain His father and an uncle were both editors of Arriba a Government daily in the Franco era Though last Junes parliamentary elections gave Prime Minister Adolfo Stiarezs makeshift centerright Union of the Democratic Center a mandate to govern MrCebrian believes that onetime functionaries of the Franco regime like the Prime Minister and many of hiS closest collaborators will eventually be eased out of powerBy pursuing a liberal economic policy but taking conservative stands on such questions as abortion and the death penalty the Prime Minister is missing the prevailing mood of the countrythat of the 50 percent of the people who voted left but neither feels proletariat nor Marxist Behind the Suirez phenomenon the editor sees a deeper crisis of the Spanish right which has not been able to organi7e itself since Frarros deathSuarez himself cincr not consier himself a rightistFew people in the Government consider themselves to be rightist because of the psychological and educational bombardment of Francoism against capitalism equating capitalism and Marxism and so onThis is a country where great fortunes were made during Francoism but where people are ashamed to make money The Socialists the second largest party in Parliament after the Union of the Democratic Center are not in much better shape in MrCebriVis view and he thinks that Felipe Gonzalez must be subject to attacks of vertigo when he ponders the strong possibility that he could be Prime Minister in a few months if new general elections are held Neither Italy nor France furnishes a model for Spains futureThere was not a World War here said MrCebrian Instead there was a civil war a terrific violenceThis country has just reestablished a monarchy when the majority of the country is not monarchist either on the lest or rightEven so it is a monarchy supported by all the nonmonarchists of this countryI think thats a fairly Spanish model Death Is Famillar He praises the courage of KingJuan Carlos and believes that even as his real powers are whittled by the new constitution being drafted by Parliament the King will serve for three or four years as the guarantor of the new democratic order Since Francos eemiselhere have been 115 political deaths in Spainincluding 63 by terrorists and 47 by the policebut MrCebrian recalls that there has been a tradition of political violence here since the civil war the rostwar reprisals that took perhaps 200000 lives a sputtering antiGovernment guerrilla movement that lasted until the early 1960s and official violence In the literature in history from a very young age he said one gets familiar with death in contrast to other cultures where one doesnt talk about it But I dont think that the Spanish people are very cruel or violentAnd the movement of terror has not yet been produced In San Sehastirinthe are killing policemen and they have just opened the new casino But the legacy of the civil war is a strong one It has left its imprint on all of us who did not live it And the editor says except for a small group of extreme leftists the truly progressive youth in this country has a holy terror f firearms Associated Press Francisco Franco and Prince

"From Rah‐Rah Cheerleader, to 'Soap's' creator",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/17/archives/from-rahrah-cheerleader-to-soaps-creator-on-her-way-to-europe-has.html,She was a cheerleader in high school and a straightA student and she had what was all in all a pretty normal Wetitchester County upbringing Her father Was an accountant her mother was a housewife and the members of her family were not weird at all Susan Harris says now The reason any of this matters is that the 36yearold Miss Harris is the creator writer and producer of the controversial primetime television series Soap which presents a comic but rather twisted view ofhe American family Or rather two uppermiddle class suburban American families the Campbells and the Tates In its first season on the air the show dealt comically with such themes as adultery murder homosexuality impotency sex change operations blackwhite relations and the Mafia causing the ABC television network to be deluged with nearly 56000 letters protesting the series both before and after it went on the air Perhaps as a result of the letters and protests from religious and homosexual groups 19 network affiliate stations banned the show Soap which wound up among the 15 highest rated television shows is now being shown in reruns at 1130 PM Mondays and Tuesdays on ABC until its new season debuts in September On Her Way to Eurone Miss Harris who was in New York the other day on her way to Europe with her 11yearold son Sam was asked over lunch at Sardis how someone from such a traditional middleclass background could come up with such an unorthodox show She giggled I think 1 got a little strange around the age of 18 she said referring to the days when she was Susan Spivak from Mount Vernon N Y I went away to college Cornell and suddenly this very traditional cheerleader became very tortured I began writing tortured poetry and standing on a bridge overlooking a gorge and feeling very tortured And of course loving every minute of it She Insisted however that Soap is not autobiographical In any way although theres probably a part of me in every character I guess there has fo be But very little of my life is in it And none of the characters are modeled after anyone I know Miss Harris added that Soaps director Jay Sandrich has often accused her of being like JessicTate the dingbat mother of the Tate clan who when the show ended was wrongly convicted of murdering her lover a tennis instructor named Peter Campbell I deny being like her Miss Harris said smiling although at times dont make a lot of sense either I often look at the world like a lovely B movie the way Jessica does As she spoke Miss Harris gave the impression of being much too shy to have created such a controversial show She spoke slowly and hesitantly staring at her salad in order to avoid eye contact Big Hollywoodstyle sunglasses were perched on top of her head her myopic eyes were the color of faded denim jeans and her twotone blond hair was worn in a Farrah FawcettMajors style Susan Harris says her childhood was traditional but she got a little strange around age 18 Miss Harris who wrote all of Soaps episodes last season she will have a cowriter this season named Jordan Crittendon said her method of working was simple I just sit down and write and it just comes to me She writes everything first in longhand she said then types it because I cant think and type Although there were some reports that Soap might not be renewed because of its controversial nature Miss Harris said she was always confident that it would Thats because Fred Pierce the president of ABC didnt know who killed Peter Campbell she said So he just had to pick it up Everybody wants to know who killed Peter Campbell My son Sam wantsto know His teacher and classmates would like to know It amazes me that people care I dont care Pause Impish grin Maybe its because I know who did it Besides writing every show Miss Harris also acted in two episodes playing Babette a prostitute She said she preferred the writing end mainly because acting made her a nervous wreck Miss Harris who studied English literature at both Cornell and New York University but never received her degree said her career as a television writer began one day about eightyears ago after her marriage to Berkeley Harris an actor broke up Wondering how she was going to support herself and her infant son she sat down and turned on the television set She was not impressed with what she saw I can do better than that she said to herself and began writing a script for the now defunct television series Then Came Bronson She said she chose that particular series because she had a friend who knew the creator and could persuade him to read her script Has Worked Steadlly Miss Harris sold the script for 4500 and has been writing steadily for television ever since Today she earns a lot of money she said refusing to specify how much There is something really obscene about that much money when people are going hungry Despite her new wealth she said she and her son still lived in a tiny tiny house without a swimming pool in Sherman Oaks Calif Her car however is a racy black Porsche Before Soap Miss Harris created two shortlived television comedy series Loves Me Loves Me Not and Fay She has also written for Maude including the controversial abortion episode and All in the Family Is she bitter about all the criticism that Soap received last summer even before it went on the air Im not bitter she replied evenly but I am somewhat disappointed Im disappointed in the press Something that could have been very dangerous started happening last summer pre censorship I would have expected more people to speak out about it but they didnt As to some critics complaints that Soaps humor is insensitive Miss Harris said To me humor is just the flip side of tragedy I think very often you want to make a point its much easier to do it in a comedy because its much less threatening Miss Harris said she disagreed with those people who blame Soap for the whole new spate of television shows that stress sex and sexual innuendos I think Charlies Angels broke the ground not Soap she said That was the first of the jiggly shows Aside from writing Miss Harris recent convert to physical fitness said she tries to run six or seven miles a day She also lifts weights  At my age Ive become a jockand she has toned her 5foot7inch body to a trim 125 pounds Socially she is reclusive she said preferring to shun Hollywood cocktail parties and the people they attract They all blow dry their brains out she said and its very hard for me make small talk with them I mean you go into their apartments and there are no books on the shelves Miss Harris said her next career goal was to write a novel or a play I dont think Id like to write a film she said It doesnt stay yours because they can get 14 people to rewrite you novel would be miae and a play would be mine just as Soap is mine Meanwhile what can Soap lovers expect in the fall She smiled secre tively as though she were about to say Tune in in September Then the words came flowing In the first episode well reveal Peter Campbells murderer she said Jodie the homosexual son does not go straight Burt and Mary Campbell will have their problems theyll all have their problems A criminal named Dutch will be introduced And there will be some marriages and some births under very unusual circumstances  and a lot of Insanity And then this former rahrah high school cheerleader from Westchester County flew off to Europe with her son Two of the controversial characters created by Susan Harris right are Burt played by Richard Mulligan and his stepson Jodie Billy Crystal
Court Orders New Jersey to Pay For Abortion for Medicaid Client,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/17/archives/new-jersey-pages-court-orders-new-jersey-to-pay-for-abortion-for.html,NEW BRUNSWICK June 16Despite a New Jersey law that permits the use of Medicaid funds for an abortion only if a womans life is in danger a Superior Court judge ordered the state today to pay for an abortion for a 24yearold Newark welfare recipient who fears that her child would be born deformed Judge David D Furman in issuing a temporary injunction against the law scheduled a hearing for next Friday on the broader issue of the laws constitutionality Todays ruling although limited to such questions as the Newark womans physical and mental conditions as a result of her pregnancy is expected nevertheless to become part of the accumulating legal record on the controversial issue of using publiclunds for abortions Judge Furman concluded after hearing arguments from both the state and lawyers for the plaintiffs that there was serious open question as to the legality of the New Jersey law Equities Are Overwhelming For the present however the judge decided that the danger to the womans health caused by her anxiety over having a deformed child as a result of her having trequired Xrays and medication for a back injury outweighed the danger to the state if the law was temporarily enjoined The woman identified only as EM said the had suffered a fall last March Citing affidavits from two physicans familiar with the womans condition and medical history and weighing what he said were the longrange physical condition of EM and the hazard to the fetus against the 180 to 200 the state would have to pay for the abortion Judge Furman said that the equities are overwhelming for granting the restraining order Michael Cole assistant state attorney general and chief of civil litigation said later that a decision on whether to appeal had not yet been made Emotional Stress Cited Joan Vermeulen the lawyer for EM and the New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization another plaintiff in the case said that EM planned to have the abortion as soon as possible at Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark where she has been undergoing medical treatment Miss Vermeulen a lawyer with the EssexNewark Legal Services Corporation said that EMs health was steadily deteriorating and that the likelihood that she would give birth to a deformed child has resulted in tremendous emotional stress EM who also has a 2yearold child receives 235 a month in public assistance Her lawyer said that on that income EM could not afford the 180 average cost of an early abortion procedure State Fears Precedent Mr Cole said there was no evidence that EM had tried to obtain the neces sary funds from private sources He also argued that if the Newark woman won in this case the state would face similar suits again and again and again Two affidavits from physicians who have been treating EM were introduced today One from Dr Kenneth A Marius EMs family physician said that his patient suffered from anxiety and depression as well as a worsening of chronic asthma since learning that her fetus could have been damaged by the radiation and medication she received for her back injury Dr Marius said he considered an abortion to be medically indicated and necessary in order to protect her health He estimated that his patient was in the 12th week of pregnancy Supreme Court Ruling A similar affidavit was submitted by Dr Paul Pedowitz who treated EM at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark The New Jersey Medicaid statute affecting abortion payments dates back to January 1977 but it did not go into effect until last summer Until then the law barring Medicaid payments for abortions unless the mothers life was endangered had been enjoined by an order by Judge George H Barlow of Federal District Court in Trenton After the United States Supreme Court ruled that in effect Medicaid payments could be made for medically necessary abortions and to end pregnancies caused by rape or incest but not for elective abortions Judge Barlow lifted his injunction and the present restrictions went into effect in August New Jersey has no clause in its statute relating to pregnancies caused by rape or incest Now pending before Judge Barlow is a motion by the state for a summary judgment upholding the constitutionality of the states Medicaid statute In addition to EM plaintiffs in the case before Judge Furman are Right to Choose a New Brunswickbased organization the New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization and Dr Edward S Milner Jr of Bridgeton
BILL BRADLEY for U.S Sector,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/18/archives/bill-bradley-for-us-senator-bradley.html,He had been a Princeton basketball allAmerican in the mid60s a goldmedal Olympian a New Yorker profile subject at the age of 21 a Rhodes scholar and for a decade an enigma wrapped in a New York Knick uniform And now he was representing himself as a politician But 12 days ago the voters of New Jersey were finally convinced that the real Bill Bradley had at last stood up As a candidate for the United States Senate in the June 6 Democratic primary he was a walkaway Bradley carried 20 of 21 counties and raked in more than 60 percent of the vote Bill Bradley is 34 So is Jeffrey Bell a conservative who upset fourterm incumbent Clifford Case in the Republican primary Bradley had never run for elective office neither had Bell Bradley has lived in New Jersey for four years Bell for less than two  making them newcomers by traditional political thinking Both ran against opponents backed to the hilt by party Organization pros and both won The states organizations Democratic and Republican are in for some heavyduty soul searching Come Novembers general election New Jerseys voters will have a clearcut ideological choice to make between two utterly new political forces and between two men who did it their way Bells was to dovetail his basic conservatism with an unrelenting call for a 30 percent cut in Federal income taxes A former aide to Ronald Reagan Bell became an overnight leader of the burgeoning taxpayers revolt a position hell continue to exploit in the general election campaign Case 74 obviously underestimated Bell in the primary the supposedly unbeatable liberal Republican hardly budged from Washington during the campaign which made Bell push all the harder Bell is a calm and confident man Midway through the primary with nobody paying much attention he said Ill beat any Democrat by a wider margin than Ill beat Case by Cases absence from the race should make things easier for Bradley but it may be New Jerseys turn this fall to prove that anything can still happen in politics Bradley expected to win his primary His effective grassroots candidacy was a blend of money fame and tight organization  and the determination hes brought to any game hes ever played Bill Bradley has never prepared himself to do anything but win Typical has been the way he crashcoursed his way into New Jerseys Democratic scene In the past four years he has done his homework on the issues and his legwork in the field He made endless rounds of political and civic clubs of fundraisers and charity telethons He cultivated local party leaders and campaigned for all kinds ofDemocratic candidates no matter how remote the district or how trifling the election He subsisted on creamed chicken and clammy hands he thrived on high visibility and low riskgiving others the benefit of his highly reflectable glory while jeopardizing nary a hair of his own political head Then not so suddenly last summer Bradley decided to lest himself by running for the Senate Bradley is not a squanderer Be it time money attention or affection he invests Carefully So now he felt it was time he saw a re turn on investment Going right after the Senate Well there are a number of reasons it wouldnt make sense to a lot of people But then Ive never done things that made sense to everybody The irony is he insisted all primary long that I do believe in paying dues and I think Ive paid mine My time so far has been well spent as an advocate  raising money for others helping them draw crowds going doortodoor with them I think the party is flexibleenough to accept a variety of ways of paying dues He certainly had to hope so New Jersey Democrats have always operated on a rigid system of machinepolitics dos and donts In this primary though Bradley was not to be the machines boy That favoredson status went to former state treasurer Richard Leone long a member of Democratic Gov Brendan Byrnes innermost circle But Bradley was the beneficiary ofsubstantial friction within some of the machines components namely the county Democratic organizations The spring of 78 produced a welter of shouting and pouting among some of the states party bosses Pledge makers broke up grudge bearers woke up alliances shifted settled and shifted again often because of Byrnes heavyhanded attempts to whip the locals into line The bickering showed at the polls Leone backed by a machine losing its power captured only 27 percent of the primary vote The fact that Bradley had little or ganizational backing in the primary didnt matter he dug with the other foot running a peopletopeople campaign that took advantage of his famous face and name He put in 18hour days working clubs malls factories just shaking hands saying hello getting a response and making orie back And there were paydirt fundraisers The Bradley primary kitty was a fat 600000 Even though he had little choice Bradley was patently comfortable with his grassroots approach He hammered at the ongoing shortcomings of machine candidates Theyve always painted themselves into corners they couldnt escape from and win From Day 1 Bradley said that candidates shouldnt be chosen just because theyve come from certain professions or have held certain offices Thats elitist Senatorial timber doesnt just grow in one part of the forest His voice would rise aggressively I am a private citizen who chose a different road to the United States Senate And I chose that road deliberately Pressed he amplifies Yes Basketball was a means to this end It gave me the time and opportunity to prepare for politics I chose it from the outset with this kind of jump in mind when it was over It was the right road then but it continues to be a toll road He spent the primary trying to show people he was not just another exjock casting about for an answer to Is there life after sport  spent it rather trying to show them hed put in years of productive brooding on the question Is there life before politics He has good reason to keep worrying about voters making that distinction because for so long he gave them no reason whatever to make it Millions recall he retired from the Knicks only last year his sport as he played it and he played it as if it were a means to no end but itself Bill Bradley was team basketball incarnate constant movement sparkling backdoor plays the purists touch with the jumper tenacious defense But he was not a oneonone hotshot he had only ordinary size and strength and he wasnt much of a rebounder his genuine stardom accrued from a parlay of natural skill and a resoluteness so fierce it was funny After a missed shot say or a pass a teammate hadnt seen Bradley would gallumph back upcourt stiffbacked neck veins distended scowling at the floor jabbering obscenities to himself Comical but just a precisionists instant analysis of a mechanical procedure gone amiss Bradley suffered foolishness no more gladly off the court than on Throughout his 10year tenure he kept his highflying personal standards in careful trim There was a sometimes glacial probity in his refusal to celebrate his own celebrity He was often projected as a kind of Christian paradigm  a young man to make the countrys mothers well up with pride to make the countrys fathers stand up a littlestraighter to make the countrys children mind their manners He rejected all that just as he declined the image of great white hope in what he knew was a black mans game He spurned endorsements of any kind even though his mere winning presence helped make pro basketball safe to play on Madison Avenue His intelligence was impressive but so in those days were his silences he yesnoed his way through many a postgame interview so he could go home and read Camus or Tolstoy He showed a Tsquare objectivity about everything He considered personal questions intrusive You must save your personality he once said for those you love and for your close friends So many reporters questions went unanswered others were refined in the cool and tidy tidal pools of Bradleys mind  and even then he sometimes amused himself by dodging those questions Some felt put off or put down while others were merely buffaloed For all however he remained an enigma And Bradley never went a month without hearing a variation of Yeah but whatre you going to do when you grow up He had the answer but he always ducked that one because he knew that he was still catching up at growing up Bradleys upbringing in Crystal City Mo was uppermiddleclass Presbyterian and rigid He was an only child programmed to become a gentleman My father insisted on manners and my mother on success Warren Bradley a wealthy bank president was a reticent man My mother figured you learned how to do things by taking lessons so I took them  dancing boxing French horn typing riding It was a reserved house highly structured Not strict in the sense of heavy discipline but there wasnt much time for loose easiness either It was always this lesson or that and schoolwork My father has always been a solid Republican He kept a picture of Hoover on the wall all through the Depression and he was an elector for Dewey in 48 My mother is apolitical but there were relatives who ran for county offices Local politicians were always in the house or were discussed at dinner so I was always aware of politics as a profession as something you could do I didnt see that my politics might be different from my fathers until I went to college Every winter the family went to Palm Beach Fla for three months I always felt like an outsider in both places says Bradley I wasnt really a part of either But from the sixth grade on he stayed behind in Crystal City spending the winters with relatives It was simple I wanted to play basketball so I told my parents I didnt want to go They werent encouraging about the gamemy father did not see me play until I was an eighth grader but that was OK I found that basketball was a place where I could discover things about myself Bradley discovered selfdiscipline and a nearscientific intensity He measured shooting lanes he memorized shot trajectories he stacked upfolding chairs to perfect his hook shot over the reach of taller players By the time I was 14 1 was selfmotivated Whatever raced inside of me was more demanding than any pressures from parents or teachers Or from girlfriends At 15 Bradley turned aside the playful advances of one young lady by telling her he was already dating  a basketball He laughs about it now but adds I had it straight early what I wanted to do At Princeton his basketball brilliance brought immediate national attention At first I talked and talked I was good copy But then it got unreasonably demanding I was honest with people explaining why I couldnt do X or Y or Z but theyd get hostile When he declined a speaking invitation at one church the minister accused him of being unChristian Classmate Mike Smith now a lawyer says Bradley was treated as a fully consummated human being which was ridiculous For one thing Bradley had never given much serious thought to serious thought 1 didnt do much reading as a kid Oh sure some of the childrens classics some of the Dr Doolittle books The Deerslayer things like that but nothing with much heft That didnt start until Princeton Maybe my coming late to it explains why it took but anyhow it did When the books came off the shelf they fell off It was pretty eclectic some of it from lit sylabuses some from friends suggestions or just by chance  somebody gave me Death of a Salesman and I was blown away But the winds blew hardest in his history courses One was taught by H H Wilson whod been attacked by McCarthy in the witch hunts of the 50s A lot of stuff I read under him  The Politics of Oil Eisenhowers speech on the militaryindustrial complex  outraged me The American people were getting screwed Id leave class and wander around campus in a fog Bradley was also aware of his own era I sat in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act was passed I was 19 I felt that something really important happened in that room that day that peoples lives could change for the better because of it It was an emotional time for me  civil rights the war And the personalities Goldwater Miller LeMay and Nixon King and Kennedy But Bradley could not enjoy this quite normal awakening in solitude So he starred in basketball majored in history and minored in posting No Entry signs around himself People would ask him about politics says Smith and by his junior year hed learned to say Well Im just a basketball player  Bradley reflects I figured I had my life to lead and it something had to give it was going to be the public attention At Oxford the public didnt give a damn so Rhodes scholar Bradley simply went about the business of being Bradley He read and wrote papers in European political and economic history and pursued his side reading His biggest discovery was Joseph Conrad His view of society as a fragile superstructure of orderliness over a massive network of darker human impulses really stopped me His drifters the chronic floaters made me think about myself made me see how important the stopdrift mechanisms are And I got into Camus After I read The Fall I went to Amsterdam to get a feel for the setting Tolstoy Dostoyevsky Mann they just became personal agents for me Through them I started defining my own values and their directions Well all right But Bradley relaxed too He raced cars played contact sports ate five meals a day and gained 30 pounds Mike Smith also a Rhodes scholar says Bradley didnt feel he had to protect himself anymore so he didnt For the first time in his life  I know I know poor little rich boy but its true he had fun It will come as a shock to most Bradleywatchers but the man has long had a keen sense of the ludicrous He can carry silly situations to logical absurdity Smith and Bradley regularly rode Smiths tiny motorbike through the streets of Oxford to morning tutorials We had to wear these idiotic gowns Smith says They had a sort of vest thing in front with weird little halfarms and they were loose in back On Bradley it really looked goofy It stopped just below his butt sticking out behind and it wasnt big enough around to begin with Now I felt a little embarrassed two big Americans on a scooter gowns flying but he  perched back there a giant even dumber looking than mehe loved it Hed laugh and wave and shout hello to people all the way Hes a lousy joke teller because hes never gone for formula stuff but he really dug being a ham He also enjoyed playing with the expectations of people who knew his background A fellow student once remarked how difficult a great big basketball player must be finding Oxfords low 141hcentury stone doorways WhamBill engaged him in a kind of instant Socratic dialogue on the virtues of just such architecture Bradley didnt know a damn thing about it hut he left t heat her guy goggleeyed Bradley once avoided an interview by stepping out of his dormitory window and going over an adjacent wall Says Smith He could have told the guy Look not today But he liked provoking people a little just to see their reactions Hell from the time he was 15 on he couldnt behave that way His own rules prevented it Hed never been just another guy clowning it up So he was making up for lost time He was playing Soon Bradley was playing again in earnest testing himself against the big boys back home Much was made of his 1967 entry into the National Basketball Association he joined the Knicks wrote columnist Robert Lipsyte On the wings of hype and certainly there were many who hoped the Ivy Leaguer with too much going for him would get firstdegree burns from the limelight But he had a sensible attitude Hedid some thinking about the boundaries of his new job I began to define my profession narrowly he says today You could get caught up in it try to be everything to everybody just because you were well known But that just accelerated things the wrongway made you bigger than you really were Ive always been fascinated by the American capacity to consume things and people Its in our literature our heritage the idea of unlimited growth and endless supply I knew the publicappetite was far bigger than any one person could feed anyhow so I felt I could engage people  talk to the press or fans sign autographs  or not just as anyone else can make those decisions I gave what I could and was confident enough not to worry about it after that If others saw that as being ultraprivate or arrogant well that was their perception I just felt I had to continue life at my own pace as much as possible With a contract that would bring him a half million dollars for four years work Bradleys pace was a little eccentric by NBA standards He did not play the standard roles or drive the standard Rolls His idea of a mens boutique was the nearest ArmyNavy store He used paperclips when cuff buttons gave out Teammates loved to needle his threadbare frugality His whole wardrobe couldnthave cost 200 they said shoes included and he bought his shoelaces one at d time the Dollar Bill nickname just meant he still had the first buck hed ever earned Bradleys apartment says one friend looked like a Holiday Inn room before the maid shows up Nothing new therefor most of his two years at Oxford Bradley had lived out of a large and appallingly messy suitcase even though Mike Smith carefully explained what bureaus were for But Bradley concentrated on what mattered to him playing basketball and quietly pursuing life beyond it That included marrying a young college teacher Ernestine Schlant He spent offseasons advising collegebound blacks working in prison and welfare reform and campaigning for the environmental movement One summer he worked in Washington for the Office of Economic Opportunity but found that some of his coworkers were a little too impressed with the baggage Id brought in from another area his celebrity status Bradley has always had a prickly awareness of the misuse of power As a ballplayer says Susan Thomases Bradleys campaign manager and also Princeton 65 Bill was concerned that his status could affect peoples decisions about things that had nothing to do with the game He felt the potential for political demagoguery was tremendous so he lay low Typical is Bradleys remark about his participation in an antiwar moratorium It was a quiet thing I didnt issue a press release Bradley squeezed as much out of his inseason mileage as anyone in professional sport In every city the Knicks hit he had easy access to bigname pols but mainly I called up people who were just starting to run for office pretty much my own age to see how they were going about it He also walked around talked around and observed In Houston say it wasnt just how the prison program was working out Id get different slants on it from some oilman at dinner and then from a guy in some crummy coffeeshop at midnight and both versions mattered Or in Seattle Id talk to a PhD who was suddenly driving a cab because he got axed in the Boeing shutdown I just went around does this sound funny  looking at America No not really If you didnt have to live with him When we were going on a road trip says former roommate Dave DeBusschere Bill would always be just coming from some meeting Papers everywhere In his bag would be maybe a change of shirts but that was it The rest was reports surveys the Congressional Record a serious novelNothing else Hed wind up borrowing my razor bumming my toothpaste But not my toothbrush He used his finger Bradley always typed up his ontheroad impressions In 1976 they became a book Life on the Run Obviously basketball gave Bradley the time the money and the liberty to follow his nose for politics Hed been on the scent periodically before he joined the Knicks but in his rookie year he was galvanized by the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy 1 remember how I felt  enraged powerless Didnt you And now 10 years later with the Watergate sleaziness in there too people are still frustrated still leery of the process Theyre still centered in on themselves on making their lives work on Ive got mine Introspections important and so is protecting whats dearest to you Ive been through that one myself But I never forgot that you can do things on a larger scale if you really set out to do them and if youre in a position to try Clifford Cases last hurrah The fourterm Senator makes an eleventhhour bid for support in the June 6 Republican primary Democrat Richard Leone ran a distant second to Bradley Said Bradley I think the party is flexible enough to accept a variety of ways of paying dues And I think Ive paid mine Bradleys eyes hold steady This commitment probably comes out of my religious upbringing I was raised a Presbyterian and became much more evangelical Ive always believed its ones job to serve ones calling My view of politics derives from that Other than that its hard to define its origin in me or to say why its hung on So no  he pauses a habit he has of waiting for words to come I guess theres no burning bush in my story But if basketball was Bradleys boon it continues to be a sometime bane I loved my game and Im proud of what I did in it But Ive wanted people to vote for my presence my touch my positions Ive wanted them to see that Im new and controlled by nobody and have a chance to do thingsbecause of that I dont want votes because people used to catch me on TV a couple of nights a week That couple of nights a week for 10 years is the reason the Bradley camp has been playing with the fire of credibility Their man is making a leap that could only happen in the mediadominated 70s when with the finality of hydroelectric conversion celebrity in one field can be abruptly channeled into another Of course his renown is a tremendous asset Basketball laughs Susan Thomases We think its terrific If Bill doesnt thats his problem And that is his problem He has very ambivalent feelings about it For Bradley the affair with the game is clearly over He has no second thoughts about the whirl he left behind Then the game mattered now it doesnt But the snag and he knows it is that the public cannot be expected to do the same kind of plug pulling in its own memory bank Bradley denies it but the fact is that he has run both on and from his own coattails That running contradiction is evident when he appears in school gyms After a political speech with no mention of basketball he sometimesgives in to the inevitable In his current road uniformdark red tie blue chambray shirt spiffy blue suit scruffy black shoes  he positions himself perhaps 20 feet from the basket He bounces a basketball a time or two crouches jumps shoots and these days makes about one shot in six The other difference is that he doesnt scowl In Life on the Run Bradley pondered [A celebritys] selfdetermination comes from external sources not from within Professional athletes are celebrities  fondled and excused praised and believed Only toward the end of their careers do the stars realize that their sense of identity is insufficient So the tactical quandary remains Yes he uses the likes of Jack Nicholson Dionne Warwick and Paul Simon to attract contributors because he knows well enough that in politics money raising is consciousness raising But he has done his quiet best to tie his candidacy to legitimate issues His stands on many issues are predictably moderateliberal Abortion is up to the woman and Medicaid should be available to her violent crime calls for swifter and stiffer sentencing but no capital punishment the United States should continue supplying arms to Israel and the PLO should be accepted into Middle East peace negotiations President Carters proposed 20 billion tax cut is too drastic and 10 percent of the annual Federal Government procurement budget should be directed to areas of high unemployment Bradleys pet projects also reflect his liberal leanings He wants for instance to be the guy pushing for massive Federal commitment to solar energy Its the only way out The technology exists now but its too expensive The reason moneys havent flowed for the mass production of solar gear is that the energy companies dont own the sun Were running out of our own fossil fuels and were getting priced out of others That guarantees inflation for good Solar is the commonsense answer Itll work and itll come because it has to Bradley considers the development of a cancer vaccine imperative We have an industrial society whose prosperity carries with it the production of carcinogens OK Do we identify all those carcinogens and eliminate them No Wed have to redesign our whole industrial sector The major thrust should be toward research for a vaccine thatll allow the bodys ownimmunological mechanisms the white blood cells to destroy cancer cells Were close but were not close enough while people are still dying of cancer of our own making He also wants a far sharper focus on the redevelopment of the nations inner cities Weve reached the endof the progression from core city to outer city to suburbia to exurbia and exexurbia Frontier is a spurious word but if we still have one its the inner city There has to be more Federal encouragement  investment tax incentives payroll tax credits government procurementbudgets geared to buying from innercity industry  to make them safe and usable again Theyre what weve got left Through all of this runs a cool appraisal of the fragility of modern life Its not a new concept not one that takes a visionary to grasp but it is one that few can address themselves to comfortably Bradley does seriously but without doomsday rhetoric He simply sees a need for America even the America of Crystal City a small cluster of houses tucked between two limestone bluffs on the Mississippi  to awake and sting itself into coping with dangers of our own making Hence his overall view  one that tries to be both realistic and visionary There are parts of our economy that arent going to be competitive much longer Weve got to develop new industries  in solar in pollution control  to make things that people here and abroad are going to need We have to reward those who take the risk in cranking up those innovations The traditional antagonisms of government vs private sector or Federal vs state vs local no longer lead to anything like solutions We have to set priorities thatll provide the necessary structures and cooperation want a piece of that action Athletes are celebrities  fondled and excused Only toward the end of their careers do they realize that their sense of identity is insufficient Given parts of his makeup Bradley is lucky to be as close as he is to that action His precisionist instincts thrived in the disciplined insularity of basketball He loved the small welllighted strip of wood and the palpable joys available in each of the games myriad compartments  the superb play the strong quarter the winning streak Even the mechanical sanctuary of jet travel became part of the platoon certainties he came to depend on So Yes the unpredictability of politics is tough Even political arena is a misnomer because it can get pretty shadowy out there You try to impose a rational structure where you can but its too human a thing too emotional for walltowall analysis You simply apply your core strengths to the parts you cant control Im used to being in front of 20000 people and knowing Im basicallyalone The premiums on selfknowledge on balance on the assurance you know what youredoing and why And then if you can tell yourself youll live through it anyway youre ready Bill Bradley has always zealously guarded his privacy a commodity that his biographer John McPhee says he reacts instinctively against losing Arid now hes upto his shoulder blades in politics But Bradley seems to thrive in crowds striding in and of course standing out  his 6foot5 frame carries precisely four pounds over its playing weight of 2l5 He is spontaneous smiling easily moving quickly gracefully There is remarkably little hesitancy or awkwardness in his physical contact with people Heads turn and turn again as he presses I he flesh He is sometimes surprised at but clearly likes the stir when he walks into a room the sidewalk ripples of recognition when he works a parade All of Bradleys TV reviews have inched up from clearly uncomfortable to less soit just about what youd expect of an ambitious young politician But this is Bradley remember the man who only drained his moats and lowered his drawbridges at whim And when he stops  someone has caught his eye or he theirs something happens in his face giving an onlooker a jolt of The face has not changed II is still this side of handsome still years away from character lines The face is deadstraight that old look so familiar to interviewers the paraderest graygreen eyes under their dormer brows waiting looking right into yours and conveying what  a flicker of boredom And the thumbnail to the lips maybe suppressing a smile of condescension No Bradley has simply been digesting a question a remark however germane however inane And now his face registers animates He leans forward gesturing and replies The other person a total stranger has been fully engaged Look says Bradley laughing 1 know what theyve always said Im stuffy or aloof or whatever But politics is what Ive wanted what Ive pointed for all along I construe it far more broadly than I did basketball Its a much bigger part of my whole existence So now the public doesnt threaten doesnt consume The thought nags that this is solipsism a calculated changing of the guardedness Sure they wear me out But you accept that Its part of the price you pay And if the fatigue becomes a source of nourishment as it should as it has then you pay it willingly I still have a core of privacy Everybody does and ought to But its smaller now so I cherish it my wife my child  I didnt see how this could ever be possible  more than ever The Bradleys live in an eightroom ranchstyle house in Denville Bradley owns considerable undeveloped property elsewhere 578 acres in Missouri 200 acres in Nova Scotia and 25 acres on the Greek island of Kyphnos His net worth is 159 million His wife Ernestine now a professor of German literature at Montclair State is a slim attractive woman with an Audrey Hepburn worrywaif face She has stayed in the background so far teaching and taking care of their 19monthold daughter because Bills his own spokesman She does not begrudge politics hold on Bradley  she has lived with it for four years  although part of her own pricepaying is considering herself lucky if we can be together to brush our teeth His 18hour days leave his retinue exhausted even bodyguarddriver John Spagnola a leaveofabsence Yale football player His battered white campaign Olds is his office There he eats usually junk food  and there he thinks He sits up front and between stops is utterly preoccupied reading left elbow on a makeshift lapboard left fingertips to forehead right thumb idly swiveling the cap of a pen No matter how far Bradley goes in politics this side of the campaigner probably wont change  hell never be one for tooling around on a campaign swing knees up against the dash sipping bourbon yukking it up with a earful of cronies But he does know others are there Sometimes without looking up Bradley will shift slightly and swing an arm around tothe back seat proferring a bag of cashews Its arrival is sudden accurate efficient He can still make the behindtheback pass The car is chockablock with paperwork Bradley is compulsive about being prepared Sometimes Bills the only guy on the face of the earth who reads all that stuff says campaign manager Thomases Hes paranoid that everybody else knows more than he does that theyve got important details he might miss That jibes with Bradleys pedagogical turn of mind but it is also an indicator that hes doing what any beginner does Try to look like anything but a rookie which is the reason that rookies always look like rookies Bradley is no exception and certain traits heighten the strain of striving to seem seamless He is a nonstop earnest man but some see his center of gravity as supercilious He also has an intensity that can be taken for rigidity In conversation he often ignores interjections but later on people are surprised to find that he was listening after all On one occasion talk had gone on to other things when Bradley suddenly returned to a question interpolated minutes earlier Did Byrnes backing Leone make me angry  He repeats the queryslowly musing Well yeah I did help Byrne get reelected last fall and I hoped hed stay neutral When he didnt it took a little chewing but I swallowed it Just as Im sure he can swallow my being the nominee Byrne has Jersey Democrats are closing ranks behind Bradley I That Bradley can pass a simple quiz in fence mending doesnt mean he is a fully developed political animal Nor does his successful defiance of the party machinery The same goes for his easy contact with people on the street  that theyre delighted when he stops to find out whats on their minds and are happily surprised to find he has something on his too All it means is that Bradley can cope with campaigning better than one might expect But hes no natural Bradleys TVdebate reviews have inched up from Clearly Uncomfortable to Less So he fidgets and has a voice that sounds as if filtered through tweed There is sometimes a recidivist jawmuscle twitch when he signs autographs but hes getting better at remembering to smile Patently hed be more comfortable in office than he has been in running for it like most candidates hed rather have his nocut contract right now so he could relax and get on with it Bradley has always been on to most of his own liabilities Of his first year in the NBA when he averaged a paltry eight points a game he observed T was a failure There is no lighter way to say it He cites even that capacity for selfdisengagement as a possible political minus Sometimes I think Id be a better candidate if I truly thought one political race was a full measure of my worth I want this more than anything I ever have but lifes a bigger continuum than that So theres this sense of detachment theres a part of me over there right now as were talking thats observing criticizing laughing Further with soft matteroffactness I know a lot of people see me as a stiff Maybe itd help if I were alittle more glib But Im not His longtime friend Robert Redford recently considered that point You know Im an easy laugh he said laughing And no Bill doesnt break me up all that often But how many politicians can you say that about In recent primaries New Jersey Democrats havent asked themselves that question theyve been addicted to the cynical laughter that comes with secondplace finishes So a Bradley wasnt a lock As one Shark River Hills Democrat put it this spring Well the knocks out on Bradley  hes honest I dont know whether Jersey can handle that Certainly the electorate had to see him as an odd one Here was an essentially private man who could have bought a fair chunk of Aruba and just called it quits And as another voter said Bradley cant be ego tripping  you can tell hes not much on spotlights and besides hes already had enough attention to last a peacock a lifetime The primary electorate saw all that Exballplayer or no they found him a genuinely upright man a comer whose time had come So they gave him his shot Whats intriguing is that while primaries are often personality contests Bradley won without showing much more than the tip of his ear His friends all insist for instance that hes still a great clown a grand man for slapstick Well what about that Isnt he going to need all his assets to win in November So how about a few beers at a Kiwanis steak fry say and cutting loose a little Tell you what Bradley said toward the end of the primary If I win Ill make some fancy formal speech sometime this summer  big hall maybe a thousand people  and when the applause has peaked and Im turning to go offstage Ill give em my Charlie Chaplin walk Its not half bad Getting up to take a phone call he demonstrates Hes right Its not II Ernestine Bradley a bride of one month watches a Knick game in February 1974
Practical Advice Has Not Worked Will Persuasion Work Better? The Epidemic of Teen‐Age Pregnancy A nurse Instructs unwed mothers‐to‐be about Occupation and contraception.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/18/archives/the-epidemic-of-teenage-pregnancy.html,WASHINGTON About one million teenage girls one in 10 between the ages of 15 and 19 get pregnant every year About 600000 actually bear children and childbirth often triggers consequences that cloud the rest of the mothers lives Teenage mothers are much more likely than their peers to drop out of school earn low wages have large families and wind up on welfare The impbrtance of the pregnancy epldemicwas spotlighted on Capitol Hill last week when the Senate Human Resources Committee held hearings on a Carter Administration proposal aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy and helping young girls to cope with motherhood Speaker after speaker echoed the view of Arthur A Campbell of the Center for Population Research The girl who has an illegitimate child at the age of 16 suddenly has 90 percent of her lifes script written for her Her life choices are few and most of them are bad The leadoff witness Secretary of Health Education and Welfare Joseph A Califano Jr called teenage pregnancy one of themost serious and complex social problems facing our nation today But he got a hostile reception from some Senators who oppose spending money on new social welfare programs The bill represents an attempt by the Carter Administration to fulfill a campaign pledge to provide alternatives to abortion which is strongly opposed by the President and by Mr Califano It would give 60 million to schools churches and clinics that devise demonstration programs In addition it would provide 18 million to extend Medicaid to pregnant women and another 64 million to expand existing programs such as family planning clinics and contraception research Many experts led by Planned Parenthood feel the bill is far too modest and places too much emphasis on the needs of young mothers rather thin on girls who want to prevent pregnancy As a serious alternative to abortion they say the bill is a hoax The two main causes of the pregnancy epidemic are increased sexual activity and failure to use birth control Most studies show that by age 16 more than 20 percent of all girls have had sex that figure approaches 50 percent by age 19 There just arent any supports for those who want to be virgins said Kristin A Moore of the Urban Institute It really is harder to say no Moreover a large proportion of those who say yes do not use contraceptives one study concluded that while 24 million sexually active teenagers do use adequate birth control methods another 17 million lack protection One reason for failure to use contraceptives is simple ignorance A second difficulty is psychological Gynecologists and others who counsel young people say that despite todays climate of sexual freedom many girls remain deeply ambivalent about sex They hesitate to ask for information and may not use birth control even if they know how because theydont like admitting to others or even to themselves that they intend to have intercourse A third factor is that about onefourth of teenage mothers actually wanted to get pregnant In a confusing world a baby can seem to offer what a lonely girl lacks most purpose in life and someone who loves her No matter why teenage girls get pregnant the fm pact is almost always devastating Girls in their teens experience more difficult pregnancies and produce more frail or sick children Between onehalf and threequarters of girls who conceive In high school never graduate and the younger a girl is when her first baby is born the more likely her family is to wind up in poverty Marriage seldom helps since three out of five teenagers who marry after getting pregnant are divorced within six years Almost no problem is more staggering because it seems to touch on all those other problems from welfare dependency to teenage unemployment said one Administration official Two general solutions have been proposed Planned Parenthood and other professional groups advocate more of what is already being offered more sex education more clinics more research The second approach comes from the Administration which takes the view that providing birth control Is not enough We want to add a moral dimension to sex education said Peter H Schuck who heads the teenage pregnancy task force at the Department of Health Education and Welfare Kids hunger for moral guidance and the purely clinical approach is not very effective This view is heavily influenced by the religious convictions of President Carter a southern Baptist and of Mr Califano a Roman Catholic It implies that moral guidance would persuade at least some youngsters to abstain from sex  the most effective of all birth control methods The two approaches are not mutually exclusive but since funds are scarce there is competition among advocates of different policies Critics of the Carter plan are uncomfortable with its moralistic overtones and feel it ignores the basic task protecting teenagers who are engaging in sexual intercourse Administration officials retort that critics particularly Planned Parenthood have a vested lnterest in the current system Supporters of both approaches worry that anti abortion forces in Congress will try to amend the bill to ban use of Federal funds for counselling teenagers about abortion Such a rider could do considerable damage since good counselling services include abortion as one option Another potential obstacle to the bill is the fact that teenage pregnancy like abortion involves the question of sex and that makes many legislators uncom fortable The whole idea we run into is that women should not be sexually active said Carolyn Bode of the Womens Lobby a feminist organization here Even if the legislation does not pass this year discussion of it has helped focus public attention on the issue Its not just bad girls from ghetto families who become pregnant noted one Administration official When you talk about one in every ten youre talking about the kid down the block as well Steven V Roberts is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times Source National Center for Health StaristiCl
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/18/archives/the-nation-as-california-went-so-goes-the-rest-of-the-nation.html,Living with Proposition 13 has proved more difficult than voting for it Californians still were not sure last week if their ballotbox decision to reduce property taxes by 7 billion and limit future increases would mean a acute and widespread dislocations b manageable inconveniences or as conservative economists predict c an opportunity for economic boom Pulsations from the referendum were felt by government officials well beyond California and they tended to be measured in ways that suited individual purposes President Carter interpreted them as affirming his campaign to hold down the Federal budget to combat inflation lie and his budget advisers last week identified legislation they considered too rust lv and Mr Carter singled Out for a possible veto a public works bill containing what he considers extravagant water projects Presumably the House was studying the same It axpayer mood but lit drew a different conclusion andvoted money for eight water projects killed by the President in 1977 There were other manifestations of the anti spirit An Illinois Senate committee approved a circuitbreaker plan already passed by the state House of Representatives to give rebates to anyone earning 30000 or less whose property tax exceeds 35 percent of his income But California is the anvil and what is forged there will go far to determine national consequences Governments large and small prepared for the worst when the new fiscal year starts July 1 To save 48 million the Los Angeles schools system canceled summer classes for 340000 youngsters and adults Marin County told 400 emloyces they probably had lost their jobs Because of matching requirements and other rules the state also stood to lose as much as 52 billion in Federal aid and Mr Carter warned that he had no means nor inclination to give special help One idea in California is for a new referendum in November that would provide less drastic tax reductions and make homeowners the main beneficiaries not commerical propety owners as under Proposition 13 But instant relief will have to comefrom the state which as a result of surpluses and budget cuts made last week has up to 6 billion available Gov Edmund G Brown Jr wants to spend it all now and worry later about longrange answers To help him he has taken on as an adviser Edward R liamilton former Mayor John V Lindsays fiscal specialist in New York City If only because his solution is the easiest the Governor should prevail in the Legislature even though many there believe it means only deferred pain Story on the referendums ripple effects Page 4 Right AboutFace Helps in Primaries In politics as in basketball it helps to be able to go to your right Gov David Pryor a leader of the progressivereform movement in once staunchly conservative Arkansas learned that lesson six years ago when Senator John L McClellan successfully used the tactic against him in a Democratic primary Last week Mr Pryor applied his experience to win a primary runoff for the Senate vacancy created by Mr McClellans death He attacked his opponent and fellow progressive Representative Jim Guy Tucker as overly friendly to labor and Northern liberals and did it convincingly enough to overcome charges that his campaign manager intervened improperly with a state agency for a politically powerful utility owner Another candidate listing rightward to advantage was Maines attorney general Joseph F Brennan a onetime liberal who won last weeks Democratic gubernatorial primary by adopting among other things hard line against Indian land claims But both he and his Republican opporent Linwood E Palmer Jr a conservative state legislator could lose in November Maine is the only state with an Independent Governor James B Longley who is stepping down three independents are in the race Abortion Impasse Looms Once More Even after learning the lessons of history some are condemned to repeat it Among them is the House of Representatives which last week virtually guaranteed a revival of last years sixmonth battle with the Senate over Federal funding of abortions Antiabortion feelings run high in the House reflecting individual consciences pressure from right to life groups and the need for representatives to run for reelection every two years That goes far to explain why Congress last year held hostage appropriations for the Departments of Labor and Health Education and Welfare while it debated the conditions Medicaid payments for abortions In 1977 the House authorized abort ions only if the mothers life would be endangered while the Senate favored language permitting many exceptions The final compromise added cases in which the mother was the victim of rapeor incest or in which two doctors agreed that childbirth would creat severe physical troubles for her Last week the appropriations bill for the two executive departments was again used in the House to make political point  in fact several 400 million was trimmed from the HEV budget reflecting the new antispending mood But abortion remained a dominant issue The legislators rejected language similar to the 1977 compromise 212 to 198 then voted foressentially the same restrictive position originally adopted last year Senate leaders predicted their response would be an abortion attitude at least as permissive as last years Bell Loses Plea On Informer List It seemed incongruous but the tiny Socialist Workers Party had the chief law enforcement official of the United States backed into a corner last week Attorny Gerneral Griffin B Bell believes it would be damaging to future cases inolving informants to turn over the Federal Bureau of Investigations files on 18 such persons who infiltrated the Socialist Workers over to the party But last year a Federal judge in New York presiding over the partys 10 million suit against the Justice Department for ha rrassment breaking and entering and  other civil rights violations said Mr Bell had to give the party the documents Last week the United States Supreme Court refused to review the lower courts order It was a technical ruling but crucial Now the only way Mr Bell may be able to get the High Court to review his opinion on the merits may be to permit himself to he cited for contempt of court for refusing to comply For Mr Bell a former judge himself in Georgia that would be particularly hard According to the Justice Department he would be the first Attorney General of the United States to be so cited Even Mr Bells appeal to the Supreme Court was designed to avoid contempt citation After an appeals court upheld Judge Thomas P Greisas order the Justice Department asked that the Attorney General be pirmitted to seek a review of the decision without first going throughthe motions of refusing to produce the names of the informers Mr Bells current proposals are that Judge Griesa certify the question  in effect bounce up to a higher court  his right to refuse or alternatively that the trial proceed without identification of the informants Both seem unlikely Theyre Battling Over Bella Again Fairly or not on any given issue Bella S Abzug becomes the issue She can be brusque and unyielding and opponents often focus not on what she says but the way she says it a habit that brings charges of sexism from Abzug supporters The pattern holds reports last week showed Soon President Carter is expected to name the former representative from Manhattan as an unpaid cochairman of a new National Advisory Committee for Women an outgrowth of last Novembers womens conference in Houston  apparently over objections from his own family Some critics regard the creation of the committee as a way of giving Mrs Abzug a Federal podium The Presidents relatives are said to worry more about the consequences of her perceived abrasivess With ratification of the

"Top New York State Democratic Candidates, Including Carey, Face Possible Challenges in Primaries",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/18/archives/top-new-york-state-democratic-candidates-including-carey-face.html,While the Republican state ticket began campaigning and fundraising for the general election in November three of the four designated Democratic statewide candidates including Governor Carey himself today still faced possible primary campaigns through the summer One Democratic primary contest was certain gnd there was general agreement that it would be hotly contested Borough President Robert Abrams of the Bronx who is the Attorney General designee of the Democratic State Committee faces a potentially strong challenge from an upstate womanM Dolores Denman who resigned a 52000 Appellate Division judgeship Friday to affirm in effect that she was in the primary to stay Still in the wings is Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak who said last night that she had not ruled out a race against Governor Carey and that she was assessing the situation Last Monday she withdrew suddenly from the Democratic ticket charging that the Governor was inaccessible and unwilling to fulfill his obligations of office I am simply saying that its a very real option she said in an interview before appearing at a dinner in her honor given by the Radio City Rockettes Miss Krupsak said she had been getting numerous letters and calls from supporters and wellwishers be prepared to go the petition route if it should come to thatshould that be the end result of the current period of evaluation and thinking Miss Krupsak added Secretary of State Mario M Cuomo a friend of the Governors replaced her on the Democratic ticket and at the moment appears to be the only one of the four statewide Democratic candidates assured of nomination without a primary Two other DemocratsState Senator Jeremiah B Bloom and Stephen Berger a former State Social Services Commissionerare threatening to challenge respectively the Governor and the Democratic State Committee designee for State Comptroller Harrison J Goldin who is now New York City Comptroller Both Mr Bloom and Mr Berger failed to win any substantial support at the State Committee designating meeting last week and must now collect 20000 signatures of enrolled Democrats throughout the state on designating petitions by midJuly to qualifyfor the Sept 12 primary Miss Krupsak would also have to collect 20000 signatures to qualify for either the primary or to run as an independent Candidate in the general election if she decides to run Even though it was evident that the Governor had encouraged Mrs Denmans candidacy a Carey spokesman said the Governor would remain neutral in the Attorney General or any other primary contest While the Democrats hold their breath the Republican state ticket headed by Perry B Duryea the Assembly minority leader and Representative Bruce Caputo his running mate for Lieutenant Governor will begin a symbolic threeday swing through the state this evening The other members of the GOP ticket are Edward V Regan the Erie County Executive who is the Comptroller candidate and Michael Roth a Westchester County lawyer the Attorney General candidate The Republicans according to Duryea campaign aides will emphasize three basic issues in their campaign against the Governorwhat they refer to as the pocketbook crisis of high state taxes and a sluggish economy the cringe crisis including the question of capital punishment and the leadership crisis involving the argument that the Governor is indifferent inaccessible and a poor administrator The Duryea team will concentrate its efforts on turning out traditional GOP majorities on Long Island and upstate while trying to soften likely Democratic charges that Mr Duryea is antiNew York City because of his initial opposition to the states efforts to save New York City from bankruptcy Four years ago the Governor won by the highest plurality in a gubernatorial election in 32 years He won three of the four New York City suburban countieslosing only Westchester the home county of his opponent Malcolm Wilson He even won a majority in the 53 upstate counties normally Republican bastions The Republican ticket is heavily suburbanoriented with three of the four candidates from the suburbs and Mr Regan from upstate Mr Roth was selected after Mr Duryea was unable to come up with a suitable New York City Jewish Republican to balance the ticket Mr Roth was born in New York City but lives in Westchester Even Republicans concede that at the moment he is the weakest link on the GOP ticket While the GOP ticket is suburbanoriented the Democratic slate could be all New York City residentsa development that prompted Mrs Denmans challenge with at least the implied encouragement of Governor Carey and this advisers who are concerned about the lack of a woman and an upstater on the ticket since Miss Krupsak dropped out Mrs Denman is expected to emphasize the crime issue including her support of the death penaltywhich Mr Abrams and the rest of the Democratic slate opposes Mr Abrams has been emphasizing the Attorney Generals role as a consumer advocate Governor Carey tipped off his strategy against Mr Duryea in several speeches last week He will emphasize his record in slowing the rate of state expenditures and in cuttimg taxes and this efforts to stave off bankruptcy for New York City and several upstate and suburban cities and school districts The Governor according to campaign aides will attempt to make the best of his controversial stands against the death penalty and for Medicaidfinanced abortions by arguing that he is a man of conscience and courage He will also attempt to identify Mr Duryea with the previous 16 years of the Rockefeller administration in which budgets and taxes mushroomed Mr Duryea will attempt to detach himself from that record by contending that he forced 750 million in cuts in the 197172 budget of Gov Nelson A Rockefeller Both sides plan major advertising campaigns with Mr Duryea having already spent 400000 for a monthlong television campaign to build up hisstatewide identification The Duryea commercials ended last Thursday and will not resume until the fall Mr Carey also had a token advertising campaign in the last 10 days and does not plan any extensive advertising until the fall unless he faces a primary challenge The Carey forces say they will budget about 35 million for the campaign while Mr Duryea hopes to raise 45 including the 400000 already spent The New York TimesD Gorton The leaders of the Democratic ticket for state offices

U.S. Family Conference Delayed Amid Disputes and Resignations,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/19/archives/us-family-conference-delayed-amid-disputes-and-resignations.html,The White House Conference on Famlliesonce seemingly the simplest of President Carters campaign promises to keep but recently mired in controversy rumor and suspicionhas been postponed from December 1979 to 1981 In announcing the postponement Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare cited the resignations of the conference chairman Wilbur Cohen Dean of the School of Education at the University of Michigan and himself a former HEW Secretary and of Patsy Fleming Mr Califanos choice for its executive secretary Mrs Fleming whose designation had been announced only five weeks earlier left because she objected to Mr Califanos insistence that she serve with a codirector Appointment Was a Surprise Mr Cohen to whom HEW officials had expected to delegate very substantial responsibility resigned because he had developed serious health problems Though his departure caused a major loss of momentum it was Mrs Flemings appointment and the cIrcumsLances of her subsequent withdrawal that led to sharp controversy among the groups that had begun planning for their own participation and had been casting about for ways to work with the Administration in preparing for their conference Mrs Fleming who began in the Carter Administration as a special assistant to Secretary Califano and had previously worked on the staffs of the House Rules Committee and Education and Labor Committeee is black and a divorced mother of three teenage sons Sources on Capitol Hill familiar with the situation and in groups who were to participate in the conference said that they were surprised when Mr Califano chose Mrs Fleming to head the conference staff because her name had never been on any of the candidate lists HEW officials had discussed with interested parties prior to the appointment According to Evelyn Moore director of the National Black Child Development Institute Mrs Fleming had not been the candidate of the coalition of black groups working on the conference Though involved groups and Government officials generally praised Mrs Flemings performance during her briet tenure her appointment was sharply criticized by the Rev Andrew Greeley a Roman Catholic priest who writes a syndicated newspaper

CUTS IN ES. SPENDING UNEDATCONFERENCE OF NATION'S MAYORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/19/archives/new-jersey-pages-cuts-in-us-spending-urged-at-conference-of-nations.html,ATLANTA June 18  Mayor after mayor took the microphone today at a session of the United States Conference of Mayors here to demand in a departure from tradition that the Federal Government soend less rather than more The conference having lobbied for years for expanded Federal urban aid and costly new social programs has been thrown into confusion by the recent California vote to slash property taxes The Conference of Mayors must get squarely behind the President and curb inflation said Mayor Lila Cockrell of San Antonio Its about time the Federal Government tighten its belt Mayor Robert J Quirk of Cuyahoga Falls Ohio said in agreement Foreign Aid Bill Affected The mayors were not atone in their concern Supporters of a foreign aid bill scheduled for debate this week expressed a fear that the House obsessed with the message froin taxpayers embodied in Californias Proposition 13 might slash appropriations for the World Bank and for other international financial institutions Page A4 The California action known as the JarvisGann amendment which may encourage similar moves in other states has underscored the complexities ambiguities and ironies of the long lovehate relationship between city governments and Washington They became apparent this morning when some 200 local officials jammed into a meeting room in Atlanta to hear a panel of municipal experts advise them on coping with tax revolts The revolt many mayors said was not against them but against inflation and Federal and state governments were the chief culprits The Federal Government and the states had better take notice that they are the target of revolt said Mayor Arnold I Rue of Stockton Calif Upsetting Usual Asumptions There was some squirming however when Wayne F Anderson executive director of the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations pointed out that the fastest growing Federal expense has been aid to local governments Such aid has increased from 7 billion to 80 billion in less than two decades Moreover he said city aid makes up about half of the pontion of the Federal budget that is subject to trimming There is no small irony in the mayors call for Federal spending restraints for the mayors were expecting to push hard been on any of the candidate lists HEW officials had discussed with interested parties prior to the appointment According to Evelyn Moore director of the National Black Child Development Institute Mrs Fleming had not been the candidate of the coalition of black groups working on the conference Though involved groups and Government officials generally praised Mrs Flemings performance during her briet tenure her appointment was sharply criticized by the Rev Andrew Greeley a Roman Catholic priest who writes a syndicated newspaper column on the ground that it was

Anti‐Abortionists' Impact Is Felt In Elections Across the Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/20/archives/antiabortionists-impact-is-felt-in-elections-across-the-nation.html,IOWA CITY June 17State Senator Minnette Doderer a leading figure in Iowa politics was narrowly and unexpectedly defeated June 6 in the Democratic primary election for Lieutenant Governor It was the RighttoLifers she said later They won every race they were in I was their No 1 enemy and their peopie won The antiabortion movement an impassioned singleminded minority in communities throughout the United States has been showing a surprising impact in recent months Antiabortion leaders have mastered singleissue politics in a number of places so that they are able to defeat opponents or extract pledges of support from candidates even though the vast majority say in public opinion polls that their choice of a candidate does not depend on the abortion issue They accomplish this by bringing out their supporters in full strength in elections in which overall voter participation is light Last Tuesday in league with fiscal conservatives they were able to overcome strong effort by the Democratic le dership in the House of Representatives to adopt last years compromise language on Federal financing of abortions in the Appropriations bill for the Department of Health Education and Welfare The leadership amendment was defeated 212 to 198 and it appeared the fight would drag on through the Congressional campaigns a prospect that the leaders of the drive against abortion tried to avoid Antiabortionists

against abortion clinics for which the leaders ceny responsibilitj An abortion clinic here for example was firebombed after it had been repeatedly picketed by Iowans opposed to its existence Meanwhile various legal restrictions against using government financing for performing abortions had taken hold in a number of states making it difficult for poor women to obtain abortions The issue is having a

intellectual gymnastics are required to defend any political position on it The Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 in 1973 that abortions in the first three months of pregnancy were legal and are between a woman and her physician but last year it held that the government was under no obligation to pay for abortions for poor women It was the latter ruling resulting in fund cutoffs from the Federal to thelocal levels that has been the basis of controversy in recent months The Current Campaigns On June 7 the Life Amendment Political Action Committee Inc one of the groups organized in Washington to pul money and other resources into the antiabortion movement contended that they had won victories in primaries held the day before in New Jersey Virginia South Dakota and Iowa The contentions were dubious because In some of the elections voters did not know what position the candidates had taken on abortion In one of the races cited Senator Clifford P Case Republican of New Jersey was defeated by a conservative challenger Jeffrey K Bell who used a range of issues against the moderate incumbent An examination of the situation in Iowa known for clean competitive politics shows what is at work A number of candidates who publicly oppose abortions were nominated in both political parties including former Lieut Gov Roger Jepsen a conservative Republican who will oppose United States Senator Dick Clark who supports free choice in the general election At the center of the antiabortion campaign is a state political action committee ProLife Action Council headed by Carolyn Thompson a Roman Catholic and registered nurse who has long been active in the National Right to Life Committee She said in an interview at her Des Moines home that volunteers working through 40 chapters throughout the state conducted a wide telephone survey of registered voters to determine their stand on the abortion issue Then shortly before the primary the council mailed 60000 pamphlets to those who had expressed a strong feeling against abortion Marked Over in Red Ink The pamphlet carried a picture of an unborn child sucking its thumb and read This little guy wants YOU to vote in the June 6 primary The position of can didates in the Federal state and legisla tive races in which there was a difference of opinion were identified In the Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor for example Minnette Doderers name was marked over in red ink As the leading proabortionist in the Iowa Legislature she has actively opposed all prolife legislation the pam phlet said Democrats were urged to vote instead for her opponent State Senator Bill Palmer of Des Moines who successfully fought to restrict abortions paid with your tax dollars Then came the key to the campaign Your vote in the primary election on Tuesday June 6 will have the impact of 10 votes or more since it is expected that less than 10 percent of the eligible voters will go to the polls Dont pass up this unique chance you have to speak out loud and clear for pro life Sure enough there was a light turnout even though it exceeded 10 percent Not quite 17 percent of the states 1546691 registered voters participated There was little public awareness of what Mrs Thompson and her volunteers were doing She said she had rarely spoken to reporters It Is difficult however to assess the overall effectiveness of the councils campaign Similar campaigns were conducted an other issues mostly from the conservative side and i as a result conservatives generally won This was underscored when Mrs Thompson showed up with a group of women at a victory rally for Mr Jepsen who will oppose Senator Clark and said Were all Democrats but were crossing over this fall Iowa is not without its activists on the other side It has some strong feminist groups supporting free choice But unlike their opponents they are concerned with a wide range of issues not just abortion Mrs Doderer said that little money or effort was given on her behalf to combat the Thompson campaign Leaders of the National Abortion Rights Action League whose political action committee is putting 100000 into campaigns for candidates who support free choice said that they do not believe the abortion issue has been crucial in deciding elections this year in some states there is no indication of its having any effect at all However Mrs Doderer was convinced by the statistics that her loss was caused by the RighttoLife campaign In areas with a heavy Catholic population where the pamphlets were distributed in large numbers she lost enough votes to give the nomination to her opponent She was embittered by the tactics She said in an interview that she had asked the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the legality of the use of the pamphlets by an organization exempt from Federal tax She also said that she resented being branded a proabortionist I am not for abortion she said That is like saying you are for automobile wrecks I am against government control and that is what they want We have never gotten any help from them in car ing for children after they are born They do not care about that The Legal Impact The movement which consists of a proliferation of national and local organizations including the Roman Catholic Church has been active in a number of areas other than elections In California one of 17 states that has continued to finance abortions for the poor from state money despite Federal restrictions antiabortion leaders said the new constitutional amendment drastically reducing property taxes there would help assure their winning a fight already under way to discontinue state help for abortions Id be surprised if the Legislature said we have funding for abortions when we are cutting everywhere else said David Roberti the Senate majority leader a Democrat of Hollywood and an antiabortion leader In Tennessee the Legislature enacted this year several laws sponsored by the antiabortion forces One would require that the attending physician must instruct every woman applying for an abortion on its likely physical and mental consequences and that a twoday period must elapse between the instruction and the operation Mrs Hilda Kilgore executive director of the Planned Parenthood Center in Nashville said she expected the law to have a chilling effect on women seeking abortions and would overburden physicians because such instruction is now being performed by lay counsellors In Arizona the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors put into effect rules that have practically eliminated free abortions in the Phoenix area In addition to restricting public financing under the Supreme Court ruling the board stioulated that it be able to review the files of women receiving abortions In some states the antiabortion forces have been defeated In New York for example they lost in Albany in an effort to push through a bill similar to the one passed in Illinois but now under court reviewto prohibit abortions for minors under the age of 18 unless parental consent has been provided Effects of Federal Law There has been a controversy regarding the effectiveness of the Federal law the compromise enacted last year on restricting abortions for the poor The law permits the use of Federal funds only when the womans life is endangered when the woman would receive severe damage by carrying the child to term or when the woman had been a victim of rape or incest Fourteen states pay for abortions under the Federal restrictions mostly with Federal funds 17 states including New York and the District of Columbia pay with their own funds with little or no restrictions almost as much as they did before the latest Supreme Court ruling However some of these including Iowa have adopted at least Federal restrictions that will go into effect soon Fifteen states including New Jersey and Connecticut pay only when a womans life is in danger and three states pay only when her life is endangered or there has been rape or incest One state Arizona leaves payment for abortions up to the counties Statistics have been slowly coming in but figures from two states gathered by Planned Parenthood indicate the trend In Arkansas about 500 abortions were performed at public expense before restrictions identical to that of the Federal law went into effect In a five month period thereafter there were only five In South Carolina publicly financed abortions fell from 5400 in one year to 14 in the nine months following adoption of the Federal standards In Idaho where a highly restrictive state law against publicly financed abortions is under court review the antiabortion forces contended that they had success even while the law was under challenge Dick Waters of Boise legislative coordinator for the Idaho RighttoLife groups said Weve cut the number of Medicaid abortions in Idaho from 410 in 1976 to 114 last year and three so far this year

The Spring Abortion Rite,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/20/archives/the-spring-abortion-rite.html,Congress seems to be perfecting a sad spring rite in which the members magisterially decide which of the nations poor women shall be allowed Federal abortion funds The House voted a stringent limit this week that would fund abortions Only for those whose lives are actually endangered by a pregnancy The Senate is expected to be more lenient offering help to those whose physicians certify that the procedure is medically necessary Eventually after weeks or even months of bitter bargaining the two houses will compromise somewhere in the vicinity of last years accommodation and restrict funds to those women who have suffered enough to satisfy Congress that they are deserving That will probably mean victims of rapeand incest women with serious health problems due to pregnancy including those who would die without an abortion The struggle in Congress only reflects a deep division in the country between competing moral claims What is sad about the endless controversy is that there is another claim and it is being denied Abortion is legal for those who can afford it But what of the poorest women who cannot afford it without Medicaid funds The stringent rules likely to emanate from Congress will make it harder for them to end unwanted pregnancies and result in unwanted children The right to be considered here is the one that was guaranteed by the Supreme Court to every womanthe right to an abortion should she want one during the first three months of pregnancy Through this Medicaid legislation Congress is effectively denying that right to the poor

Teen‐Agers on Sex: Confusion Is Clear,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/21/archives/teenagers-on-sex-confusion-is-clear-teenagers-on-sex-confusion-is.html,ATLANTA June 20  Seventeenyearold Charles W from North Carolina  or Charmin Chuck as he introduced himself during the icebreaking session  felt the pill was 90 percent effective as a means of birth control but he had some reservations Now you know the spare smiling black youngster said a woman can leave her dude now and go with somebody elseshes on the pill Lillian H 17 of Philadelphia bridied a bit but agreed Just because woman can take the pill she can make love to anybody but that doesnt mean she will but anybody who takes the pill helps her man and herself too Across the hall in another cubicle a pudgy 14yearold from a small town in South Georgia found the whole thing disconcerting and busily looked the other way while a determined Unitarian Church counselor sorted through a pile of contraceptive devices arrayed in her lap and discussed each in turn how to use it its effectiveness and cost Well the girl said when it was all over why do it in the first place Such was a modest sampling of some of the disparate and often conflicting views that emerged among teenagers grappling with problems of their own emergent sexuality at the first national teenage health conference which was sponsored by Emory University and held here yesterday and today Titled Whats Happening the conference attracted 1200 teenagers and 500 adult counselors health professionals and exhibitors to the World Congress Center to discuss problems often as baffling to grownups as to children sexual decisions contraception whether to use it and what kind venereal disease rape unwanted pregnan adoption abortion and marriage Interspersed was instruction on breast and pelvic examination sexual roles and responsibilities the role of alcohol and sex and getting to know your own bod Approaches ranged from graphically clinical to trendy to coy Besides health professionals speakers included retired baseball star Hank Aaron and the Rev Jesse Jackson the charismatic civil rights leader who stirred up gospel fervor with chants like I am a man I will produce I will protect I will provide The teenagers  some of whom paid their own expenses some of whom were sponsored by family planning groups around the country  also viewed slide presentations psychodramas exhibits and films on the gamut of teenage sexuality and attendant problems  At the core of the conference werethe alarming trends in teenage pregnancy among them the following More than a million teenagers from 15 to 19 become pregnant each year and another 30000 under 15 10 percent of American teenagers  become pregnant each year and 6 percent give birth Eleven million teenage boys and girls are sexually active and only a million are enrolled in family planning clinics Of the one million pregnancies 28 percent result in births conceived after marriage 10 percent result in births conceived prior to marriage 21 percent result in outofwedlock births  27 percent terminate in induced abortion 14 percent terminate in miscarriage We have babies having babies said Clarence Cook program administrator for the Grady HospitalEmory University Family Planning Program We have had 10yearolds go full term have the baby You cant imagine the difficulty this creates in terms of health problems alone he said Infant mortality among children born to mothers under 15 is double the average and the child is 17 times more likely to be retarded or have cerebral palsy The social toll is also enormous three of five teenage marriages end in divorce within three years a third of all abortions are among teenagers twothirds of all teenage pregnancies and half of all teenage births are unintended  But while the problems were clear the approaches to solution were not The central theme of the conference was that teenagers should make their own decisions about sexual activity with due regard to safeguards consequences and alternatives But reflecting national attitudes toward sex education the program was a bit schizophrenic At the same time that teenage girls were being told they need not yield to sexual demands to be popular but should not feel guilty about contraception if they did they were elsewhere being handed religious pamphlets condemning premarital sex as sinful and warning that venereal disease is Gods curse on those who violate his sex laws and dictating that the male is master of the house Less patently contradictory but still modestly confusing was the attempt to reconcile admonitions to abstinence  the only 100 percent safe way is to not do it  with efforts to convince sexually active teenagers not to be afraid to admit to themselves what they were doing and to take precautions Would you go into a drugstore in South Georgia to buy a contraceptive one youngster asked He got 10 nos In the same group the moderator who tried to lead the teenagers into an acceptance of the possibility of premarital sex was repeatedly met with variations of You dont need to know about that if you dont mess around and Abortion is sinful and Im a Christian After the group broke up the moderator an Alabama woman in her 30s said This is an extraordinary problem called the paradox of pregnancy These girls just wont admit that they might have a sexual relationship some day and they are precisely the ones who will get pregnant if they do because they just wont accommodate the possibility of planning on sex by contraception They feel bound to pretend it was an accident that they were pushed into sin I sometimes fear that the JudeoChristian ethic is the greatest contributor to pregnancy that I run into At the same time the teenagerspossibly atypical in that they were able and willing to come some distance to attend the conference  seemed generally to accept liberal sexual views and to support sex education A questionnaire found one segment of about 350 students favoring fullcredit courses in male female relations and sexual responsibilities by 344 to 7 Two hundred fiftyfive to 100 thought their school provided too little information about venereal disease 342 to 12 thought birth control information should be provided in high school 308 to 45 thought masturbation should be discussed 272 to 82 thought homosexuality should be discussed and 193 to 142 felt that marriage should not be required for sex relations

Bollingen Series XCVI Illustrated 549 pp Princeton NJ Princeton University Press 30 peror of the Ottoman Turks as the infidel who sacked Constantinople in 1453 and put an end to the last Byzantine vestige of the Roman Empire Mehmed did not rate the glowing appraisals Christian historians lavished on any secondrate doge or prince who ever commissioned a pieta Such ethnocentrism has by the evidence of this monumental biography distorted later 15thcentury history erasing from our sense of that crucial period its cosmopolite Oriental side Who but specialists suspected how constant the contact diplomatic and intellectual was between both sides of the Adriatic or how sophisticated a state Mehmed built in his brief and bellicose reign Even specialists however have had special problems in penetrating Ottoman history with its scattered and slippery records written in a dozen tongues from Albanian to Parsi Franz Babinger the German turcologist surmounted these technical problems and applied his oceanic erudition to the task of writing a narrative of Mehmeds life and times The original German text was published in 1953 and was soon revised gaining an immediate renown but the English translation languished for reasons still not entirely clear until after Babinger died on a research trip to Albania and this handsome edition has been brought to press by other hands Experts will debate the problems this patchwork and dilatory method may have created Lay readers will positively reel at the density of unfamiliar names and events In one not untypically overfreighted sentence Babin Before setting out on his second expedition to the Morea Mehmed replaced the deposed Albanian Hamza Zenevisi not to be confused with Skanderbegs nephew by Zaganos Pasha who as husband of Murad IIs daughter Fatima Banal had for a time been at once Mehmeds brotherinlaw and fatherinlaw Still Babinger has an exciting oldfashioned story to tell packed with sieges and slyness bloody

if population pressure will force diners around the world to switch their diets from expensive natural protein sources such as meat and fleshy fish to one of the many nutritionally adequate substitutes that run the noisome gamut from algae to locusts Hunger is a very complicated problem because no workable definition of the optimal diet exists because venal politics and socioeconomic barriers block distribution of food that already exists and because arbitrary cultural preferences limit the exploitation of neglected food sources It is this last obstacle that Barbara Fords brave new larder must surmount Americans for instance myself among them turn up their noses at Rivella a perfectly sensible Swiss carbonated drink made from whey and mountain herbs Will Africans and Asians be more docile and gobble up dried earthworms because food technologists tell them dried earthworms are almost 60 percent On the other hand many of the new protein sources do sound promising especially the ones that can be unobtrusively mixed in with conventional foods Mrs Ford has done an admirable job in any case of compiling a catalogue of dozens and dozens of promising projects wing beans alfalfa protein concentrate giant prawns and the like Along the way she provides a tight sum mary of uptodate nutritional thinking Her writing is brisk and clear and does not try to scare us only to inform She is also commendably careful not to push any of her discoveries as a panacea Indeed she habitually lists the drawbacks of each substance the relative high cost of soybeans or the buffalo gourds high fiber content One of these wonder foods protein from tobacco or hybrid wheat  may yet make a real difference in world diet and it is comforting to know that so many scientists are at work on so many potentially helpful innovations QUASAR QUASAR BURNING BRIGHT By Isaac Asimov 240 pp New York Doubleday  Co 795 Trollope Voltaire Georges Simenon Isaac Asimov  what do these men have in common They are graphomanes They couldnt stop writing Mr Asimov is still at it after more than 200 books of science fiction and science fact He is addicted as he explains with customary charm and clarity in the introduction to this 13th collection of his science essays from the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction Reading all at once through these 17 popularizing familiar chatty essays on everything from atomic nuclei to black holes one begins to see how he does it I mean that his writers strategy for explaining complex material better than any other living person emerges as a simple method for luring laymen into subjects they cant fundamentally understand and making them think they do He begins with a personal anecdote for example a disarming story about an Austrian chauvinist forced to concede that his country cannot match the Grand Canyon leads into a history of the electric light bulb that is meant to demonstrate American leadership in technology Its a good story and Mr Asimov makes it move with a constant shower of numbers not scientific numbers or much science either we never learn why Edisons filament worked where others failed the patent number of the bulb the date of the first successful bulbs introduction The appeal is much the same as that of the Guinness Book of World Records Mr Asimov entices us with lists of new elements in the peri odic table of clever statistical charts about cities and with some very clear numerical explanations of the astronomical and geological forces that have caused ice ages only during 1 per cent of the Earths history He knows precisely how much real math and science readers weaned on baseball statistics can stomach This is a great gift and in the next collection hope he will apply it to discussing graphomania as a psychological quirk but also as a rich source of new statistical records  the most prolific author of all time the man who wrote the most in one day before the invention of the typewriter and on and on and on LOVE  SEX A Modern Jewish Perspective By Robert Gordis 290 pp New York Farrar Straus  Giroux 895 As professor of Bible and Rapaport Professor in the Philosophies of Religion at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America Robert Gordis speaks for normative Judaism He is no kind of radical In this survey of Jewish positions on currently controversial aspects of sexuality Professor Gordis comes out against abortion on demand against premarital sex against adultery He states without scientific authority that homosexuality is an illness This is exactly the sort of conservative opinion one expects from a spokesman for rabbinical learning and it would be pointless to argue with Professor Gordiss views He is in a profound The real problem with this book is that it cannot hope to persuade thousands of apostate Jews of anything except that they were right to abandon formal Jewish observancenot so much because of the rigid views of the rabbinate but because of the irrelevant and empty language that modern leaders like Professor Gordis spew out in a simplistic and vacant attempt to win young people back to the fold Professor Gordis speaks of Judaisms capacity to warm the heart without stifling the mind its blending of idealistic aspiration and realistic understanding Such rhetoric says nothing and makes the skeptic yawn Such mindless sermonizing is exactly what has driven many modern Jews into secular forms of Jewish life

Sex Education: Suburban Parents And School Aides Pursue the Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/27/archives/sex-education-suburban-parents-and-school-aides-pursue-the-debate.html,CENTEREACH LIRichard Arluck began to discuss the sexeducation classes he teaches and the 50 assembled parents grow still qioldonly the silence was interrupted by a man in the back of the room who tried to shout down Mr Arluck Nlary Ann Fox the chairman of the ad hoc committee on sex education of Long Islands Middle Country School District immediately told the man that he was out of order but his comments prompted a lengthly debate by the committees members Could they was the question ever have a discussion about the possibility of introducing sex education into the districts curriculum if they allowed parents at their meetings They finally agreed that parents should play a role and that they would meet again in September after a summer of research The recent incident points up thc highly emotional atmosphere still surrounding the issue of sex education which many people assoCiate with thc controversy over legalized abortion Pregnancies Are Rising Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare has endorsed sex education ivith millions of Federal dollars as an alternative to abortion particularly among teenagers Pregnancies are on the upswing especially among girls 14 years old and younger and a recently released report by two researchers at Johns Hopkins University concluded that 10 percent of all American girls between the ages of 15 and 19 got pregnant in 1976 The number of clinics and other sgrvices directed at teenag ers is growing but in suburban New York schools o licials say the majority of youngsters Ire receiving only the most cursory int ormation about human reproduction Furthermore attempts by districts lke Middle Island to introduce sex education into the curriculum continue to Meet deep suspicion or steadfast opposition from parents who insist that it is their prerogative to teach their children about sex Federal Efforts Are Indirect Since last years ruling by the Supreme Court that Medicaid funds need not be made available for abortions 146 million has been allocated to expand the financing of existing familyplanning units and to bolster research education efforts directed at youngsters A teenagepregnancy prevention bill calling for 60 million more in funds has been introduced in Congress Federal officials recognize however tnat since sex education has always been the province of the local community there is little that they can do directly to make sex education a routine part of the publicschool curriculum As a result the Federal effort is indirect as in the case of the Middle Country School District where the Suffolk County Health Department using a 40000 Federal grant attempted to set up a parent  child discussion evening The idea was that 100 children from one school would exchange parents for an evening with 100 children from another school in the district and have an open uninhibited discussion of sex The district however decided instead o set up the ad hoc committee In determine whether parents wanted a sexeducation curriculum and if so what it should include The only sex education offered now by the 16330pupil Middle Country District comes in the form of a film on maturation shown to fifth and sixth graders in only one of the 10 elementary schools Parents must give permission and separate films are shown to boys and girls The girls film discusses menstruation while the boys covers growth changes that they can expect It talked about an egg and sperm about acne and that when you get older you sweat and have to change clothes a lot aid Vincent Dimarco a sixth grader from Lake Grove who recently saw the film Many other Long Island districts also show the film as their only brush with sex education although the Syosset district has a comprehensiVe program recognised by sexeducation advocates as one of the countrys most outstanding New York States Education Department does not mandate the teaching of sex education but offers the district an advisory curriculum The curriculum is being updated according to Frances Bernstein the head of the states Bureau of School Health Education and Services but no decision has so far been made on whether to include the topics of homosexuality pornography and contraception These are the red flags Mrs Bernstein said Cutback in New York City In New York City the number of schools teaching sex education has declined over the last three years because of the citys budget crunch according to Melvin Warren of the Board of Educations Center for Health and Physical Education Mr Warren said that among the first positions to be cut by both the community districts and the central board were those for coordinators of family living or sex  education courses Without someone holding their hands Mr Warren said some districts have given in to timidity and curtailed their programs or have put off implementing them Like the state tie city does not mandate the teaching of sex education but offers the districts an advisory curriculum The current curriculum also in the process of revision does not cover contraception Half a dozen states in addition to the District of Columbia mandate sex education But what is offered tends to he sporadic and up to each districts comfort level according to Frank Carparulo a founder of the Sex Information and Education Council of Connecticut which had its first meeting earlier this month To illustrate his point Mr Carparulo said that in the East Haven School District virtually no sex education was taught because of the opposition of the districts superintendent But in New Haven there is a complete program in which contraception is discussed and the actual devices are shown to the students In New Jersey another state without mandated sex education a parent from the Bergen County community of Dumont is challenging the right of the school district to require that all students take a sexeducation course The parent John Bannon objected when his daughters family living class which is for seniors only took up the tonics of abortion homosexuality and contraception He said that as a Roman Catholic he found all three types of behavior deviant and snful We dont advocate abortion or any form of contraception in what we teach said David Dervits Dumonts Superintendent of Schools We just say these are the methods and we include rhythm and the students bring to that discussion their own ideas and religions The Dumont School Board insisted that parents could not he allowed to pick and choose among the courses considered necessary parts of the curriculum Mr Bannon appealed that policy of the states Education Commissioner who backed the board Now Mr Bannon has appealed to the states Board of Education Although opposition to sex education programs in the public schools has cased somewhat since 1969 when an effort led by the John Birch Society destroyed the sex education in the Anaheim Calif public schools resistance still comes from this conservative side of the political spectrum from forces opposed to abortion and from the Roman Catholic church For example a Roman Catholic priest the Rev Charles Fink a member of Middle Country Districts ad hoc committee has expressed grave reservations about the wisdom of introducing sex education to the curriculum The presumption is that these programs will cut down on illegitimacy but where is the hard evidence he asked There certainly is more contraception used by young people today than 30 years ago yet these problems of illegitimacy and venereal disease arc worse than ever A recent study of 150 families in the New York City area conducted by Dr Ann Welbourne an associate with the psychiatry department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook confirmed that teenagers were still receiving most of their information about sex from their friends rather than from their parents or teachers In the absence of definitive information about the sexual knowledge of teenagers health educators and sexeducation advocates use anecdotal evidence to back up their view that too many teenagers are ignorant of the basic facts about sex You Cant Relate to It My venerealdisease investigators tell me it is a common myth among teenagers that if you rub earwax on a penis before intercourse that will prevent venereal disease said Dr David Harris Suffolk Countys Health Commissioner during an interview Other examples mentioned by Dr Harris or others included the belief that it was impossible to become pregnant from a first sexual experience or from intercourse done while standing up and that birthcontrol pills protected women from venereal disease In East Hampton LI the editor of the school newspaper Maria Schneider wrote an article for the paper in which she described all the available methods of contraception She said in an interview that she had written it because when I was a freshman I knew two girls who had to leave school to have babies and usually about nine girls 1 year have abortions Sex education is part of the high school curriculum but it lasts only for one week of a semesterlong health ccwrs acording to Miss Schneider who added You cant relate to it Her article was never printed in the school paper because the principal Dr Christopher Sarlo believed it spent too much time on the specifics of birth control and missed out on quoting the people who would have given it perspective that would have made it acceptable He asked Miss Schneider to revise the article but she declined Asked if he believed the district should offer more sex education Dr Sarlo said High school is not the place to begin but where when and how is something to be addressed by the parents the community the church and the school together
Effects of the Democratic Split: Both a Windfall and a Handicap,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/27/archives/effects-of-the-democratic-split-both-a-windfall-and-a-handicap.html,Assemblyman Perry B Duryea the Republican candidate for Governor of New York State is clearly the chief beneficiary of the rare spliteven for wild and wooly New York politicsbetween a Governor and his ostensible copartner News Analysis in state government for the last four years Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak For the next two months the voters will view a bitter and many would say un seemly struggle between the states two highest ranking Democratic public officials with inevitable overtones of warfare between the sexes Even their supporters conceded yesterday that the two would provide ammunition for the Republicans and possibly provoke the average voter into an attitude of a plague on both your houses To compound the Democratic embarrassment one of the partys veteran legislators State Senator Jeremiah B Bloom of Brooklyn hopes to make it a threecornered race by getting on the primary ballot through petitions signed by at least 20000 enrolled Democrats just as Miss Krupsak must do to qualify for the Sept 12 primary Indeed there are strong signals that the Carey forces will welcome and possibly even encourage the Senator because of the widespread belief in the Carey camp that the Governor would have a better chance of surviving a threeway primary than a direct twoway confrontation with the Lieutenant Governor Why They Prefir 3 Candidates The theory endorsed by some but not all of Miss Krupsaks political advisers is that the two challengers will divide the antiCarey vote an apparently substantial vote according to the Governors own polls They will also be forced to compete for attention with each other as well as with the Governor and his highly visible post Bloom could be the single most important factor said a Krupsak aide as he waited for the candidates appearance yesterday at one of the citys seedier street corners Wyckoff and Myrtle Avenues just down the block from the ruins of the Bushwick section of Brooklyn David Garth the Governors campaign strategist is among the many Carey aides who feel that the Bloom candidacy can be a plus for the Governor If Mr Carey agrees his camp would not challenge Mr Blooms efforts to get on the ballot and indeed might assist him by covertly helping him to collect signatures and taking every opportunity to build him up as an equal of the Lieutenant Governor In his statement reacting to the Krupsak candidacy for example the Governor repeatedly referred to her as Miss Krupsak as if she held no public office A minority view is expressed by some Krupsak advisers who argue that Mr Bloom as a regular organization Democrat will siphon votes from he Governor who backed by the Democratic Party rstcbFshment n the state In addition Miss Krupsaks victory over two male  G Olivier in the 1974 Lieutenant Gover nor primary is cited as a possible scenario for the upcoming primary Even if Mr Bloomwho is widely rated the weakest of the three Democratsproves to help Miss Krupsak or has little impact on the contest the Lieutenant Governor faces the task of drawing substantial issues with a Governor whom she has supported and an administration of which she has been a highly visible part That problem was evident in Miss Krupsaks announcement which dealt with such generalities as building a new partnership between the people and government distant and unresponsive government and time for a change Indeed Miss Krupsak and her public relations aide Mike Garcia cut off questions about her differences with the Governor and why she changed her mind at the last minute to run against him She answered only five questions although she had kept newsmen waiting 40 minutes and then delivered her entire 20minute announcement speech A Dearth of Issues Seen Shes going to have a hard time finding issues said John J Burns the Governors campaign manager Assemblyman Clifford Wilson explained yesterday why he was leaning toward support of Miss Krupsak While the Governor was vetoing bills she was in her office seeing legislators he said City Councilwoman Mary Codd of Staten Island said she was supporting Miss Krupsak because of her anticipated opposition to the Westway the Manhattan highway project Mrs Codd said that Staten Islanders opposed the planned Westway as extravagant The Lieutenant Governor who had attended the news conference in which the Governor and Mayor Koch had announced their support of the highway project will switch her position according to several City Council members supporting her apparently in an effort to win the support of the liberal Manhattanoriented New Democratic Coalition The coalition is reconsidering its earlier endorsement of Mr Carey However few politicians expect Westway to be a major issue in the campaign outside the West Side of Manhattan Yet on such major issues as abortion and the death penalty the Governor and Lieutenant Governor have agreed Senator Bloom pointed that up yesterday when reacting to the Krupsak candidacy he asked what choices she is giving enrolled Democrats Like Carey she is foursquare against the death penalty like Carey she has suddenly discovered that something is rotten in the State of New York and something should be done about it That is presumably only the start of such charges that will produce joy in the Duryea camp this summer It could even get better for Mr Duryea the Governor loses the Democratic nomination he will still be the Liberal arty candidate and thus divide the nora1 democratic vote in the general election with the Democratic nominee either Miss Krupsak or Mr Bloom That would almost guarantee Mr Duryeas election

"Abortion Financed by Medicaid Is Approved for Rape Victim, 12",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/28/archives/new-jersey-pages-abortion-financed-by-medicaid-is-approved-for-rape.html,NEW BRUNSWICK June 27While a controversy continued to intensify today over the use of public funds for abortions New Jersey approved a Medicaidfinanced abortion for a 12 yearold rape victim after doctors said that her life woould be endangered if her pregnancy was not terminated The states approval of the abortion for a Camden girl who had been pregnant for five months followed a medical examination over the weekend ordered by Judge David D Furman of the State Superior Court who was hearing a broadly based challenge to New Jerseys Medicaidabortion statute The statute permits Medicaid financing only for abortions deemed necessary to save the mothers life The lawsuit against the 18monthold state law barring state funds for abortion has been filed by several individuals along with such organizations as Right to Choose and the New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization The issue arose when a suit was filed by the EssexNewark Legal Services Corporation on behalf of a 24yearold Newark mother on welfare whose health was said to be threatened by her pregnancy because she had undergone Xrays and medication following an injury that physicians said might have damaged the fetus In a ruling earlier this month Judge Furman set aside the state Medicaid restrictions in a temporary restraining order and directed the state to pay for the womans abortion on the ground of medical necessity His ruling skirted the state laws requirement that the womans life had to be threatened if state Medicaid funds were to be used Judge Furman had refrained from ruling on the broader issue of the constitutionality of the New Jersey law That decision is expected to come f011owing another hearing before him on July 3 The New Jersey statute is more restrictive than the guidelines set last year by the United States Supreme Court which provided for publicly financed abortions where they are medically indicated and if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest Today following the addition of other pregnant women as plaintiffs in the suit against the state law Judge Furman denied the requests by two pregnant New Brunswick welfare mothers for Medicaidfinanced abortions Abortions Called Elective One was a 21yearold mother of two children who was fiveweeks pregnant living on 310 a month aid provided under the Aid to Dependent Children program and the other is a 30yearold mother in her 10th week of pregnancy whose welfare income is 356 a month Their applications were said to be in the category of elective abortions which have no standing in current state law although representatives of the EssexNewark Legal Services Corporation described them as marginal cases falling somewhere between the therapeutic and the nontherapeutic classification The judge said however that the applications could be refiled after a future determination on the constitutionality of the state law The judge said however that the applications could be refiled after a future determination of the constitutionality of the state law At the same time Judge Furman ordered a state Medicaid physician to examine a I4yearold girl from Bridgeton and a 42yearold Millville woman to determine whether abortions were medically indicated and their pregnancies if carried to their natural term would endanger the mothers lives
‘Bakke’ May Change a Lot While Changing No Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/02/archives/bakke-may-change-a-lot-while-changing-no-law.html,Perhaps no case in modern memory has received so much media coverage and scholarly commentary With those words in the United States Supreme Court chamber last Wednesday Justice Lewis F Powell Jr began his announcement of the Courts Judgment in case No 76811 Regents of the University of California v Bakke Over the next hour five members of the Court expounded their views on the Bakke case often passionately to the courtroom audience Then came six separate printed opinions canvassing at considered length the legal issues presented by affirmative action programs to help disadvantaged racial groups in the United States When it was all over had the great case of Allan P Bakke changed American law Would the decision awaited with such nervous anticipation by so many interest groups lead to any great change in society The answer to those questions was evidently no Regents v Bakke would almost certainly not be a transforming legal event as Brown v Board of Education was in 1954 or the Abortion Cases in 1973 It would more likely be seen in history as a decision allowing most existing social policy in the field to continue But that does not make the Bakke decision unimportant Far from it The late Alexander Bickel said that one of the Supreme Courts most important functions was to legitimate political and social programs If the Justices find a policy constitutional Professor Bickel said the public is more likely to accept it and let the arguments fade If that is the eventual result of the Bakke decision it the heat does now gradually go out of the legal and political argument about affirmative actionit will be an ironic outcome For the Justices found the Issues so prickly so divisive that no majority could agree on a single opinion to express the Courts view The contrast was inevitably drawn with the unanimity of Brown v Board of Education But that difference reflected the nature of the two cases Racial segreagation enforced by law was a fairly clear issue in 1954 legally and morally After Hitler it was hard not to see an expression of contempt when a dominant racial group in a society made a minority go to separate schools or wear yellow stars As Prof Paul Freund puts it the inevitability of the Brown decision can be understood if the opposite result is imagined the Supreme Court finding in 1954 that segregation did assure blacks the equal protection of the laws Affirmative action arouses more uncertain feelings in the public and in judges When a university takes a minority student under a special admissions program fora class limited in number someone else is not admitted Like Allan Bakke he may be a sympathetic person who cannot personally be charged with discrimination that has oppressed the minority But the historical fact of racial discrimination remains with all its distorting social effects Out of these conflicting interests and with all those conflicting opinions the Supreme Court in the Bakke case somehow arrived at a middleoftheroad out come Or so it seemed from the first reactions which on all sides were rather accepting Mr Bakke won but so did the general principle of affirmative action That was the comforting paradox communicated to the world But what sort of affirmative action programs are likely to pass judicial muster in the future The five justices who spoke to the constitutional issue gave some clues in what they said about ends and means Four said it was a proper objective for an institution even though it had not itself discriminated to redress societys past racism  by training more black doctors for example The fifth Justice Powell found that end too broad What a university could seek he said was a diverse student body And any institution that had itself discriminated could use raceconscious corrective measures So at least those two ends are constitutional As to means the four judges who took a broad view of purpose also would have upheld the admissions system of the Davis Medical School reserving 16 of 100 places for minority students Justice Powell found that method needlessly rigid He said that race could be considered but as one among several factors He cited Harvards flexible plan which allows administrators to seek diversity in admissions by giving favorable weight to race leadership potential dembnstrated compassion and soon At universities then something like the Harvard system could be acceptable That is the reason for believing that the Bakke decision will not require any great change in policies across the country Very few professional schools or undergraduate colleges have such explicit numerical affirmative action plans as Daviss most come closer to Harvards Justice Blackmun observed in his opinion The cynical of course may say that under a program such as Harvards one may accomplish covertly what Davis concedes it does openly What the outcome in Bakke unquestionably does is to allow universities a good deal of discretion over these matters That comes as a great relief to their officers who feared above all being held to some rigid legal standard in numberless lawsuits over admissions decisions Whether universities will use their discretion to continue bringing more black and other minority students into the stream of higher education will be entirely up to them One thing the Court made clear significantly is that a state institution itself free of any taint of past discrimination is not obligated to have any affirmative action program A large question that the Bakke case did not settle is how far a remedy may go if an institution or industry is found to have excluded minorities itself One lowercourt case cited by Justice Powell apparently with approval upheld a requirement that contractors bidding on public construction projects in Massachusetts set aside a fixed portion of the work for minorityowned subcontractors  because of a long history of discrimination But the Court has agreed to review next term a decision ordering Los Angeles County to hire a fixed ratio of black and Hispanic firemen after a finding that they had been excluded in the past by a discriminatory examination Justice Blackmun noting the small number of black doctors and lawyers in America said In order to get beyond racism we must first take ac count of race Justice Marshall speaking with emotion said the position of the Negro today in America is a tragedy He recited some depressing statistics of life expectancy and income exclaiming Im  talking about today Though the result of the Bakke case may be to leave things in a vague middling state no one who sat in the courtroom and heard the justices could doubt the depth of the philosophical conflicts involved
Counterrevolt Brewing on Abolishing the Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/02/archives/long-island-weekly-counterrevolt-brewing-on-abolishing-the.html,WHEN Denis R Hurley began his campaign for the Suffolk County Legislature last year on a platform calling for abolition of the very body he was running for few people took him seriously They did not even take him very seriously when he won But then something happened and Mr Hurley started to pick up support among his colleagues to have the question Put t a referendum Mr Hurleys fellow Republican Louis T Howard endorsed the abolition proposal calling the Legislature a threering circus and a Democrat Robert J Mrazek gave his backing to Mr Hurley Then the Suffolk County Republican chairman Gilbert C Hanse endorsed the Legislatures abolition which would mean the institution of a Board of Supervisors with votes weighted according to population Mr Hurley was beginning to be taken seriously In fact a revolution was under way Now comes the counterrevolution Recent interviews and a head count indicate that 10 persons on the 18member Legislature are ready to vote against holding an abolition referendum Even some of those who favor putting it on the ballot say that they do so only to avoid being labeled undemocratic and add that they would campaign against abolition if it went to a referendum The Legislature is only nine years old having been formed to remedy an inequity in which five Supervisors from eastern towns containing less than 10 percent of the county population were voting equally with five members from the western towns where most of the population lived During its existence the cost of running the Legislature has risen from 200000 to 18 million a year while Legislatorssalaries have risen from 5900 a year to 22500 One of those taking the position that he would campaign against abolition is Joseph R Caputo the Presiding Officer and the target of much of the criticism that a circuslike atmosphere prevails at meetings of the Legislature It would be difficult not to put it on referendum Mr Caputo said I am opposed to abolition but I may vote in favor of putting it on a referendum The legislators are doing a fine job They work hard One thing is certain The members work long hours For example the meeting that considered eliminating funds for Medicaidfinanced abortions held despite the advice of the County Attorney Howard E Pachman that the measure if approved would have been voided because it was contrary to state law lasted for more than 19 hours People both for and against abortions spoke reasonably or shouted at legislators legislators spoke reasonably to the citizens or shouted back at them and later some legislators were shouting at one another It was this kind of conduct that led Mr Howard and others to call the meetings a circus although observers noted that Mr Howard sponsor of the antiabortion measure was among those carried away in the high emotions of the debate at one point telling a minister who had spoken in favor of abortions that he was thankful that he did not belong to that ministers congregation In endorsing Mr Hurleys abolition proposal Mr Howard attacked the Republican leadership and said of his party We evolved into a bimonthly performance with certain legislators upstaging each other for the benefit of headlines Mr Mrazek who has established a reputation as a maverick in the Legislature still says he favors abolition although he is clearly uncomfortable at finding himself allied on the question with Mr Hanse and some other Republicans Besides Legislators Caputo Hurley Howard and Mrazek the only others who have taken positions firmly in favor of getting abolition on the ballot are John P Finnerty who said Enough of a question has been raised that it should be put to the people and two who want it on the ballot but would campaign against it They are John T Donohue who has his own alternative proposals and John C Wehrenberg who said Id put it up to a vote but Id work to kill the proposal Legislator William Carney is undecided As a Conservative traditionally I should support referendums he said But in this case I want to make sure the people are well educated about the issue Personally I dont want to see the Legislature abolished Those who responded firmly as against abolition  even against a referendum  were Legislators John J Foley Floyd S Linton Ferdinand Giese William C Richards Michael J Grant Anthony Noto Joseph F Bassano Sr Martin J Feldman John J ONeil and Jane R Devine There are Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the question and party considerations are not expected to become a factor unless Mr Hanse decides to try to impose some party discipline but it appears to be too late for that The issues are many Those in favor of abolition contend that the Legislature costs too much and that a Board of Supervisors would be less expensive and closer to the people And always the question of the circus atmosphere is raised For example there is Mr Bassanos short temper and Mr Mrazeks impulse to needle him Both are Democrats in a Legislature controlled 11 to 7 by the Republicans with Mr Carney the Conservative counted among the Republicans But when Mr Mrazek introduced his bill  since passed  to have public officials make disclosures of their financial holdings Mr Bassano said that that was how Hitler had got his start Mr Mrazek was astonished Much of the opposition to abolition of the Legislature comes from people who say that it is an improvement over the old Board of Supervisors Dont forget Mrs Devine said the Board of Supervisors gave us the Southwest Sewer District Mrs Devine has joined two other Democrats Mr Foley and Mr Linton in rising to oppose abolition The Supervisors have their own multimilliondollar corporation to manage Mr Linton said It is facile to argue that the Supervisors would do a better job of running the county Mr Linton added Abolition appeals to a sense of sheer delicious anarchy Mr Foley said We are going to request a hearing before the Charter Revision Commission with our own proposals You have to look at the whole charter To say that we should go back to the golden age of the Board of Supervisors is an exercise in nostalgia People forget that the Nassau County Board of Supervisors is not a paragon of good government The three Democrats will suggest that the Legislature conduct its meetings quarterly spending the rest of the time in committee meetings hearing testimony and statements from the public This could return some order to the meetings they say Much of the discussion over abolition returns to the role of Mr Caputo with Mr Foley asserting Leadership at the legislative level is at the heart of the problem Mr Caputo replies that Mr Foley is angry at him because he discovered that Mr Foley had switched his 1973 county car for a 1977 model that was being given up by a defeated legislator without getting authorization from the Legislature Maybe because he was found out he dislikes me Mr Caputo said Maybe were too alert for him Democrats have asserted that Mr Caputo pays too much attention to such details as who is driving what car and not enough to running the Legislature If Joe Caputo were County Executive Mr Linton said then there might be a move to replace the executive with a county manager Actually such an idea has been proposed Mr Donohue favors putting the abolition measure on the ballot but he would prefer to keep the Legislature and has submitted a measure calling for a county manager form of government such as that used in many cities Under such a system the Legislature would hire a manager who would carry out its policies Mr Donohue has another proposal that of forming Brookhaven County out of the present town of that name another new county made up of the five East End towns leaving Huntington Smithtown Babylon and Islip as a county made up of West End towns The first area is growing the second is rural and the third has stopped growing he said and all have different problems Mr Donohue has not yet discussed his plan to abolish the County Executive post with its incumbent John V N Klein As for abolition of the Legislature Mr Klein said I support putting a proposition on the ballot to give people an opportunity to decide on it but I have not made a judgment as to whether to vote yes or no Heavy issues are involved the costs vs the work product that comes from each system whether the Supervisors with large town governments could legislate efficiently It should have a very thorough airing so that people could make an informed judgment

And if he spells daisy and zeppelin wrong an artist who suggests an unguiculate for U can be forgiven Its an alphabet not to be missed ON To WIDECOMBE FAIR By Patricia Lee Gauch Illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman Unpaged New York G P Putnams Sons 795 Ages 4 to 8 There is an infectious lilt to the language of Patricia Lee Gauchs story adaptation of an English folk song and Trina Schart Hyman has given the loosejointed tale a grandiose probably Caldecott Medalcontending  graphic production Sketching on location at Widecombe in Devon the artist recreates the village with its overpowering church tower the lay of the surrounding moors and she provides loving closeup vignettes of local flora fauna and architecture In addition she presents us with a septet of memorable country bumpkins each individualized with rafish charm Yet the ultimate effect Selma G Lanes is the author of Down the Rabbit Hole of her busy alternating fullcolor and blackandwhite spreads is of a surfeit  overblown action and detail almost smothering the frail narrative This latter concerns seven neerdowells who kill an old gray mare when drunkenly they all attempt to ride her at once en route home from the Widecombe Fair One wishes for slightly more story and less pictorial splendor seductive as each separate bit of art work is ALEXANDRA THE ROCKEATER By Dorothy Van Woerkom Illustrated by Rosekrans Hoffman Unpaged New York Alfred A Knopf 695 Ages 5 to 8 How Alexandra who unexpectedly becomes the mother of one hundred hungry children manages to outwit a gullible young dragon and thereby guarantee a lifetime food supply for her readymade brood makes a story virtually certain to please both young listeners and precocious readers Retold from a Rumanian folk tale it bears resemblances to many other tales particularly The Brave Little Tailor including its questionable lesson that brute strength is never a match for quick wits Even though the dragon is an incredible patsy Dorothy Van Woerkoms matteroffact narration combined with Rosekrans Hoffmans bright funny and quirkily stylized illustrations carry off the nonsense with panache SWEET BETSY FROM PIKE A Song From the Gold Rush Days Illustrated by Robert Andrew Parker Unpaged New York The Viking Press 795 Ages 6 to 9 The versatile Robert Andrew Parker has taken a song about the Gold Rush days on which to exercise his painting talent Each fullpage illustration  a rich combination of acrylic and watercolor  carries the reader along with Betsy and Ike as they trek westward from Pike County Mo to a fortyniners haven Placerville Calif The immensity of the plains the romance of camping under the stars the cheerless monotony of sand and heat that nearly do poor Betsy in  are all here But each Parker painting is like a tableau there isnt much narrative action or even progress page to page The lyfics themselvesessentially the saga of a romance gone sour  contain little to engage the attention of a young audience Even where Parker might have introduced drama and suspense the cattle die the Shanghai rooster runs off the last of the bacon is eaten he chooses not to exploit the possibilities There is probably an accidental reversal of pictures at one point  when Ike and his Betsy attend a dance but the action is so minimal its difficult to be sure This handsome  if static  work seems more an artists indulgence in nostalgia than a picture book children are likely to cherish EDITH JACKSON By Rosa Guy 187 pp New York The Viking Press 895 Ages 12 to 16 Although Edith Jackson is the final novel preceded by The Friends and Ruby in Rosa Guys moving trilogy about young blacks in todays urban society its heroines story stands firmly on its own Readers of the previous books will be pleased to

Carey Using Big Supporting Cast in Re‐election Campaign's Television Commercials,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/03/archives/carey-using-big-supporting-cast-in-reelection-campaigns-television.html,Testimonials to Governor Careyby the actress Helen Hayes and half a dozen New York politicianshave started appearing on television screens in an advertising campaign that is unusual for an incumbent According to David Garth the media man who made the introductory C00000 package they reflect the belief that the public does not have much sense of Mr Careys record as distinguished from his personality The problem is very simple Mr Garth said Hes done a lousy job of taking credit for what hes done Some politicians have suggested that three and a half years of a crisispacked incumbency have made Mr Carey unpopular enough that he seeks the publicized company of popular figures Commercials by Duryea But Mr Garth said that was not so a judgment that was more or less endorsed by aides to the Republican candidate Perry B Duryea whose own initial commercials now off the air were designed as a sort of personal introduction of him to New York voters The Carey package is different According to Mr Garth a 30second announcement that zooms in on the Governor as he sits at his Albany desk has accounted for 35 to 40 percent of the spots played so far But the advertisements that have been running for the last few weeksall except the Governors own ending with the tagline The more you know the facts you know hes rightfor Governor also include messages from Miss Hayes Richard Ravitch who helped rescue the Urban Development Corporation from default Alfred DelBello the Westchester County Executive Howard Samuels who lost the 1979 primary to Mr Carey Morris B Abram who investigated nursing homes Victor Kovner a member of the partys reform faction on Manhattans West Side and Mario M Cuomo Mr Cuomo who is running for Lieutenant Governor on the Carey ticket and who says he rewrote his message himself is going to get second billing to the Governor according to Mr Garth Cuomo a Hasty Addition The Cuomo spot has a hasty look compared to the polished cinemaverite style of the rest of the pack reflecting no doubt his hasty addition to the ticket after Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak declined to run She had made a commercial praising the Governor which Mr Garth still has in the files but which he declines to show to reporters Nonetheless he said the current Carey package reflects neither in its style nor its timing any changes because of her emergence as a primary opponent of Mr Careys Rather he said the early start emulated in a sense the television package that he did last year for Mayor Koch whose paid messages started early in the year continued pretty much without interruption and are credited by many politicians with turning a relatively obscure Manhattan Representative into the Mayor of New York With Mr Carey it is different People know who he is and according to some politicians they have negative personal impressions of him as a man who does not stand by his friends But as Mr Garth describes it Mr Carey has been a reluctant ribboncutter an executive preoccupied with his job and has not done a successful job of selling himself Its a unique problem he said My feeling is if he came on the screen and said he did things it wouldnt have the same credibility So Mr Del Bello praises cuts in welfare spending Mr Samuels contends that the Carey administration ended 16 years of mismanagement Mr Kovner speaks of court reform Miss Hayes tells of help for hospitals And Mr Cuomo whose own unhappy mayoral campaign last yearwhich the Governor sponsored then abandonedwas one of the main talking points of the Careycantbetrusted theory stares firmly into the camera and begins Its no secret that Ive had political disagreements with Governor Carey He is running with the Governor he maintains because he thinks the Mr Carey has done a good job And Mr Carey in the major message cites two matters that many politicians say have made him many enemieshis support of abortion and his opposition to the death penaltyand says that these were matters of conscience Does this remind anyone of the 1970 RockefellerforGovernor advertising campaign in which the incumbents face was rarely if ever seen Not precisely Mr Garth argues since Mr Carey often in a favorite snatch of film showing him with some Albany laborers wearing bright yellow hard hats appears in almost every spot As in the KochforMayor schedule Mr Garth said he expects that Carey advertisements will be on television At the moment CareyforGovernor is the whole paytelevision program Miss Krupsak whose material will be done by a Schenectady agency that she has always used expects aides said to start an advertising campaign in three weeks or so Mr Duryeas television man John Deardourff said that the next stage of that campaign had not yet been mapped Filming of new spots probably will start in early August he said

The Right Way to Fight for E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/04/archives/the-right-way-to-fight-for-era.html,The pressure on Congress to extend the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment will reach a crescendo next weekend as marchers and lobbyists descend on Washington They see their just cause as a tantalizing three states short of the 38 needed for adoption and seek a reprieve from almost certain defeat in their sevenyear struggle for womens rights But the means by which they prevail should not be subordinated even to a noble end To alter the amendment procedures with the extension they demand would we think cause even greater damage than a further delay in the ratification of the ERA The very process of amending the Constitution is at stake If the ERA were given a second sevenyear term for ratification by the states it would be a clear case of manipulating the process in an effort to achieve a desired result It would be particularly damaging if such an extension were decreed by a simple majority vote as its sponsors hope instead of the twothirds majority constitutionally required for amendments If the twothirds vote were in fact to be found the amendment process could be started all over again albeit for a new round of struggle state by state The nations founders wisely prescribed a slow and difficult process for amending the Constitution to protect it from transient politics and policy They left it to Congress to decide how long the states would be given to vote their approval on an amendment Any retroactive change in this time schedule because the set period did not produce a desired result would plainly offend the solemn spirit of the amendment process Moreover once the rules are bent all forces can play the same game The next time around on an amendment to forbid abortion for instance these same marchers would deeply resent a similar maneuver The way to judge the wisdom of a procedure is to imagine your worst enemy having the benefit of it Besides questions of fair play there are also some important questions of tactics An extension might not in fact serve the cause of those who seek it Four of the 35 states that have already approved E RA have since voted to rescind the endorsement The validity of such rescission has not been established If the deadline were extended no one knows how the courts would treat past rescissions and future ones Other amendments have been the object of even longer and more grueling battles It took women nearly 75 years to gain the constitutional right to vote Amend rents to abolish slavery to guarantee due process and to extend the vote to black men could be passed only after a bloody Civil War The ERA like other just constitutional causes of the past will eventually be adopted If the current version lapses next March another should soon take its place with another perhaps even longer but duly considered deadline for state action  As the battle continues let us hope it will be better fought than in recent years The tactics against the ERA in some state legislatures have been deplorable but they could have been more ably countered The propaganda of some opponents of the amendment has also been shabby frightening some people into believing that the constitutional equality of the sexes would end their separation in public restrooms or reduce widows Social Security benefits or force women to work outside the home or to leave their young children with caretakers These scare stories are easier to concoct than to refute but they too can be more ably countered Finally there has been a more subtle problem afflicting the sponsors of the ERA Although more than half the population still favors its passage public support has declined In part this may be due to a feeling of reduced urgency 16 states have adopted their own versions of the amendment and court decisions as well as legislation have asserted some of the same rights But the decline in support may also reflect a growing impression that the ERA is some kind of elite measure designed mainly to improve the lives of highly educated women who want fulltime jobs outside the home In this view it seems to have little to offer to poor vomen in routine jobs or women who intend to devote themselves fully to children and home We recall the ticket seller in an Albany train station who said in 1976 that she had voted against New Yorks referendum on a state ERA Asked why she pointed to the restrooms in the station saying I didnt know what the ERA meant but thought it was a womens libber type thing Youll probably think Im stupid but Im not a womens libber at all Except for equal pay of course Im all for that And so of course is the ERA But somehow that message was lost Until the way to reassert it is found we fear the amendment too will remain lost

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/06/archives/letters-education-and-the-minorities-after-bakke-reactionary.html,To the Editor In morally and legally evaluating the Bakke decision it is crucial to decide whether the thesis that race may be considered a positive qualification for a position in a professional school is consistent with the prohibition of racial quotas If race is considered a qualification in itself then a person otherwise better qualified can lose a position solely because of his race If this is to be justified on grounds of the value of diversity in the classroom why not aim at mix that is optimal via a quota That there is by definition a difference in degree to which race is considered in these two methods cannot be maintained since no program ever called for filling a quota with applicants who lack otherwise minimally acceptable qualifications A school can adjust this level of minimal acceptability by adjusting the size of the quota as easily as by adjusting the degree to which race is to count as a qualification Many minority group members have been denied equal opportunity to acquire qualifications for professional school and this justifies remedial programs and perhaps handicapping of credentials for these individuals This is not the same even in practice as considering race itself a qualification since not all members of these groups have been denied opportunity and present programs may tend to benefit most those members who deserve it least on this score That race itself should not be considered a qualification for contributing to learning through diversity in the classroom is clear from the fact that we would not allow it to count in the contrary sense if it were concluded from a study of Swedish schools for example that a homogeneous atmosphere is more conducive to learning Individualizing criteria for compensatory preferential treatment would not involve the great additional administrative costs sometimes claimed by schools given the types of personal information required in applications Furthermore compensatory programs of this type could continue to aim at correcting disadvantages connected with racial discrimination and not all economic handicaps The only difference from present programs would be their application to individuals who truly deserve compensation This type of program should have been advocated by Justice Powell as an alternative to the quota system at Davis not one which is a thinly disguised route to the same political goal of allotting positions by race The Bakke decision like the abortion decision in Roe v Wade was politically astute in aiming to satisfy as many of the competing interests as possible It is seriously questionable however whether our Supreme Court ought to be one more majoritarian political institution in our society Decisions in which distinctions lack legal or philosophical bases deserve little praise for their political astute ness ALAN H GOLDMAN Atlantic Beach LI July 1 1978 The writer is associate professor of philosphy at the University of Miami Reactionary Seabrook Demonstrators To the Editor The recent antinuclearenergy demonstration in Seabrook NH should be placed in perspective The animating rationale of the protest movement is based upon a rejection of progress and technology Permeated with a sense of their own moral superiority the protest leaders see themselves as the leading edge of public opinion as vanguards in a movement to return America to a more pristine past Inheritors of the antiestablishment tradition of the 1960s they differ from their predecessors in that the new enemy is not government but science itself Science makes nuclear energy possible nuclear sites like Seabrook assure economic growth and the success of capitalism To protest nuclear power is to strike at the marriage of science and capitalism The antinuclear movement is doomed to failure for it seeks to undermine the scientific and technological revolution which has created the modern world Such a protest is unable to provide the guidelines necessary to confront the economic challenges of a thriving growing America The Seabrook demonstrators unconcerned for economic and social progress exhibit a reactionary mentality They are temporary and inconsequential impedimenta to the tide of history and are destined to become a forgotten footnote to the constructive advancements of science in this century For without scientific and technological progress backed by economic power the worlds problems are insoluble ALEX A VARDAMIS Research Fellow

replace the free air pump For almost as long as the automobile has existed service stations extended this courtesy to all comers It represented a kind of decency it was tantamount to saying Sure brother help yourself And now for a few dollars what happens Thousands of people in cars perhaps not so new will save a quarter and drive a little farther on underinflated tires Or to get their moneys worth will overinflate Result more blowouts more skids from unevenly inflated tires How many lives will be lost and how many injuries will occur from how many accidents As for bicyclists like everyone else they will be privileged to get two cents worth of air for a quarter Let there be a concerted campaign on the part of motorists who drive up to a gas station where the vending machines sit and let the motorists say Sorry well go somewhere else Back in the 1920s I think it was Sinclair Lewis wrote a book called Free Air the theme of which was the openness of people the Sure brother help yourself feeling as the pulse and glory of America Now comes the end of an era  or it will come if motorists accept it meekly as theyve accepted so many other changes that reduce the quality of life Must we LAWRENCE TREAT Edgartown Mass June 22 1978 To the Editor Once upon a time a poor man was accused of stealing a horse from a rich estate The jury decided that the poor man was totally innocent provided that he returned the horse  after the harvest Mr Justice Powell speaking for an erratic majority decided that wellmotivated racial and ethnic discrimination nation is perfectly legal and even praiseworthy provided that victims like Bakke are given their equal rights  after the delay and expense of a legal action In the name of diversity races and surnames in short supply may be given preference so long as the process is muddled by the admixture of objective characteristics such as personality and by consideration for musicians athletes applicants from poor families and farm boys from Iowa However the Constitution and laws specifically prohibit discrimination based on race and national origin but not discrimination based on the other characteristics Mixing poison with milk does not make the poison safe quite the contrary South Africa has been rightly condemned for officially enforced race distinctions and the sale of computers that might be used to process racial records has been protested Should we not also protest the racesurname sex code that is part of the computerized record for many applicants students and employees of American institutions The real reason for my letter however is that my children through no fault of their own are members of racialethnicsurname group that is overrepresented among applicants with high objective qualifications If they receive negative diversity points or fail to receive positive diversity preference which is the same thing we will sue IRA GLICKSTEIN Apalachin NY June 291978 To the Editor If is strange that on

urban centers of this country If that documentary accurately reflects the existence of these young people I have no reason to think it does not then debating the correctness of the Supreme Courts

to reside in the city The taxes generated by their return would be most welcome and all New Yorkers would rejoice in their presence WALTER S NEWMAN Flushing NY June 28 1978 FCC A More Responsible Solution To the Editor Your editorial support of the proposed Communications Act of 1978 is at best misdirected While you correctly observe that amid the euphoria of high profits broadcasters tend to ignore their legal status as public trustees the answer does not lie in abolishing this concept A more responsible solution might be granting an impotent FCC some realistic enforcement powers The influence of broadcasting on society and its values cannot be measured Moreover the airwaves these broadcasters occupy reach into each of our homes yet this bill would strip us of our rights as citizens to demand that those given this privilege perform some sort of public service beyond the dictates of profitability In view of the oftencited power of radio and TV the concept of licensing broadcasters as public interest convenience or necessity demands is virtually a corollary to the First Amendment Deregulation might be the answer if all who wish to broadcast could do so The fact is that the industry has grown so much that except in the most rural of areas usable frequencies are as scarce today as they were when the industry began Further marketplace forces cannot be relied upon to achieve diverse programming even in radiosaturated New York City recent incidents involving WNCN and WRVR prove that without the threat of challenges to broadcast licenses the publics demand for classical and jazz formats would go unanswered The bills cosponsor Representative Lionel Van Deerlin has stated that broadcasters will be delighted with this bill As a member of that group I am insulted that a legislator assumes that I have so little regard for the public we are both charged with serving DONALD M KREIS Station Manager WRMCFM Middlebury College Middlebury Vt June 26 1978
"Congress's O'Neill and Byrd: Two Leaders, Two Styles",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/07/archives/congresss-oneill-and-byrd-two-leaders-two-styles-chairmen-not-as.html,WASHINGTON July 5  Thomas P ONeill Jr envelops issues Congressmen and even Presidents in an irresistible bear hug Robert C Byrd treads more gingerly as wary of a precedent as of a President But in a Congress whose independence and assertiveness could barely have been imagined when either of them first came to Capitol Hill they have managed to lead by walking the path between the anarchy of independence and singleissues politics on the one side and the ramrod leadership of such Democrats as Sam Rayburn and Lyndon B Johnson on the other They do not succeed all the time as Mr Byrds failure last week on labor law revisions shows But Congressional inaction on Administration proposals does not reflect only legislative sloth Without a President to enforce the making of a decision there is no consensus on Capitol Hill on issues like welfare or hospital costs Chairmen Not as Strong Mr Byrd and Mr ONeill cannot impose consensus and neither can the committee chairmen in this day of diminished Congressional power structure That is especially true of the House where the problem is compounded by the fact that the current group of chairmen is not a particularly strong collection The two leaders took over  Mr ONeill as Speaker of the House and Mr Byrd as majority leader of the Senate  in the same month that President Carter took office And each has a profound effect on how Mr Carter succeeds Last year it was commonplace in Washington to praise Mr ONeill and snipe at Mr Byrd mostly because of their relative successes and failures on energy legislation But in 1978 Mr Byrds Senate has dealt with the Panama Canal Middle East fighter planes and the Federal criminal code and the balance of judgment is more nearly even Dealing With Mr Carter Their respective relationships with Mr Carter are wellknown Mr ONeill took him up early and enthusiastically trying to educate and help a Democratic President so that together they could make a record The Speaker does not follow every bit of policy proclaimed by the White House but given a chance and some warning he tries to cooperate Mr Byrd is more sensitive more distant less willing to see the Senate made a junior partner of the White House As majority whip a few years ago the West Virginian was hardly an enthusiast of Senate reassertiveness in foreign policy but as majority leader he will not give it away In those differing styles they reflect not only their own personalities but those of their very different houses The House is more partisan the Senate more jealous of its prerogatives The House is so big it requires leadership though it does not always get it the Senate stacks its rules for the minority and as Mr Byrd said last fall It would be impossible for Jesus Christ to do anything without unanimous consent Their dealings with their colleagues show that too One day last week Mr ONeill lumbered out of the chamber and implored a colleague Can you give us a vote Mr Byrd asks more gently often requesting consideration rather than a flat promise Striving for More Order Mr ONeill has more power in terms of appointments to key committees like the steering committee that makes other committee recommendations But both have striven for greater order than their immediate predecessors achieved In the House Mr ONeill has succeeded in keeping the body to a schedule Members know in advance when they will be off at 530 and when they will work late Only occasionally does he push them very late as he did recently when the House worked until midnight to approve his way of dealing with television coverage of its sessions with the House and not the networks controlling the cameras In an interview the burly Massachusetts Irishman said the reason for pushing the legislators was simple he wanted the matter settled before the networks could mobilize local station owners to put the heat on their members That in spades is how things were done when he served in the Massachusetts House Mr Byrd who managed the schedule with exactitude when he was whip and Mike Mansfield was leader cannot jam things through What many senators consider ills one really bad moment came last fall when in breaking the natural gas filibuster he seized the floor and with the assistance of Vice President Mondale kept anyone from even raising a point of order Mr Byrd has never said he was wrong although the spectacle of normally reserved freshman Democrats like Senators Gary Hart of Colorado and Paul S Sarbanes of Maryland lead ing the charge against his actions must have made an impression But he cites the problem of the filibuster after cloture  a problem that may confront him again if an end to the debate on labor law revisions is voted this week  as one that must be addressed by rules changes Loss of an Obstructionist In this area his problems could be greatly simplified by the recent death of Senator James B Allen Democrat of Alabama No one in the Senate now seems likely to replace Mr Allen as parliamentary obstructionist since such a person must possess a combination of interest intelligence tenacity and the willingness to have most of his colleagues furious at him One talent that Mr Byrd and Mr ONeill have in common is that of being a bridge between generations In the House with about half the membership in its first second or third term the gap is well publicized But 46 out of 100 senators are in their first terms too In Mr ONeills case the ability to seize a moment of change and ride with it has been displayed more dramatically from the time in 1970 when he sided with the reformers in opening up the House rules and making challenges to seniority easier to the present with his advocacy of ethics rules and income limits political requirements of this time that would have seemed preposterous when he arrived in 1953 In Mr Byrds case the role has changed not only with his recognition of the greater independence of individual senators a change encouraged by Mr Mansfield in reaction to Mr Johnsons strongarming but with his attitude on the issues as well His attention was once seized by the conservative sides of issues such as civil rights and welfare and crime but as age and the decline of the civil rights issue have broken the Southern bloc Mr Byrd has moved toward the middle He can work as easily with Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts as with Senator Russell B Long of Louisiana  unless the two are in conflict in which case he is likely to side with Mr Long Both leaders are criticized Mr Byrd more severely as not being greatly concerned with substance and legislative detail In Mr ONeills case there is less need to master detail He makes an emotional Democratic speech or appeal for a vote and that fulfills his role Mr Byrd to handle the behindthescenes meetings that settle close Senate issues has more need to handle detail And he is taking a greater role on Panama and labor law in particular than he did last year On foreign policy where the Foreign Relations Committee offers little leadership he has assumed a central position His own deep distrust of the Soviet Union has put him in tune with the Carter Administration but may bring conflicts if a strategic arms treaty is presented to the Senate He has warned that he might not support it Neither admits to any real surprises in their roles Unlike Mr Carter they already knew their jobs from close observation although Mr ONeill said the changes in the House were brought home even more strongly to him when he started meeting everyone who wanted to see him You didnt get in to see Rayburn in 100 million years he said Each says he is proud of the record of Congress although the energy issue is not settled another abortion fight looms one irritating House rider after another on foreign affairs issues can be forseen and such issues as welfare and revision of the Hatch Act probably will not get settled at all this year In part that may be leadership But leadership is also a partnership there must be a willingness to be led That willingness is often absent in legislators when there is no real consensus in the country and leaders cannot force it As James Mooney an aide to John Brademan the House Democratic whip put it The leadership does not possess supernatural powers There are no incantations that one can mutter over a bill and have it miraculously pass Most of the time when a tough vote is lost it is not lost for lack of will or lack of effort but because it was tough vote
Girls Found Stabbed To Death in Norwalk Tied to Prostitution,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/07/archives/girls-found-stabbed-to-death-in-norwalk-tied-to-prostitution-both.html,STAMFORD Conn July 6  One of the two young women found stabbed to death in Norwalk on July 4 was facing charges of prostitution in Stamford according to the local States Attorneys Office and the other had supported herself through prostitution since last September according to a former foster mother Veronica Ronni Tassiello had been living in the street since she ran away in September from a foster home for four teenagers in Stamford the foster mother Diane Dereyna said today It was the night before she was supposed to start at Stamford Catholic High School as a freshman under a 1500 full scholarship arranged by Mrs Dereyna She came home drunk at 3 AM There was no way we could sober her up and put her on the bus said Mrs Dereyna of the troubled teenager who was then 16 She knew it was her last chance Both Died of Stab Wounds Miss Tassiello was found dead in a patch of woods in Norwalk beside a close friend Alaine Hapeman also 17 of Hartford Both had died a few hours earlier of multiple stab wounds The police said today that the investigation was continuing but that there had been no progress On the night in September that she was drunk according to Mrs Dereynathe other three foster children in the house where she had lived since July were very cool to her Mrs DeReyna who has taken in abused unwanted and incorrigible children and teenagers for 20 years said Our rules are very strict because these kids are trying to straighten themselves out If you told Ronnie there was a rule against something she would go out and do it Stupid things like shoplifting right in front of policemen She left the foster home that night but apparently had no other home but the street The identification card she was carrying at the time of her death listed the address of the DeReyna house on Fifth Street in an old but not fashionable section of Stamford A Homeless Feisty Kid She was a homeless feisty kid She didnt have too much morals or sense said Mrs DeReyna She felt desperately that if she followed the boys or whatever you want to call it it was her only way into the outside world Mrs DeReyna who is a professional typist and science fiction writer said that Miss Tassiello had telephoned her intermittently since September occasionally dropping in for a meal She had two abortions last winter and sent the foster mother a bill for one of them Mrs DeReyna said When Miss Tassiello left the DeReyna house the Department of Children and Youth Services which had placed her there notified the police in every place she might be according to Jeanete Dille deputy commissioner
Politics And the E.R.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/07/archives/politics-and-the-era-in-the-nation.html,In 1976 Jim McDuffie won one of the four seats from North Carolinas 22d State Senate District finishing third in an atlarge race just a thousand votes behind the leader But when Senator McDuffie sought reelection last May he came in fifth 4000 votes behind the top man and lost his seat In 1976 you see Jim McDuffie promised to support the Equal Rights Amendment But once in the Senate he cast the single vote that defeated the ERA after it had passed the House So in 1978 ERA supporters helped unseat him Thats politics And that kind of giveandtake and play of forces in our fluid American political life is an excellent reason why Congress should vote to extend the time limit for passage of the ERA That would be politics too  not a question of how you play the game but of who wins As was pointed out in a recent letter to this newspaper by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman the principal sponsor of the extension resolution and other proponents theres no real tradition or custom  much less a constitutional or statutory requirementfor a time limit for passage of a constitutional amendment The first 18 amendments including the Bill of Rights and the monumental Fourteenth had no such limit The original sevenyear limitation on passage of the ERA was not part of the amendment itself but a section of the legislation by which Congress proposed it to the states so theres no fundamental reason why Congress cannot change its collective mind and choose to extend the period And its nonsense to call such an extension for the ERA unfair as the time limit was arbitrary so would be extension and one is no more and no less unfair than the other To those who say extension would be like changing the rules of baseball in the eighth inning because one team is behind an equally dubious analogy should be cited  that many a manager has stalled for time hoping for rain to end the game in the eighth inning while his team was ahead Thats baseball and politics Besides an extension would provide as much time for rescissions  of which there already have been three by states that had passed the ERA as for ratifications Whether rescis sions are legal ultimately will be up to Congress which decides whether or not the necessary threefourths of the states have ratified an amendment but if an extension should result in numerous rescissions Congress surely would be impressed Thats a chance ERA proponents must take Besides the purpose of the torturous amendment process provided by the Constitution is to make sure that hasty and illconceived amendments are not whipped through by impatient majorities In this instance extension would serve that sound purpose because of the campaign of distortion intimidation innuendo slander shabby maneuver and outright lies waged by numerous opponents of ERA many of them  like the John Birch Society  veterans of farright causes back to the vilification of Dwight Eisenhower In a democratic society thats politics too but to let the ERA die under such pressures and by an arbitrary time limit would be the opposite of the calm thoughtful and orderly process the Constitution prescribes And that is particularly so since the ERA is before state legislatures at a time when it must bear symbolic identification with rising hysteria against abortion homosexual rights busing and other liberal ideas The amendment has become a sort of standin against which opponents of any of these can vent their opposition to all So Congress should provide an extension as a legitimate political action to save the ERA from being killed without constitutional justification by IN THE NATION the sevenyear time limit  not by the states Indeed 35 of the necessary 38 states have passed it the three remaining rescissions notwithstanding In numerous of the 15 other states the amendment has been bottled up in committee or otherwise sidetracked rather than finally defeated in Utah for example the opposition of the Mormon Church has kept it from coming to a vote Again thats politics But the legislative situation in the states is such that three additional ratifications cannot possibly be had by the deadline March 22 1979 Equalrights marchers therefore ought to make this crucial point in their Washington demonstrations  that Congress which by twothirds vote of both houses recommend the ERA to the states has the political power to prevent its defeat just as various forces have so far had the poUtical power to prevent its ratification If Congress wants the Equal Rights Amendment to pass that is it must vote for extension if Congress does not provide an extension Congress will have killed the ERA An arbitrary time period will have been allowed to frustrate the intent of the Constitution forces of reaction and untruth will have prevailed politically when they might have been countered politically But as Jim McDuf fie learned politics wont stop there

LLTTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/09/archives/letters-burning-questions.html,Burning Questions To the Editor Pearl K Bell gives herself away in the first line of her review of Alix Kates Shulmans Burning Questions March 26 Will the womens movement survive its novelists she asks Not only is the question condescending and absurd in its reduction of politics to a matter of taste but the implied answer is obviously Not if I can help it Mrs Bells preconceptions about feminist novels impel her to review a simpleminded dogmatic tract that exists only in her head In fact the simplemindedness is Mrs Bells Her reading of the book is utterly tineared judging from her penchant for quoting tongueincheek phrases as if they were deadly serious she seems incapable of recognizing an irony let alone a joke The problem aside from the wellknown fact that antifeminists have no sense of humor seems to be that Mrs Bell cannot conceive of an author who is both passionately committed to the movement and irreverent about it having rightly concluded that Burning Questions is not meant as caricature she assumes it must be as earnest as she assumes all feminists must For anyone who reads it with attention rather than spleen Burning Questions should lay such assumptions to rest It is the first novel Ive read that gets down the experience of radical feminism and of the 1960s in all its seriousness and silliness richness and excess Not only does Mrs Shulman distance herself from her protagonist Zane largely through the bookwithinabook device which is not merely a formality but the central conceit of the novel  and its best joke but Zane has a far from simple view of the years she recounts from the perspective of the sober 70s  in her revolutionary autobiography To both books chief burning question  what can a middleclass American feminist who has never known poverty imprisonment war or exile have in common with the revolutionary women of the past  Mrs Shulman and her heroine offer only partially equivocal an stand is that they take the question seriously As a feminist I particularly resent Pearl Bells snide assertions that Mix Shulmans novel could set back the cause of womens equality some 50 years and that she must be an undercover agent for Phyllis Schlafly  the implication being that Mrs Bell has our true interests at heart This sort of attack on feminism in the name of a phony concern for feminism has become a familiar Orwellian maneuver These days we have feminists opposing legal abortion feminists defending skin magazines Its true of course that if it werent for women like Mix Shulman neither Phyllis Schlafly nor Pearl Bell would have much to do  which is to say that without feminism there would be no ELLEN WILLIS New York City To the Editor Regarding the review of Mix Kates Shulmans novel Burning Questions I think the crucial question is not Will the womens movement survive its novelists but more succinctly How long must serious feminist writers be subjected to biased critiques of their politics masquerading under the euphemism book review Pearl Bells review of Alix Kates Shulmans novel is a vicious attack Mrs Bell interprets the content of the novel and then gives her opinions on that interpreted content displaying along the way  judging from the frequent generalizations she makes during the course of her critique  a profound bias against feminist novelists This constitutes the entire content of her review Nowhere is the writing in the book discussed nowhere is the books internal logic analyzed whether Alix Shulman succeeds in achieving what she not Miss Bell intends  As far as whether this particular novel is damaging to womens equality I have serious doubts whether that is a judgment any individual woman can make and I strongly resent Pearl SUSAN SHERMAN New York City Pearl K Bell replies Since ideological fanatics prefer heat to light it would be a futile expense of time and spirit to attempt an answer to Ellen Williss crude vilification of me Unfortunately slandering the reviewer does not automatically demolish her or his critical judgment of the book If Miss Shulman meant Burning Questions to convey ironic irreverence about the 1960s as well as passionate commitment to revolutionary feminism the latter intention so completely overwhelmed the former that her tongueincheek detachment disappeared without a trace Miss Shulman presents the autobiography of her rebel girl not as the work of an overeager young zealot sometimes given to silliness and excess but as the reflective memoir of an older and wiser woman who means precisely what she says and has given some thought to the way she says it If only a true believer can hope to detect the injoke allegedly at the heart of Burning Questions  or what Susan Sherman calls its internal logic  then the rest of us reading it neither as ideologues nor as pernicious enemies of the cause cannot be blamed if we take it for the straightfaced and humorless 
THE A.C.L.U. AGAINST ITSELF,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/09/archives/the-aclu-against-itself-aclu-aclu.html,Security guards stood grimly at the door of the panel on Free Speech For Racists And Totalitarians The discussion  at the American Civil Liberties Unions recent Convocation on Free Speech focused on the ACLUs disputed defense of American Nazis right to march in Skokie Ill Some peo Booming in the 60s the American Civil Liberties Union is now in disarray Thousands of members have quit over its stand on such charged issues as the Bakke case and the Nazis right to march in Skokie But the leadership insists The Bill of Rights is our client ple feared that the Nazis themselves might show up at the panel others expected a demonstration by the Jewish Defense League Among those on the dais was David Goldberger a young ACLU lawyer who brought the action on behalf of the Nazis Mr Goldbergers life has been changed by that suit He has been subjected to torrents of abuse from Jews and others horrified at the notion of defending those who unleashed the Holocaust Some of the hostility was evident among the 300 people who crowded the Rhinelander Gallery of the New York Hilton that morning in midJune This way to Auschwitz gibed a bystander And after Mr Goldberger had spoken a woman in a flowered dress rose at the back of the room to ask in a trembling voice Would you defend the Nazis if they wanted to march in your neighbor For a moment Mr Goldberger remained silent The only sound in the room was the rustling of paper and the clicking of camera shutters Then the young lawyer replied gravely Lady defending them is like having them march in my neighborhood The prolonged battle over Skokie has indeed been as if the Nazis were marching through the ACLUs own neighborhood goosestepping across the lawns trampling on the flower beds The intrusion has caused great anguish turned neighbor against neigh 1 Anthony Lukas a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist is currently writing book on the lives of three Boston families bor even led some people to move out Nobody is sure just how many people have left the ACLU over Skokie More than 9000 have invoked the Nazis in irate letters so thousands more certainly have dropped quietly off the rolls for the same reason But the membership decline began long before David Goldberger got his first call from the Nazis in April 1977 From a high of 270000 in 1974 the rolls had already fallen to 210000 by last year and have now tumbled to 185000 Clearly the organizations troubles stem from something much deeper than Skokie Amid the rampant rtvatism of the late 70s there is no public issue capable of generating sustained commitment from large numbers of civil libertarians Moreover the public interest field which the ACLU once had largely to itself is now crowded with dozens of groups spawned by the 60s all scrambling for slices of the smaller pie Finally this has happened at a time when Americas liberal community  long the principal source of ACLU strength is in terrible disarray In the 60s and early 70s liberalism was an easy reflex involving issues far from home civil rights in Selma and Little Rock the war in Saigon and Phnom Penh Watergate and impeachment in Washington For Northern liberals at least these were stark moral watersheds dividing the good guys from the bad guys But the liberal issues of the mid70s are not so easy in part because they are less remote Affirmative action womens rights busing childrens rights and the like hit the liberals own neighborhoods even their own families  requiring painful selfexamination Often they involve a conflict of rights Busing for example wins support from libertarians determined to provide equal educational opportunity to all but opposition from libertarians who believe parents ought to have the maximum freedom to determine how their child should be educated Privacy pits those who want to prevent public intrusion into private lives against those who believe the press must be free to print anything except libel The Bakke case found those committed to enlarged opportunities for blacks and other minorities opposing those who regarded racial criteria for whatever purpose as anathema The ACLU opposed Bakke but the Supreme Courts recent decision dramatically illustrated the split in the national consciousness on such rights Justice Powell provided the decisive vote in two 54 decisions first holding that Bakke had been discriminated against because he was white but then switching to the other side and holding that affirmative action programs were constitutional so long as race was regarded as only one It is enough to make a civil libertar Survivors of the Holocaust who planned to protest the Nazi march in Skokie ian yearn for the old simplicities Bring back Bull Connor Richard Nixon and that gorgeous evil war one of the ACLUs leaders joked over a drink at the recent convocation Curiously Skokie was not an issue that involved competing civilliberties concerns The libertarian argument was strongly on the side of the Nazis or more accurately against the Chicago suburb of Skokie which passed ordinances to prevent Frank Collin and his storm troopers from marching The ACLUs leadership regarded Skokie as a classic First Amendment case If we dont belong in Skokie I dont know where we belong says Norman forsen the ACLUs chairman Some critics of the ACLU argued that the Skokie march would not have been protected free speech at all but incitement to riot Yet in the law one can incite only ones own followers to riot and nobody feared a riot by Mr Collins 20 stormstroopers The real threat of disorder came from the crowds of distraught Skokie residents To have prohibited the march on such grounds would have been to permit what is known as the hecklers veto lending credence to the noxious principle that speakers may be silenced because of the response expected to their words The courts agreed with the ACLUs position and permitted the Nazis march which they ultimately canceled and rescheduled for a park in If Skokie was an easy case in law was hard on the facts For it revived the worst agony of our time Skokie has an unusually high percentage of Holocaust survivors and nobody  certainly not the ACLUs heavily Jewish leadership  underestimates the anguish which Nazi uniforms and insignia must cause to those who lost families at Dachau and Buchenwald One Skokie resident adamantly opposed to the Nazi march is Sol Golstein a 64yearold emigre from Lithuania He recalls the Gestapo tossing his mother starved but still alive into a mass grave When men went back the next day they saw the earth move  I dont know what would happen to me if I saw a swastika in front of house The ACLU has defended free speech for Nazis before In 1960 for example it represented George Lincoln Rockwell the late American Nazi Party leader and about 1001 members resigned but the incident created nothing like the Skokie stir What has changed is not the Nazi threat  there are still barely 1000 of them in the country  but Jewish sensibilities In 1960 most American Jews were solid partners in the liberal coalition Today many see themselves as abandoned by their former allies on a host of issuesincluding affirmative action blackcommunity cont nil crime and Israel Several affiliates report that many people blame the ACLU for high crime rates In May 1977 500 persons many of them apparently Jewish  gathered outside its New York headquarters to protest its protection of criminals Weve had enough shouted the crowd When an ACLU spokes either but the rights of criminal defendants had to be protected a demonstrator screamed You ought to be raped and mugged then youd know what were all about  Viewed in this context Skokie is less cause than symbol for Jewswho until recently made up 40 percent of the ACLUs membership One Jewish woman recently wrote that for years I have been watching with dismay a lot of A7LU actions and saying to myself sooner or later theyll he defending Nazis Now lo and behold here you are defending Nazis Another grouping disaffected over the defense of the Nazis is the ideological left Marxists and other radicals have long been ambivalent about the organization At the beginning  1920  the ACLU was overtly a leftwing organizat ion an offshoot of the American Union Against Militarism a group of pacifists and reformers opposed to United States entry into World War 1 The ACLU quickly became involved in defending the left from the notorious Palmer Raids and other acts of political repression In the 1930s it shifted toward political respectability Spearheaded by Norman Thomas a leader of the Socialist Party a faction on the board moved to purge Communists from its leadership Following the NaziSoviet pact it expelled one of the ACLUs founders Elizabeth Gurley Flynn because she was a party member Twentysix years later in April 1976 the board voted 32 to 18 to repeal Flynns expulsion finding that it was not consonant with the basic principles on which the ACLU was founded But between those dates it did some other things that most of its current leaders admit were hardly reconcilable with its basic principles The 1950s were a particularly bad decade for the ACL11 as they were for many American liberals Responding to coldwar pressures the board ordered that membership applications specify that the ACLU welcomed only those whose devotion to civil liberties is not qualified by adherence to Communist fascist KKK or other totalitarian doctrine More important it dodged many issues in that witchhunting era declining to fight blacklisting and holding that the death sentence against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg raised no civilliberties issues By 1951 IF Stone and several other civil libertarians formed the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee to augment the ACLU but with guts enough to fight the evils of McCarthyism without fear of being sullied by the label of proCommunist Only last year did it become clear just how bad things had gotten Under the Freedom of Information Act the ACLU obtained documents revealing that in the 50s five key officers of the organization maintained questionable contacts with the FBI and that one of them served as an informer providing the bureau with information on ACLU members It is to the Unions credit that when Aryeli Neier its executive director discovered the incriminating information he promptly made it public along with a statement condemning the contacts as a betrayal of ACLU principles Through the 1960s and early 1970s the Marxist left and the ACLU managed to bury their differences in the common fight against the war and Richard Nixon But with the disappearance of those unifying issues their divergent perspectives have reasserted themselves Last April 20 for example Aryell Neier journeyed out to the Brooklyn Law School to debate the issue with with Marshall Perlin a National Lawyers Guild member who has represented a long line of leftwing political dissidents It had been a tough clay already for Mr Neier It was Hitlers birthday the day the Nazis had originally planned to march in Skokie And that afternoon the Jewish Defense League had staged a demonstration at ACLU headquarters presenting the director with an extraordinary work of art  a brass plaque engraved Presented to the ACLU on Hitlers Birthday Our graves are flooded with blood and tears Our graves are crowded with the bones of our babies and families Where are you our brother the plaque affixed to a large board covered with pictures of concentration camp ovens the whole thing covered with broken glass and simulated blood The irony was powerful for Mr Neier is a German Jew and was born in Berlin on April 22 1937 His mother told him that she had struggled to prolong her pregnancy so he would not be born on April 20 and thus have to watch the storm troopers marching through the streets to celebrate the birthday he would have shared with the Fuhrer The Neier family left Germany when Aryeh was 2 but he lost three grandparents and several aunts uncles and cousins in the Holocaust First to speak was Mr Neier whose moon face and chubby torso disguise a rapier intelligence and formidable debating skill The right to free speech is always tested at the extremes he said Rarely are centrist groups denied their First Amendment rights It is almost always fringe groups people who are provocative who select that place where they are disliked the most because that is where they can get the most attention Isnt that what Martin Luther King did at Selma For that very reason it is the extremes that have the greatest interest in protecting the rights of their enemies Once the freedom of one group is abridged that infringement will be cited to deny the rights of others The people who most need the ACLU to defend the rights of the Klan are the blacks The people who most need the ACLU to defend the rights of Nazis are the Jews Marshall Perlin a big bear of a man began with a disclaimer I dont wish to Oppose free speech But Mr Neiers remarks have an abstract neutral quality The law is not neutral The courts are not neutral The ACLU is not as neutral as it pretends The ACLU did not defend the rights of Communists in the 1950s Why should it be defending people like the Nazis and the Klan today We were wrong in the 50s Mr Neier snapped But our failures then Aryeh Neier executive director of the ACLU He wants to leave batting at least 300 David Goldberger who represented the Nazis in court Would he let them march in his own neighborhood Defending them is like having them march there shouldnt be invoked as an excuse for comparable failures today It was tough in the 50s to defend Communists and we ran away It is tough now to defend the Nazis and the Klan That is why it would be wrong to run away again Mr Perlin shot back When you talk abstractly about the First Amendment you are ignoring the rights of blacks which are in imminent and real danger now Suddenly Mr Neier raised his arms against the blackboard his voice shrieking in highpitched mimicry of Mr Perlin Theres a clear and present danger to take over the USA and therefore we must suppress rights Thats a lie and you know it Aryeh Mr Perlin exploded Im not talking the way the Supreme Court did in Dennis All Im saying is the Klan real The Klan is dangerous Youd better wake up to that before it is too late Mr Perlins sensitivity was understandable for Mr Neier had shrewdly noted the similarity between the lefts arguments for suppression of its enemies and the rationale the Supreme Court used in the 1950 Dennis case permitting an abridgement of Communists First Amendment rights because the party posed a clear and present danger The left argues that the ACLU shouldnt maintain rights for the Nazis and the Klan not only because they are presently dangerous but also because if they came to power they would deny those same rights to others That argument has been around a long while too John Milton the spiritual father of free speech exempted Catholics from his plea for liberty In Aereopagitica he wrote I mean not tolerated popery and open superstition which as it extirpates all religions and civil supremacies so itself should be extirpate     It is no coincidence that Mr Perlin focused on the Klan cases rather than the Nazi suit While the Nazis currently endanger only Jewish sensibilities the Klan poses a real physical threat to blacks both North and South Indeed the Klan cases have stirred much more debate than Skokie within the organizations ruling bodies The California case grew out of an attack in November 1976 by 13 black Marines at Camp Pendleton on what they thought was a Klan gathering It turned out to be the wrong group but before they discovered their mistake the blacks had severely injured five whites The Marine Corps brought criminal charges against the blacks held them inordinately long in pretrial detention and prevented them from seeing civilian counsel Meanwhile the corps summarily scattered 15 Klan members to bases around the country The case split the Southern California affiliate into warring camps The affiliate itself based in Los Angeles represented the black Marinesbut its San Diego chapter defended the Klansmen The Lawyers Guild says that this is poisonous evenhandedness that the ACLU is canceling itself out and hence betraying the cause of civil rights Cecile Podoloff coordi sponds The Bill of Rights is the AC LUs only client The Mississippi case has been even more troublesome It developed after the Harrison County Board of Education which has been implementing a school desegregation plan refused to let the Klan hold a rally in a school playground on a Saturday The Grand Dragon called the ACLUs Mississippi office and the executive director accepted the case By a narrow vote the affiliates board approved the decision but all seven blacks on the board resigned in protest When the Klan later sought to switch its suit from state to Federal court the board reversed itself and refused to take the case citing the Klans record of violent acts against blacks The Klan then asked the national ACLU to take the case and its board voted 4715 to do so holding to its principle that speech and assembly as distinct from illegal action must be protected Bitter recriminations followed Mississippis representative on the national charged that Aryeh Neier told him they had to represent the Klan because Jews would never understand if they defended the Nazis in Skokie but dropped the Klan case in Mississippi under pressure from blacks Dramatic as the Klan cases are ultimately they posed little more legal difficulty than Skokie For they too are relatively straight freespeech cases and the ACLU has a long history of taking virtually any First Amendment case offered to it First Amendment cases still have top priority as in the ACLUs current petition that the Supreme Court review its recent decision permitting surprise police searches of newspaper offices The decisive dilemmas facing the organization today are in different areas One overriding question is how far the ACLU should move from a focus on core civil liberties to a broader range of political and social issues The Union has already shifted rather decisively in this direction As late as 1960 the organization was still a relatively small 45000 members outfit heavily concentrated in New York devoted principally to filing amicus curiae briefs in freespeech and dueprocess cases In 1964 Charles Morgan Jr opened a Southern regional office in Atlanta and largely through the force of his iconoclastic personality dragged what was by then the rather elitist organization into the battle to secure the rights of black people Henceforth rights of equality  those embodied in the Thirteenth Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and hithero pigeonholed as civil rights rather than civil liberties  commanded an increasingly important place on the ACLU agenda If civil rights woke the organization out of its coldwar lethargy the Vietnam war plunged it directly into the social activism of the 60s One turning point was the Spock trial of 1968 When Dr Benjamin Spock and four codefendants were indicted in Boston for counseling draft evasion the national board initially declined to take the case because it feared it would raise noncivil liberties issues such as the legality of the war But after the Massachusetts affiliate took the case the board reversed itself in a wrenching decision that led to a batch of resignations Behind the opening wedge of the Spock case the group pushed ever more deeply into the war issue defending many draft resisters and military dissidents By July 1970 following the Cambodian invasion and Kent State it had traveled so far that it could pass a resolution calling for the immediate termination of the war Watergate and impeachment took the ACLU even further into matters which some of its members still regarded as political In September 1973 after some bitter wrangling and a 515 vote it became the first major national organization to call for Mr Nixons impeachment It followed with a series of fullpage ads in major papers appealing for funds to pursue the matter The ads were launched with great trepidation  Continued on Page 18 Charles Morgan Jrwho resigned as chief of the ACLUs Washington office after a feud Den Hogan Chorlen Nazi leader Frank Collin goosestepping past the police who protected him during a speech in Chicago ACLU Continued from Palm 11 some officers feared a disaster  but they were a staggering success helping attract a record 50000 new members in 1973 alone Again it was Chuck Morgan from his new base in Washington who led the impeachment charge brandishing his flaming sword This made some board members nervous among them Edward J Ennis then the ACLUs chairman who wrote several memos urging circumspection The strains surfaced at an executivecommittee meeting when Mr Ennis and other members joined in criticizing Mr Morgans zeal The Washington director felt that Aryeh Neier did not adequately support him and this set off a bitter feud You have to understand Chucks experience in the South to see why he was so angry at Aryeh one staffer recalls When you are battling the Klan and the White Citizens Council down there you expect perfidy from your enemies but you also demand absolute loyalty from your friends He felt betrayed by Aryeh Mr Neier on the other hand is not a man who permits himself much public emotion Most members of the organization regard him as one of the brightest people they have ever met but he is pure undiluted cerebrum His prodigious intellectuality is relieved only occasionally by chess and J S Bach One staffer recalls an impromptu celebration in her office the day the Vietnam war ended Mr Neier looked through the door and remarked coolly I dont see this as a victory Theres no First Amendment in North Vietnam One man who knows him well says Aryehs substance is left but his style is right He was elected in 1970 as the candidate of the left and in the early years often in close working partnership with Chuck Morgan he was responsible for pushing the organization into some of its boldest positions But increasingly he came to feel more at home personally with the cool traditionalists on the board least at home with the passionate progressives And when Aryeh doesnt respect you intellectually you cease to exist for him For a time it was a shootout in the libertarian corral and ultimately the cool marksman Nazi Frank Collin right is jostled by a protester near the Partys Chicago headquarters from New York got his man When Mr Neier chastized him in 1976 for speaking out on the Presidential campaign without sufficiently separating his position from the ACLUs Mr Morgan took high umbrage and chose that as the occasion on which to resign as Washington director About the same time Melvin L Wulf the ACLUs legal director resigned after differences with Mr Neier and Mr Dorsen The turmoil of recent years including the membership decline management imbroglios Skokie and the battles with Mr Morgan Mr Wulf and the boards left wing took their toll on Aryeh Neier Last year he decided that he wanted to leave within a year Chairman Dorsen a New York University law professor with a magic touch for healing organizational wounds urged him to stay on a while so it would not appear that he was resigning under fire on Skokie Mr Neiers own pride was justifiably involved as a friend explains Aryehs like a baseball star who had some big 350 seasons but has just off of 230 ones He wants to go out with at least a 300 season under his belt Finally in April he announced his intention to leave in early fall A committee has been formed to seek a successor As of this writing the two principal candidates from within the organization are Ira Glasser the volatile earthy executive director of the New York affiliate and board member Monroe H Freedman a cool but quirky gadfly who is professor of law at Hofstra The two men are often seen as representing competing wings  Mr Freedman the traditionalists and Mr Glasser the progressives  though they themselves maintain they are closer on most issues than is generally recognized Both men agree that the essential task before the organization is to apply 18th and 19thcentury libertarian principles to 20thcentury settings They also agree that it must be rigorous in establishing genuine civilliberties issues in the new areas rather than merely for essentially political activity The principal difference between the two men is temperamental on his record Mr Glasser would be somewhat more eager than Mr Freedman to find suitable grounds for extending the ACLUs reach The debate over such extension is complicated by the apparent lessons of recent years Most ACLU leaders now recognize that its vast growth between 1965 and 1975 was somewhat artificial built on people who were less interested in civil liberties than in fighting the war or Mr Nixon It is widely believed that most of those who quit over Skokie were people who were never committed to perhaps never even understood the First Amendment The dilemma is a complex one In the palmy days of the Warren Court the ACLU did not need a large membership or a full treasury to win battles it merely filed a brief before a generally sympathetic court But with the Burger Court hostile to many of its concerns the emphasis has shifted to lobbying and public education To win these days says John F Shattuck the new Washington director we need clout out there in the country On the other hand there is intense awareness that the ACLU can never aspire to anything like majority support By definition civil liberties are rights against the majority The need is to maintain if not a majority then at least a substantial constituency for what are often called the core rightsparticularly the First AMendment rights of speech and assembly without which no other rights can be assured But as the organization seeks to widen its constituency by expanding into other areas there is concern as to whether the conflicts engendered will erode the constituency for the core rights For example Catholics who might rally around the First Amendment are alienated by the ACLU stance on abortion and Jews were put off by its opposition to Allan Bakke Im not worried about alienating people we wouldnt be doing our job unless we did says Rolland OHare one of the traditionalists on the board But I do get worried when we start making it difficult to defend the things we care most about The argument is carried furthest by Alan Dershowitz a professor of law at Harvard and a former board member who feels the ACLU shouldnt be trying to develop new constituencies The Union should be like an accordion he says In some decades it should expand in others it should contract The ACLU is merely a limited insurance policy against specific types of repression When that repression isnt there we shouldnt try to expand to fill the vacuum Some critics accuse the ACLU of doing just that They point to a speech Mr Neier gave at a conference in 1976 in which he noted that in the postwarandWatergate doldrums the only segment of 60s activists still able to generate widespread excitement was the movement for womens rights Somewhat later Mr Neier described the organization as the legal branch of the womens movement Indeed under vigorous prodding from the womens caucus on the board  the only caucus in the organization womens issues have gained an increasingly important place on the agenda In October 1977 the board voted to designate as its No 1 priority the campign to guarantee women the right to choose an abortion Do we really feel thats the No civilliberties issue in the country a skeptical board member asks or are we trying to tap into the vitality of the womens movement A number of areas into which the ACLU has expanded aggressively during Mr Neiers tenure have aroused relatively little controversy within the organization One is the effort to guarantee constitutional rights to people confined in institutions  jails prisons mental hospitals training schools for children and nursing homes for the elderly settings in which until recently rights were regarded as barely applicable and virtually unenforceable There are other issues that still sharply divide the board A recent question that developed considerable heat was whether the ACLU should support a suit by an Idaho factory seeking an injunction against inspections by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration without a warrant Originally the board voted to side with the company holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches applied to safety checks on corporations but then by a 3020 vote it reversed itself Ultimately the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the company The most divisive issue of all these days is a perennial debate about whether the ACLU should get into what is called economic rights The left on the board has long argued that people cannot exercize their constitutional rights without an adequate income Rosa Parks [the originator of the Montgomery bus boycott] couldnt have gotten on that bus without a nickel says Ellen Feingold a leader of the fight At a recent meeting another board member thundered By our silence we would be defending the status quo Opponents argue that such arguments seek to equate civil liberties and social justice while they are very different things At last Decembers meeting the board passed 3730 a rela ACL U lawyers in Los Angeles who represented black Marines at Camp Pendleton Their clients had been engaged in a battle with white Klansmen defended by others in the ACL U Mississippi Klansmen The ACLU defended their right to hold a schoolyard rally tively mild resolution which held that when there is a direct and substantial connection between poverty and particular deprivations of civil liberties and civil rights the ACLU will support positive governmental action to mitigate the effects of poverty But it voted down 2916 a much more farreaching resolution declaring that the right of gainful employment ought to be recognized as the fundamental right of every American Much of the board believes the most pressing matter facing the organization is not economic rights for the poor but the ACLUs own economic survival The longterm membership slide and its severe impact on revenue forced cutbacks in program and staff Management consultants concluded this spring that the organization was in deep financial trouble They traced the trouble less to its involvement Free speech is tested in the extreme The people who most need the ACLU to defend the rights of the Klan are the blacks in controversial issues like Skokie than to what they call systemic weakness In particular they blamed disastrous management of the membership department inadequate recordkeeping and poor communications with members Those familiar with the situation say the ACLU did not adapt quickly enough to the transition from the easy impeachment days when according to an office joke you could send out a letter reading Dear Sir Screw You and get back 20 Such bland selfassurance probably led Mr Neier and others to ignore membership details Membership dues support all the organizations First Amendment activities Some critics of the Skokie defense argue that the Nazis had enough money to engage their own lawyers and an organization that depends so heavily on Jewish money shouldnt be paying to represent a group that wanted to kill Jews To which an ACLU official responds We have never had a means test here The New York Times has plenty of money too but if they want our defense on something like the Pentagon Papers we would be glad to defend them Of late Mr Neier has poured much of his personal energy into raising money from foundations Indeed the management consultants give him credit for a superb job in raising 2 million in such grants However these monies are designated for specific projects like those on womens rights privacy and censorship Some critics worry that the increasing reliance on earmarked grants permits others to set too much of the ACLUs agenda Mr Neiers hope of going out with a 300 season depends largely on the success of a special fundraising appeal signed by David Goldberger which has already raised some 500000 and on the Free Speech convocation which drew 1700 people and with corporate underwriting may raise another 250000 The convocation also served to rally the organizations spirits badly dampened by the recent turmoil particularly Skokie Bruce J Ennis the ACLUs new legal director sees Skokie as a good thing because it weeded out the people who dont really believe in civil liberties Jules Feiffer a speaker at the convocation luncheon said much the same thing in his own oblique style Skokie he said raised several questions Why cant we come up with a better class of victims Whatever became of victims like Eugene Debs Mythic victims Victims you could hang around with Who would enhance status But there are still some ACLU members who believe in standing up for any victim who is denied his constitutional rights One is the man from Miami who responded to the Goldberger appeal with a check and three words Defend the bastards  Norman Dorsen

The List of U.S. Senate Candidates in Massachusetts Is Complete,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/09/archives/brooke-the-shooin-is-now-brooke-the-vulnerable.html,Politics too often is not good theater anymore There are too many polls too much targeted direct mail even too much for elected officials to do You can go a week even Texas without hearing a funny political story and rare the candidate with the nerve to shout crook in a crowded field Most places anyhow But Massachusetts is striving be true to its traditions With the field of candidates completed last week a United States Senate race that six weeks ago seemed to be dying for lack of a cast let alone a script now has the potential for an entertaining fullscale brawl Recent elections in Massachusetts have been dominated by charges of corruption bruising personal campaigns and attacks on opponents integrity That has been true mostly elections for state offices but Senator Edward W Brookes campaign this year for a third term may be different As recently as early May the race lacked spark True polls showed Mr Brooke had serious potential weaknesses including questions about his personal finances But with his pOlitical skill bankroll and liberal support he seemed have scared off most serious opposition He still has the money and the skill and the energies that Massachusetts teachers displayed in collecting the signatures needed to put him on the ballot suggested that liberal support had not deserted him But he is in trouble now largely because of the recent revelations that he lied about his finances under oath in a divorce proceeding  What makes this of interest to people outside the state that Mr Brooke is more than just another senator He is one of the more important liberals in the Republican Party which last month saw Senator Clifford P Case of New Jersey knocked off by a rightwing challenger And he is the partys leading black  the Senates only black  honored just last month with his picture on the cover of the Republican publication First Monday The legend on the cover said Experience and Integrity We have an awful lot invested in Ed a highranking Republican official said pointing to the earnest efforts by Bill Brock the party chairman to recruit blacks into the ranks The investment was not so great that it kept the Republican leadership from wondering whether some other Massachusetts liberal such as Elliot L Richardson the former secretary of all things or Representative Margaret M Heckler might take a shot at Mr Brooke in the Sept 19 primary The leaders did not actually promote opposition but it is understandable why they might think about whether they had to lose not only their leading black but a precious seat in the Senate in addition They have only 38 But because of both feelings of loyalty to Mr Brooke during his hard times and worries that a challenge probably would be fruitless no liberal joined conversative Avi Nelson in the primary Mr Nelson a radio talkshow host has avoided personal attacks concentrating instead on hitting the Senator hard on conservative issues such as school busing abortion and the Panama Canal treaties which Mr Brooke voted for Mr Nelson is looking for registration switches in South Boston to help him against a black Senator with a liberal reputation But hardly anyone thinks he could win in the generally liberal state in November so Republicans are counting on Mr Brooke against a Democratic field that has grown bigger and more confident Their main hope is that Massachusetts voters will share the view of a liberal woman who in a conversation last week about the Brooke divorce was overheard by a leading Democrat to say I think its a family affair and we ought to stay out of it The acid nature of the Brooke family soap opera may encourage that attitude combined with a worldly assurance that everybody lies about property in divorce cases People in the Brooke camp believe that is indeed happening and there is no evidence to contradict them But even the Senators most dedicated supporters think he has been hurt and may be even more so by investigations under way or likely to be begun by the Senate Ethics Committee and state authorities Even if these produce nothing by Election Day Mr Brooke has already lost something precious to a politician  the idea that he cant be beat The Democrats are waiting to take their turn Two of the three leading candidates Paul Guzzi and Kathleen Sullivan Alioto entered after the divorce disclosures The news also enhanced the opportunities for Representative Paul E Tsongas the most serious Democrat in the race before then It has even had to be encouraging for Howard Phillips an ultraconservative Republican born again into the Democratic fold where he feels he will do well among the many liberals and for State Representative Elaine Noble another early entrant She is an able politician but her lack of much money and her acknowledged lesbianism do not make her formidable statewide candidate There is less emphasis among the Democrats on issues partly because it is early partly because most of them have fewer substantive disagreements with Mr Brooke than does Mr Nelson the Republican So far the race is not lively for what anyone is saying Mr Guzzi the Secretary of State and the favorite because statewide he is the best known drove his car into a tree the other day Mrs Sullivan Alioto a serious Boston school committee member talks in football metaphors her father owns the New England Patriots and campaigns doortodoor with her husband former San Francisco Mayor Joseph L Alioto Mr Tsongas who has good fundraising potential from others of Greek descent tries raising issues such as foreign policy and economic development but his early campaign was characterized by a friend as suffering from terminal earnestness Nobody is calling Mr Brooke a crook openly and course he denies he is one They mutter about it as they used to complain that the newspapers never investigated him They fear a backlash and dont want to make him martyr The informed political guessing is that someone will discover sooner or later that he or she is losing and will take off the gloves But now it is midsummer not a very political time and even Massachusetts cannot make up its mind whether to take its politics raw or refined Adam Cl_vmer is a reporter for The New York Times who covers politics and Congress Massachusetts rivals Republicans Edward W Brooke left and Avi Nelson Democrats Kathleen Sullivan Alioto Paul Guzzi and Paul E Tsongas
"Powell Either (a) Leads, or (b) Follows Very Well",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/09/archives/powell-either-a-leads-or-b-follows-very-well.html,WASHINGTON  Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr a 71yearold Virginian who is inevitably described as courtly is emerging as a pivot at the ideological balance point of the United States Supreme Court More so than any of his eight colleagues on the high behch when Justice Powell votes on the complex and controversial issues before them he winds up in the majority helping make the law of the land rather than protesting that it should be otherwise This was never more dramatically demonstrated than on the climactic day of the 197778 term which closed last week when he announced the judgment of the court in the case of Allen P Bakke With his colleagues evenly divided on two issues Justice Powell cast the vote that struck down the medical school admissions quota challenged by Mr Bakke and then joined the other half to support the general legality of special preferences for minorities aimed at remedying proven past discrimination Because of his unusual position as the sole Justice who Mild speak for both majorities in the case he alone wrote the supporting language that became the law of the historic case And in six full terms on the court Justice Powell has quietly amassed a record of standing wth the majority far more than the otheiJustices with only 75 dissenting votes 852 cases That record is subject to two opposite interpretations He could be a leader in the Courts private deliberations who strongly influences others to join him to produce a majority or a follower who acutely senses the majority position early and moves toward it The members of the Court naturally resent anyimplication that their individual decisions reflect political or personal rather than purely legal considerations but the confessional secrecy with which the Justices cloak their debates tends to invite such speculation Though in the early terms of the Burger Court the four Nixon appointees voted together 70 percent of the time and almost always in the majority during 197778 the unanimity of the four dropped to 36 percent so that one of them who remained in the majority 79 percent of the time as Justice Powell did obviously had strong allies In the most important decisions that the Court has handed down during his service Justice Powell because dissents so infrequently has been almost indistinguishable from the Court itself He voted for the legalization of abortion and for a new code of restrictions on obscenity in 1973 In 1977 he wrote the 63 majority ruling that permitted states to restrict Medicaid abortions With all his colleagues he voted to compel President Nixon to give up the Watergate tapes in 1974 That same year he voted to avoid decision on the DeFunis reverse discrimination case agreeing that the controversy was legally dead because the plaintiff was about to graduate from law school On capital punisment he was one of four dissenters from the 1972 ruling ofunconstitutionality But he supported the validity of three state laws that the Court approved in 1977 and voted with the majority against two others Justice Powell is very much a member of the legal and the Southern establishments Before joining the High Court he served for more than 30 years in Richmonds largest and most influential law firm During a term as chairman of the Richmond School Board he was regarded as a racial moderate helping to achieve peaceful integration in 1959 On the basis of his civilian record business interests had hailed Justice Powells elevation to the Supreme Court as the arrival of a friend Most business cases involve conflicts between commercial interests and the Government the Burger Court ruled for business 54 percent of the time during the past six terms and Justice Powell 64 percent He disqualifies himself from participating in decisions more than any of his colleagues presumably on the ground that he owns stock in a corporation or industry that could be affected When he was confirmed in 1971 he had a net worth of over 1 million including stock in 30 corporations Inside the sanctum of the Supreme Court conference  the only other person allowed in the room is the man who arrives at 11 AM with the cinnamon toast  Justice Powell may or may not wield great influence We can only guess When actual votes are taken in order of seniority he would not cast his until seventh but he would almost certainly have made his position clear during the debate By his own account he has little personal contact with his colleagues outside the conference room In a 1976 speech he reported that informal interchanges between the Justices on cases other than by written memorandum were minimal Justice Powell has tended to blend into the scenery through most of his service Although his opinions have been clearer and more succinct than some of his colleagues he has not acquired a reputation for literary style or wit But his starring role in the Bakke case was only one example his recent tendency to distinguish himself from the background Chief Justice Burger disapproves of dissenting Justices presenting their views from the bench or even of long recitations by the authors of majorities But Mr Powell claimed his right in the closing days of the term to voice two testy dissents one upholding a Tennessee dam against the endangered snail darter the other protesting another day in court for an alien with a long criminal record One of Justice Powells potential sources of influence with his colleagues is the fact that he has an impressive professional record as a private practitioner Although he never served before on the bench or in the Justice Department he has been president of the American Bar Association the American Bar Foundation and the American College Trial Lawyers Like most of his colleagues Justice Powell has expressed his legal philosophy almost exclusively through his votes and opinions since he joined the Court In 1976 however he told the American Bar Association that the Burger Courts decisions in criminal law cases had produced a more traditional and in my view a sounder balance between protecting the public and the accused Earlier as president of the bar association Mr Powell urged the press and television to exercise appropriate restraint in coverage of criminal trials and maintained that the constitutional guarantee of public trial was never intended to protect any right of the public to be entertained or even to be informed of current events Shortly before his nomination the Virginian wrote a long private memorandum to the United States Chamber of Commerce recommending ways to promote broader support for the free enterprise system and attacking Ralph Nader the consumer advocate among those who openly seek destruction of the system Warren Weaver Jr covers the Supreme Court for The New York Times Fred Ward Black

Dukakis Delays on Budget Despite Threats by Unions,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/09/archives/dukakis-delays-on-budget-despite-threats-by-unions-30000-more-not.html,BOSTON July 8 AP  The Massachusetts Legislature completed work on SS billion budget early today but Gov Michael S Dukakis delayed his signing of the measure despite threats of unspecified action by unions representing 42000 state workers who have not been paid since June 29 Before recessing the Legislature overrode earlier vetoes by Governor Dukakis of sections of the budget to ban public financing for most elective abortions one of the issues holding up the proposed budget Yesterday leaders of Council 93 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees said that if the budget were not signed by Monday there would be major action Governor Dukakis was waiting for the legislative session to end before signing the bill so he could veto some sections of the budget without fear of being overridden Among the sections he opposed was a circuitbreaker that would provide income tax rebates for real estate taxes that exceed a fixed proportion of household income He expressed hope the Legislature would wind up its business over the weekend so he could sign the budget in time to start issuing paychtcks Monday The state is already contending with walkout by 300 prison guards at state institutions The guards walked out on Thursday over the paycheck question Last night employees at Wrentham State School for the retarded walked off their jobs Administrators and volunteers were caring for the estimated 1200 mentally retarded children and adults 30000 More Not Paid Besides the workers covered by the council about 30000 other state employees have missed one paycheck In addition 80000 of 140000 welfare recipients have not received payments totaling 10 million and the state has issued 24000 emergency food vouchers worth 800000 The state has been unable to pay 78 million in bills most of them owed to private hospitals nursing homes and other medical facilities The sections that Mr Dukakis attempted to strip from the budget would restrict state financing of abortions for poor women except to save the life of the mother or where rape or incest was involved The abortion question dominated many days of legislative debate and maneuvering on the budget primarily because of the Governors opposition Last year he vetoed five measures opposing abortion and although easily overridden in the House his vetoes were sustained by the Senate This time it was different Vetoes Overridden In the Senate one veto was overturned 23 to 11 the others were overridden 24 to 12 with the Senate president Kevin B Harringtoncasting the decisive vote to provide the necessary twothirds margin The House votes were well above the required twothirds margin Civilian personnel in the Corrections Department including lawyers social workers computer operators and administrative aid5 walked the cellblocks at Walpole and Bridgewater state prisons and the Southeastern Correctional Facility for the criminally insane State police officers have manned the perimeters of the institutions since Thursday when the guards and other workers walked off Full shifts have reported to work at the Norfolk Concord and Framingham reformatories State corrections officials reported no inmate disturbances at any of the institutions
Watching the Soviets Watch Television,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/09/archives/watching-the-soviets-watch-television-watching-the-soviets-watch.html,Anyone familiar with the Nielsen or Roper conclusions about American televisionwatching habits might recognize the following statements  Housewives are among the heaviest consumers of television programs  Both men and women over 55 or 60 watch a great deal more television than do younger people  The poor spend many more hours in front of the set than do middle or highincome groups  People who have had little formal education much more often fall into the category of TV addict than do people with more education  College graduates tend to be more critical of the programs they see on television and are therefore less satisfied with the daily fare  People turn to television mainly for entertainment Ellen Propper Michietvicz is Kathryn W Davis Professor at Wellesley Collette and professor ofpolitical science at Michigan State University She is currently writing a book on mass medici audiences in the Soviet Union What is perhaps surprising is that these statements apply not only to American society but equally and sometimes with even greater force to the society of the Soviet Union Indeed these are the findings of a series of scientific surveys which the Russians themselves have conducted and which have only recently become available to Western students of Soviet society it has been only in the past decade or so under Leonid Brezhnevs reign that the renewal of such public opinion polling was encouraged and supported The close similarities in TVviewing habits are extraordinary because at first glance the medium  and the message  are so different in the two societies One basic difference is the result of the Russians belated recognition of the importance of television they were much slower than we to approach the era of mass saturation of television sets In America the 1950s was the period when we approached saturation as households we were captured by the beginning of the 60s But in the Soviet Union television has become available on a mass basis only relatively recently In 1960 there were 5 million sets there by 1975 due to an intensive program of production and distribution that figure climbed to more than 55 million sets And more than 65 million sets are manufactured  by nationalized industry of course annually Whereas by now 955 percent of the households in the United States have at least one TV set the proportion for the Soviet Union is still considerably smaller  about twothirds of the nations households But official policy in the Soviet Union now decrees mass saturation and that goal is rapidly being approached The 1980 Olympics will surely give the final push In terms of sheer number of hours of total television transmission the four channels in the Soviet Union do not yet match our volume Their first channel  the only one entirely in color broadcasts about four hours in the morning and after a midday pause to midnight The second and fourth channels begin programming at 5 in the afternoon The fourth channel features such entertainment fare as theatrical films variety shows and plays the second channel has more programs of local interest and less ambitious features The third channel carries strictly instructional television geared particularly to lessons for school children and adult education courses It does not enjoy much popularity In 1978 there were 410 television stations throughout the Soviet Union  Unquestionably the content of Soviet TV programs is considerably different from ours Inasmuch as programming is made centrally and must conform to official Soviet notions of what is permissible and desirable the shows all have a didactic flavor  they are used to socialize or mould the citizenry Consider Russian quiz and game shows These are very popular but they are not exactly The Price Is Right or 20000 Pyramid One show called A nuka devushki Lets Go Girls is telecast once a month for 90 minutes Prizes are modest  flowers or books  and contestants are chosen and perform as members of professions or occupations the object is to popularize the various professions and encourage initiative and good job performance For instance when a group of policewomen performed on the show their act consisted of a closeorder drill to music using their nightsticks followed by suggestions for improving traffic signs Other game shows promote family activities and sports There is a popular crime series but it hardly resembles Starsky and Hutch or Baretta Called The Experts Investigate it focuses on the work of the police the storylines are based on material from the police archives however theres no violent sensationalism and the social origins of antisocial activities are underscored as are the infallibility and efficiency of the police Similar in tone were two recent and popular series about Soviet spies during World War Il Another dramatic series In Our Circle approaches American soap opera but with a difference  it recounts the daily life of the Kuznetsov family but minus adultry abortion and other negative developments Yet perhaps the most popular serial program is Incredible But True the host of which is the son of the famous Soviet physicist Peter Kapitsa This program which claims an audience of more than 150 million is telecast semimonthly and examines popular scientific subjects Two other series that have enjoyed tremendous popularity are imports the American show Lassie and the British Broadcasting Corporations dramatization of The Forsyte Saga In addition to the serial programs the Russian viewer prefers feature films  many of which are from Socialist countries  and variety shows Entire operas ballets and symphony concerts are also telecast but audience surveys indicate that these are of far more interest to the highly educated than to the average viewer And finally there is a heavy commitment to childrens programs and news programs Programming for children includes morning cartoons stressing proper conduct and morality and after school a variety of programs nature and travel instruction in games and sports readings and dramatizations of literature There are also special quiz and games competitions for teams of children with the emphasis on collective cooperative striving for goals The lives of military heroes and other famous Russians are presented as models for emulation The most important news program Vremia Time is telecast for halfhour several times a day The format begins with news of the Soviet government then domestic mainly economic news then regional news still domestic  and next international news It closes with about three or four minutes of sports and two minutes of weather Altogether the domestic items take up almost twothirds of each halfhour telecast Of course news in the Soviet Union is what the government chooses to inform the populace  Surprisingly despite these profound and obvious differences the impact of television on Soviet society has been much the same as here For one thing other types of leisure activities have been eroded since the introduction of television As in our country listening to the radio reading books and going to the movies and the theater have all declined For example in the United States between 1950 and 1960 the average number of movie visits per urban inhabitant declined from 21 to 12 In the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1976 the average number of movie visits per urban inhabitant fell from 22 to 16 A recent survey of tilmgoing patterns found that as a result of competition from movies on television each month Moscow movie theaters lose about lion sales or roughly 18 million sales a year This amounts to roughly 15 percent of the planned goal of ticket sales for the year As the newness of television wears off movie attendance may climb upward but it hasnt happened yet Advocates of television there as well as here point to the possibility that television may stimulate other leisure activities Just as in the United States novels drainatized for Soviet television often sell phenomenally well after the programs have been shown Yet it is sobering to note that for every increase in books read or movies and theater presentations attended there is a fivefold decrease due to television In addition social activities are on the wane Visiting friends and relatives even conversation is decreasing Soviet citizens go to lectures less often a gigantic speakers bureau the Knowledge Society blankets the country with lectures on all subjects participate in recreational club activities less spend less time on hobbies In direct contradiction to the norms or goals of Soviet socialism they have become on the whole less social and less personally creative These overall figures tend to mask great differences among social classes and other groups within the Soviet audience Not all groups there have responded in the same way to the television revolution Education seems to play a crucial role in the Soviet citizens readiness to change his habits At the lower reaches of the spectrum people with a fourthgrade education or less estimated at roughly 15 to 20 percent of the adult population of some cities and higher in rural areas television has eliminated virtually all other media and leisuretime activities For this group addiction is not too strong word the set is on virtually all the time Yet programs on political and social subjects a high priority item in the Soviet Union are simply not understood by 93 of these viewers At the other end of the spectrum the college graduate in the Soviet Union watches much less television  some onethird less  than the national average of 12 hours per week Furthermore people who have graduated from college are largely critical of the TV fare offered And they have not on the whole allowed the introduction of television to erode their reading habits American college graduates in the early days of television were wary of the new medium and watched much less than the national average But their viewing time has been increasing over the years and they now watch only about 30 minutes a day or 16 percent less than the national average Differences among groups within the television audience there and here also depend on what options the citizen has that is how much else is available and interesting outside the home and also how much can be afforded For example in both societies the process of aging carries with it changes in life style There is decreased mobility sometimes infirmity Older people are usually living on a pension and that introduces financial constraints Television watching goes up for this group Its also very high for the very young who seem to have an inordinate fascination with the small screen Children under 15 in the Soviet Union are now spending at least as much time in front of the in Poor people can ill afford entertainment other than television in the United States they spend more time watching television than does any other group This is true in the Soviet Union as well Although they are not termed poor people living in Soviet cities who are poorly educated migrants from the countryside are relatively disadvantaged As a social group they are virtually impervious to Soviet media and culture They try to maintain rural patterns of life and tend to cluster in areas of cities where they can do so their income and job mobility is limited they dont read newspapers much if at all they do not go to theaters movies or museums their friendship contacts are limited But they do watch television And the rural disadvantaged at the bottom of the national income scale are the heaviest television consumers of all even if it means going to a friends or relatives house to watch Although there are 15 times fewer sets and less free time in rural areas than in the cities rural people spend 12 times more hours watching television And some 42 percent of the  Certainly the impact of television on Soviet society has been marked but has had ambivalent implications Whether considered from the point of view of official policy or of maninthestreet satisfaction there have been both advantages and disadvantages There are definitely ways that television viewing has aided the goals of the Government  quite apart from the obvious one of adding still another medium of communication that can be utilized to indoctrinate the population The Soviet Union is a vast country with a large and dispersed rural population many of whom have little education And there are literally scores of different ethnic groups some 120 different languages are spoken in the country Television provides a standardized message it helps to narrow the very real differences among regions ethnic groups and between rural and urban populations Particularly for rural people isolated as they are and relatively out of touch with modern life television may provide the only effective image of a dynamic modernizing Soviet polit ical culture It is a powerful tool with which to forge a single national culture Television brings another benefit It absorbs time that might be spent just hanging around It shortens the amount of time that might otherwise be available for what are termed antiso dal activities  drunkenness rowdy ism juvenile delinquency  and the simple timewasting that the authorities frown upon On the more positive side Soviet sociologists are encouraged that television helps keep the family together But there are contradictory implications as well Leisure time is becoming private There is a decline in socially oriented organized activities People are staying at home more closed in ones own family This is the opposite of that collectivist social spirit so important to Soviet goals in character education Inward rather than outgoing private rather than participatory  this may be the personality type emerging It is also a passive type Soviet critics of television point out that it has undermined personal creativity  making things doing things Amateur musicmaking folkdancing and hobby groups have all registered declines as television has entered the scene This too differs from the goal of the creative individual who objectifies by making  mantheworker in Marxian doctrine The television viewer is very much the Perhaps the most potentially disturbing effect that television has introduced is its effect in increasing discontent For the masses of rural viewers the urban life they see portrayed on television throws into startling relief the tremendous disparities between town and country living It makes the hardships of rural life much harder to bear Since the introduction of television in the Soviet Union the number of people who have become dissatisfied with rural life has doubled The striking similarities in the impact of television in two societies as different as the Soviet and our own suggest that there is something about the technology itself  something abaft the magnetism or hypnotic effect of the small screen  that changes peoples lives all over the world It is true that the decision to produce television sets and price them for mass consumption and household ownership was a critical choice that the Soviet leadership was not compelled to make They could for example have placed television viewing firmly in a social setting by establishing the club or political meeting place as the locus of the set That they chose the route of private mass consumption was surely related to the benefits they felt would accrue to their society by increased exposure to the medium The balance sheet has been complex and we are not yet at the bottom line  either in the United States or in the Soviet Union But we do know that the impact of television has been powerful everywhere and fraught with ambivalent consequences

COALITION CONFIRMS CAREY ENDORSEMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/09/archives/coalition-confirms-carey-endorsement-miss-krupsak-fails-in-bid-to.html,Miss Krupsak Fails in Bid to Attain Backing of Liberal Democrats The New Democratic Coalition yesterday reaffirmed its endorsement of Governor Carey dealing a blow to the gubernatorial candidacy of Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krunsak Miss Krupsak seeking at least psychological momentum for her candidacy had tried to reverse the coalitions endorsement of the Governor made on June 3 At that time she was still a candidate for Lieutenant Governor on Mr Careys ticket and was one of those who urged endorsement of the Governor Koch Lobbies for Carey Earlier yesterday she was believed to have enough strength to at least deny the endorsement to Mr Carey if not win it herself But with only about half the delegates present in a steamy auditorium at Washington Irving High School at 40 Irving Place in Manhattan Mr Careys endorsement was narrowly reaffirmed The vote was 793 weighted votes for reaffirmation of the endorsement and 783 against  Some of the top public officials affiliated with the coalition including Mayor Koch City Council President Carol Bellamy and Representative Elizabeth Holtzman lobbied and voted for the Gov_ ernor at the meeting A disappointed Miss Krupsak standing at the side of the auditorium said that its easier to be for an incumbent Governor  Noting that her candidacy was only 10 days old the Lieutenant Governor pledged that she would continue her campaign until the Sept 12 primary  The endorsement of the coalition the liberal wing of the Democratic Party was vital for Mrs Krupsak since it represented half of what was intended to be twin base of downstate liberals and up state Democrats for her challenge of Governor Carey in the primary A Major Setback Already having difficulty raising money and attracting the support of name Democrats Miss Krupsak is likely to find her fight for the nomination even more difficult after the coalition defeat The Krupsak setback at the second coalition meeting was somewhat surprising since there had been widespread expectations that she could at least deny endorsement to the Governor who has not been a popular figure among the coalition members Indeed on a preliminary procedural vote the Krupsak forces prevailed with just under a 60 percent majority Councilwoman Jane Trichter of Manhattan one of the most prominent Krupsak supporters at the meeting blamed the presence of Mayor Koch for the Lieutenant Governors defeat contending that some coalition members had been intimidated by his support of the Governor Robert Dryfoos Miss Krupsaks counsel and chief political adviser said that public officials affiliated with the coalition had pressured delegates to support the Governor However a top coalition official who has been publicly neutral and who asked not to be identified blamed the disorganization within the Krupsak camp They didnt make the phone calls he said Miss Krupsak also alluded to disorganization within her ranks by repeatedly noting that her campaign was less than two weeks old A notable absentee from the meeting was Bella Abzug who was endorsed by the coalition for Congress earlier this year and for Mayor last year She was reported by friends to be incensed over Miss Krupsaks decision to deemphasize her role in the campaign Miss Bellamy Miss Holtzman and Assemblyman Oliver Koppell of the Bronx spoke against the motion to withdraw the endorsement The most notable speaker for the mo tion was City Councilwoman Jane Trichter of Manhattan Arguing against the motion Miss Bellamy noted that the Governor had been endorsed by the coalition a month ago The issues have not changed and we are an issueoriented organization  he has fought our fight Miss Bellamy said She noted that the Governors position on abortion and the death penalty were identical with the position of the coalition Miss Holtzman urged that the coalition stick with its endorsement of the Governor by describing him as a politician of conscience and principle On an anticlimactic vote a coalition majority voted to endorse Mario M Cuomo for Lieutenant Governor but the endorsement vote fell just short of the 60 percent majority needed However by the time the vote was counted most of the delegates had left and James Chapin chairman of the coalition said he would authorize a mail ballot for the almost certain endorsement of Mr Cuomo The effect of the coalition action on the endorsement for Governor is largely psychological because the vote is not binding on the political clubs affiliated with the coalition just as the club positions are not binding on individual members Perhaps typical were the three largest clubs in Manhattan the heartland of the coalition The Village Independent Democrats took no stance on the Governor The Lexington Democratic Club backed Mr Carey and the Community Free Democrats of the West Side supported Miss Krupsak The New York Ttmes  Paul Mosetros Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak voting with members of New Democratic Coalition at meeting yesterday in Manhattan
City's Health Chief to Order Abortions by Lincoln Hospital in Bronx,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/11/archives/citys-health-chief-to-order-abortions-by-lincoln-hospital-in-bronx.html,New York Citys Health Services Administrator said yesterday be would order abortions to be performed at Lincoln Hospital  whose physicians have never performed abortions there  even if it meant brinairut in outside doctors Medical services at Lincoln a municipal hospital in a povertystricken area of the Bronx are provided by Misericordia Hospital Medical Center under an affiliation contract with the Roman Catholic medical center Because of the noabortion policy women in the neighborhoods surrounding Lincoln have had to seek abortion services at other hospitals even though it is Mayor Kochs announced policy to provide abortion services for poor women in the communities where they live However Axel Schupf the Health Services Administrator said yesterday through a spokesman that he was aware of the problem at Lincoln and had discussed it with leaders from Misericordia and New York Medical College The college which uses Misericordia as a teaching hospital was recently taken over by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York According to the spokesman the affiliation contract between Misericordia and Lincoln Hospitals allows Misericordia to refuse to perform abortions and is thus identical to the affiliation contract the Catholic hospital had with Fordham Hospital one of the old municipal institutions shut down two years ago and replaced by Lincoln Hospital The spokesman also reported Lincoln officials as contending that there was no pressing demand for abortions particulady from the predominately Catholic Hispanic neighborhoods that surround the hospital However Jane Johnson an official of Planned Parenthood of New York City said There is no question that there is a critical need for abortion services in that area of the city Mrs Johnson said that 900 abortions were performed at a Planned Parenthood clinic just down the street from Lincoln Hospital at 349 East 149th Street during the first six months of this year and that abortions involving women in their second trimester had to be referred to hospitals elsewhere in the borough Dr Frank Cicero the president of Misericordia said while there was no written prohibition against abortions is nevertheless our wish and desire that none be performed by a physician affiliated with our hospital In contrast with Misericordias prohibition Dr Joseph Cimino the chief executive of New York Medical College said yesterday that there was no prohibition against college faculty members performing abortions at nearby Metropolitan Hospital Center where medical services are provided by the college under an affiliation contract No Requests reported When asked to explain why no abortions were performed at Lincoln Monserrat Flores director of public affairs there said that abortions had been terminated at the old Lincoln Hospital and that when the new institution opened in 1976 no one requested our program Mr Flores also said that the hospitals Community Advisory Board did not want them performed either However Jesse Hamilton a member of the community board could not recall any such opposition He said that issue was now being discussed by a board committee headed by Julie Lozada In an interview Miss Lozada described the area served by Lincoln as crying for help in preventing unwanted births She said that her committee would urge the board later this month to propose to the hospital that an abortion service be instituted to meet what she said was a critically neglected situiation in the South Bronx While Congress has approved a law that bars Medicaid funds for abortions unless a mothers life is directly threatened or the pregnancy involves a case of incest or rape New York State has adopted a far more liberal position allowing Medicaid hinds for any abortion that a physician regards as medically necessary According to number of physicians virtually any applicant for a Medicaidpaid abortion meets the New York requirement In these cases the state has agreed to pay the 50 percent Federal share of the cost

Stage: Liviu Ciulei's ‘Spring Awakening’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/14/archives/stage-liviu-ciuleis-spring-awakening-a-directors-play.html,A Directors Play USING a student cast and an awkward play Liviu Ciulei has directed a partial view of the extraordinary talents of this wise and gifted director Mr Ciulei worked with the Juilliard Theater Centers upper classes late last year in what was intended primarily as a learning exercise rasher than a public performance The few performances that were given made considerable impression however and now Joseph Papp has brought the production to the Public Theater for a limited run It constitutes an introduction to New York of the Rumanian director who has worked on several occasions with the Arena Stage in Washington DC There among other things he put on stunning and revealing productions of Hamlet and The Lower Depths Spring Awakening is a much lesser play and in many respects it is both ungainly and dated Furthermore though the Juilliard cast is talented it falls short of fully developed professional standards That Mr Ciulei should make his New York debut under these handicaps shows a kind of magnificent disregard for smaller consider ations that marks the very large and humane approach that lights up his theater Time and again the director and designer  he combines both functions has found dazzling uses for his space and his actors Sometimes the effects stand alone as a kind of bravura comic emphasis but more frequently they work to deepen our understanding of the play bore holes in its frequent inaccessiblity and cast a new and moving light on what seems stilted and assertive In a style that alternates between naturalism and expressionism with arbitrary obscurities and a feverish anger Wedekinds play is partly a protest against the sexual hypocrisies of the turn of the century His adolescents are caught torn and destroyed in the conflict between their desires and the iron ignorance in which they are kept More broadly though it is an attack on the social despotism of the times For Wedekind the older generation was murdering its children not only by repressing their sexual instincts but by grinding them down with religious precepts and the demand that they compress all of their new life into a demanding and narrow course of studies  Of its three young protagonists the girl Wendla dies of an abortion after being thoroughly confused by her kind but foolish mother as to just how pregnancy occurs Melchior her idealistic and equally ignorant lover is sent to reform school after his parents turn their backs on him And Moritz the most pitiful  also the funniest he is the plays finest creation  kills himself after he fails his exams Spring which is being performed in a translation by Edward Bond has certain amount of faded rhetoric and makes a deliberate use of caricatures  mostly of the older people  that fade even faster than rhetoric But there is an unfaded freshness in the youngsters their dilemmas may seem dated though I suspect that they are not but their pain is unforgettable in its sharpness and in the luminous quality that it retains The high hurricane fence that runs the length of the stage divides the compressed world from the free one All the scenes controlled by adults take place behind it the school the parents bedrooms the meeting hall where a committee of professors votes to expel Melchior The scenes where the children are themselves exploring their pain take place in front of it on a stage covered with leaves Their very attitudes change as they come from behind the fence the constrained flirtatious squealing of three schoolgirls becomes an exuberant shriek as they race forwards onto the leaves From the first as we see him in melancholy profile against a bare white backdrop Moritz is marked out as victim Richard Franks performance is remarkable under Mr Ciuleis guidance he achieves all the comic resignation the effusive pedantry the desolate groping for attitudes that break off like straws in his hands I was a baby when I came here or would have come as someone else he says Just before he shoots himself but he says it ruminatively without bitterness The director has made sure that the young people are played with a light silvery quality that reflects their pain onto us instead of charging into it directly He etches the comedy behind the pain only rarely letting it take over It only takes over fully in fact in the comically stylized scenes in which the grownups posture among themselves It is very funny when Melchiors parents unlace each others corsets in turn as they discuss him angrily while preparing for bed Melchiors confrontation with his professors is also comical particularly when a tiny hallucination takes over the stage in the shape of four blueclad houris who clamber over the chief professors desk and into his lap But the best parts of the production softening the plays ungainlinesses and discovering its touching strengths are the lighter and less obvious touches with which Mr Ciulei maneuvers his young cast and accelerates its growth SPRING AWAKENING by Frank

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/15/archives/letters-careykrupsak-contest-the-real-issues-crime-protection-prime.html,To the Editor Traditionally in political campaigns political reporters and analysts tend to advance a major theme for each campaign and write their articles around that theme The Krupsak candidacy is no exception Understandably considering the nature of her announcement the theme advanced by political reporters including your own Frank Lynn has centered on Mary Anns being with the Governor one day and against him only a few days later The questions most often asked by the press concern this apparent turnabout While this theme is certainly justified considering recent eventsit has the unfortunate effect of preventing discussion of the real issues on which the gbernatorial primary should be fought As the Democratic state committeeman who nominated Mary Ann Krupsak at the Albany convention would like to state what this campaign is about in terms ofissues I think we must start by realizing that a new group of Democrats emerged on the political scene in recent years Carter Democrats is probably their most accurate label These Democrats have rejected the fundamental philosophy of Roosevelt Truman Kennedy and Johnson that the government has a responsibility for redressing social wrongs and improving the lot of the disadvantaged Whether it be Carter in the White House or Carey in the State House these Democrats have adopted the trickle down theory of government and economics which holds that the answer to social problems is giving benefits to business which will in turn trickle down to the lower classes Thus while the liberal wing of the state committee supported Governor Carey in his veto of the death penalty his funding of Medicaid abortions and his efforts to provide financial assistance to the beleaguered cities of the state we felt he had absolutely no concept of the role of government in alleviating problems of unemployment housing education health or transportation In fact state programs in these areas are virtually a void What this campaign is really about is a contest between two opposing political philosophies On the one hand is the traditional Democratic philosophy whether reflected in the WPA and CCC of Roosevelt the national health insurance program of Truman the Peace Corps of Kennedy or the War on Poverty of Johnson that the government must have a direct role in providing jobs housing education public transportation and health care for all its citizens On the other hand is the political philosophy espoused by Governor Carey that the function of government is to cut taxes and provide benefits for the business community Mary Ann Krupsak in her announcement has presented this difference in terms of communicating with the people in various areas of the state She has correctly pointed out that she has visited areas with problems whether they be dairy farms or changing neighborhoods has sat down with the people who live in those areas and has discussed possible solutions to their problems The implication is clear Where the assistance of the state government can help improve the quality of life of its citizens Mary Ann will commit her administration to providing that assistance As the campaign develops specific position papers will be issued to present in more detail Mary Ann Krupsaks programs in various areas I hope this will permit a changing of the theme for the campaign now advanced by the political reporters to one which emphasizes the substantial difference in the approach to government between Governor Carey and Lieutenant Governor Krupsak The choice for the voter will then be clear and we have the utmost confidence that those who vote in the Democratic primary will support the traditional Democratic philosophy of government involvement in social problems and reject the new philosophy of the Carter New York July 5 1978 To the Editor The news article by Peter Kihss on Mobs Role Discounted in Gambling June 26 was extremely interesting have been an admirer of the work of Jonathan B Rubenstein since his book City Police was published in 1973 Unfortunately Mr Rubenstein and Mr Reuter state in their current study that gambling arrests in New York City had declined from 11467 in 1963 to 5949 in 1971 and 1394 in 1975 because gambling enforcement had become lowpriority activity The fact of the matter is that the decline was due to political pressure from 1965 to 1975 From 1971 to 1975 and up to the present the decline was mandated by the Police Department hierarchy which did not want gambling arrests by the uniformed patrol officers The real reason for this move by the police hierarchy was well pinpointed by the Knapp Commission the inability of the ranking police administrators to stop corruption The police administrators solution no arrests by patrol officers except under specified guidelines the hierachy must protect its image Mr Rubenstein will find similar decline in street narcotic arrests by uniformed police officers Did this policy of hands off street gamblers and narcotics pushers stop corruption Of course not just review the records of the Special Prosecutors office The winners organized crime because their profits increased The real pawns the police officer and the community In closing let me add that during 1965 to 1975 I was commanding officer of three detective squads and three police precincts in New York City Stony Brook L1 July 41978 Prime Inflation Fighter To the Editor Inflation is now the meanest threat to the welfare of our country Only by legally enforceable wage and price controls can this menace be opposed successfully No other action has been suggested that can be seriously effective Such controls worked very well twice in the past with only insignificant faults Its opponents are primarily those who now have the power to inflict rising prices and wages Yorktown Heights NY July 8 1978 To the Editor Try as one can it just isnt possible to be rid of anxiety concerning the social and political health of West Germany Refusal of that countrys largest television network to include Holocaust in its programming [news story July 3] confirms this judgment Granted that Holocaust might not have been the best rendition of that horrendous episode in recent German history its still better than nothing For Peter SchulzeRohr program director of Stidwestfunk to brand the series as garbage is unacceptable No less satisfactory is his further rationale for dismissing the telecast for incorrect costuming and for a writers interpretive license to insert the visits of relatives to Buchenwald inmates Such details he says would confuse German audience notably its youth Which is preferable one can retort ignorance or confusion Some knowledge or none The attitude of Peter SchulzeRohr and that of other West Germans who oppose the showing of Holocaust is baleful indication that a significant percentage of the population doesnt wish to be reminded of the Nazi past even for objective and therapeutic reasons Added to the recent rightwing violence in the Federal Republic this incident forcefully argues that the embers of National Socialism still burn in thnt Rockville Md July 4 1978 To the Editor Taking On the Undertakerleditorial July 2] seems to be a major sport in this country today When the President of the United States past and present takes on the press everyone hides behind the freedomofpress bit Perhaps undertakers could if they had at their disposal a newspaper hide behind the freedom of choice that every American is entitled to Since when has it been a newspapers job to dictate what people must do about burying their dead Burying ones dead always has been a very personal thing which the Federal Government or the press should have very little to say about No one has taken the time to print the good things about funeral directors The only picture that you found fit to print was that drawn by Jessica Mitford which seems strange to me She has certainly made huge amounts of money from belittling the funeral directors and on top of that gets free exposure in your paper It might interest you to know that most of the funeral homes in this country are small mom and pop type operations and they are among the few remaining service businesses where individuals dedicate a lifetime of understanding helping and getting involved with the people they serve and the community they live in By far the greater number of funeral directors in this country are communityminded and are neighborhood friends The funeral director is on call 24 hours a day is there when people need him and according to Federated Funeral Directors of America nets about 150 per funeral If a person making 300 a week buys a 20000 yacht no one gets too upset Let him buy a 2500 funeral and everyone gets in the act Doesnt seem fair to me Yes there have to be some bad apples in the funeral industry and certainly they should be thrown out But by and large the funeral industry serves a need in this country and is doing a superb job Even the FTC report is based on a very minute percentage of the total Perhaps it is time that someone did an indepth study of the good points of funeral service rather than slanting the reports just to sell papers I have been a funeral director for nearly 30 years and have dedicated my life to serving my community and my friends I am proud of this I am willing to bet that 99 percent of the people have served would agree that they got their moneys worth and a whole lot more Ellenburg Depot NY July 3 1978 To the Editor Few issues have a more profound impact on the conduct of government today and on the opportunities of our children in the future than the financing of public schools Since New York Connecticut and many other states now have this issue before them it is important that information about programs in states which have begun to face the problem be full and accurate New Jerseys Public School Education Act of 1975 redesigned the states system for governing local education and altered its program for financing local school districts This law like many school finance topics sometimes lends itself to simplistic analysis In a recent editorial you condemned the small percent of new state aid which the 1975 act directed to the 23 districts with the lowest perpupil property values This ignores the fact that New Jersey increased its state payments to local school districts by almost 250 million in the half decade before the 1975 act went into effect Of this money 45 percent went to these 23 districts even though they included only 13 percent of the states public school pupils As a result the states share of local budget expenditures in these districts increased from 34 percent in 197172 to 57 percent in 197576 before the 1975 law was implemented New Jerseys 1975 act was intended to extend this partially equalizing system to more districts It is too early to demonstrate conclusively whether this has been accomplished but the trends appear to be moving in the desired directions The percent of school districts with budgeted per pupil expenditures within 10 percent of the statewide average has increased from 40 in 197576 to 42 in 197677 to 46 in 197778 Furthermore the states contributions to local budgets in the 23 poorest districts now approximates 65 to 70 percent Excluding the special case of Newark these 23 districts have increased their per pupil expenditures under the new law more rapidly than the state average even though they have enjoyed the greatest decline in property tax rates New Jerseys 1975 Public School Education Act did more than distribute aid it focused on the education of children and established a set of procedures to hold school districts account able for their own performance The act obliges the Commissioner of Education to review school programs and expenditures and it gives the Commissioner the authority to direct districts to change those programs or increase those expenditures if they are not constitutionally

Rules for U.S. Funds To Pay for Abortions Tightened by H.E.W.,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/15/archives/rules-for-us-funds-to-pay-for-abortions-tightened-by-hew.html,WASHINGTON July 14 UPI  Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare issued regulations today tightening the rules under which Federal funds may be used to pay for abortions Three changes he announced were as follows The two doctors who certify that the abortion is necessary must be financially independent of each other Under the law Federal funds may be used for abortions only when two doctors certify that the mother will suffer severe and longlasting damage Mr Califano said the financial independence requirement would eliminate conflicts of interest The names and addresses of both the victim of rape or incest and the person reporting the crime must be listed The law allows Federal money for abortions in cases of rape or incest if the crime is reported to the police or public health officials within 60 days Previous regulations required only the address of the victim When doctors certify that the mothers health would be affected without an abortion the name and address of the patient must be given to state and Federal authorities The old regulations required only the name Mr Califano said that therequirement for addresses would enable state mull HEW officials to ascertain the appro prilkness of payments for abortions
Lutheran Church in America Elects Its New President,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/16/archives/lutheran-church-in-america-elects-its-new-president-given-a.html,CHICAGO July 15  The Rev Dr James R Crumley was elected president here today of the Lutheran Church in America with 31 million members the third largest Protestant denomination in North America Special to The New York Times Dr Crumley secretary of the organization since 1974 received one vote more than the needed majority on the sixth ballot defeating the Rev Dr William H Lazareth 337 to 330 Three votes were declared invalid The vote was taken at the biennial convention of the Lutheran Church in America which was formed from fourgroups in 1962 Dr Crumley will replace the Rev Dr Robert J Marshall president since 1968 who is Moving to a mission post with the Lutheran World Ministries Dr Lazareth had been based with Dr Crumley at the New York headquarters serving for two years as director of the Department of Church and Society Earlier today on the fifth ballot the Rev Dr Herbert W Chilstrom president of the Minnesota Synod had been eliminated Given a Standing Ovation 1 accept this position with fear and trembling said Dr Crumley as the 670 clergy and lay delegates gave him a standing ovation He said that he recognized the enormity of the position from having worked just down the hall from Dr Marshall Dr Crumley a native of Bluff City Tenn attended Roanoke College in Virginia and Lutheran Theology Southern Seminary in South Carolina He served in Greenville and Oak Ridge Tenn and in Savannah Ga before moving to New York The 53yearold minister never attended a full liturgical service until college But he said that he gained a profound experience of God from my family and neighbors in the hills In college Dr Crumley said he became a logical positivist which prepared him to be pastor for 150 PhDs in his congregation in Oak Ridge a city populated by many atomicenergy scientists But then he said today I noticed that scientists had the same problems as people in East Tennessee and I realized the biggest privilege anyone can be given is the caring of souls Emphasis on Pastoral This emphasis on the pastoral was the mood of the convention as Dr Crumley said that he is not an administrator Dr Marshall has been credited as a skilled manager who has raised church income modernized church structure and stressed ecumenism The Lutheran Church in America is generally regarded as the most liberal of the Lutheran groups in comparison with the Lutheran ChurchMissouri Synod with 29 million members and the American Lutheran Church with 24 million There are occasional talks about greater contact with these groups as well as with the smaller Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches but Dr Marshall said recently that the promise of Lutheran unity that seemed so bright 10 years ago has not been fulfilled Seen at the convention held at the Conrad Hilton Hotel the Lutherans were one of the most wellmanaged and organized of the religious denominations While Roman Catholic conventions are often noted by the gaps between conservative bishops and spiritually minded local activists while Jewish conventions are marked by sharply worded political and intellectual differences among rabbis and while other mainline Protestant conventions are noted by bitterness over such issues as abortion homosexuality and womens rights the delegates of the Lutheran Church in America got along wonderfully When someone raised a question about Illinois not ratifying the proposed equal rights amendment or the issue of ordaining homosexuals his statements were duly noted without debate While some would like the church to adopt more specific directives Dr Marshall said I believe that would be a mistake The church does its best when it provides basic principles rather than a multiplicity of regulations Not that the organization lacks for regulations By today the amount of written material distributed to all delegates was four inches thick  most of it accurately numbered for inclusion in a notebook duly provided to all When decisions on amendments seemed close delegates would stand and be counted by redjacketed pages all of whom carried hand counters and clicked their way through the flock The delegates were so organized that they had to have green attendance cards initialed at each session to be eligible for expense money from their home synod They were so diligent at attending that not one tennis racket was seen being carried in the first four days of the convention in contrast to several other denomination conventions recently But good sturdy Lutheran joggers were seen out at Grant Park every morning at 6 long before official business Associated Press The Rev Dr James R Crumley
Catholics Reassess Views on Spiritual Movements,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/16/archives/catholics-reassess-views-on-spiritual-movements-findings-are.html,Officials of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn are reevaluating some basic assumptions about their congregants as a result of a recent study taken by the diocese Perhaps the most important finding was that spiritual movements like Charismatic Renewal Cursillo and Marriage Encounter have produced many of the most loyal and active parish mem bers rather than leading spiritually minded Catholics out of parish life People are saying they dont want just teaching they want spiritual experiences in the church said the Rev Michael J Dempsey director of pastoral communications for the diocese which covers Brooklyn and Queens As a result of the study one of the most farreaching ever conducted by a religious group in the metropolitan area many parishes may change some aspects of fundraising preaching parish activities and outreach programs Findings Are Corroborated The study also corroborated findings by other Catholic studies that many of the most loyal Catholics do not accept or are confused by changes in church policy in the past generation and that church at tendance continues to decline The information was gathered by trained members of the diocesan staff who distributed more than 8000 questionaires in 15 selected parishes and received 2129 responses They are convinced the results reflect the attitudes of the estimated 12 million Catholics who make up more than a quarter of the 45 million residents of Brooklyn and Queens However because of the ethnic makeup of the diocese officials say their study would not reflect any other area of the United States The survey was conducted in four languages English Spanish Italian and French Creole for Haitians One major finding was that IrishAmericans who make up only 10 percent of Catholics in the diocese account for 34 percent of persons attending mass By contrast ItalianAmericans comprise 55 percent of the diocese but only 22 percent of the attendance and Hispanicspeaking persons make up 30 percent of the diocese but only 17 percent of the attendance Historical Reasons Cited There are historical reasons for these differences Father Dempsey said citing anticlerical attitudes in Italy and Puerto Rico in the past But Father Dempsey added This information makes a big difference in raising money or planning programs because we can identify the population attending mass and not attending The various spiritual movements which have brought new fervor to many Catholics have been fostered by moreemotional roots of Catholicism Both Cursillo weekend meetings stressing Catholic values and Marriage Encounter a retreat for married couples began in Spain and have been adopted by many Christian groups around the United States Irish Catholics never talk about their spirituality Father Dempsey said But now the feeling seems to be if you have a holy person let him shine Many church officials had assumed that spiritualism and new values would lead many Catholics out of the church as suggested by the Rev Andrew Greeley in his book The Communal Catholic However in Brooklyn communal Catholics are right at the hub of the church Father Dempsey said Somewhat Stronger Beliefs The Brooklyn study agreed with the findings two years ago in the Yorkville neighborhood on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that Catholics who attend church regularly have somewhat stronger beliefs than professed Catnolics who do not attend church While 89 percent of regular attenders belieVe in the sacrasment of penance as forgiveness from sin only 61 percent of nonattenders believe in penance There were similar discrepancies regarding premarital sex and eternal punishment for serious sin The same gap showed up in a recent survey conducted by the Gallup organization for 29 religious groups The common theory is that many people dont go to church because they dont like the sermons or they had a fight with the priest Father Dempsey said This study shows there is more to it than that While Sister Kathleen Kelly a staff leader said she was pleased with the kindly attitude particularly on social issues officials were not heartened to note that even among regular churchgoers only 68 percent agreed with church opposition to abortion only 65 percent agreed on premarital sex and only 56 percent agreed about divorce One curious discrepancy was that 62 percent of nonattending Catholics believed in hell but only 43 percent believed in eternal punishment for serious sin Dont Have to Go There They can believe in hell as long as they dont have to go there suggested Brother Timothy Walsh the research analyst Only 30 percent believe it is unnecessary to compromise principles to get by in the world while 45 percent believe certain deeds and omissions are always sinful The great majority accepted the informal trends in recent years  lay involvement in the mass the greeting of peace during the mass folk masses ecumenicism A third of all interviewed wanted the traditional Latin mass available to those who miss it Nearly twothirds expressed confusion about recent changes and attendance at mass has apparently dropped from 44 to 40 percent in the past decade The study also showed that women accounted for 638 percent of attendance and males only 269 the balance did not answer that question One major difference between the Yorkville study and the Brooklyn survey was that people in Brooklyn seemed to complain more about priests and parish activities Diocesan officials felt that people in the varied neighborhoods in Brooklyn expected more from the church than people in the impersonal highrise world of Manhattan
Lessons in How to Film The Troubled Psyche,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/16/archives/lessons-in-how-to-film-the-troubled-psyche-pysche.html,Capturing the disturbances of the mind on film poses tricky problems Mental states are invisible film is the medium of the visible image In translating one into the other it is easy to be overly explicit clumsy or downright fanciful Moreover the sea of mental illness does not provide material for plot in the usual senseneurosis and madness are not events Popular movies on this subject often compensate by exaggerating the dramatic and theatrical elements of mental illness Even the better ones among them do not always escape this danger Insanity is rarely as mythically compelling as it is in Equus the schizophrenics visions usually do not come in the vivid Technicolor of I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and whatever the horrors and stupidity of mental institutions people with the robust good health of Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest rarely get admitted there for any length of time But Channel 13s series Psyche Films on the Mind offers a welcome antedote to the popular psychological melodramas The series which began last Tuesday with the contemporary Dreamspeaker includes three other rarely shown films The Quiet One which will be telecast this Tuesday at 10 PM Wednesdays Child which will be shown the following Tuesday July 25 at 930 PM and Secrets of a Soul which will be shown on Tuesday Aug The four films are only loosely con nected by a common theme they were made at different times and offer different perspectives on the causes and nature of mental illness But each of them represents an interesting solution to the problems in filming internal states and taken together they provide a historical overview of the techniques that filmmakers have used in giving expression to this elusive subject Secrets of a Soul chronologically the earliest although the last to be shown in the series is of special historical interest Made by Joseph Pabst in 1926 it was the first attempt to dramatize the process of psychoanalysis and contains some of the earliest experiments in translations of inner workings of the mind into visual equivalents The film was written and produced with the consultation of Dr Hans Sachs and Karl Abraham two of Freuds disciples and probably with the unofficial advice of Freud himself Its subject is classic psychoanalytic case completely with all the paraphernalia of dreams repressions and sexual disfunctions and in its technique the film tries to imitate the process of psychoanalysis To explain the condition of its protagonist a middleaged professor who finds himself gripped by a knife phobia after a dream in which he stabs his wife Pabst alternates scenes of his daytime life his memories and his dreams The daytime scenes contain events and images which in the dream sequences reappear endowed with symbolic meaningfor example a statuette of the Virgin Mary that his wife gives him is associated with his unfulfilled desire to have a child in the dreams he has that night Through the alternation of day and nighttime scenes Pabst tries to suggest how unconscious feelings can transform perceptions and charge ordinary objects with extraordinary meaning After the stabbing dream all nights take on a potential character for the professorand Pabst indicates this by running a glinting highlight over a knife as the professor looks at it The dream sequences are an ambitious attempt to visualize the contents of the unconscious itself They are replete with a whole lexicon of Freudian symbolsrushing trains towers the planting of a seedling tree The images in the dream scenes whirl float loom in odd sizes and weird juxtapositions spaces become distorted and movements are freed from laws of gravity These sequences resemble many sur realist films made in the same period but they are also a testimony of Pabsts very literal faith in the picture of the self that psychoanalysis provides Pabst clearly believes the material lodged in the unconscious has been defined and described by Freudand that there could therefore be a onetoone correlation between subliminal Popular movies often exaggerate the dramatic and theatrical elements of mental illness Feelings and images When Pabsts camera enters the professors psyche what it finds there is as concreteif not as stableas the physical world The Quiet One which chronologically follows Secrets of a Soul is its polar opposite in technique Rather than conjure up images of what is hidden in the psyche it conveys its protagonists state by showing his external circumstances The film made in 1949 by Sidney Meyers and Helen Levitt is a docudrama based on the case history of an emotionally battered sevenyearold boy It was unusual for its time filmed on location in Harlem at the Wiltwick School for Delinquent and Emotionally Disturbed Boys and its narration was written by James Agee Like the neorealist films of the same decade The Quiet One sees the self as inseparably connected to its environment The psyche is shaped and molded by external conditions feelings are responsive to those conditions and can be inferred from them Therefore the internal condition of the protagonist is conveyed by images of his experiences encounters and surroundings The film progresses through a series of realistic scenes of Harlem life Donalds unhappiness and aimless boredom are suggested by shots of dismal streets and bleak interiors Later his restored health is associated with the pastoral setting of the Wiltwick School Symbolism is scant in the film But while all the images are realistic in content they are filmed expressively to reflect Donalds perceptions and needs Stark lighting heightens the sense of desolation detailsfor example the sound of footsteps under a bridgeare carefully chosen for their evocative power To emphasize the sense of oppressiveness the camera often duplicates a childs point of view Buildings are seen only halfway up and stairs ascend interminably into cavelike inhospitable doorways The scenes of Donalds encounters with people who affect him are marked by the same combination of realism and expressiveness The short episodesa fight with the grandmother who reluctantly keeps Donald in her house a visit to his mother who hardly notices himare glimpses of ordinary events but in a few telling details they condense a long history of indifference and rejection The direct method of conveying Donalds subjective experience suggests that the psyche is not an arcane obstruse place but that it is simply The narration is also straightforward Agee uses the vocabulary of intuition rather than analysis to pene trate and describe Donalds inarticulate feelings The premise of the narrative which is also true of the visual footage in this film is that the self can be grasped whole in the round as if interior and outer experiences were indistinguishable from each other The method of The Quiet One is to give a threedimensional picture of the protagonist in which his emotions and his circumstances are correlates of each other Wednesdays Child made in 1971 is very much a product of the psychological culture It presupposes to a greater extent than the other films an audience that is familiar with psychological concepts and the process of therapy Its director Kenneth Loach was clearly influenced by RD Laing a psychiatrist whose writings on schizophrenia received wide recognition during the 60s One of Laings contributions to the theories of schizophrenia was his description of schizophregenic families which by subtle emotional lies and manipulation destroy one of the members hold on reality Wednesdays Child dramatizes Laings insights by depicting such a schizophregenic family that pushes an adolescent girl over the brink of insanity Because the subject of the film is family cell that collectively produces an illness the focus of the film is distributed among its members And because the girls state is seen as a function of her relationships the progress of her illness is shown almost entirely through interpersonal situations A number of encounters and confrontations with her family and therapists delineate the emotional web in which the girl is caught The encounters dramatize the manipulative strategies that eventually derange the her mothers attempt to control corrupt and often completely deny her experiences as when she refuses to acknowledge that her daughter is pregnant while simultaneously insisting on her getting an abortion The girls condition can be guessed from these manueversit is a logical conclusion to an emotional syllogism The manipulative strategies are indicated almost entirely through dialogue language is as important as image in this film which in fact resembles a filmed drama or a psychodrama To give some idea of how deeply they are lodged in the girls consciousness certain phases are repeated over and over like motifs The mothers favorites are What will come of this younger generation and I know what is best for you The emotional charge of some of these phrases is understandable only by reference to Laings theories I know what is best for you for example has especially insidious connotations signals the mothers desire to control and appropriate her daughters feelings and is an important clue to the sions movements and occasional symbolic gestures she draws a baby on her stomach after the abortion and destroys her fathers clock to kill time are the most obvious signs of what she is experiencing But mostly her subjective state is indicated through a configuration of relationships The film presumes the audience knows what schizophrenia is about and that it can derive its own conclusions about the impact of her parents lies and manipulation on her psyche Dreamspeaker which was shown last Tuesday is probably the most startling presentation in this series Unlike the other three films it does not try to account for its protagonists disturbance at all Much of the film is muffled in an eerie silence and extraordinary events are shown without any explanation Madness in this film is treated as a mystery for which no rational analysis is adequate and the images are chosen to intensify that mystery instead of clarifying the main characters subjective experiences they reinforce its opaqueness But in each of the other three films an interpretation of mental illness is reflected in the choice of visual style and technique How mental states are captured in images depends on what the filmmaker thinks they are And judging by the variety of approaches represented in this series that continues to be a puzzle which taxes and challenges the filmmakers and skill
"Biological, Ethical Questions About Laboratory Conception Are Great",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/16/archives/can-there-be-new-forms-of-life-before-birth.html,If all goes well within the next two or three weeks the first human fertilized within the artificial environment of a culture medium will be born at Oldham General Hospital 190 miles outside of London Heralded as the worlds first testtube baby the infant the product of the union of a sperm and an egg within the confines of a tiny laboratory dish containing special nutrient formula The method  known as embryo transfer  was designed to aid conception in women with malforma dons in the Fallopian tubes which ordinarily carry newly fertilized egg to the womb By means of embryo transfer physicians are able to bypass the Fallopian tubes and convey the fertilized embryo from the laboratory apparatus directly to the uterus More than just an aid to conception however the method if successful promises to provide an opportunity understand and profoundly influence the process human reproduction For one thing the technique will probably provide scientists with useful new information about normal fertilization Were still at a very early stage in our understanding of human conception says Dr Luigi Mostroianni Jr professor and chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania In addition the advance could aid the study of the harmful effects of drugs and Xrays on developing embryos This might help establish guidelines concerning tolerable levels of drug and Xray exposure luring the first few days of life Despite its promise as a research tool some scient fists remain skeptical regarding the effectiveness embryo transfer They point out that in the case of diseased or severely narrowed Fallopian tubes the possibility still exists albeit a small onethat fertilization may have occurred normally rather than in a test tube According to this view only the total absence of Fallopian tubes could provide absolute proof of the underlying effectiveness of embryo transfer Along with these reservations concern has been raised that children resulting from the procedure could exhibit physical or mental defects Although performed routinely for years in other species the methods safety has not been verified in man or even among other primates If the child born at Oldham Hospital should turn out to be abnormal in any way the whole procedure will be finished says Dr Mostroianni We must remember that present technology doesnt enable us to predict all of the longterm effects of the manipulations involved But if the method does prove safe new and potentially controversial applications will not be long coming For one thing since the embryo can be implanted within the mothers uterus it is likely that the same embryo could thrive within the uterus someone other than the mother Scientists foresee little difficulty in accomplishing this feat other than synchronizing the ovulation cycles of the two women by hormone injections At the critical moment three days after the testtube fertilization  the embryo transfer could then take place in either the mother or her substitute Beyond the technical problems lie even more complex ethical and social questions If embryo transfer involves a husbands sperm and wifes egg family relationships shoul4 remain stable But in instances where one woman provides the uterus for an egg donated by another who should be considered the childs real mother Or as one gynecologist quipped Which one gets the Mothers Day cards Extending this scenario some sociologists are projecting a wombs for hire industry in which women who are unwilling or psychologically unable to complete their pregnancies may pay someone else to do it for them Most scientists agree however that babies will never be fully incubated outside the womb as described in Aldous Huxleys Brave New World Others fear that widespread embryo transfers may further heat up the already hotly contested abortion issue Since many more embryos are prepared than are actually implanted some ethicists are already inquiring about the fate of the discarded embryos Would they ever be used in future transfers on another woman for instance whose eggs turned out to be less than optimum asks Dr Leon Kass physician and Henry Luce Professor of the Liberal Arts of Human Biology at the University of Chicago And who decides about discards Shall we leave it so that discarding laboratorygrown embryos is a matter solely between the doctor and his plumber At this point most scientists agree that future medical applications of the embryo transfer technique are likely to remain limited to a small number of patients For one thing the test tube method must now compete with recent developments in reconstructive surgery for damaged Fallopian tubes After such operations many patients formerly considered permanently sterile have borne children by natural means Future surgical breakthroughs in Fallopian tube repair might further diminish the demand for embryo transfer In addition for every successful transfer in subhuman species there are hundreds of failures A similar situation would almost certainly be encountered largescale human embryo transfers Embryo transfer is a technically difficult procedure that will not be generally available for a very long time if at all cautions Dr Mostroianni But even if the number of successful takes can be increased the current epidemic of medical malpractice suits is likely to prevent most obstetricians from performing this experimental procedure of still unproven safety and effectiveness In the case of malformations would the doctor be at fault Could the parents sue for malpractice Further could the deformed child at a later time sue for wrongful life or the failure of the physician or the parents to obtain his informed consent These are only some of the many harrowing legal questions that may result from embryo transfer operations Answers must be found before embryo transfer becomes a practical or commonly accepted medical procedure Richard M Restah is a neurologist and the author of Premeditated Man Bioethics and the Control of Future Human Life
Women Reject Krupsak Race To Back Carey,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/17/archives/women-reject-krupsak-race-to-back-carey-new-york-political-notes.html,Striving for equality in politics women politicians have generally been united in supporting major women candidates in recent elections But that is not so in this years statewide elections in which two women are running for major Mimes  oneof them the states highest elected female official Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak Both Miss Krupsakwho is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination against Governor Carey and Dolores Denman the former Appellate Division justice who is running for the Democratic nomination for State Attorney General have less support among major women politicians than their male opponents Among the leading women politicians supporting the Governor for example are City Council President Carol Bellamy and Representative Elizabeth Holtzman both considered possible United States Senate aspirants in 1980 Miriam Bockman the Manhattan Democratic leader State Senator Linda Winikow Karen Burstein the Public Service Commission member and Barbara Fife the chairman of the Reform Caucus of the Democratic State Committee Miss Krupsaks leading supporters among women politicians are Bella S Abzug and four members of the New York City Council  Jane Trichter Ruth Messinger and Miriam Friedlander all of Manhattan and Mary Codd of Staten Island The explanations for the strong feminist support of the Governor include his positions on such issues as abortion and the death penalty his appointment of women to his administrntion and Miss Krupsaks lastminute entry into the gubernatorial race when many women politicians had already made committments to the Governor Mrs Denman was also a late entry into the Attorney General contest and is almost unknown outside western New York Her opponent Borough President Robert Abrams of the Bronx who has been unofficially running for four years has been endorsed by al most every major female officeholder including Miss Krupsak when she was still the Lieutenant Governor candidate However Mr Abrams is not returning the favor He has endorsed the Governor No major female officeholder has yet publicly endorsed Mrs Denman The Lieutenant Governor said she was not surprised when female politicians supported the Governor Why shouldnt women have the right to do what is safe and easy like men she asked On the Republican side there are no women seeking statewide office Two aspirants for the Attorney General nomination Rita E Hauser and Jane P Gilman were rejected by Perry B Duryea the GOP gubernatorial candidate and party leaders In the tradition of party discipline they did not take their case to the rankandfile Republican voters in the Sept 12 primary Buttressing Governor Careys reputation as a hard man to work for is the fact that two of his top aides are now laboring for his opponents Tom Lewis who was Mr Careys speech writer until recently is now putting antiCarey words in Miss Krupsaks mouth At the same time Mr Careys former communications director Harry J ODonnell is now communicating against the Governor as a top aide of Mr Duryea Finally two other recent refugees from the Carey staff CarolOpton the former deputy secretary and James Vlasto the former press secretary are laboring for Stephen Berger an aspirant for the Democratic nomination for State Comptroller Mr Vlasto had a falling out with the Governor last year The Koch administration keeps promising to clean up Times Square but one of the biggest eyesores

strategist and manager respectively a key behindthescenes role is being played by a 24yearold assistant to Mr Garth Philip Friedman who graduated from Harvard just last year Despite hissouth Mr Friedman has been active in New York campaigns since 1970 and working with Mr Garth since 1974 He is in effect Mr Garths alter ego in the campaign working on organization scheduling and even

More Pain for Those Choosing Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/18/archives/more-pain-for-those-choosing-abortion.html,The opponents of abortion are bringing two more measures into the House of Representatives this week which treat women who choose legal abortion as a group apart undeserving of the equal protection of the Federal laws One measure the pregnancy disability bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect pregnant women against discrimination in employment  except those who have abortions The second would forbid the United States Commission on Civil Rights from considering abortion issues on the ground that abortion is not a matter of civil rights The very proposal of the first measure contradicts the premise of the second The civil rights proposal should be easy to reject The commission an independent nonpartisan advisory agency has the power to study and report on any subject in the broad area of civil rights although it has no power to enforce its views Its studies of discrimination and pertinent legislation in the fields of education housing and employment have helped to keep Government agencies on their toes and to inform Congress and the public about progress against discrimination In its 20year life the agency has produced only one major study of abortion but that 1975 document apparently earned it the enmity of the foes of abortion The panel opposed Government restrictions on abortion during early pregnancy on constitutional grounds in effect following the lead of the Supreme Court The Court has held that under certain conditions a womans right to abortion is guaranteed by the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments The commission is not a major participant in the current battle over abortion nor is it likely to be But as long as abortion remains a legal right a commission charged with the protection of civil rights should not be barred from considering the subject The other antiabortion measure poses a more difficult legislative choice because it is tacked onto a muchneeded amendment to the Civil Rights Act The amendment supported by a broad coalition of labor women and civil rights groups would close a loophole in the law that has allowed employers to use pregnancy as a ground for dismissal the denial of sick pay or medical benefits or even seniority rights when time is lost due to disabilities connected with pregnancy The bill would prohibit such special treatment or discrimination but it would exempt women who have abortions from its protection And the parliamentary situation when the bill comes to the House floor this week will not allow members to debate or delete the antiabortion clause The vote must be for or against the entire bill with a twothirds majority required for passage We recommend albeit sadly a vote for the amendment The widespread abuse of pregnant women in the workplace has cried out for legislation since 1976 when the Supreme Court ruled that they were not automatically protected by the sex discrimination clauses of the 1964 Civil Rights Act There remains a slim hope that in the Houses conference with the Senate the offensive antiabortion clause might be defined so narrowly that few women will be affected by it The Senate bill as it stands contains no antiabortion provision Still it is a sad irony that in its vote to end one form of discrimination against pregnant women the House will be sustaining another form against those who have abortions That cannot be allowed to stand
G.O.P. Chairman Says Single‐Issue Groups Imperil Political System,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/19/archives/gop-chairman-says-singleissue-groups-imperil-political-system-broad.html,WASHINGTON July 18  Bill Brock the Republican national chairman said today that singleissue political activism by rightwing committees was creating financial problems for his party and governmental problems for the nation The Republican leader contended that efforts by such groups to elect or defeat candidates on one or two polarizing questions such as abortion and gun control were hazardous for the political system because they tend to reduce the quality of the officials who are elected Asked specifically about the impact on the party of Richard A Viguerie a professional directmail expert who works primarily for conservative causes Mr Brock replied I cant believe that drain ing our resources is helpful National officials in the Republican Party have been privately complaining for some time that the multiple Viguerie fundraising efforts have siphoned off good deal of money that otherwise would have gone to the party and a somewhat broader range of ideological support Mr Viguerie maintains that his directmail campaigns raised 25 million last year Broad Judgment Urged There are hundreds of these singleissue constituencies and they create very serious problem Mr Brock told reporters at a breakfast meeting Any voter who follows their instructions is not going to be judging the candidates broadly as they should Mr Brock a former Tennessee Senator who was a staunch conservative when he was in Congress strayed from some other traditional Republican positions saying that we dont believe in trying to balance the budget at a time of economic stagnation or in reducing the size and cost of the Federal Government in absolute terms now The best we can do he added is to restrain the rate of growth which now runs about 15 percent a year Mr Brock said he hoped to increase support for Republican candidates among Jewish voters from the level of 15 to 25 percent of the past to 30 to 40 percent in the elections this fall Jewish Frustration Noted There has been a substantial falling off of support for President Carter and an enormous amount of frustration in the Jewish community the Republican leader continued This has had some impact on Jewish support of the Republican Party per se but I dont know how to put a figure on it Asked if he thought former President Richard M Nixon should play a role in the fall elections Mr Brock replied No That would put a nonproductive issue into this campaign I see no advantage to debating Watergate all over again Party goals for the 1978 election Mr Brock said are 250 more seats in state legislatures a gain of six governorships and 15 to 20 seats in the House of Representatives Party spokesmen almost always underestimate such gains in advance in an attempt to improve their prospects of victory afterwards United Press International Bill Brock

SPEAKING PERSONALLY Beach Haven: The Joy of Crowds,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/23/archives/new-jersey-opinion-speaking-personally-beach-haven-the-joy-of.html,WHENEVER it is known that we have a house in Beach Haven at the New Jersey shore someone always says Lucky dogs  you have those weekends in September June and September  those are tne montns that everyone longs for Then the beach is something shared with spindly legged gulls and the nights are so quiet that you can hear the oceans surf as you fall asleep In September the water is warmer than ever and no lifeguard whistles you to swim between the narrow flags and the sunlight which is softer than its summers glare makes everything lovelier  the house fronts the twilight haze the tranquil bay But it is inJuly and August when the crowds are thickest that I love the shore the most I dont walk to Jacks Bakery when get up at 730 on Sunday mornings even though the doughnuts have just been made and are so hot that you need a napkin to hold them I go about 9 or 10 when you have to take a plastic number and wait for one of the four counter girls I usually ask someone  anyone  Would you like to split a dozen sticky buns With nuts They come in dozens too many for us The person ask usually says no but another customer in the crowded shop overhears us and is happy to share her husband doesnt like sticky buns either but she and her daughters do On weekends our beach overflows with trippers  those who motor down for the day  and expands into the adjoining ones at Center and Norwood The Brannigans who own a house and are from New York say that were becoming another Coney Island They say disapprovingly We remember when you could count the people in the water on both hands I remember those days too But without the trippers on the weekend we couldnt have our lateafternoon volleyball games on the beach Because of an ordinance any activity with a ball is prohibited during the time that the beach is patrolled After the guards leave you can sail a Frisbee or fly_n kite or play volleyball but with the latter you need 10 to 12 people There are_about a halfdozen of us who want to play volleyball and from the stragglers who have not left the beach we can always recruit a landfill usually college students for a game And volleyball with bare feet on sand and with the ocean as a chaser  could one want more But it is not just for selfish reasons that I like the crowds As a fair or a market is bedraggled if it lacks people so too the beach I like lying on a towel looking at the different shapes of the bodies listening to the talk of the Phillies the high price of celery or the new front of the Hands store Each blanket or umbrella or row of towels marks an apartment even more transparent than in a theater with its invisible fourth wall at the beach four open walls Because we go to the same beach each day there are communities Even though many of the people rent they come back to the same apartments every summer and are as reliable as the homeowner The Weinrybs who have rented the cottage across the street for more than 10 years sit to the right of the pavilion The McKaigs our neighbors to the left and in the afternoons only Dr Meyerss wife isa beachie shes there all day The Karlens to the right and close to the wet sand so that they can keep their children in view As I lie there Charles McKaig walks past One more time he says his shadow stopping Though my bathing suit is not dry from the last time I go in again Swimming unlike volleyball or baseball is private the joy is catching a wave as it breaks the waters chill on a hot forehead and a sky not marked by tall buildings and very large and blue Before I go home I pass Dr Zitser who takes a room at the oceanfront motel each year and say Cmon in Stanley Its not too late I dont even mind the crowding in the center of town I love going to the Island Book Store on Sunday morning even though the line for newspapers is beyond The sidewalk and into the street After yto littlestep your way past the stacks of Jersey and Philadelphia papers to the thick Times there is another line to pay for them The owner jowly and white Tshirted is not too busy for the same teasing he does on weekdays As I pay I say I remember when I could buy this for quarter These days he says inks expensive When Igo to the Laundromat I do not mind the wait for one of the dryers Because I know that they are all taken I never go without a book It is on the green bench in front of the Laundromat that Rennie Morgan died as the result of an abortion that Alison rejoined her husband Jimmy to play squirrels and bears that Dr Eduardo Parr bought sunglasses and the beginning of Marias love I could read at home but there cracks cry for Spackle and paint scruffs look like gashes At the green bench there is nothing one can do but read Even the noise from the nearby houses each bursting with people can be pleasant In the evenings windows are open radios and stereos are louder than the listeners in the room realize and parties start late and go on and on Our bedroom window is close to the McKaigss porch and often when we are ready for sleep we hear the laughter as the McKaigs and their friends bring back the fun of the day Barely awake and too tired to do more than move slowly we enjoy their spirit It catches the happiness that thousands have found at the beach and is a pleasant soporific  Roy S Wolper lives in Philadelphia and summers at the Jersey shore He teaches English literature at Temple University

"Philanthropy, the Business of the Not-So-Idle Rich",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/23/archives/philanthropy-the-business-of-the-notsoidle-rich-the-elder-statesman.html,Philanthropy has always carried an aura of wealth and dogoodism an image as a plaything of the idle rich said John D Rockefeller 3d in an interview some months ago But it is not too late to straighten out the idea Mr Rockefeller who died two weeks ago devoted the greater part of his life to that goal But even as he labored to broaden the base of charitable donations and involve American business to a greater extent total giving in the United States declined  to an estimated 352 billion in 1977 less in real terms after adjusting for inflation than the level of contributions in 1960  As a massive study completed three years ago by the Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs showed the bulk of private giving comes from average American families with incomes of less than 20000 year That study concurred with other experts who say that corporate and family giving in the United States has Waned as the Government has assumed increasingly greater responsibility for the costs of higher education health  care and social assistance to the poor and aged This trend has produced a widespread sense that philanthropy a byproduct of the great wealth produced by American capitalism may be a thing of the past an anachronism in the modern welfare state  Philanthropists like Mr Rockefeller who gave away more than 70 million on behalf of the Rockefeller family according to some estimates  and some businesses such as the DaytonHudson Corporation continue to fund the arts education and foundations Itut business in general doesnt take full advantage of the Federal Governments incentive to give  an Internal Revenue Service provision that permits corporations to deduct up to 5 percent of their pretax income for charitable contributions  It is often noted in philanthropic circles that if all companies donated 5 percent of their earnings they could generate almost 9 billion in contributions year instead of the current 15 billion The biggest corporations actually give the least as a percentage of their profits According to Minneapolis retailing executive Kenneth N Dayton thats just like saying that the Federal Government can spend the money more wisely than you can Though it has fallen on bad times philanthropy has historically been behind much of the nations social progress with funds for the care of the mentally ill the consumer and environmental movements the voter registration program in the South And private giving remains an essential ingredient in the diversity of the American experience The following individuals in their own very different ways testify to the continuing richness of that tradition The Elder Statesman If there were an archetypical American philanthropist of the 20th century it was John D Rockefeller 3d who probably supervised the giving away of more private money than anyone since the days of Andrew Carnegie An essentially shy modest man JDR 3 as he was called by his staff lived somewhat in the shadow of his more flamboyant younger brothers content to manage the family funds and the Rockefeller charities from Room 5600 the luxurious family offices in the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center The public in large part was as unaware of his activities as was his daughter Alida who when informed years ago that her father was a philanthropist asked if that was something like a ventriloquist In recent years however John Rockefeller had overcome some of his preference for privacy and embarked on a campaign to defend the crucial role that he felt philanthropy should play in the American system To the scion of the Standard Oil fortune philanthropy was a littleunderstood third sector in the United States Just as taxes support Government and profits support business philanthropy is the fuel of the private nonprofit sector whose existence Rockefeller argued in articles and speeches is indispensable to the pluralism of the United States In an effort to strengthen the fundamental role of philanthropy JDR 3d in 1973 initiated the socalled Filer Commission study on private philanthropy designed to recommend ways in which the tax laws could encourage more private funds to flow into the voluntary sector He also attempted without much success to persuade corporations to give more to established nonprofit organizations partly on the theory that if major private universities hospitals and cultural organizations were better supported by business foundations would be freed to concentrate on innovative new projects As he aged the tall lean New Yorker whose face reflected the craggy features of his Yankee forebears found that his own interests had turned in a surprisingly untraditional directionpopulation control Six years ago he chaired a national Commission on Population which recommended to thenPresident Nixons dismay a goal of zero population growth increased sex education more child care facilities and abortion Recently the Population Council which he founded in 1951 has begun to concern itself with the role of women Styles change in private giving but trend is downward on the grounds that family planning will only take root when women have opportunities in life beyond bearing children Mr Rockefellers most substantial gifts were in the realm of the arts however He was the principal supporter of institutions of Asian art and culture in New York City and during the 1960s and early 1970s he gave 11 million of his own money to a single pet project the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts It is expected that with JDR 3ds passing his younger brother Nelson will assume much of the responsibility for the familys philanthropies a shift that will undoubtedly bring a more conservative orientation JDR was by far the most open and progressive of the brothers the director of a major New York foundation said recently His loss is bound to affect the quality and the responsiveness of the brothers funds philanthropies The Businessman Corporate giving is the last major undeveloped frontier in philanthropy the Filer Commission concluded a few years ago Most companies contribute about one percent of their pretax income to charity In addition however many corporations do underwrite public television programs museum exhi bitions and the like noting the cost as a business expense rather than a charitable contribution In this philanthropic desert a group of companies in Minneapolis stand out like an oasis Some 33 corporations there give 5 percent of their income to philanthropy out of a nationwide total of 37 who reportedly do so None is more active than the DaytonHudson Corporation one of the nations leading retailers which has donated 5 percent of its pretax income for more than 30 years According to other Minneapolis businessmen anyone trying to raise money in the city always starts with the Dayton brothers Softspoken 56yearold Kenneth N Dayton chairman of DaytonHudsons executive committee and his brother Bruce a director controlled about 90 percent of the companys stock until a recent merger with Mervyns a Californiabased retail chain which reduced their interest to 28 percent Not only do they share the views of John D Rockefeller 3d but they became part of the same family this summer when Bruces son Mark married Alida Rockefeller We believe theres only one reason for business and thats to serve society Kenneth Dayton says and if society doesnt perceive that business is doing it it wont tolerate business Business has to say to itself that a certain amount of its efforts its energies and its resources  meaning its profits  must be devoted to building better environments in this nation he explained If not the free enterprise system has a limited life span Practicing what they preach the Dayton brothers supervised the giving away of more than 635 million last year making DaytonHudson one of the top 15 corporate philanthropists in the country even though some 200 corporations are larger in terms of revenues The companys policies received the ultimate accolade two years ago when they were detailed in a Harvard Business School case study to be debated by the next generation of corporate leaders Unlike most corporations which give primarily to health and welfare organizations or to education DaytonHudsons beneficence is concentrated in just two areas social action and the arts The company has long been a mainstay of the Minnesota Society of Fine Arts and the Minnesota Orchestra And John D Rockefeller 3d elder statesman of philanthropy who died two weeks ago among its social projects it has financed an urban gardening program for unemployed workers in Detroit a free public health facility in Portland Ore and a Minneapolis Tshirt printing enterprise that provides training for 120 disadvantaged students To those who argue that companies can illafford these kinds of giveaways Kenneth Dayton says there has been virtually no stockholder resistance A few people have tom up their charge cards he concedes but if everyone could be scared off by a few people nothing would ever be accomplished The Radical Fringe Those who come into great wealth while still in their twenties not surpris ingly often take a radically different attitude toward their riches than those blessed in later life For one thing they may have to live with peer disapproval of privilege or the discomfort of enjoying a sixfigure income while many of their contemporaries are looking for a job One solution devised by young people in Boston southern California and San Francisco has been to establish foundations that not only foster social change but avoid the elitist connotations of oldfashioned philanthropy by being partially controlled by the communities they support The first of these groups was the Vanguard Foundation in San Francisco set up in 1971 by Obie Benz the young heir to a major foodprocessing fortune he declines to identify the family further and seven other socalled fat kittens including the heirs to the fortunes created by Sears Roebuck Levi Strauss Union Carbide JC Penney and Matson Shipping I believe in the redistribution of wealth and power says Mr Benz now 28 years old and I wanted to work toward that through Vanguard One of Vanguards staffers put it a ikbit more succinctly Were the radical fringe Many of Vanguards benefici aries might have trouble getting past the guards at such palaces of philanthropy as the Ford Foundation Grants have gone to a prisoners union a prostitutes organization counterculture radio stations a shelter for battered women and legal services for migrant workers Two years ago the foundations emphasis shifted toward the deliv ery of services to San Franciscos Third World populations including AsianAmericans blacks Chicanos and Indians As a result the group is now funding such projects as a Korean Center La Ram Information Center which provides bilingual counseling to the Spanishspeaking community and Indigena which publishes a newspaper on native American issues Roughly 50 percent of these grants are decided on by a community board representing local activist groups and dominated by minority members The remainder of the grants are set by a second donor board representing the 30 out of Vanguards 100odd donors who give more than 3500 a year to the organization Interestingly more than half of the grants approved by the two boards overlap My philosophy as a philanthropist is expressed almost entirely through this collective organization says Mr Benz who is only one of the substantial contributors to the fastgrowing foundation whose receipts have jumped from 230000 in 1976 to 395000 last year A recent magazine article on the group brought in almost 15000 more in contributions The choice of the ultimate beneficiaries is the result of the insights of a variety of people including those closest to the problem Its the most efficient and responsive way to give The Lady I do believe a womans point of view is different says Brooke Astor one of the handful of women to head a major foundation I think we take a more intimate view and are more humanly oriented I also make a point to visit every project we give to  I think the person whose money is involved should be personally involved Otherwise whats the point the Government might as well do it The elegant effervescent Mrs Astor who spoke in the redlacquered library of her Park Avenue apartment became a philanthropist when her third husband died in 1959 and left her the Vincent Astor Foundation as well as 2 million and the income from holdings of more than 60 million The 69 million foundation makes gifts only in New York City largely because Brooke Astor feels the money was made here and it should be spent here She also believes in what she calls keeping the crown jewels The Astor Foundation has long been a bulwark of the citys leading public institutions cluding the Metropolitan Museum the Bronx Zoo and the Public Library New Yorkers have the slender stylish Mrs Astor to thank for Tuesday nights at the Met the new World of Darkness exhibit at the zoo and the very survival of the deficitplagued library which has been granted 5 million for its endowment to match 10 million from other sources But Mrs Astor prefers to discuss her smaller more individual projects which she rattles off with the gusto of presidential candidate ticking off his accomplishments There is the basketball team for teenaged Puerto Rican girls and the program for gifted city teachers who are sent every summer to seminars held by Johns Hopkins University in Santa Fe N M and who come back to talk about what they have learned over tea There are programs for women just out of prison for the prevention of child abuse and for the aged The latter are a special concern for in spite of her golden hair size 10 figure and the apparent energy of teenager Mrs Astor is as she puts it well above the age of retirement She has built greenhouses for older citizens in housing projects supported kitchens in settlement houses that serve hot meals to more than 100 people a day and given 20000 to an animal center for free treatment for pets of anyone over 65 Mrs Astor devotes part of almost every day to the foundation which gave away 96 million last year She also finds time to confer with the likes of Mayor Ed Koch and Senator Jacob Javits about new city projects to serve on eight boards

Implants of Monkeys May Explain Success With Human Embryo,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/25/archives/implants-of-monkeys-may-explain-success-with-human-embryo.html,LONDON July 24  A surprising discovery in the experimental transplantation of 35 monkey embryos reported this month by a British researcher may explain the success ofDrs Robert G Edwards and Patrick C Steptoe in implanting a human embryo That embryo has developed into a fetus with an audible heartbeat and The baby is expected to be born in the next few weeks The finding concerning the monkey embryos also suggests that human embryo transplants may be far easier than had been assumed The researcher Dr John H Marston of the University of Birmingham Medical School and his colleagues found that in rhesus monkeys embryo transplants can be performed successfully at a very early stage  even after only one division of the original egg cell If this characteristic is peculiar to primates including man it means that human embryo need be cultured in Laboratory for only a short time before is inserted in the prospective mother In earliet attempts to induce pregnandYin otherwise sterile women Drs Edwatds andSteptoe had cultured embrytos for sorry four and a half days before iMplanting them in the mothers Manyopeciallsts believed that so long an existence in an artificial environment was a probable reason for the many failires of the two researchers An account today in The Daily Map howeller suggests that the embryo how matured to an almost fullterm baby was inserted at an earlier stage of development The London newspaper has bought exclusive rights to the personal accounts of those involved The article quotes the prospective mother Lesley Brown of Bristol as saying that an egg cell was removed for fertilization Nov 10 and that only two days later Dr Edwards said Were going to put it back The normal ninemonth gestation period would end in early August but since the plan is to deliver by Caesarean section the baby may be born sooner Mrs Brown who will be 31 next Monday is quoted as saying that she had to sign a paper agreeing to an abortion if the fetus appeared to be defective The finding in rhesus monkeys surprised specialists because other mammal embryos notably those of rabbits and mice invariably die if they are introduced into the uterus before they have reached a multicell stage of development A Transitional Stage It was this  at least before the rhesus findings were known  that led Drs Steptoe and Edwards to culture their embryos to the transition stage from morula 32 to 64 cells into blastocyst about 170 cells In normal reproduction the embryo performs its early cell divisions in the oviducts linking the ovaries where the egg cells originate to the uterus Fertilization occurs as the eggs descend through the ducts called Fallopian tubes The women treated in more than eight years of experimentation by Drs Steptoe and Edwards suffer from defective oviducts Their eggs must therefore be removed from the ovary exposed to the husbands sperm in the laboratory cultured to an appropriate stage of embryo development and inserted into the uterus The rhesus experiments were reported at the annual conference of the Society for the Study of Fertility held in Cambridge where Dr Edwards holds a university position as specialist in reproductive physiology The 35 embryos were removed from the monkeys oviducts a day and a half to two days after normal fertilization After brief laboratory manipulation 15 embryos were returned to monkey oviducts to complete their cycle and descend normally into the uterus Each of the other 20 was placed in a uterus even though they were far from the normal level of maturity for such entry Despite this four of them survived to maturity Two of them were only at the twocell stage when inserted the other two had reached the sixcell stage Of the 15 that entered the uterus after developing in the tubes 11 matured Cambridge colleagues of Dr Edwards say that he was aware of preliminary findings in the rhesus study last fall when Mrs Brown underwent the treatment enabling her to gestate a child Dr Edwards has not said however whether the embryo in Mrs Browns case was inserted at an earlier stage than in previous attempts He has remained silent on the case in general In the past he and Dr Steptoe have been severely criticized within the medical community for publicity accorded their work before it was reported in a scientific journal Under a contract with the syndication arm of Associate Newspapers publishers of The London Daily Mail the two men reportedly will write personal accounts of the experiment It is not clear whether these will include medical details further enraging their colleagues Shares Are Not Announced Nor has it been announced what share of the proceeds said to exceed the equivalent of 500000 will go to Mrs Brown and her husband Gilbert and how much to the two researchers whose financial support has shrunk as resentment at their publicity grew Before their apparent success with Mrs Brown however Drs Edwards and Steptoe spelled out strategies being considered to overcome what they saw as their chief impediment The inserted embryos were not lodging properly in the uterine wall Regardless of which one of these strategies overcame the problem and led to the current pregnancy some if not all of the others will have to be tried to determine which one is the best In a paper presented last year the two men emphasized that from all they could see under microscopic monitoring their embryos were developing normally despite laboratory conditions They were therefore less inclined than others to believe that prolonged culture was the problem Dr Edwards noted that animal embryos cultured in the laboratory and then reinserted developed into deformed offspring no more often than in normal reproduction He conceded however that the loss rates during pregnancy were higher Other specialists interviewed said those cultured more than two or three days had poorer survival rates Abnormal Hormone Balance The two men have been more concerned with overcoming the abnormal hormone balance in the womens bodies at the time of insertion caused by doses of hormones to induce superovulation  the simultaneous production of many egg cells at a time that can be predicted within hours It was feared that these hormones given to the patients as they neared the stage in their monthly cycle when they would normally produce a single egg cell overwhelmed the signaling of the hormone system Normally when an egg is ejected from its sac in the ovary special tissue called the corpus luteum forms there and manufactures hormones essential to pregnancy If there is no fertilization and no newly formed embryo sends a chemical signal to the ovary the corpus luteum regresses and menstruation occurs If an inserted embryo were present it would be swept out One strategy has been to prescribe additional hormones progesterones to balance the hormones again A second is to forgo the hormones that induce superovulation instead in midcycle an eggreleasing hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered to induce the egg ripening naturally to mature at a predictable time Device Removes Egg The egg as in all of Dr Steptoes procedures is then removed with a device that penetrates the abdomen near the navel Only one egg at a time can be extracted this way and then only with great surgical skill Dr Edwards has said Furthermore the procedure gambles that the single egg will be fertilized and develop normally With superovulation producing many eggs the chances of success are greater Nevertheless he reported these difficulties have been overcome in several patients which leaves open the possibility that this was the method used with Mrs Brown The Daily Mail quotes her as saying that an egg was removed Yet another strategy the two men have considered is to omit all hormone treatments and watch in the patient for the hormonal signal that a mature egg will be released This signal is the surge of luteinizing hormone that comes once monthly Harvesting of an egg would be attempted 30 hours later but as Dr Edwards has pointed out analysis to spot this warning sign in itself takes several hours Finally the two men have discussed freezing embryos derived after superovulation and storing them until the woman has passed through at least one monthly cycle By then her hormonal balance should have recovered from the treatment used to induce superovulation While embryo freezing and thawing are becoming routine with cattle so far as is known they have not been tried as yet with human embryos

Halting The System,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/25/archives/halting-the-system-in-the-nation.html,WASHINGTON  When President Carter denied earlier this year recommendation from the International Trade Commission for tariff relief for the steelfastener industry only about 20000 workers in six states most of them in Ohio would have been direedy affected Six states have only 12 senators plus a relatively small number of Congressmen But there are about 22 senators and numerous House members that represent states with textile interests about 15 or 20 more senators plus many Congressmen are from the shoe _ states of the Northeast And virtually every member of Congress represents some interest  mushrooms or shrimp or footwear or color TVs  that is or may be threatened by imports So the members whose states and districts were most affected by Mr Carters steelfastener decision promptly struck alliances with other interest blocs each of whom needed or might some day need reciprocal help from the steelfastener group The result was that Robert Strauss the Administrations trade chief decided to keep the issue off the House and Senate floors where majorities had the power to override the President He engineered a delaying action a new investigation by the ITC where the matter now rests Such logrolling old stuff in Congress has become a powerful factor in recent years owing to rising import competition heightened interestgroup consciousness the new institutional power of Congress and the greater independence of its members Together with zealous new lobbying organizations all contribute to a new political situation in which as Bob Strauss puts it even FDR and LBJ would have had a hard time getting anything done around here today And Frank Moore Mr Carters legislative aide observes ruefully Its practically impossible to put together coalition for something anymore That may sound like the excuse of apologists for Mr Carters skimpy legislative record But Senator Edward Kennedy privately expresses similar ideas as do a number of other close observers in Washington not all of them Carter supporters Briefly described this view goes about as follows 1 An immense shift of institutional power from the executive branch to the legislative has followed the excesses of the socalled imperial Presidency It is reflected in much more than the War Powers Act or other restrictions on Presidential freedom in foreign policy In domestic affairs such developments as the effective House and Senate budget committees and the increasing use of the onehouse veto have enabled Congress to assert itself in vetoing regulations issued by Federal agencies An expanded Congressional staff with sophisticated computer assistance also makes Congress less dependent on the executive branch Mr Moore says there are about 160 subcommittees each with majority and minority staff maybe 25000 in all 2 Within this more independent Congress individual members alsO are more independent to the point where party or Presidential programs have become all but impossible to sustain The reasons are numerous Taxpaid campaign perquisites make incumbents ever more difficult to defeat Most members of Congress win election more by television and personal appeal than by party label or Presidential coattails And there appears to have been a great shift of contributions to Congressional candidates in 1976 when the Presidential campaigns were financed by Federal subsidy Members owing little to party or President operate in a system in which reform has weakened committee chairmen particularly in the House No chairman or dean of a state delegation can be counted on to deliver important blocs of votes as Wilbur IN THE NATION Mills once delivered Ways and Means Democrats now they say in the House that Chairman Al Ullman controls maybe two votes and ones his own 3 Since the highly charged 1960s virtually everything has been politicized organized and computerized including numerous emotionladen issues like abortion and the Panama Canal treaties The result is a sh4rp proliferation of singleinterest lobbying conducted with effective new mailing and research techniques much of it directed to preventing action on issues a group considers important This lobbying includes not only the usual big interests but environmental consumer healthcare and numerous other groups both pro and con All can be profoundly effective on legislation  if a senator votes wrong up here on Friday Frank Moore says on Monday his office is covered up with mail  but also back home A senator for example with a generally sound record even on constituent services probably is in serious trouble this year if he favors abortion and ending the embargo on arms for Turkey after having voted for the canal treaties and the sale of fighter planes to Saudi Arabia Each is the subject of vigorous singleinterest lobbying as are gun control the ERA nuclear power generation and numerous others These developments as some here see it are tending to bring the system to a halt But more about that later
RELIGIOUS LEADERS DIFFER ON IMPLANT,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/27/archives/religious-leaders-differ-on-implant-catholics-critical-of.html,Roman Catholic leaders criticized all forms of artificial insemination yesterday but many Jewish Moslem and Protestant figures endorsed a laboratoryinduced conception so long as both husband and wife were the parents of the child The religious leaders and theologians were responding to the birth in England Tuesday night of the first baby known to have been conceived outside the body All the religious authorities interviewed expressed concern however about any possible broader uses of the technique for genetic engineering and most expressed the fear that laboratory insemination could lead to women bearing other womens children Others were concerned that more abortions might resuit from laboratory inseminations I was quite touched by the passion of this woman to have a baby at a time when many women are choosing not to have children said Blu Greenberg an Orthodox Jewish writer who is an advocate of womens rights A Reminder of Hannah In her determination she reminded me of the Biblical heroine Hannah mother of Samuel who cried at the temple gates until God promised her she would have a child in the next year Mrs Greenberg a mother of five said The response from the Vatican the headquarters of the worlds 590 million Roman Catholics was based on the same reasoning that the church has used to oppose artificial contraception The Rev Pierfranco Pastore a Vatican spokesman who noted that he was speaking personally said Fecundation must be carried out according to nature and through reciprocal and responsible love between a man and a woman In the United States Bishop Thomas C Kelly the general secretary of the National Council of Catholic Bishops issued a statement that said in part The Christian morality has insisted on the importance of protecting the process by which human life is transmitted The fact that science now has the ability to alter this process significantly does not mean that morally speaking it has the right to do so A Somewhat Different View A somewhat different view was taken by the Rev Richard A McCormick a professor of Christian ethics at the Kennedy Institute of Georgetown University If someone were to approach me about artifIcial insemination in which the husband were the donor I would not have the certainty to say its wrong Professor McCormick said He noted that Pope Pius XII made four separate statements against artifical insemination from 1949 to 1958 but he added Since that time there has been a long second look a rethinking that it can be justified Father McCormick said that the issue would be raised in September at a meeting of the Federal Ethics Advisory Board of which he is a member He said he expected that the boards view would be used when research groups in the United States pursued grants to duplicate the British medical success Remarkable Scientific Achievement Dr C Everett Koop surgeoninchief at Childrens Hospital in Philadelphia who is a Presbyterian elder and an author on bioethics praised the remarkable scientific achievement But he added Since I believe that life begins at conception I must ask what happens if somebody wants to cancel the experiment and he dumps it down the sink Dr Koop said that he was concerned about the next step when Mrs Jones decides she wants a child from that tall blond gene pool down the block He also said that he feared genetic manipulation to produce a super race Dr Haddon W Robinson chairman of the Department of Pastoral Missions at Dallas Theological Seminary said that there was no theological problem with the English baby but he said that he was afraid laboratoryfertilized eggs could be placed in surrogate mothers and that that would raise questions about what it actually means to mother a child Giles Eccleston secretary of the Church of Englands Board for Social Responsibility called the birth an advance in meeting the problem of childlessness facing some married couples But he said that he questioned the use of scarce medical resources for this when other needs such as problems of the aged and the mentally handicapped might be more pressing Cautious Catholic Reaction Reaction from Roman Catholic authorities in England was also cautious A statement by the Social Welfare Commission for the Church in England and Wales commended the birth as a prolife expression of love but it added that different cases posed a variety of problems Gordon Cardinal Gray Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh who is president of the Scottish Catholic Bishops said that he had grave misgiVings about the methods and the possible implications and consequences for the future Ayatullah Milani a Moslem Shiite leader in Iran told an Iranian radio audience that a baby born under circumstances similar to those of the birth in England is quite legitimate and legal according to Moslem law as long as the father and mother are husband and wife Rabbi Israel Klavan an official of the Rabbinical Council of America the major Orthodox group said that Orthodoxy would accept a birth so long as no thirdparty donor was involved

realestate company is suing on the grounds of constitutional guarantees of free speech and press to bar three of Essex Countys most fashionable suburban communities from prohibiting realestate signs on a homeowners front lawn The suit which has been filed by the Berg Agency and a former client is specifically challenging municipal ordinances in effect in Maplewood West Orange and South Orange residential communities that place esthetics high on their list of suburban values All testimony in the suit brought by the Berg Agency and a onetime client Lawrence Pinilis a former resident of Maplewood was concluded earlier this month before Judge William F Harth of the State Superior Court and summations are scheduled for Aug 24 A ruling could come as early as this fall In the meantime many communities with ordinances similar to those on the books in Maplewood West Orange and South Orange face the prospect of similar challenges if realestate agencies decide that freedom to place

will be served by this action The Berg Agency and the state Civil Liberties Union on the other hand see the restrictions on for sale or for rent signs or their sold or rented counterparts as clearcut constitutional violations Of the three municipalities being sued Maplewood has the most stringent ordinance It forbids political for sale [or sold] or for rent or rented] signs in one and twofamily residential zones and gardenapartment zones except for sale [sold] or for rent [rented]  signs on vacant lands or new construction West Orange and South Orange have lesser restrictions prescribing size and location of signs and the information that may be on them Nevertheless according to the brief by John M Iatesta of the law firm of Wilentz Goldman  Spitzer of Woodbridge in Middlesex County where the plaintiff organization is based the Berg Agency sees all the ordinances comprising a violation df plaintiffs First Amendment right of free speech and press The Berg Agency suit cites many precedents and decisions from both state and Federal courts to support its challenge No opinion however appears to be more pertinent to New Jersey than one handed down in May 1977 by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Linmark Associates Inc v Willingboro In that ruling the Supreme Court reversed a Court of Appeals finding and in comment on Linmarks claim of First Amendment rights the Court noted Persons desiring to sell their homes are just as interested in communicating that fact as are sellers of other goods and services Similarly wouldbe purchasers of realty are no less interested in receiving information about available property than are purchasers of other commodities in receiving like information about those commodities And the societal interest in the free flow of commercial information   is in no way lessened by the fact that the subject of the commercial information here is realty rather than abortions or drugs   Mrs Lenore Stern Township Clerk of Willingboro said that the 20yearold Burlington County municipality once known as Levittown hasnt been affected too much by the decision but only as a result of the cooperation of our local realestate people We see very few signs she said although there are a few from outoftown realtors Speaking for Maplewood however Mr Katz contends that in the Willingboro case the basis for the Courts determination was racial integration The Maplewood lawyer argues that there is neither implication of nor reference to racial integration in the whole of the Berg Agencys suit and the Willingboro decision is irrelevant to the current case He says that Maplewood adopted the restriction on for sale and similar signs to preserve the essential character of its residential district in contrast to its commercial districts in the belief that it will preserve the esthetic appeal of its residential areas Mr Katz also cited the Supreme Courts comment in the Willingboro matter to the effect that this case presents the question whether the First Amendment permits a municipality to prohibit the posting of for sale or sold signs when the municipality acts to stem what it perceives as the flight of white homeowners from a racially integrated community In Mr Katzs opinion a proliferation of for sale or similar signs in a neighborhood  and he says he is supported by the local Board of Realtors  in residential neighborhoods would be contrary to good zoning practices would adversely affect the esthetic values of a community would be inclined to drive down property values and finally would invite burglaries and vandalism He also denies that the ordinance deprives the realestate agent of the tools of his trade Reviewing the sales of residences in Maplewood made solely through realestate agencies for the 12 years 1966 through 1977 Mr Katz reported that the number of sales rose steadily during that period from 139 per year to288 A similar trend was evident in South Orange and West Orange he said Nevertheless in his brief for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union which intervened on the Berg Agencys side as amicus curiae or friend of the court Eric Neisser concluded that the sign ordinances of the three municipalities despite their differences should be invalidated as unconstitutional infringements upon the rights of free expression and equal protection He also contended that the communities were not bereft of other means of achieving their esthetic goals They may address their esthetic concerns with ordinances directly tailored to the offensive clutter and litter through provisions concerning size shape location and quantity of signs he said Similarly the towns may prohibit false or deceptive advertising such as lowest taxes in town [assuming that to be untrue] or advertisements for illegal transactions such as for sale to whites only But in each case the Constitution requires that the towns choose the least drastic means necessary to accomplish their goal This they have not done here And in distinguishing Maplewoods outright ban and the restrictions on signs imposed by the two neighboring communities Mr Iatesta wrote There is no factual or legal justification for asserting that the homeowners sign does not offend esthetics or property values and the Berg Agency does offend esthetics and property value Consequently the ordinances of    West Orange and   South Orange Village violate substantive due process 
Women Play Vital ROles in Governments of Scandinavia,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/30/archives/women-play-vital-roles-in-governments-of-scandinavia-active-in-the.html,ODENSE Denmark  Nowhere in WesternEurope and perhaps nowhere in the world have women so consistently reached the upper levels of political life as in the Scandinavian countries In Denmark 3 of the 19 Cabinet ministers are women  Eva Gredal a social worker who is Minister of Social Affairs Lise Ostergaard a child psychologist who is serving as a Minister Without Portfolio for foreign affairs and Ritt Bjerregaard a former teacher who is Education Minister Mrs Gredal and Mrs Bjerregaard are figures of considerable influence responsible for more than half the Danish budget The women in government Mrs Gredal remarked spend the money that the men raise Mrs Ostergaard the newcomer to the group has represented her country at several major international meetings Mrs Bjerregaard 37 years old considered a possible choice for Foreign Minister has emerged as the rising star of Danish politics The daughter of two Communists she describes herself as a theoretiCal Marxist Her brand of Social Democratic politics which she set forth in an interview is flexible and highly individual the product of her view that Socialist politics fails when leaders think they can prescribe for everything Active in the Swedish Cabinet If Mrs Bjerregaard becomes Foreign Minister she will not be the only woman in that office in Scandinavia Karin Soder a 50yearold multilingual former teacher who has been in the Swedish Parliament since 1970 and is second deputy chairman of the Center Party has been Foreign Minister since 1976 Of the 20 Swedish ministers or deputy ministers 5 are women as a resuit of Liberal Party

Pirkko Tyolajarvi Minister of Social Affairs and Health sits in the Cabinet Other recent governments have had two or three What makes Scandinavian politics so different Outsiders are full of theories An American diplomat said he thought it had something to do with the selfreliance developed long ago by women ac customed to being left in charge when their men went to sea A Swedish professor said that the issue of womens rights was a natural outlet for the Nordic passion for equality particularly since there are few racial minorities A Norwegian businessman said that Scandinavians readily accepted a variety of roles for women because they disliked putting people into categories Mrs Ostergaard  who moved from clinical psychology in Denmark to refugee work in Asia and Africa and then 18 months ago to the Government  argued that the Lutheran Church which predominates in Scandinavia takes a much more permissive view than the Roman Catholic Church toward wbrnens roles outside the home In addition she said we have more social and sexual freedom than in most countries so marriage for better and for worse is notso confining a framework But the success of women really grows out of our basic view of society Mrs Ostergaard Went On Esteem in this country depends more on your ideas and your ability to express them and yOur Willingness to work like hell than on your wealth or class or

woman minister Nina Bang took office in 1924  to a long tradition of nondiscriminatory education When compulsory education began here it began for both sexes she said Equally important Mrs Bjerregaard believes is the availability of childcare centers for working mothers Denmark a small country has 5000 such centers with 40 children aged 1 to 6 in each at a cost to parents of 55 a month the state pays the rest Even so there are relatively few women engineers or business leaders in Denmark Mrs Bjerregaard is doing what she can to change that including coauthorship of an eighthgrade textbook called You Have to Decide Yourself She rejects hiring quotas The danger for Socialist movements she said is too much centralization too much dictation from above too much interference After seven years in Parliament Mrs Bjerregaard who is married to a historian knows that men sometimes resent women in major jobs which she views as the normal reaction of people reluctant to share power She also knows that we all need to make myths so they say that good women politicians are cold and that bad ones are soft In her own case she is right A civil servant who commented that she was very able added

Abortion Battle Facing Two Tests,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/30/archives/new-jersey-weekly-abortion-battle-facing-two-tests-abortion-battle.html,TRENTON THE continuing battle over abortions in New Jersey  seldom out of the news since 1973 when the United States Supreme Court ruled that abortions were legal  is gearing up for another round to be fought on two fronts in the courts and in the Legislature In the last five years among the two million women of childbearing age in New Jersey there have been an estimated 200000 abortions but the rate among lowincome women has dropped since last August because of a new state law prohibiting the use of tax money for abortions Since the law took effect Medicaid abortions have fallen from about 1000 a month to virtually none A definitive court case now pending in State Superior Court will determine the constitutionality of the law which prohibits the use of tax money to pay for the abortions except where necessary to save a womans life On July 3 Judge David D Furman of Superior Court directed the state to pay for Medicaid abortions pending a ruling on the laws constitutionality where there is a medical reason  including possible psychological trauma The United States Supreme Court has upheld a Federal ban similar to the state law on paying for routine Medicaid abortions The New Jersey Supreme Court however has not yet ruled on thdstate law and Justice Morris Pashman of Supreme Court has said in several recent rulings that the New Jersey Constitution may provide more protection of individual freedoms than does the United States Constitution The law is being attacked on the ground that it is discriminatory in denying medical treatment to poor women that is available to others The July 3 ruling came in a suit brought by the New Jersey Right to Choose an affiliate of the National Abortion Rights Action League The plaintiff a Newark woman identified only as E M sought a Medicaid abortion because she feared her unborn child might have been damged by Xrays made after she had been in an accident She contended that psychological problems might result unless she had the abortion During the course of preliminary hearings Judge Furman allowed other women to join the case which has now become a classaction suit A first hearing on the constitutionality of the law is scheduled for April 11 at New Brunswick On the legislative front opponents of abortion are trying to develop public support for a proposed state law to regulate abortions and require a 48hour waiting period before an abortion could be performed It also would require abortions to be performed by physicians and direct that physicians notify the parents or guardians of women under 18 before an abortion could be performed A hearing on the legislation pending in both the Senate and the Assembly is scheduled for Aug 17 in Trenton These are reasonable bills said Kay Krug president of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee which asked that the bills be introduced Mrs Krug said the proposed law would be education in that it would require physicians to explain all the physical or mental complications that could ensue from an abortion The legislation also does the following Declares that an unborn child is human being from the moment of conception and is therefore a legal person Requires all abortions to be performed by licensed physicians and in hospital if done after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy Directs that a woman seeking an abortion sign a consent form stating that the dangers have been explained to her and provides that a physician who performs an abortion without such a statement may be sued for civil damages Prohibits abortions after a fetus is judged to be viable except where necessary to save a womans life or health and requires that a second physician be on hand to provide immediate medical assistance to the infant to help the infant survive the abortion The legislation also declares that an infant survives an abortion performed for reasons other than to save a womans life or health the woman would lose all claim to the child as would the father if he knew about and acquiesced in the abortion The infant would become a ward of the state The prime sponsor of the bill in the Assembly is Thomas J Deverin of Carteret and in the Senate Joseph A Maressa of Berlin Both are Democrats Proponents of abortions have not settled on a strategy to oppose the proposed new law which would regulate abortions in New Jersey Fran Avalone the coordinator of the New Jersey Right to Life leader calls the bills reasonable chapter of Right to Choose said her organization would present testimony against the proposed new law at the Aug 17 hearing You know the bill is unconstitutional Mrs Avalone said An almost identical law in Illinois was declared unconstitutional in April by the Federal District Court out there The bill also contains a section already ruled unconstitutional by the U S Supreme Court The section would prohibit abortions using saline solutions 
The Visitor's China Is Separate,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/30/archives/the-visitors-china-is-separate-china-the-tour-visitors-separate.html,Photographs by Colin McCullough and Marylln Bender A guide translates in a Shanghai workers flat Wang Chienhua our 26yearold guide in Shanghai apologized for his English which he admitted he had been practicing on Americans for only three months But his smile was irresistible Would you please be so kind as to write out for me the names of all the different kinds of family planning  he asked Caryn Magid a tourist from New York And could you show one to me Mrs Magid was able to respond only to the first part of Mr Wangs request which seemed to be prompted less by personal curiosity than by his eagerness to serve the people of China by being a good interpreter His problem was that the Americans were continually asking about contraception and abortion in a country with a population estimated at 900 million MrWang who was single was able to elucidate one Chinas most effective methods of controlling the birth rate The Government urges the postponement of marriage to 28 or 30 years of age for men and 25 for women Job assignments then keep many couples in differrent cities  and from one another Mr Wang was one of the dozen or more guides that my husband our 18yearold son and I encountered last month during a 10day tour organized by Pan American World Airways the seventh such tour the airline has conducted since last December when it obtained permission to take 2000 visitors to China this year Usually we avoid group tours But with a driving desire visit China before our son enters college this fall and no likelihood of securing a rare official invitation or permission for individual travel we surrendered our cherished independence As it turned out the trip was the most fascinating of our several adventures in countries such as the Soviet Union and Iran where it can be exasperating to go it alone But two aspects made the experience peculiar at least for us One was the advice given to the 98 members of the tour by the airline at the briefing in Tokyo before we flew to Peking Though you paid foryour tour you should consider yourselves representatives of the United States Government said Jeffrey F Kriendler an official of the airline who was acting tour leader We should try to leave the Chinese with a good feeling He then warned us not to embarrass the Chinese by making critical remarks about their political leaders Mr Kriendler gave this advice even before he realized that his would be the only passport kept throughout the journey by the chief guide of the China International Travel Service as if it seemed to me he was being held responsible for the rest of us The unwelcome notion that we tourists were somehow playing a diplomatic role was reinforced by the chief guide Chang Younling who accompanied us from Peking to Shanghai Nanking and Canton Early in our stay he badgered one of the group with questions about why Pan American continued to serve Taiwan which the Chinese refer to as an unliberated province Actually the airline is unlikely to seek the retention of the Taiwan route when the agreement on it lapses Sept 30 But in the last of many effusive speeches as we boarded the train at Canton for the border crossing to Hong Kong at Shum Chun Mr Chang mentioned the bricks in the edifice of friendship between the two nations that our visit had helped to cement The second oddity of the trip was our relationship with the guides On the one hand they provided our almost exclusive contact with the Chinese people But in a bizarre twist owing to the guides woefully restricted knowledge we tourists were converted into their instructors of art history and English Visitors Are Separate The Chinese as a rule were considerate and obliging hosts but determined to keep foreigners apart from Chinese citizens in hotels restaurants planes and trains Foreigners are shepherded into comfortable though separate sections in public places and on the train from Shanghai to Nanking an opaque lace curtain was hung over the glass window of the door so that we had to peek under it to stare at the Chinese in the next car Predictably they stared back A request by a small group of us to ride the Peking subway was turned down with evasiveness We had missed the time set aside for foreigners and there was no assurance that we would be allowed on if we ventured the ride by ourselves Still it is easy to hire taxis or walk unescorted in the cities where the gathering crowds seem always to be friendly or impassive but never threatening  as they can be in the Soviet Union The most formidable barrier between the American tourist and the average Chinese he tries in vain to meet is usually that of language Thus the visitor is thrown back willynilly upon the guides Four guides traveled with us through the whole trip and in each city two local guides were assigned to each of the four groups into which the tour was divided We could make our own judgment about Chinas impressive strides in agriculture and about the inadequate measure of her industrial development But only from a guide could we try to learn as much as we could about political and social currents From reports published in Hong Kong it would seem that China is undergoing a period of reconstruction perhaps even struggle of leadership after the death of Mao Tsetung Like instant Sinologists we attempted to take our own readings from the programmed responses of the guides and from their translations of the wall posters which are the chief means of communication Unfortunately one question may draw as many different answers as the number of guides to which it is put Revolutionary committees have been abolished a Peking guide told my son The first person we met at a commune near Shanghai was the head of its revolutionary committee Need for Translators If China is opening its doors to an influx of tourists it will have to produce a new crop of foreign language experts to serve as their guides Considering the xenophobia of the Chinese and the near destruction of their educational system in the black decade of the Cultural Revolution which started in 1966 this would be no mean feat Privileged tourists such as guests of the Chinese Government and tour operators who deal with the higher echelon of the Chinese travel service report dealings with rehabilitated intellectuals linguists and foreign trade experts who had previously been purged As ordinary tourists we were assigned mostly the novices products of Chinas newest leap forward into the revival of traditional education It is impossible not to view them as victims of politicl upheaval The most knowledgeable was Mr Chang the chief guide a middleaged political veteran A few skilled guides of about 30 years of age boasted of having been Red Guards The least capable was a guide in Canton who could only muster This way to the bus The rest were about 25 years old recent graduates of foreign language institutes or of universities where they had majored in English during a threeyear course which has just been extended to four years They are paid an average of 50 yuan a month 30 a typical salary for a factory worker All of the younger guides had worked on farms or in factories after secondary school But now the rules have changed Some young people with special skills such as language facility are being allowed to enter the university directly at 17 Qualification for admission is once again by entrance examination One aspect of the Cultural Revolution was to punish or reward students for their parentage  the children of workers and peasants were admitted to universities and the offspring of the intelligentsia were barred Intellectuals are the treasure of the people one guide told us Chairman Mao said that most intellectuals are willing to serve the people Few of the guides had been taught by natives of Englishspeaking countries most of their instruction had been through written texts radio broadcasts and films made in China Several maintained they read The New York Times Time Newsweek and The Economist at their library but their spoken competence and their tunnel vision of the world indicated that their claims were exaggerated or that copies of those publications were heavily censored One guide asked us to send him maps of the United States I would like to know where all the people I meet come from he said He added that he would not be permitted to receive books Artistic Disappiontment The art connoisseurs on our tour like Joanne Stern a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art in New York were sorely disappointed We were permitted visits only to museums in Shanghai and Nanking They had impressive archeological collections but like most museums they had been closed during the Cultural Revolution and now were dusty and dimly lit with identification written only in Chinese One pleasant surprise was the abundance of Art Deco architecture particularly in Shanghai along the riverfront avenue called the Bund and other areas of the city that were once British and French settlements However while Art Deco may be a fashion treasure in the Western world it is reactionary dross to the children of the Chinese revolution Mr Wang announced that the Shanghai Museum of Art and History had been opened in 1952 but Mrs Stem and I persisted in pointing out details in the floors door panels and window that dictated earlier architecture After we had made our comments the guide sought out a watchman who recalled hearing that the museum had been bank built by imperialists in the 1930s Another Art Deco gem was the Peace Hotel on the Bund where we were billeted Ruth Armstrong of Pacific Palisades Calif assured us that it had been the Cathay one of the grandest hotels in the Orient when she had lived in Shanghai in 1935 Her memories of dining and dancing the night away there seemed more dispassionate than the history of the hotel recounted by Mr Chang It was built in 1928 by a British Jew Victor Sassoon and called the Cathay he said This British Jew came to Shanghai with just a suitcase in 1843 and became a millionaire overnight dealing in opium They say this imperialist owned 1900 tracts of land in Shanghai Of all the guides Mr Chang appeared to be the most interested in the United States He alternated confident pronouncements about Americans all surgeons are millionaires Las Vegas is rife with prostitutes  with questions about the cost of American houses and furniture and the jewelry tourists were wearing He also quoted extensively from the Little Red Book Chairman Mao said a woman can hold up half the sky he told a woman wearing a feminist Tshirt Punctuality is virtue he also reminded us Visit to College Our clearest perception of the educational chaos wrought upon this oldest of civilizations came from a hastily arranged visit to a teachers college The evening we arrived in Nanking I asked what had become of Ginling College once the sister institution of Smith College my alma mater The next afternoon Chang Hsinsheng a graduate of Hangchow University and the most competent of our guides escorted us to Nanking Teachers College a coeducational training school for secondary school teachers that now occupies Ginlings wellmanicured campus As Mrs Stern Ethelyn Chase another tour member both of whom were Smith alumnae also our husbands my son and I sat in a cool reception hall on impeccably slipcovered sofas sipping hot tea Mr Chang whom we called Chang 2 to distinguish him from the chief guide interpreted discussion between us the dean and two professors The dean Yeh Suten grayhaired woman of great composure and charm calmly recounted the changes in education after Liberation when according to Chairman Maos policy education had to be combined with proletarian politics and labor The 2000 students spend a portion of their time on a farm or in an electric motor factory affiliated with the college When the Gang of Four was in power Chairman Maos policy was destroyed she said referring to his widow Chiang Ching and her radical associates who were arrested in October 1976 after Maos death They played havoc holding high the banner of revolution but it was a deception For several years education suffered as they advocated politics in direct opposition to being professionally expert Their main purpose was to usurp the top power of the state The college remained open from 1968 to 1970 when many of the universities were closed but the curriculum suffered The three of us resisted the To the children of the revolution the wealth of Art Deco is reactionary dross Gang of Four in our own way the dean said Since the crash of the gang she went on emphasis had been placed once more on academic content especially on subjects such as mathematics science music Chinese literature and English and Russian After a perfunctory question to the dean about American methods of teacher training and an offer by us to send some English language reference books which she accepted we exhanged cordial goodbye When we left Nanking the next morning the guide assured me that our visit had contributed to the building of friendship between our two peoples The guides refused any gifts from us except buttons and Polaroid photographs of themselves and tour members Smoking is bad for the health they said adamantly when we tried to press upon them American brands or the Chinese samples we had been given on flights on the national air line Civil Air Administration of China What they lacked in professional skill the guides more than made up for in unflagging patience and overpowering charm I will always remember a conversation that Mrs Chase had with Chang about the care afforded to children who displayed antisocial behavior Mr Chang said earnestly Childrens minds are like a white paper on which we write If the guides taught us anything it is that in China the mind is like a palimpsest on which messages can be erased and rewritten endlessly It was the most disturbing lesson of the trip

HELENE DEUTSCH AND THE LEGACY OF FREUD,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/30/archives/helene-deutsch-and-the-legacy-of-freud.html,Helene Deutsch at home in Cambridge Society may change but the meaning of the unconscious is immortal Inset Dr Deutsch in Vienna 1918 At age 93 Helene Deutsch is the last of the original Freudians Though attacked by feminists angered by her theories about female sexuality she is a prime example of a liberated woman Some 20 years ago one of her younger colleagues invited Helene Deutsch grande dame of Boston psychoanalysis and pioneer in the Freudian movement to dinner Worried lest she not be sufficiently amused he also invited a notable from Bostons music community to insure her entertainment At the last moment however the musician was unable to attend and the host recounts today he apologized profusely for the musicians absence as soon as Dr Deutsch arrived Then in her 70s Dr Deutsch merely laughed Dont worry she assured him If Im here Im the party If anyone else had said that it would have been sheer arrogance said the host now one of Bostons senior analysts But in Helene Deutsch it was just an adequate appraisal of the facts She was livelier in her 70s than most people in their 30s She was the party 0 Helene Deutsch has not always been so affirmatively received In fact she has been a prime target for many archfeminists in recent years because of her association with Freud and her championing of his theories about women Contemporary feminism inaugurated its existence as a movement with an attack on the teachings and principles of Sigmund Freud Those women who have come to represent the movement to the news media have insisted that if any one man promoted the oppression of women it was he Freudthat slave driver of the unconscious  chased women from the consulting room to the nursery and kitchen they say and generations of analysts and psychiatrists who came after him kept them bound to pots and pans diapers and baby carriages The liberation of women feminists claimed depended on exposing the errors of these theories which have chained women to traditional stereotypes and prevented them from taking charge of their lives and their worlds Because Helene Deutsch was a celebrated exponent of Freuds theories she has felt the heat of the feminists Suzanne Gordon the author of Lonely in America is currently writing book on psychological change At 93 Helene Deutsch is the oldest of the original Freudians the first woman analyst to be analyzed by Freud himself and one of the few pupils he agreed to treat himself In her renowned twovolume work The Psychology of Women she presents the most comprehensive psychoanalytic account of the subject to date while her book Neurosis and Character Types is a classic of descriptive exposition In Vienna in the 20s she helped form and direct the Vienna Training Institute which when it opened in January 1925 was the first of its kind When she came to Boston in the 30s she organized and promoted analysis in her new homeland Finally she has trained and analyzed a generation of younger analysts who have gone on to achieve fame in their Thus Helene Deutsch has for most of her 93 years lived the life of a liberated woman In the 1900s she was a socialist and fought for the rights of women and even in her 80s marching against the war in Vietnam she was one of the most politically committed of her peers And therein is the paradox Her life seems at odds with the theories about women that she herself has projected and which the feminists have found so distasteful The house to which Helene and her husband Felix Deutsch came when they fled the Nazis in the 1930s is a simple American home on a quiet street in Cambridge Pictures of Freud decorate the walls the furniture and rugs are gently worn the muted colors of the overstuffed chairs and sofa absorb the light which filters through curtained windows creating a timeless feeling in whichthe press of everyday life seems somehow remote Dr Deutsch comes out of her study to greet me She moves slowly now aided by a cane upon which she leans heavily as she navigates through the house Her face betrays no singularity that might set her apart from others her age It is her spirit her confident lively gestures and her relish for anecdotal richness that reveal the texture of her life and her work Her accent is thickly ornamented with her native Polish intonations When she speaks she rolls the English language over her tongue molds it into her idiosyncratic syntax She speaks five languages says Dr Edward Bibring a contemporary of Dr Deutsch all of them in Polish 0 She was born on Oct 9 1884 the youngest of four children of Wilhelm and Regina Rosenbach Her father was an attorney in the town of Przemysl in the Polish part of the AustroHungarian Empire Looking back on her childhood Helene Deutsch attributes her sense of social justice to her fathers consistent championing of the underprivileged her rebelliousness she owes to her struggles with her mother Even now Dr Deutsch is vociferous about her mothers effect on her She was a mean woman and I did not want to be like her she insists So Helene began to rebel When she was 12 her mother forbade the education Helene needed in order to pass her university entrance exams In protest she ran away from home After two policemen found her and made her return she threatened to run away again and again unless her father signed a paper promising her an opportunity for a university education It was a mean thing Dr Deutsch recalls now 1 was saying to this father who adored me I do not trust you But it was the only thing because he was so afraid of my mother He was not an aggressive man In her teens she met and fell in love with Herman Lieberman the great socialist leader The fact that Lieberman was 16 years older than she and had two children and a wife who would not divorce him did not please her mother My family was very reactionary she says Not my father but my mother My mother felt I was a terrible poison to the family With Liebermans encouragement she organized women workers and was an active socialist I was always burning to be arrested she continues I used to bring bibua she uses the Polish word and then corrects herself you know forbidden propaganda to the border so someone could come and take 1 was longing to be arrested but [it] never happened She was soon admitted to the University of Viennas Medical Faculty where she planned to become a pediatrician but later changed her mind and decided to become a psychiatrist At this time a friend introduced her to Freuds work What attracted me to Freud she recallswas [his] theory of infantile sexuality and the unconscious but also his protest against society She broke with Lieberman and became more involved in psychiatric rather than political activity In 1912 she married Felix Deutsch a physician who served as Freuds doctor until the two men quarreled and who later became an analyst and pioneer in psychosomatic medicine In 1918 Helene Deutsch determined to be introduced to the study of psychoanalysis by the master asked Freud to analyze her What will you do if I refuse he asked When she replied that she would abandon the field altogether Freud agreed to treat her So began the famous analysis that provided the many anecdotes recounted in analytic histo Dr Deutsch warns that not all the accounts of that analysis are accurate There is for example the question of the session in which Freud fell asleep While analytic historians are shocked by that short nap Dr Deutsch herself merely laughs Can you blame him she chuckles You know it must have been so boring for him because I had just had a child and spoke about [the] difficulty [of] getting a wet nurse thought God how bored he must be and that was confirmed Although historians of the analytic movement report that there were often tensions between Dr Deutsch and Freud she only stresses the positive I was never angry at Freud she says with great conviction I was only worried he should not be angry at me You know for me he was the greatest revolutionary He was apolitical but he was a revolutionary She adds with her characteristic irony People ask me if I can briefly define what Freud has done and I sayOhI only very little He only found that children are not saints and [discovered] the meaning of the unconscious Those are the two modest things Other historians imply a sexual involvement between Dr Deutsch and Freud She agrees that her analysis uncovered classically Oedipal issues but today she laughs There was nothing erotic in Freuds relationship to me When I read her a passage in Paul Roazens book Freud and His Followers which alludes to  Freuds pleasure in Helene Deutsch she muses Now what can that mean That sounds suspicious What kind of pleasure does he have in mind The incident which various histories say was the most traumatic for Dr Deutsch concerned Freuds abrupt termination of her analysis in 1919 Freud asked her to stop analysis so that he could gain an analytic hour to continue his treatment of one of psychoanalysis most famous cases The WolfMan Russian nobleman totally paralyzed by phobic dreams which involved a morbid fear of wolves The WolfMans treatment had been undertaken first by Freud in 1910 and had revealed important corroborating information on childhood sexuality and the Oedipal complex and illustrated how memories from infancy could be recovered through analysis in adult life But The WolfMans treatment had been interrupted and Freud was anxious to re I was depressed about it Dr Deutsch says but the depression goes away Of course I gave him the hour He needed it and I was able to recognize the case is so important for analysis The year that Dr Deutsch was in analysis with Freud was difficult At that time she was working at Viennas famous WagnerJauregg clinic but was denied an official title because male doctors returning from the war had reclaimed the jobs that women had successfully filled in their absence Partly because of this kind of treatment Dr Deutsch broke with official Viennese psychiatry and dedicated herself to analysis a move that proved to be of lasting significance to the Freudian school of psychoanalysis Dr Deutsch very soon became influential as a teacher and organizer When the first analytic institute opened in Vienna it was she who directed it and cast a deciding vote when other members of the selection committee could not agree upon a candidates acceptability Her vote she says went only to candidates who satisfied her very stringent standards Nor did she lower those standards when the candidate in question was a member of Freuds family as in the case of his daughterinlaw Esti Freud whom she convinced not to become an analyst I became a speech therapist says Esti Freud I am not sorry I would have been a secondrate analyst but I am a firstrate speech therapist Although Dr Deutsch entered the analytic field after the splits between Freud and Jung and Adler she was present during the period when Wil helm Reich began his association with Freud in the early 20s At first she considered the controversial Reich to be valuable addition to the analytic circle Besides she says he was very vivacious and a very good dancer which was important in those days By the late 20s however she and other analysts had changed their minds I was later sorry he came into the institute she recalls He was psychotic and [he] totally sexualized Freuds theories with his orgone Little did Dr Deutsch suspect that her own theories as well as her allegiance to Freuds would someday be under attack and that she would in her own way become as controversial as Reich himself The focus of the attack on Dr Deutsch is her massive work The Psychology of Women Published in America in 1944 it consists of a volume on girlhood and a second volume on motherhood Dr Deutsch begins with womens early years examines puberty and adolescence and dicusses the onset of menstruation which according to Dr Deutsch completes the process that establishes the foundation of the feminine personality and forms what she terms the feminine core Proceeding from this point Dr Deutsch describes what she considers to be three essential traits of femininity  narcissism passivity and masoch ism These traits in conflict or combination generally place a woman in one of several categories the feminine erotic  a sacrificing mothering woman who is more interested in love than in sex the masculine active woman whose dominance and aggressiveness is often a reaction against fears of dependency or the homosexual According to Dr Deutsch the small girls passage to maturity is marked by a renunciation of the masculineactive tendencies in favor of the passive tendencies which are of the greatest importance in furthering her development toward the feminineerotic category This passivity in women is according to Dr Deutsch a result of what she calls the genital trauma In explaining this trauma she rejects Freuds view that penis envy determines female characteristics Rather the small girl reaches toward a passive model of femininity when she discovers that her clitoris is an inadequate organ for the release of her heightened sexual excitement and so transfers her sexual pleasure to the passive receptive the vagina The onset of the genital trauma sets loose female masochism the desire to be overpowered But because of this masochism and its dangers to the ego a counteracting narcissism is aroused Womens sexual goals are dangerous for her ego because they are masochis tic in character Dr Deutsch writes and the riddle of feminine narcissism can be solved only if we understand feminine masochism the aggressor in the inner conflict She illustrates her contentions with case studies vignettes examples from literature and history But her critics say her biases permeate her presentation of female development Her ideal woman is one who is passive and nurturing a woman whose sexual pleasure is a reward for her service to the species This image has aroused a howl of protest from feminists who view it as an outgrowth of Freuds theories on sexuality sex roles and the unconscious In the early 60s Betty Friedans book The Feminine Mystique accused Freud of providing a rationale for womans oppression According to Friedan Helene Deutsch and other followers of Freud not only compounded his errors but in their tortuous attempt to fit their observations of real women into his theoretical framework closed questions that he himself had left open Thus for instance Helene Deutsch   equates femininity with passivity and masculinity with activity  In Patriarchal Attitudes Eva Figes another prominent feminist accuses Dr Deutsch of defining the predominant trait of the feminine woman as eroticism which says Figes is just another way of saying that she is primarily a sexual object And again Susan Brownmiller in Against Our Will asserts that Helene Deutsch and Karen Homey each from a different perspective grasped at the female fear of rape and at the feminine fantasy but as women who did not dare to presume they turned a blind eye to the male and female reality In a recent interview Brownmiller added that she considered Dr Deutsch to be a piobut traitor to her sex Dr Deutsch needless to say does not agree with the feminist criticism What she says about women is she feels neither derogatory nor incorrect Of passivity she writes in The Psychology of Women If we replace the expression turn toward passivity by activity directed inward the term feminine passivity acquires a more vital content and the ideas of inactivity emptiness and immobility are eliminated from its connotation The term activity directed inward indicates a function expresses something positive and can satisfy the feminists among us who often feel that the term feminine passivity has some derogatory implica Today as she sits in the study of her home surrounded by her huge library of sociological psychological and philosophical works and novels she further explains the meaning of that concept When I say passive I do not mean woman should not work I never said that quite the contrary I mean positive things The capacity for identification is a positive thing for a woman The identification of a woman with a man is often based on the wish for a penis But a woman does not stop being a woman when she identifies with a man What Dr Deutsch finds hard to understand is the vehemence of the femi If I had ever said women should not work would have been contradicting myself I fought and sacrificed many things to be able to work In America Helene and Felix Deutsch in the 60s The tempo of life is different nisi criticism and what she considers to be its distortions of her work and life She believes that motherhood is one of the most positive experiences a woman can have but neither in print nor in conversation has she ever said that women should be mothers The Psychology of Women is full of stipulations to the contrary furthermore she enunciated a prochoice stand on the abortion issue at a time when such a position was not at all popular In my view she wrote every woman has the right to achieve motherhood and to renounce motherhood whether it Is legal or not Dr Deutsch herself was an active campaigner for womens rights In addition to organizing women workers she picketed the University of Vienna to protest its refusal to allow women to study law If I had ever said women should not work I would have been contradicting myself because I really fought and sacrificed many things to be able to work In addition Dr Deutsch insists she used Freudian theory as tool to liberate women so they could follow whatever path they chose She would never have dictated what woman or a man should do says one colleague emphatically Even those who are admirers of Dr Deutsch however feel that her close attunement to Freud and his theories particularly his belief that anatomy is destiny that biological factors such as gender determine psychological characteristicshave reduced her impact personally and professionally There was clearly a split between her practical and theoretical views one Boston analyst comments As person she represented freedom but her ideas epitomize an earlier generations thinking Her views about biology are not so terrible its just that theyre incomplete She simply never explored or made explicit social aspects of womens psychology so that its hard to say anything that would sound nice about The Psychology of Women today You must remember though he adds that she was a member of movement when it was just beginning They [the original Freudians] werent interested in social psychology at that time They had enough to do opening up What many agree to have been her most original contribution to analytic literature has in fact nothing to do with womens specific problems In short essay published in 1942 on the as if personality  an emotionally distorted type of human being who can sustain his own personality only through identification with others she anticipated recent work on narcissistic character disorders When she moved into this area the Boston analyst points out she took her real dramatic departure from Freud who always said that analysts should concern themselves with what he called the transference neuroses and not move out into other matters It was a mark of Dr Deutschs observational and descriptive powers that she chose to deal with a subject which at the time was outside clinical interest and which had been That Dr Deutsch did not further depart from Freudian theory is not surprising when one also considers her personal history Although it is risky to engage in armchair psychoanalysis one cannot help but feel that her personal experiences and not just her clinical observations helped shape her theories that her history explains the dichotomy both critics and supporters note between her life and her work When Dr Deutsch says that womans career often affects her ability to be a good mother she thinks of her own dilemmas as a mother She admits frankly that her relationship with her only son suffered because her professional obligations prevented her from spending enough time with him One feels that her emphasis on passivity and motherhood is a recompense in theory for what she may have felt to be failings in her personal life And when she speaks of the terrible strength of the motherdaughter bond and the daughters need to separate from her mother she is undoubtedly remembering her own battle for liberation One poignant vignette from The Psychology of Women illustrates this struggle It tells the story of a woman who has been unable to carry a baby to term because her negative relationship with her own mother has kept her from forming a positive image of motherhood She consistently loses her babies in the last months of pregnancy Then her close friend becomes pregnant and a month later when the woman finds herself again pregnant her identification with both her friend and her friends living mother allows her to carry her baby longer than ever before When the time of her friends delivery comes the woman worries that she will lose her source of identification and thus her baby But a miracle occurs The friend seemingly by an act of will holds off delivery for a month until the woman can successfully deliver Later on when the woman becomes pregnant again her friends presence seems enough to assure her of a successful delivery Then suddenly the friend moves out of town and though the woman seeks help through psychoanalysis she again loses her baby The story is told with enough novelistic attention to detail to make it fascinating but it is all the more interesting when we learn as Dr Deutsch tells me that the woman who could not have more than one child was Helene Deutsch herself her friend was the psychoanalyst Marianne Kris and the analyst was Freud Helene Deutsch was her own proof for her theory about the potency and problematic nature of the motherdaughter bond Today Helene Deutsch plays no active role in the psychoanalytic life of Boston She is too old to see patients It is hard to find anyone older than me she says jauntily just as she is too old to engage in polemics She is not however too old to voice her criticism of American psychoanalysis I am not very satisfied with the psychoanalytic movement here she explains It is not very idealistic Its too concerned with money You know here analysts are terribly expensive She puckers her lips and makes a long sucking noise in emphasis You cannot believe it My greatest fee was 30 an hour If someone could not pay I would do it for nothing The lack of idealism in America is partly due Dr Deutsch feels to the character of current analytic candidates This latter factor is disturbing to Dr Deutsch who from the time she directed the Vienna Training Institute contended that a candidates character should determine acceptance I always put emphasis that when we take [analytic] candidates it is not so much intellectual preparation as characterological I know the most important thing for an analyst she argues is to have reliable character because situation is very suggestive Now standards are the same but the quality of people is different In the time we started there were people who were very much interested in analysis Now there are people who are very much interested in money money how much money can they make And here in America we cannot have the luxury of allowing longtime analysis They press us The of life is different Despite her reservations Dr Deutsch feels psychoanalysis will survive even those analysts who are not up to her standards What is good in psychoanalysis she predictswill stay The techniques may change but that is not important whether you lie down or not Society might change But the meaning of the unconscious is immortal Some people say psychoanalysis is outmoded But if they have something better I have not yet seen [it] What they pretend is better are parts of analysis stolen 0 Age has dulled some of the impact of attacks against her If she hears of a new criticism of her work she merely shrugs her shoulders Sometimes she even agrees with assessments of her personality To accusations that she was a narcissistic woman she replies I probably was When they say she was temperamental she asks What does that mean That I am loving when I am loving and angry when I am angry I agree When asked if she would revise any of her theories she simply chuckles Make me a proposition The only thing she would still like to do she says smiling her impish smile is complete her interrupted analysis After I stopped analysis with Freud wanted to finish [it] Freud had no time and was already sick so he sent me to Karl Abraham in Berlin But Abraham wrote Freud that he is too much my friend to analyze me And so she laughs I am sitting here waiting for analysis  According to one feminist critic Dr Deutsch turned a blind eye to male and female reality and was a pioneer but a traitor to her sex Where it all started Sigmund Freuds couch While Helene talked Freud dozed
Two Sparkling Performances Light Up the West End,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/30/archives/two-sparkling-performances-light-up-the-west-end-two-sparkling-west.html,LONDON arely are a play and a performance so intricately meshed that we wonder where the character ends and the actor begins This season London theatergoem have an opportunity to experience two such examples of theatrical harmony each coming not from one of the respected knights and dames of the English theater but from impressively talented younger players  Tom Conti in Brian Clarks Whose Life Is It Anyway and Kate Nelligan in David Hares Plenty The evenings are made doubly significant by the quality of the playwriting Underneath a comic veneer each play has something pertinent to say about contemporary sodety Whose Life Is It Anyway at the Savoy Theater is quite simply the best new English play currently on the London stage If the American theater has recently seemed somewhat obgessed with old age and dying Whose Life can be regarded as a play about death itself A handsome young sculptor and art teacher Mr Conti has been permanently paralyzed as a result of an automobile accident Entrapped in a hospital bed he has no use of his limbs or his bodily functions All he can do and all he can ever hope to do  is to move his head Any summary may make the play sound discouragingly static and glum but it cannot take into account the theatricality of the character the humanness of the predicament and the virtuoso performance given by Mr Conti In essence all that remains of the sculptor is his brain 2 and it operates at a dazzingly intelligent pace The patient is witty sophisticated and acerbic  and more than a little bit of a clown But he never loses his equilibrium Carefully analyzing his possibilities because he can move his head from side to side he jokingly can imagine himself_as_atmlnis umpire he decides that death is to be preferred to this quarterlife Without hospital ministrations and mechanisms he would cease to exist  he sees himself scornfully as the computer center for an electronically operated battery of machines and therefore he asksfor and finally sues for his release He knows that on his own he will surely die  The play works on several levels is an immensely compassionate and painful story of an articulate man at the end of his tether It is also a complex investigation of an extremely sensitive subject The moral and philosophical concerns raised by the play are also applicable to abortion and euthanasia The crucial question is whose body is it anyway The patients mind is a crackling compendium of judicious insights and injudicious urbanities He knows exactly what is happening to him  his depersonalization and disintegration the gradual loss of his sole remaining possession his consciousness At the same time he is surrounded by helpfulness The hospital is no Cuckoos Nest There are no villains The upright head of the hospital has saved Mr Contis life and like a benevolent dictator now feels the obligation to prolong it even against the patients will When the patient asserts that will the doctors response is to tranquilize him The charge is that a wish to die is by definition a symptom of insanity Zhe patient should be sedated out of his depression and forced to live Mr Conti objects with a Catch22 permutation Id be insane if I werent depressed Back and forth the play turns from patient to head of hospital from solicitous nurse to sympathetic attending physician Jane Asher from glib social worker to bemused psychiatrist Finally the medical question is resolved by law The issues of the play are urgent the performance is tran Mr Conti known to American audiences for his performances in pivotal roles in television versions of Frederick Raphaels Glittering Prizes and Alan Ayckbourns The Norman Conquests bears a physical  and an artistic  resemblance to both Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino He has a nervous intensity an apparent spontaneity a keen sense of comic absurdity and a wonderfully expressive face The last attribute is especially in his favor in Whose Life Immobilized on se for the entire play he has to act only with his face Without ever once overacting or becoming mannered he uses his face as canvas evoking on it the complete spectrum of his character Shifting his eyes to measure his opposition smilingly flirting with an impressionable young nurse bantering affectionately with Miss Asher and feverishly thrashing his head from side to side on his pillow Mr Conti manages to give a beautifully physicalized as well as emotionalized performance Al though we are sitting at a distance from the actor it is as if we are watching him in closeup Even as he amuses us with his epigrams vaudeville jokes and imitations  prone Mr Conti has the spirit of a standup comedian  he never for one moment or one joke lets us forget the depth of the mans anguish As played by Mr Conti the character is full of life which makes the aptness  and the Necessarily the other characters are subordinate They surround the patient with a circle of good intentions Some of these people are admittedly more schematic than others but there are incisive characterizations by Richard Leech as the rulebound hospital head Jennie Goosens as a dutiful nurse and particularly Miss Asher as a doctor facing her own dilemma She cannot help but be attracted to the invalid On his feet he would be her natural match The romantic flicker that passes silently in a gaze between them is the spark of what could have been a consuming passion There is some awkWardness in the stage design Whose Life was originally a television play and it still bears signs of that earlier incarnation Most of the action takes place in the patients room yet it occupies only one third of the playing space It is as if the camera were expected to zoom in on the central action The result however is that certain scenes are needlessly cramped too many actors crowded around the patients bed However the director  his decision even more horrifying Michael LindsayHogg must share credit with his playwright and his cast for a most challenging evening Whose Life Is It Anyway  moves us with its personal story and also sends us out of the theater thinking and discussing the ethical implications of the stimulating argument Plenty at the National Theater is also a play on an important subject in this case the loss of ideals in England after World War II  economic prosperity counterweighted by moral sterility Mr Hares protagonist is not as one might expect a politician or an artist She is a sidelong participant in the affairs of state a woman of considerable individuality tut no single direction As a teenager Susan Traherne Miss Nelligan fought in France with the Resistance For her the war was the best of times a peak of patriotism and later a subject for nostalgia a sentiment that might be echoed by many other Englishmen After the war the character drifts into various jobs and into an unhappy marriage with a young diplomat with a briefly accelerating career She underuses her talents and increasingly becomes a tangle of frustrations Through her eyes we see the shabbiness and the hypocrisy of contemporary business and politics The playwright saves his most savage assault for the diplomatic corps and its blind obeisance to an indefinable code that is above questions of right or wrong Talent is unrewarded and individuality is punished those who play the game correctly rise to the top What complicates the play is that the heroine is undergoing a mental collapse much of it in public In the plays most dramatic episode as hostess at a dinner party she insults her husband and then viciously assails a diplomat for his passive role in the Suez crisis In common with World War II Suez seems to be one of those traumatizing points in modern English history and a frequent specter in contemporary drama dealing as this play does with the falling Stylistically the work has a coolness of design a spareness and an air of mystery It is preeented isiflashbaek We see the characters bleakly awash in 60s pessimism and then wing back to 1993 and occupied France At the bayonetedge of danger heroism has a curious idyllic hue as if seen in a recurrent dream Then we move forward as the playwright follows the declining spirit of the heroine and her country As if immersed in a novel bit by bit we learn about the character and we understand the correlation between her and her times Finally in an epilogue the playwright gives us another glimpse into the past  as the first day of peace spreads over France and the heroine looks forward to a lifetime of such glowing moments Coming at the end of the play the scene is sad and wistful but not the devastating revelation that we have come to expect  and that the play needs to lift it into a loftier dimension However Plenty consistently holds our attention It is in all respects a major step ahead from Mr Hares last playTeeth n Smiles a middling drama about the world of rock The writing is pungent and ironic and the perfdrmance by Miss Nelliganis For several seasons this new English actress has been emerging into stardom at the National Theater first in Heartbreak House and then last year as the corrupted innocent in Odon von Horvaths Tales from the Vienna Woods In Plenty she fulfills her promise With the looks and sensuality of a Faye Dunaway a commanding stage presence and her own air of mystery she impales our attention Even when she has no lines we are aware of her We read her reactions watching her seethe to a boil as the world teeters around her The role calls for her to age 20 years  and back again  to move from youthful radiance to adult awareness and she manages the feat  even the incipient mania  without faltering There are admirable supporting performances by Stephen Moore as Miss Nelligans hapless husband and Julie Covington as her dilettantish friend but the evening belongs to the star and the playwright effectively serving as his own director Mr Hare is one of the more imaginative and thoughtful of the younger British playwrights and Miss Nelligan is clearly his Savoring the incandescent acting of Torn Conti and Kate Nelligan one can envision the dramatic fireworks that might result were the two to occupy the same stage at the same time

flat accents of upstate New York Im running for Governor and I need your help Her smile is bright and open Flashing it without surcease while campaigning she looks almost a decade younger than her 46 years She works close to the people she talks to answering questions in long runon sentences that build to long filibustery monologues full of phrases such as surfacing the followthrough prioritywise

recalls Mr Dryfoos my job was to look for where the meetings were Plays a Catalytic Role With nothing better to do Miss Krupsak took to the hustings showing the flag around the state and setting up regional conferences where citizens could air grievances and not incidentally get to know their Lieutenant Governor better Although she sometimes tends to exaggerate her role in such projects as reopening an unused railroad line in the Mohawk Valley boosting the states wine industry persuading an airfreight business to move to Stewart Air Base and in saving Radio City Music Hall even her critics grant her a catalytic role I dont claim personal unilateral credit for these things she says with characteristic phrasing but I sought ways of being of assistance in doing whatever wa3 indicated by the circumstances When Governor Carey was first asked how he intended to treat her candidacy he got a laugh when he answered With great sensitivity But he is obviously taking her  and longshot challenger State Senator Jeremiah B Bloom  seriously When the Governor is going to all those dinners says Virginia Corsi Miss Krupsaks chief of staff You know hes scared Despite the early difficulties Miss Krupsak says she is comfortable with her decision to run that it is a source of enormous satisfaction that I can now project myself as I am She adds that she is also a political realist Im 46 years old and not some flaky kid I have the strength that comes from being willing to give it up and to risk being able to serve in a better way

it needed to close its budget gap Also adopted as part of the budget was a drastically revised educationaid formula with an increase in aid of 230 mil lion This satisfied Governor Careys intention to shift aid from the wealthier suburban areas to the harder pressed cities  but did so by directing more aid toward districts with large numbers of handicapped and academically poor students a method that the Republicanled Senate was philosophically able to accept Provisions that protected school districts from losing money despite declining enrollments were maintained A longstanding dispute over additional aid to upstate counties was resolved when the state took over the cost of the Supplemental Security Income program for the elderly and the disabled This provided additional welfare money for upstate counties and for New York City Adoption of the budget was delayed for days when Senators who areopposed to abortion attached an amendment that would have barred the state from paying for

Krupsak Bandwagon Rolling Against the Odds,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/31/archives/new-jersey-pages-krupsak-bandwagon-rolling-against-the-odds-the.html,It is lunchtime in lower Manhattan Like workers around a queen bee a crowd of reporters photographers and curious citizens swarms east on Nassau Street all but obscuring the object of their interest Hi how are you Mary Anne Krupsak asks again and again in the soft flat accents of upstate New York Im running for Governor and I need your help Her smile is bright and open Flashing it without surcease while campaigning she looks almost a decade younger than her 46 years She works close to the people she talks to answering questions in long runon sentences that build to long filibustery monologues full of phrases such as surfacing the followthrough prioritywise and creating relevant academic experiences It is testimony to her not inconsiderable charm that despite the jargon and a propensity to drone she is an effective and on occasion exhilarating campaigner With her earnest intensity her starbeam smile andher vague campaign theme of restoring government to the people the politican she most resembles is not Bella S Abzug with whom she is often compared but the Jimmy Carter of early 1976 Like the man who wanted to become President she is reaching for an office believed beyond her grasp with quiet evangelical fervor telling interviewer after interviewer that public service is almost a religious calling to me Like Mr Carter she presents herself as a grassroots populist come to joust the aloot politicians out of their windmills And like his her own quest challenges conventional political protocol But unlike the President who planned his assault on the nomination down to the last nuance Miss Krupsaks entry into the lists displayed all of the subtlety of Muhammad All promoting a prizefight After having hinting for weeks that she would again be Governor Careys running mate on the appointed day of his declaration of candidacythe 12th of June the Lieutenant Governor crisscrossed the state saying she could not run with a man unwilling to fulfill his obligations of office Two days later she indicated that she would not run against him The odds are against running for elective office she said at the time But less than two weeks after that she announced her candidacy for the Democratic primary on Sept 12 because I want to use the great powers of the Governors office to help build the new partnership between people and Government Chose Not to Walk Away To her detractors some of whom labeled her a woman scorned her June behavior was but another example of the erratic unpredictability that they say characterizes her To admirers it was additional evidence of her independence and integrity Miss Krupsak says the decisions were made in stages that at the 11th hour she sorrowfully concluded that the Governor had no intention of enlarging her role in his administration leaving her no choice but to withdraw Then off the ticket I thought deeply about my own careerand I felt that the choice for me at this point was not to walk away from a lifetime of experience Her campaign advertising theme unveiled last week makes the best of the ungainly sequence of events Im risking everything because I know government can be managed There is risk aplenty in taking on an incumbent who for all of his unpopularity still controls the political apparatus of the Democratic party and with whom Miss Krupsak is in agreement on many issues Some areas of departure she supported he vetoed legislation

Louisiana's Stringent New Abortion Law Termed ‘Standard‐Bearer’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/01/archives/louisianas-stringent-new-abortion-law-termed-standardbearer.html,NEW ORLEANS July 31  With scarcely any public notice the Louisiana Legislature has passed a law restricting abortions that is believed to be the strongest in the nation The measure signed by Gov Edwin W Edwards early this month is to go into effect Sept 8 although legal challenges are expected  The law is more stringent than the con troversial measure upon which it was modeled an abortion ordinance in Akron Ohio that is being challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union The Akron authorities have been temporarily enjoined from enforcing that ordinance Louisiana has now tecome the new standardbearer for a new constitutional regulation of abortion said Marvin Weinberger the 23yearold chairman of Citizens for Informed Consent an Akronbased organization that calls itself a national clearinghouse for prolife legislative reform Tremendous Excitement Aroused No other state has enacted regulations as farreaching Mr Weinberger added There has been tremendous excitement aroused as a result of Louisianas action Im sure well be filing suit said Peggy Cottle coordinator and director of Louisianas two largest abortion clinics the Delta Womens Clinics in New Orleans and Baton Rouge The new law will probably be challenged by the ACLU according to a staff attorney for that organization in Washington Lane Carson the New Orleans lawyer and state representative who introduced the legislation said it requires parental consent or a court order for females under 15 to get abortions and parental notice or a court order for unmarried women under 18 to do so It also mandates a waiting period of 24 hours and counseling by a doctor for any woman to get an abortion In counseling the physician is required to tell a woman seeking an abortion and the parents of females under 15 who are seeking abortions that the unborn child is a human life from the moment of con ception and that an unborn child may be viable if more than 22 weeks have elapsed since conception The law requires the doctor to describe in detail the appearance of the fetus and its characteristics mobility tactile sensitivity including pain perception or response brain and heart function the presence  of internal organs and the presence of external members The doctor must say that abortion is a major surgical procedure which can result in serious complications including sterility or a perforated uterus and that an abortion can result in severe emotional disturbance He must also give the woman information about alternatives to abortion and the availability of social service and mental health agencies And he must have the patient or if she is under 15 her parents sign a consent form then wait at least24 hours before performing the abortion The new law also requires that all abortions after the first trimester of pregnancy be performed in hospitals License Fees Must Be Paid Clinics and doctors offices where abortions are performed must pay annual license fees of 1000 plus 500 for each physician performing abortions Abortion facilities must provide emergency transportation to take a patient to a hospital within 15 minutes of the diagnosis of a medical complication and must have clinical laboratories certified to perform medical tests as well as standard operating rooms In the absence of an operating room the facility must have a written agreement for the use of an operating room at a hospital no more than 15 minutes away The attorney for the Baton Rouge Right to Life organization and Citizens Against Abortion Michael Connelly who wrote the new legislation said he had followed the Akron ordinance right down the line but had strengthened it and added the licensing requirement The law passed the House unanimously 88 to 0 and was approved in the Senate 35 to 1 No opposition was voiced by proaborticin forces I was frankly surprised Mr Connelly said We made no effort to keep it secret When Lane Parson introduced it he sent out a press release Why no one showed up to oppose it I dont know It simply wasnt a very visible issue as a bill this session said Pat Evans director of the Louisiana Bureau for Women in Baton Rouge Most women hardly knew about it Beyond that she said theres a general feeling here of just avoiding the abortion issue because of this states political ambiance its folklore and culture the influence of the Catholic Church

Ford, a Crusader For Civil Rights and Ecumenism",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/03/archives/rev-george-b-ford-a-crusader-for-civil-rights-and-ecumenism.html,The Rev George Barry Ford one of New Yorks most widely known Roman Catholic priests and a champion of civil rights died Tuesday at the Mary Manning Walsh residence at 71st Street and York Avenue He was 92 years old Father Ford as he was known to thousands of New Yorkers left his mark as Columbia University chaplain church pastor ecumenical groundbreaker civil libertarian and friend to many of the citys bestknown citizens He retired in 1958 after 44 years as an active priest and as pastor for 23 years of the Church of Corpus Christi 531 West 121st Street Father Ford had been a United States Army chaplain for five years and the first executive officer of the first peacetime training school of the Chaplain Corps At a party celebrating his 90th birthday on Oct 28 1975 he recalled his arrival at Columbia in 1929 as the universitys first Catholic adviser He was given an office outside of which hung a portrait of glowering Martin Luther Martin scowled he said and scowled back He added Some day think hell be canonized Reprimanded for Actions A colleague and friend of Protestants and Jews particularly those at Columbia and Union Theological Seminary Father Ford sometimes encountered the hostility of other priests who regarded him as the priest maverick He recalled that on the 100th anniversary of the founding of Riverside Church he was reprimanded by archdiocesan authorities for sending the church a basket of flowers Such actions and his unabashed liberalism often led to strained relations between Father Ford and the hierarchy At one point he was officially silenced for a time by the late Fraricis Cardinal Spellman In his book A Degree of Difference published in 1969 by Farrar Straus  Giroux Father Ford lamented what he saw as the extreme conservatism among bishops and the Italian dominance of the College of Cardinals Vatican H opened windows of the church and a cyclone blew it in he said of the churchs evolving overhaul But many changes are still needed Hailed Pope Johns Policy In 1964 Father Ford said he regarded the late Pope John XXIII as having been one of our greatest people and applauded Johns policy which Father Ford said was to bring our church up to date and to make the church more relevant to what he saw as contemporary social and religious needs Father Ford favored the ordination of women as priests and a more democratic means of electing popes holding that every segment of the church should be represented With his close friend Eleanor Roosevelt and others he was a founder in 1941 of Freedom House an organization aimed at furthering democratic principles He condemned the late Senator Joseph R McCarthy Republiban of Wisconsin as a demagogue He called the difference of opinion among major religions a healthy condition in a democracy and in a speech in Boston asked an end to namecalling between a few Protestant and Catholic leaders Father Ford was subsequently ordered by Cardinal Spellman to confine himself to church duties and to refrain from making speeches in public After a crosscountry trip in 1944 that aroused his interest in rights for blacks he said they were second if not thirdclass citizens and doubted theyll take it much longer Father Ford also championed the rights of labor the poor and Soviet Jews in the late 1940s He served on the Church Peace Union and was a leader in the Committee for Harlem which sought to improve slum conditions and the City Committee for Children At 90 he still kept abreast of the controversial issues Referring to the churchs teachings on birth control divorce and abortion he said Its hard for me to believe they are infallibly true But he added theres no use starting a scrap at my age He spent his childhood in Utica NY Father Ford was graduated from Niagara University in 1908 St Josephs Seminary in Dunwoodie and ordained at St Patricks Cathedral in 1914 Father Fords first assignment was in Monticello NY where he remained for two years then transferred to St Aloysius Parish on West 132d Street near Seventh Avenue In 1935 when Corpus Christi parish adjacent to Columbia became vacant Cardinal Hayes appointed Father Ford to Its pastorate He received honorary degrees from Columbia Manhattan College and Seton Hall College and and awards from Temple Israel Congregation Bnai Jeshurun and the Stephen Wise Award from the Free Synagogue In 1959 the New York Teachers Guild honored Father Ford with the John Dewey Award He is survived by two nieces Eileen McHugo and Mrs Rosemond Doyle both of Utica Terence Cardinal Cooke the Archbishop of New York will officiate at funeral service Monday at 10 AM at Corpus Christi Church The Rev Benedict Groeschel a Capuchin monk at Trinity Retreat in Larchmont NY is to deliver the homily Burial will be in the family plot in St Georges Cemetery Utica
Suffolk Ban on Funds To Finance Abortions Voided by State Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/03/archives/suffolk-ban-on-funds-to-finance-abortions-voided-by-state-court.html,A justice in State Supreme Court in Riverhead LI ruled yesterday that the Suffolk County Legislature acted illegally when it adopted a resolution directing that no county funds be used for abortions The justice Thomas M Stark said in fourpage decision that local welfare districts such as Suffolk County may not substitute their own regulations and interpretations for the regulations of the State Department of Social Services The decision was made on a petition by Louis T Howard a Suffolk County Legislator from Amityville and the Republican candidate for the Assembly in the 19th District and 12 other county residents to require the court to direct that the resolution in question be complied with and that the directives of the State Commissioner of Social Services be annulled The action was filed against County Executive John V N Klein Suffolks Commissioner of Social Services and the County Comptroller and Treasurer as well as Barbara B Blum the State Commissioner of Social Services The court action stemmed from the County Legislatures action last Feb 14 cutting off public funds for abortions an action taken against the advice of the County Attorney Eight days later Mr Klein vetoed the resolution on the ground that the County Legislature did not have the authority to direct county administrative officials to act contrary to state laws and regulations The County Legislature overrode the veto on Feb 22 But at the same time the State Commissioner of Social Services directed the local commissioner to ignore the legislative action and continue to process and pay claims for medical abortions according to state law Justice Stark found that the State of New York has chosen as a matter of poli cy to continue Medicaid funding of these abortions which are found b the patients doctor to be medically necessary
`Girlfriends’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/04/archives/girlfriends-director-on-female-friendship-changing-attitudes-like-a.html,Male friendship long characterized by a kind of robust macho slapontheback romanticism has been celebrated in novels beer commercials and the socalled buddy buddy films Female friendship however was largely ignored for years perhaps because no one believed it really existed The stereotype was of women at each others throats as they competed for men Now that stereotype has been dealt a blow as a number of films exalting female friendship have been recently released including One Sings The Other Doesnt Julia An Unmarried Woman and to a certain extent The Turning Point The latest film and perhaps the one most explicitly aimed at this once unexplored area  is Claudia Weills Girlfriends which opens here next week at the Cinema I It is about what happens to two female Manhattan roommates when one of them decides to move out and get married What I tried to do was show that female friendship is as fragile delicate supportive complex nourishing painful anddifficult as a love affair Miss Weill said the other day over lunch at Sardis It is not unlike a marriage she went on At the end of the day you share meals you talk about what you did you go to movies together and you see friends together Changing Attitudes Miss Weill who is 31 years old and one of the few active women directors in the United States said she thought that because intimacy with a man is such a powerful experience we tend to disregard or value less than we should our friendship with women But that attitude is changing she said mainly because of the womens movement and the fact that more and more women are forming close friendships with other women Today its considered bad form to break a date with a woman if a man calls she said Not long ago the man always came first In Girlfriends Miss Weills first feature film Susan Melanie Mayron and Anne Anita Skinner are just out of college and live together in a fifthfloor walkup on Manhattans West Side Their friendship and the tests tb which it is put is explored as one moves out of the apartment to get married and the other is left to begin life alone feeling abandoned and betrayed Eventually they are brought together on a new and deeper level of friendship on a day that Anne has an abortion and Susan has her first photography exhibition in a SoHo gallery Like a Kinship Is Miss Weill saying that a friendship between two women is better than a relationship between a man and a woman No Im not positing that one is better than the other she said But its different With two women you know how a person is going to respond its like a kinship like family There is a kind of bonding with identical things shared Although Girlfriends is strongly womanoriented Mits Weill said it had drawn many positive comments from men who had seen advance screenings So many men have come up to me and said When my best friend got married I felt lost  she said I just think men are not as used to revealing that feeling as women are When asked if she were at all influenced by the socalled buddy films of a few years ago that were strongly criticized by feminists on the ground that they ignored or downgraded women Miss Weill said For the most part I thought they were really boring They were a little simplistic in their notion of what a friendship was what a relationship was They had two men with beautiful faces and the adventures they have together What I find interesting is whats not said and what people want from each other Girlfriends began as a 10000 short film financed by the American Film Institute Miss Weill said but gradnally grew to feature length as she put together a series of grants loans and contributions from friends over the threeyear period that it took to complete the film The final cost was 500000 she said The screenplay based on her idea was written by Vicki Polon The 5foot7inch Miss Weill who has pale blue eyes and wears her brown hair in a shaggy brushedback hair style said she got the idea for the film after reading a short story called Bliss by Katherine Mansfield Its about a young married woman who has a baby and thinks everything is so happy and perfect she said Yet shes drawn to a successful single woman and wants that womans life She sees her husband helping the woman on with her coat and he may or may not be having an affair with her So the married womans idea of bliss is shattered Has Miss Weill ever been involved in a roommate situation similar to that of Susan and Anne I have been Susan and I have been Anne she replied But its not based on any one situation or on my life The closest parallel to me was when I shared a house with a girlfriend my last year at Radcliffe But I was the one who left for a man Miss Weill who is single and lives in Greenwich Village has had what she calls an extremely privileged life A distant cousin the late composer Kurt Weill she grew up in Scarsdale and worked summers at her fathers British American House clothing store in Manhattan Her mother is a lecturer at the China Institute She said she first became interested in film making at Radcliffe and was convinced she wanted to make it her career during the summer of her sophomore year 1967 when she worked as a gofer on a documentary called Revolution that was being filmed the HaightAshbury section of San Francisco My parents tell me Ive never been the same since she said with a smile Miss Weills last film before Girlfriends was the Academy Awardnominated documentary The Other Half of the Sky A China Memoir the 1975 chronicle of the first womens delegation to China led by Shirley MacLaine She has also produced and directed a number of other documentaries including the acclaimed Joyce at 34 and 20 films for Sesame Street Does it bother her that she is often described as a feminist film maker I am a feminist and I am a film maker she replied evenly But I dont believe in making didactic or rhetorical films I believe you move people by making them laugh or cry To me that is the most political thing you can do Miss Weill who has a twopicture deal with Warner Brothers distributor of Girlfriends said she planned to do other things in the future besides womanoriented films I feel no pressure to stick with womens films she said It seems to me extremely chauvinistic to assume that because you are woman director you have to make films about women or relationships Feminism is a point of view you can use on any subject even a big entertainment film The New York Times Paul liosefros Claudia Weill
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/05/archives/letters-cancer-and-grantsmanship.html,To the Editor Daniel S Martins plea for the continuation of cancer research funds on the July 17 OpEd page merits a response The National Institutes of Health has been generously funded over the years and there is really no need for special cancer funding Fundamentally the chemotherapeutic attack on cancer has been virtually sterile Some of the contracts have been boondoggles and some of the conceptual approaches to fighting cancer have been puerile as well as extremely costly The problem of course resides in the term fighting cancer We really dont want to fight it We want to discover its cause prevent it or treat it But indeed we have fielded an army to fight cancer We have soldiers instead of scientists Cancer is so intimately involved with the entire life process that much more would be known about cancer today had moneys been granted for studies in the basics of normal cell functions The fight for Federal funds schooled our academicians in the arts of grantsmanship Basic cancer research can do nothing but lead one back to the study of the functions of normal cells most of which has been accomplished with noncancer money The latest example of such study is the isolation of a gene preceded by the unraveling of the double helix  both achievements the de scendants of long and brilliant study by generations of scientists who added piecemeal to our knowledge of structure and function without all the fanfare and with less recompense The atmosphere when applying for grants has been such that unless the word cancer is mentioned money is not forthcoming My observations during the last 20 years have been that although there has been great and fundamental research performed once big money became available a lot of touts came off the racetrack went into cancer research and skimmed a lot off the top to subsidize their own empires This perhaps accounts for the old saw that more people are living off cancer than dying of it The cure for cancer like the cure for any other mysterious problem will come unexpectedly We are in the process of assembling the logic required to lead to a cancer cure It may take generations If the logic were available the cure could be discovered by Nick the Greek or any halfway skillful chess player The true scientist is not bound by the rules and therefore his mind is receptive to observations which others might dismiss as illogical The scientist inquires into the unknown The problem with cancer research as it is funded today is that too often funding goes to entrepreneurs who represent themselves as scientists CHARLES HARRIS MD Toms River NJ July 25197E Energy As Congress Procrastinates To the Editor About 18 months ago President Carter delivered an energy message urging quick legislation to reduce oil imports establish greater rationality in energy pricing and create incentives for energy saving Whatever some may say about his political ineptitude it is nothing compared with the ineptitude of Congress in its failure to come up with meaningful legislation The message is clear  US oil consumption has increased 18 percent since 1973 while it has declined in most other developed nations  The dollars devaluation during the past 18 months has been precipitate and no end is in sight It is caused largely by the trade deficit a significant part of which is due to oil imports  Inflation has been fueled in part by the increased prices for imports caused by this devaluation This is probably the most important issue before Congress Yet Congress debates and procrastinates as its members are the subject of lobbying to protect powerful interests I feel like I have been had I am re minded of Trumans reference to donothing Congress The name fits this one One gets a sense of great activity and little in the way of results Its members should be held accountable for their failure to act when they next ask for our votes EMMETT WALLACE Westport Conn July 25 1978 Jan Sawka US Oil Transport The Missing Pipeline To the Editor In his July 28 letter to The Times P A Curtiss of Standard Oil certainly seems to repudiate most of your recent editorial on How to Get Oil by Selling Oil to Japan However he fails to say why transportation from the West Coast eastward has been stymied for four years This should be of some interest to East Coast consumers of oil After all the oil companies bought rights to Alaska oil many years ago They bought 800 miles of Japanese pipe for the pipeline over eight years ago Mr Curtiss refers to proper provision for additional domestic pipeline transpor tation as desirable to improve our countrys energy selfsufficiency But the proper provision hasnt yet been made Why It was possible to lay 800 miles of pipe through the toughest terrain to get the oil out of the North Slope of Alaska but not to lay a pipeline from southern California to Texas  in eight years Whos kidding whom  and who is getting paid A H WHITELAW North Stonington Conn July 28 1978 Memorial Insult To the Editor According to The New York Times of July 18 the proposed multimilliondollar memorial to Franklin D Roosevelt will contain a sculpture of Roosevelt and his colleagues at Yalta The erection of an image of Joseph Stalin in Washington is not a fit way to honor any American The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission should reconsider its plans so that the Roosevelt Memorial will be a tribute and not an insult ALDAN O MARKSON Kenilworth NJ July 191978 If Buses Had Big Numbers To the Editor Why arent bus route numbers those tiny numbers and letters in the front and rear of buses  made large enough to be seen from a distance By the time you see the buss designation the bus zips past you and you realize youve been standing at the wrong bus stop If native New Yorkers are confused what do outoftowners think ALFRED GESCHEIDT New York July 25 1978 Of TestTube Babies Abortion and the Law To the Editor In its 1973 abortion rulings the U S Supreme Court said that viability the ability of a baby to live outside the womb with or without special life supports occurs between 24 and 28 weeks gestation It said the states legitimate interest in protecting unborn life allowed it to prohibit or limit abortion after viability Since then we have seen viability pushed back as far as 19 weeks gestation weakening the Courts definition But with the birth of the first testtube baby in England the Courts definition of viability has become obsolete and the term takes on a completely new meaning For a period of days the living human organism offspring of human parents existed and grew outside her mother She had been viable from fertilization and did not become nonviable when she was placed in her mothers womb And now the Court must consider the fact that viability cannot be reckoned as the end of the second or beginning of the third trimester Viability exists from the moment of conception Also the 1973 rulings made much of the term meaningful life implying that human offspring are not meaningful in the early stages of development when they can be aborted freely Yet a couple in New York is suing a hospital for 15 million for destroying a testtube baby being readied for implantation How is the Court to determine when life is meaningful if this baby is valued so highly at a very early stage of gestation This concept must also be restudied by the Court The Supreme Courts 1973 abortion rulings are fast being eroded away JOSEPH M SCHEIDLER Executive Director Friends for Life Chicago July 271978 The Loiterers To the Editor As a resident of 27th Street at Lexington Avenue I find the lawsuits for false arrests instituted by two women against the police very disturbing My landlord raises the rent after every lease expiration as is to be expected He claims his assessment is increasing 5000 per year Yet every summer the number of prostitutes pimps and other unsavory individuals loitering on my corner and adjacent intersections seems to increase I find this particularly perturbing since I was held up on Park Avenue by three ladies of the night at 730 on a Saturday morning last summer I cannot help but feel that the court actions against the police for their attempts to alleviate this situation will have a negative effect on the officers feelings about law enforcement in my neighborhood ANDREA R MINOFF New York July 28 1978 To Abrogate a Treaty To the Edi tor I was happy to see on my recent return from Asia that my letter on the Presidents power to abrogate treaties had appeared on June 12 Unfortunately however a single line of that letter was inadvertently omitted in reproduction making two sentences unintelligible The affected sentences should have read One can also understand why the decision to release the country from such entanglements would not require similar approval The Presidents appointment and removal of Cabinet officials provides an analogous example I very much hope that a correction can be noted because the issue involved is sure to become a major one as debate over normalization of relations with China develops during the next few months JEROME A COHEN Director East Asian Legal Studies Harvard Law School Cambridge Mass July 24 1978 On Replacing Con Edison With a Municipal Utility To the Editor The recent New York Times editorial Wasting Energy on Con Edison is simply incredible in advocating that even a study of replacing Con Ed with public power is a waste of time At a time when the New York metropolitan area is on its economic uppers to fail to even study a means of reducing one of the greatest economic anticompetitive burdens on businesses and residents of the area appears irresponsible The editorial misses the vital point of the real possibility of significantly cutting commercial and residential utility rates by taking advantage of the much cheaper power from other New York and from New England utilities and regionalizing the rates we now pay There is no earthly reason why we should be struck eternally with the accident of history which gave us an island utility serving only the city and Westchester the highest cost areas in the state The most practical way of regionalizing rates is by creating a municipal utility and purchasing power where it is most advantageous to do so A great advantage would be the opportunity to get as a preference customer the cheapest power in the country from the New York State Power Authoritys Niagara plant Under the Federal law which licensed that plant 50 percent of its output must go on a preference basis to municipal utilities and rural coops yet only 23 percent is presently being so supplied Public ownership of electric utilities might as you suggest have no intrinsic magic but the facts are that the average monthly bill for residential service among municipal electric sys terns is 542 for Seattle 2081 for Los Angeles and 1344 for Sherrill NY which just established a municipal system last year saving 35percent on its rates as against 41 for Con Edison customers Your editorial sounding strangely like the public relations material Con Edison issues about itself blames high taxes and fuel costs for our high rates ignoring the fact that Con Ed rates without any taxes are still much higher than most other utilities rates with taxes  even those that pay comparable fuel costs For The Times to echo Con Ed by suggesting that we consider letting the city go back to having dirtier air strikes me as a peculiar departure from the papers traditional defense of a healthy environment  and ignores the insignificant savings that can be achieved and the great health and cleanup costs that would be substituted In short there are compelling reasons for at least considering a replacement of Con Ed with its highest rates in the country RICHARD L OTTINGER Member of Congress 24th Dist NY Washington July 27 1978

Writer of Character,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/06/archives/writer-of-character.html,TN his introduction to this commemorative 75th birthday selection from the works of James Gould Cozzens Matthew Bruccoli tells us that he about to present a relatively forgotten man It is not that Cozzens has suffered from lack of exposure after all he had six BookoftheMonth Club selections Pulitzer Prize a William Dean Howells Medal and couple of Hollywood adaptations in what he calls his postapprenticeship novelistic career But his major books  The Last Adam1933 Men and Brethren1936 The Just and the Unjust1942 Guard of Honor1948 By Love Possessed1957  do not appear on college reading lists that are chockablock with Cozzens contemporaries and the English faculties tend to ignore him JUST REPRESENTATIONS A James Gould Cozzens Reader Edited by Matthew Bruccoli 568 pp Carbondale III Southern Illinois University Press Cloth 1495 New York Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Payer 5695 It is with some puzzlement that MrBruccoli records this fact Could it be he asks that Cozzenswho celebrates responsibility and chooses for his protagonists men and women who stick to their vocations  offends egalitarianminded critics This could be part of the explanation But the more certain supposition that as an antiromantic who tried conscientiously erase any trace of the assertive I from his novels Cozzens does not offer the college lecturer any easy personal handles No legends cling to him He did not with Hemingway and Fitzgerald partake of the moveable feast of Paris nor did he hunt the great kudu Africa or brave rifle fire in the Spanish Civil War He hated cocktail parties he marched in no picket lines he signed no Trotskyite manifestoes he appeared on no committees and he kept quiet about his hobbies which included growing roses What he did mainly was to stay home on a farm near Lambertville NJ and write When he did move into the great world it was to observe He had a faculty for immersing himself in the minutiae of exacting vocations the law the ministry medicine industrial counseling He spent a year writing corporation stories for Fortune magazine he says he was no good at it but he happened to be working for an editor who rewrote large sections of the magazine to please himself which could be discouraging and he undertook classified Stateside assign ments for the Air Force in World War II His close observation of professionals who lived in and for their work provided little in the way of panache Lacking the prejudices of a Sinclair Lewis Cozzens saw no reason to deride earnestness But there was an unavoidable satire of the limitations of life Responsible men did their best but as Mr Bruccoli indicates chance in the Cozzens novels often collaborated with the follies of passion to override reason and ripeness experience Cozzens himself in a rare interview John Chamberlain formerly the daily book reviewer for The New York Times is the author Farewell to Reform and The Enterprising Americans said he had no thesis except that people get a very raw deal from life To me life is what life is The selections chosen for this commemorative anthology are for the most part selfcontained even when they are lifted from packed and intricately plotted novels that run individually to 500 pages The bit chosen from Men and Brethren an episode in which Ernest Cudlipp an Episcopal priest in a New York slum saves a woman from suicide by arranging for an abortion moral ambiguity or moral complexity even more successful as a short story than the three actual short stories that are included With the two big character studies excerpted from By Love Possessed one has to go back to the whole novel to understand certain points of motivation But one reason for excerpting from the bigger Cozzens novels is surely to send the reader back to the originals The one Cozzens novel that is included in its entirety is Ask Me Tomorrow1940 which happens to be the one uncharacteristically personal fiction in the Cozzens postapprenticeship list It draws heavily on Cozzens own experiences as a tutor in Europe in the 20s But even here Cozzens maintained the exterior view The approach is closer to the Henry James of Daisy Miller than it is to the fiction of the postWorld War expatriates Ask Me Tomorrow is definitely not the mode of Compton Mackenzies Sinister Street or Fitzgeralds This Side of Paradise the two youthful quest novels that were so widely imitated in the interwar period The Cozzens portrait of the writer as young man is tenderly ironic the author applies the same objective criteria in looking at himself as he does when looking at others Incidentally Ask Me Tomorrow is a perfect depiction of the Europe that traveling Americans knew when the dollar was a dollar Besides his own informative introduction which offers a number of littleknown biographical facts about Cozzens Mr Bruccoli includes several critical essays  and reviews by others bearing on various aspects Cozzens craft Three of them are published here for the first time The Good Dukes by Noel Perrin contains some startling insights into Cozzens search for what Mr Perrin calls ordering characters who operate somewhat the way Shakespeares dukes do in the late comedies In sports the ordering character would be the takecharge guy As Cozzens grew older he saw the stout stubborn will  gaining impressive victories He also came at a later age to realize how temporary are the patterns and the point one can impose on life In By Love Possessed written when Cozzens was 54 the diminished future that must come to all aging dukes who attempt to control life is a matter for cosmic irony Arthur Winner the smalltown lawyer who turned down the offer of a judgeship in his 50s on the ground that middle age was not a time for new beginnings has been compelled by a series of shattering experiences to realize that it was an illusion to believe power really matters But he fought a good fight and that is what counts in the making of character In his preference for responsible individuals CozI zens was something of an anomaly among the major novelists of his period Hemingway preferred the character who made his separate peace Fitzgerald gloried in the romanticism of defeat Farrells Studs Lonigan welches on his idea of being strong and tough and the real stuff One has to go back to Willa Cathers generation to find ordering characters to match those of the big Cozzens novels Publication of Just Representations should do much to revive a dimming reputation But in the world of Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal how long will lake to bring the man of character back to fictional life 
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/06/archives/the-nation-in-summary-congressional-blight-hits-urban-plan.html,When unveiled last March the Carter urban plan had a little something for everybody Now its got a lot less of one very important element  money  in part because of the way the package attempted to please There have been other setbacks but the big blow came last week when the House Intergovernmental Relations subcommittee whose members are predominantly rural and conservative voted to 6 to postpone indefinitely a bill that would have provided 1 billion a year for distressed cities Many large cities have already written their anticipated share into this years budgets New York for example was due to receive 140 million and now says it will have to cut its already reduced work force Unless the measure is revived  there were efforts in the Senate late last week to do so  the nations urban centers will have lost all countercyclical aid the Carter bill would have replaced the expiring anti recession program which channeled 13 billion a year to places with Reviving it may not be easy Partly to realign the allocations system to reflect real urban needs more adequately and partly to head off complaints by spreading Federal dollars around the Administration rejiggered the aid formula by adding slower than average growth in population employment and per capita income to the calculations The effect was to add 8000 to the 17000 already eligible communities among them some affluent ones The bills supporters had trouble defending that and they say they got too little help too late from the White House More help might not have done it With a briskness reminiscent of Congressional committees more highhanded days chairman LH Fountain of North Carolina accepted a nondebatable motion to postpone from Representative Elliott H Levitas Democrat of Georgia after permitting only 30 minutes of discussion and no amendments If youre a political candidate running in a large field it doesnt hurt to have a famous father In Kansas last week Nancy Landon Kassebaum in her first statewide race won the Republican nomination for United States Senate That she was able to whip eight other prospects seemed largely due to a broadside of television spots that stresed the fact that before she became a housewife and a broadcast executive she had been the daughter of Alf Landon the revered  among Kansas Republicans anyway  former Governor and Presidential nominee That tactic might or might not work in November Shes matched against Democrat Bill Roy a doctorlawyer who gave up a seat in the House of Representatives to run against and almost beat Republican Senator Robert Dole four years ago Lately Mr Roy has been busy explaining that hes not nearly liberal as portrayed in his politics and his views on abortion the factors that helped Mr Dole last time In Tennessee which also sorted out party candidates last week the name game didnt work Bob Clement son of the late Gov Frank G Clement and six other Democrats lost the partys gubernatorial nomination to a banker Jake Butcher Mr Butcher spent 19 million to make his name well known and to counter Mr Clements charges that he was somehow unpatriotic because he sometimes tried to pay as little income tax as possible Although Mr Butcher is prepared to spend a lot Republican nominee Lamar Alexander Mr Alexander stood for Governor and lost four years ago and has used the time since to gear up for 1978 In Virginia last week there was reminder that modernday campaigning often an endless series of short airplane hops has its risks Richard D Obenshain the Republican senatorial candidate died when the light plane carrying him home from a campaign appearance crashed near Rich When the House Majority Whip is angry at the White House things are not good When the Speaker of the House isnt speaking to the Presidents Congressional liaison man things could fairly be said to be a lot worse especially when the prospects for the Administrations legislation were already are shaky Looking to first things first President Carter last week assigned VicePresident Mondale to find a job for Robert T Griffin Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jrs close friend who had been fired 10 days ago as secondincommand of the troubleridden General Services Administration Mr Mondale  and Mr Griffin  did well Mr Griffin is now a 50000ayear senior assistant to Robert S Strauss the Presidents inflation fighter and special trade representative Mr Griffin says hes happy Whether Mr ONeill is appeased remains to be seen He had banned Frank B Moore the White Houses Congressional point man from his office because he said Mr Moore had lied to him about the Griffin dismissal But neither Mr Moore nor his operation was high in the Speakers regard before then Presumably John Brademas is next on the fencemending agenda The Majority Whip is of Greek extraction and was angered when Mr Carter rejected a compromise hed offered on the Turkish arms embargo and instead pressed for the repeal that passed last week The Federal Bureau of Investigation has had its critics over the decades and in recent years has been called down for various activities that have been at best unsavory At times it seemed that everyone in the agency was suspect But director William H Webster has found someone who apparently is not and named him to head the bureaus New York operation a center of particular turmoil The man Neil John Welch now in charge of the Philadelphia office New York is not only the biggest office in the country with the classiest cases and 850 agents Members of Squad 47 mostly with the approval of middlelevel officials were responsible for many of the illegal breakins and bugging conducted in the pursuit of Weather Underground fugitives in the early 1970s Wallace J LaPrade the New York offices former head who apparently came close to being charged with perjury in the breakin case that led to the indictment of L Patrick Gray 3d and other former high bureau officials was fired last month Mr Welchs prescription I plan to take this office apart brick by brick and reassemble it That would be consistent with his 25year record in field offices across the country Never popular with the home office he once said the bureau would be better off if someone put sandbags around the [J Edgar Hoover] building and shut off the phones he is considered an agents agent by men in the field Actually hes not Mr Websters discovery alone The search committee President Carter asked to screen candidates for the bureaus directorship last year had only one FBI man Mr Welch on its short list Now they wont have Margaret Midge Costanza around to irritate them anymore The outspoken  her fans call it witty and frank her critics abrasive and inconsistent assistant to the President resigned last week eight days after one of the television appearances she was known to enjoy was abruptly cancelled by Gerald Rafshoon President Carters special communications read politics and public relations assistant If that was an insult  Miss Costanza says she is leaving with good will and love for Mr Carter  it was an addition to previous injury An early supporter of the Georgians candidacy the former vice mayor of Rochester NY was rewarded with a post as public liaison to a wide range of interest and minority groups But Miss Costanzas public statement that Bert Lance should resign for instance or her meeting with Administration women opposed to the Presidents abortion views didnt win her friends in the Carter inner circle After Anne Wexler a political sophisticate with ties where Mr Carter needs them to the liberal Democrats joined the White House staff Miss Costanzas constituency was redefined to include women only The next to final straw came in May She was moved to the basement from her prize office down the hall from the Presidents The trials of Edward W Brooke became one fewer last week A Suffolk County District Attorney decided that the twoterm Republican Senator from Massachusetts will not face perjury charges over a fictitious loan he created to reduce his net worth in determining his divorce settlement because it didnt materially decrease his assets and so wasnt materially false Tribulations remain however Mr Brookes opponents in a September primary have been publicly congratulating themselves for not making the Senators selfadmitted misstatements an issue Thy dont really have to The state is investigating possible Medicaid fraud and the Senate Ethics Committee on Mr Brookes request is looking into his finances as a whole Clyde Haberman and Caroline Rand Herron
Life in the Test Tube,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/06/archives/life-in-the-test-tube.html,WASHINGTONThe birth of Louise Brown should be a cause of joy and gratitude Nature blocked oviducts has been outwitted and Louise is apparently healthy and normal Three cheers for Doctors Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards So what else is new That is probably the reaction of very many to the testtube baby It is I believe a myopic reaction It focuses on benefits and results in narrowly individualistic way Since we ate social human beings our actions always occur in a context and have social repercussions implications and possibly social costs No person is an island nor is any couple any physician or any laboratory for that matter It is the American way to measure by immediate results We are an interventionist people If the elderly become bothersome dishinctional or dependent we isolate them in leisure worlds hospitals for the chronically ill and homes for the aged If pregnancy is a nuisance we end it Many say the answer to industrial pollution is more technology The questions come later Sometimes too late If our pesticides are carcinogens have we not missed a turn The in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer that resulted in the birth of Louise Brown raises serious social issues and policy questions To achieve a uterine fix several ova must be fertilized Dr Steptoe estimated that he had in his research gone through roughly 200 fertilized ova What are these discards Were they miniabortions am not sure But there is a problem here After all the only thing standing between an eightcell zygote and Louise Brown is a uterine home for nine months Being a zygote is part of the history of all of us We may differ on our evaluation of nascent life at this stage but we should not close our eyes Then again where does embryo transfer stop With husband and wife There are many who have no serious moral objection to artificial insemination by donor It has been practiced for years in this country Can there be any consistent and compelling argument against donor in vitro fertilization for these people And then there is the host or surrogate womb for the malfunctioning uterus or the thirdparty ovum for the woman without ovaries or the unattractive woman Is it really impossible to imagine a movie star in the future auctioning an ovum for charity To stem the cries of Ah cmon it is well to recall that David Rorviks book about an allegedly successful cloning of a human being In His Image was on the bestseller list as nonfiction A nation of hero worshippers where the family is already under serious assault is not likely to balk at a little sperm and ovum mixing or even great deal of it None of this need happen of course But todays incredibles are too often tomorrows headlines The slope is slippery in all places Furthermore if in vitro fertilization is done to conquer sterility today will not donor in vitro reproduction to minimize the risk of genetic disease be the next step After all everyone wants healthy baby At that point the specter of positive eugenics is at our back door with all its enormous problems For instance what qualities are to be bred in what defects screened out What constitutes the desirable human being And who decides this And on and on the questions go Is it ethically cricket if certain unknown and potentially devastating hazards of deformity are borne by a prospective and unconsenting child for the benefit of the parents Daniel Callaghan of the Hastings Center remarked that the history of medicine is full of instances where things were done unethically but led to benefits for people Correct But are we really better for it Do post factum results erase thh unethical character of what we haVe done If they do we must be ready to accept this in other areas such as politics Just a little moral chicanery can achieve some pretty big shortcuts Again how much embryo transfer was attempted in subhuman primates to minimize these risks What happens if the fetus is discovered by amniocentesis to be defective Do we simply abort and start over Is there perhaps a cultural schizophrenia involved in testtube culturing when over a million legal abortions of mostly healthy pregnancies occur annually in the United States Is it a healthy direction for organized medicine increasingly to treat the desires of people eppecially at a time when primary care and preventive medicine is beyond the reach of so many in this country Will the introduction of sophisticated and powerful technology into the beginnings of life lead us to view nascent life as a product a consumer item especially when this technology involves numerous discards  All of these questions may have decent and acceptable answers There may be controls that will keep 1989 forever six years away After all there is nothing inherently wrong with artificiality even when it operates in extension and support of the procreative process But when it does we are touching closely on some basic human values marriage and the family human sexuality and personal identity When we deal with such profound values special caution is the mark of wisdom A good historical memory should tell us that much But it should also tell us two more things First that technology can at times represent a mixed blessing Second it should warn us that the best way to discern blessing from burden is through open public disCussion before the fact Some scientists are accustomed to announcing awesome breakthroughs and then adding almost as an afterthought that these might raise serious ethical problems If we are to remain ethically sensitive should not these problems be raised before the technology is introduced and applied Or is It really better to discover only afterwards that our pesticides are carcinogens Brad Holland
The No. 1 Evangelical,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/06/archives/the-no-1-evangelical-carter-keeps-his-religion-and-politics.html,Like John F Kennedy President Carter had a religion ptoblem dtiring his campaign Mit unlike Mr Kennedy whose religion was largely ignored after his election Mr Carters faith continued to draw steady attention and many of his fellow bornagain Sduthern Baptists feared that the reputation of the evangelical movement would stand or fall on the spiritual image projected by the President The evangelical movement had never really been the mainstream of power said the Rev Jimmy Allen president of the 13millionmember Southern Baptist Convention They had felt coinfortable attacking others But when one of their own got there they got a little nervous They were afraid that if he didnt do well hed fail us Talks with delegates to the recent Sputhern Baptist annual meeting in Atlanta indicate that Mr Carter has made positive impressioh on religious grounds even among many who are critical of his politics So well has he done in their estimation that he is regarded as having replaced Billy Graham as the honorific Mr Evangelical Southern Baptists recognizemany of the Presidents emphases including his refusal to mix politics and religion publicly for political gain as arising out of his spiritual background Fellow churchmen regard this preference for private practice of faith as a Baptist trait They are pleased with what they regard as his Christian morality reflected in concern for human rights and family life They like the fact that he belongs to a local church and undergirds The Baptist stress on Bible study by teaching Sunday School Mr Cakters pastor has praised him as the most committed to the institutional church of all American Presidents Moreover the presence on the scene of the Presidents sister Ruth Carter Stapleton as a faith healer does not disturb Southern Baptists Though others may wonder about the extent to which Mr Carter is associated with what are regarded as marginal elements in the Christian faith Southern Baptists neither link the President with Mrs Stapletons beliefs nor rule out her claims Beyond his allegiance to basic evangelical tenets Mr Carter belongs to a growing minority of evangelicals who are dedicated to social issues In the past most Southern Baptists have been political conservatives but because believers such as Mr Carter there is now rising interest among many church people in such matters as poverty race relations and international concerns On the abortion issue the President has walked a tightrope sharing the widespread opposition to it within his denomination on personal grounds but aligning himself against a constitutional prohibition that many Southern Baptists reportedly favor The extent of the Presidents influence was demonstrated when The Southern Baptist Convention passed strong resolutions in favor of both human rights and disarmament On the last day of the convention Mr Carter underscored this point in an address to the National Conference of Baptist Men Declaring that Baptists had been too inclined to turn inwardly and to stay that way he cited the civil rights struggle during whiCh he said you and I were not in the forefront of those involved in ending segregation Too many of us are derelict in the duty of taking our influence our power and dealing with those issues that till remain a great challenge to us all Mr Carter said The President also sounded many themes that are echoed in Southern Baptist preaching particularly the personal struggle to overcome selfish desires He spoke of making an inward spiritual journey and in a moment of striking candor confessed that compared to the effort he had made to winning the Presidency I have never given that much of a sustained commitment to serving God Many in the audience saw the President as an authentic spokesman for the basic evangelical concepts of humility inward experience of faith and devotion to a vocation that broader than any earthly status I think he is a genuine Christian trying to apply Christian principles said Roy Jennings of the Brotherhood Commission of the denomination He seems to be saying hope whatever I do wont embarrass Southern Baptists There are some fundamentalistswho do not share the overall enthusiasm for Mr Carters spirituality I hear some who complain that he is not living up to his beliefs said Robert OBrian of the SouthernBaptist information office They are upset when the President simply cant just do everything theway Baptists would Two issues that Mr Carterhas acted upon his decision to send an envoy to the Vatican and his opposition to tuition tax credits impinge directly on Southern Baptist sensitivities and illustrate the mixture of support and opposition within that church commmunity Mr Allen and other leaders of the denomination have made known their displeasure with Mr Carters choosing to send an envoy But there has been corresponding enthusiasm for the Presidents fight against the tax credit because of those same principles But even the criticism among Southern Baptists of such policies as the Panama Canal treaties does not seem to damage Mr Cartert reputation as the nations number one evangelical Most feel he has helped the country become acquainted with evangelicalism People throughout the country are askinequestioris now said Laura Fry an evangelism specialist for the Southern Baptist Convention You know our country is more pagan than it ever has been with people asking these questions we have an opportunity to do something about it  HawkinsSygma President and Mrs Carter at church in Plains Ga
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/06/archives/letters-on-the-threat-of-testtube-babies-the-technician-as-god.html,To the Editor The development of testtube babies can be compared to the perfecting of wing transplants so that pigs might fly an impressive academic exercise which could lead to useful knowledge but which in itself can only be called unnecessary We could regard it with the detached admiration considered appropriate in every scientific advance even one whose value is not immediately apparent were not its implications so malevolent The threat is not of an army of clones or an Orwellian nightmare of laboratory automatons nor of coldblooded manipulation though Louise Brown would be justified in her fury had she been born hideously deformed after all this tinkering The threat rather is of unbridled selfishness and of an irresponsible scientific community that would cater to it in defiance of social conscience The exultation with which Fallopian tube bypass fertilization has been lauded in the headlines seems hollow when juxtaposed with the photographs of children who are starving in a dozen underdeveloped countries If some arrangement had been devised so that all these children were adopted one might be persuaded that some progress had been made As it is all we have is the latest toy for rich women no less a luxury than plastic surgery on a socialite To dignify it as anything else is to indulge in dangerous sentimentality Future historians will remark with amazement upon the appalling disparity it reveals between the sophistication of 20thcentury technology and the primitivism of its social thought clinging to an irrational belief in the importance of blood ties a custom as parochial as any in the most barbarian societies and able to countenance technological larks when half the world is hungry In the wisdom with which we have assimilated the lessons of Copernicus Alexa Grace ridiculed and Galileo forced to recant we find the alternatives to protecting Dr Frankenstein more abhorrent than the risks We have come to regard the pursuit of technological advancement as an inalienable right But in our determination to avoid the Scylla of reactionism or dictatorial definitions of what is good for us we have been dashed against the Charybdis of a technological freeforall Hence the madness of simultaneously inventing artifical insemination and hygienic abortion hence the confused scrambling about for a reason why we should go to the moon why we should perfect lifesustaining respirators for the comatose why we should make babies in Petrie dishes instead of beds The Indiscriminate accumulation of discoveries is not the essence of scientific aspiration To say that we can make mustard gas is to say nothing Amusing patients with testtube babies when poverty and overpopulation are great tragedies of our time and thousands are in desperate need of health care is like deferring cancer research until weve found a cure for ingrown toenails There is a point at which inappropriate activity however harmless in itself becomes unconscionable Those doctors are painting one house while another house burns down CAPPY BEINS New York July 31 1978 The Technician as God To the Editor Human life conception in glass instead of in the womb has elements of awe and dread A barren woman has new hope of rejoicing in her offspring and her husband in the seed of his loins But what of that Brave New World syndrome where the laboratory technician can become as God deciding which conception in vitro shall be wombimplanted and which shall be washed down the drain Which shall live Which shall be kept from life Such scientific success imposes increasing responsibility upon our society to deal with the existential choices thrust upon us by our new knowledge Shall we scrap new knowledge for fear of opening Pandoras box We cannot The box is open In this as with the imminent new successes in genetic engineering we are compelled paraphrasing Reinhold Niebuhr to seek provisional ethical solutions for what may be insoluble ethical problems STANLEY M KESSLER West Hartford Conn July 27 1978 Endangered Women To the Editor I am thankful that the first child born from laboratory fertilization is girl At least now there are two female principals in the drama instead of one lonely woman surrounded by powerful and prestigious male doctors male scientists male legal ethical and religious experts male newspapermen and so on and on Men now have the ability to freeze their sperm fertilize eggs in vitro and deliver the children surgically and the potential ability for freezing embryos and transplanting them in women other than the egg preducers Fortunately a womans body is still needed to carry the fetus to term But women of the future had better get more than a toehold in the bastions of power Otherwise when maledominated technological reproduction develops artificial wombs too women except for a select few egg producers may end up totally superfluous JUDITH LORBER Dept of Sociology Brooklyn College Brooklyn July 26 1978 Our Shifting Balance of Power To the Editor What we are witnessing today with tragic consequences for the nation is so great a shift in the balance of power that it has largely divested the President of the capacity to exercise leadership in the legislative process This has often resulted in deadlock between the Congress and the President intolerable delays or the triumph of local parochial or special interests against the national interest It surely demonstrates the wisdom of Burkes remark that nothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government The fact is that in the absence of builtin capacity for Presidential leadership the size and parochial interests of the Congress make it an unwieldy and improbable instrument for integrated national policymaking The former majority leader of the Senate Democrat Mike Mansfield with a Republican President in office said on the eve of the 1974 Congressional election and in the face of an anticipated huge Democratic majority referring to proposed legislation to combat recession and inflation One man has to take the lead 535 men and women in the Congress cannot do so so the lead has to come from the chief of state and he has to come up with some specific proposals In the hope that this recognition will increasingly dawn on its members propose that the Congress in a statesmanlike act of selfabnegation pass concurrent resolution committing both houses to bring to a vote on its merits within a specifically limited period of time after their receipt legislative proposals on which the President requests prompt action Congress would of course be free to accept modify or reject each Presidential proposal and the people in turn would be free to judge its members arenrdingly SAMUEL HENDEL Hillsdale NY July 28 1978 This Politicizing of Bakke Is Simply Bad Strategy To the Editor Reading the analyses by Professor Askin letter July 24 and other critics of the Supreme Courts decision one can understand why the justices tried so hard to extricate themselves from the heated polemics surrounding affirmative action in the Allan Bakke case What seems to anger so many of the critics is the Courts refusal to legitimize the view that societal benefits should be distributed solely on the basis of race What they do not seem to understand is that the guarantee of equal protection under the law applies to both whites and nonwhites What is most disturbing however is the use of the Bakke case as the primary determinant the ultimate litmuspaper test for measuring civil rights progress in our society This politicizing of Bakke is simply bad strategy for most Americans will not support affirmative action plans which subvert our commitment to equal opportunity through the impositon of racial quotas Ironically several civil rights groups recognized that Bakke was not the appropriate test case upon which to win judicial support for affirmative action They recommended against appealing this case to the United States Supreme Court And for good reason In Bakke the Medical School at Davis established a racial quota admissions policy that guaranteed the admission of 16 minority persons who were judged apart from and permitted to meet significantly lower standards of admission than regular students Some have argued that only wellqualified students were accepted at Davis yet the record indicates that minority students with a gradepoint average as low as 21 on a 40 scale were actually admitted And this at a time when grade inflation seems to be rampant in our institutions of higher education Few would disagree that an integrated and multiracial society ought to be one of our major national goals But even the oftenquoted Kerner Commission did not recommend the kind of policies advanced by Professor Askin and other critics of the Bakke decision By leaving affirmative action open to interpretation by other decisionmaking bodies the Court has made it possible for us to move toward the goal of an integrated society without resort to blatantly discriminatory means The realization of such a society may now require more time and The Times welcomes letters from readers Letters for publication must include the writers name address and telephone number Because of the large volume of mail received we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters money but I believe that the majority in Bakke was right in refusing to adopt a new kind of racism to ameliorate the lingering effects of the old racism RODNEY A GRUNES Asst Prof of Political Science Rutgers University Newark July 27 1978 The Minorities Share To the Editor Comments on the Supreme Courts decision in the Bakke case range from enthusiastic endorsement to violent attack An equally broad spectrum of opinion prevails with respect to the entire subject of socalled affirmative action programs whereby minorities are accorded some type of preference regarding admission employment or promotion It is quite likely that there will be many more court cases in this area many more and probably differing decisions and a continuance of the wide divergence of opinion This is a difficult and complex problem and these varying viewpoints should be neither surprising nor unduly disturbing Nevertheless it seems to me that there are two fundamental issues involved on which there should be increasing agreement as time goes on In the first place decisions regarding admission to educational institutions as well as employment and promotion in all types of activity are usually based on some rules or guidelines These may include past records tests race sex age geographical location or other factors Whatever they are some will regard them as fair and just to others they will be unfair unjust and discriminating There is no absolute Like beauty the equity of these criteria is in the eye of the beholder Secondly and of greatest importance is the question of what policy will best serve the United States and all its people in the future Certainly the policy adopted must promote peace and tranquillity among all the races which compose our diverse population But these objectives cannot be attained unless minorities have their fair share of the educational and occupational opportunities our society affords This means that affirmative action programs must be maintained and strengthened Indeed if any provisions of our Constitution or our laws are construed otherwise they must be changed to assure that we will continue to have a neaceful and maressive nation JOSEPH L BLOCK Chicago July 26 1978 When It Hits Home  To the Editor This letter is in response to the various material published on the Bakke decision My good friend and I both applied to Yale University last fall Both of us went to the same high school and took almost all the same courses My grades SAT scores and achievement test scores were higher than his Neither of us was actively involved in sports and in extracurricular activities we were about equal My friend was admitted and I was not My friends parents were from Puerto Rico and he was thus classified as a member of a minority group I had never thought of my friend as Puerto Rican before and only then became acutely aware of his background At first I was angry but we talked it over and remain friends today I believe in affirmative action and find its goals admirable but when it hits home it sure does hurt JOHN Z

Ideas &Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/06/archives/ideas-trends-in-summary-a-reporter-begins-his-jail-term-for.html,Im going to jail for what I believe to be the public interest for what I believe to be the interest of my profession M A Farber a reporter for The New York Times said last Friday just before entering a Hackensack NJ jail for a stay of uncertain length Mr Farber was imprisoned for defying a court order to surrender his complete files on the case of Dr Mario E Jascalevich to the presiding judge in the doctors murder trial The Times was found guilty of contempt of court along with the reporter and began paying a 5000aday fine at the expiration of a temporary stay of the sentences imposed on Mr Farber and on his employers The newspaper argues that disclosure of a reporters confidential sources discourages investigative reporting and that confidentiality is protected both by the First Amendment and by shield laws in New York and New Jersey But Dr Jascalevichs attorneys say Mr Farbers notes are needed to assure their client the fair trial guaranteed him under the Sixth Amendment The Farber case thus represents a conflict between two constitutional guarantees and is at the same time an important test of the New Jersey shield law The First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press but it does not define that phrase The courts have tended to uphold some but not all kinds of press freedom They have generally stood firm against attempts to prohibit punish or require publication but they have sometimes set limits to newsgathering activities For instance the Supreme Court has said that judges should prevent prejudicial statements to the press by attorneys witnesses and others And although 26 states now have shield laws courts have in some instances declined to recognize them The Farber case is an example Mr Farber was ordered to jail even though the New Jersey shield law says explicitly that a reporter has a privilege to refuse to disclose both his sources and the information they have given him At the end of last week it looked as if Mr Farber might be in jail at least until the Jascalevich trial is over Meanwhile the newspaper will continue to seek a full hearing on the merits of its case and will pursue its appeals through New Jersey appellate courts to the United States Supreme Court Ever since the Supreme Court legalized abortion five years ago critics of the decision have been chipping away at the reform with considerable success before the High Court in Congress and in state and local courts and legislatures The latest success is in Louisiana where the State Legislature has passed the most stringent abortion law in the country When the statute takes effect next month unmarried women under 18 will not be allowed to end a pregnancy without a court order or official notification to their parents those under 15 will need either a court order or parental consent Other restrictions include annual license fees of 1000 each for abortion clinics plus fees of 500 for each clinic physician But the most striking feature of the law is the requirement that doctors counsel every woman seeking an abortion along very specific lines She must be told that a fetus has mobility tactile sensitivity including pain perception or response brain and heart function internal organs and external members She is also to be informed that the unborn child is human life from the moment of conception that an unborn child may be viable if more than 22 weeks have passed since conception and that abortion can lead to serious physical complications and cause severe emotional disturbance Court challenges to the new law both by abortion clinics in Louisiana and by the American Civil Liberties Union are likely Last year the board of the civil liberties group voted to give first priority in 1978 to a campaign to preserve the right to abortion Freedom of choice board chairman Norman Dorsen said at the time is gravely in danger Preliterate human beings and their successors for thousands of years drew their maps from personal experience from what could be seen Today sophisticated instruments enable cartographers to map places they have not seen and will never visit A case in point is the vast region buried under Antarctic ice and now being mapped by scientists aided by airborne radar The area which is larger than Europe has been sealed off from ordinary exploration for 20 million years Seeing through ice that is 15000 feet deep in places radar has so far enabled cartographers to survey more than a million square miles Unlike the fairly smooth ice on top the hidden terrain is varied and rugged Along the coast near the Ross Sea and the Ross Ice Shelf lies a range of peaks that have been named the Transantarctic Mountains Moving westward explorers have found the Wilkes Trough a deep sedimentfilled gash in the earths crust a highland area the Aurora Trough which is being compared to the worlds largest body of fresh water Lake Baikal in Siberia and then near Adelie Land an escarpment that rises 8200 feet and extends for 160 miles Farther to the south near the Soviet Unions inland base Vostok are the Gamburtsev Mountains Mapping is being done from aircraft that follow flight lines set 30 to 60 miles apart The sponsors of the project are the National Science Foundation in the United States and in England the Scott Polar Research Institute which is associated with the University of Cambridge In 1958 a Chinese Communist official asserted that Education should serve the politics of the working class Now just 20 years later priorities have changed and the Communists are looking to scientific and technical education especially abroad to help modernize China by the year 2000 To that end it became known last week Peking is making plans to send as many as 10000 Chinese to Western colleges and universities within the next two years Little effort apparently will be made to shield the new overseas students from Western society and thought the Chinese want them to live in ordinary campus housing and to study a wide range of scientific technological and other subjects Only a handful of Chinese are now studying in the West but Chinese officials have asked Britain France and West Germany to take 500 students each beginning in September No direct approaches have yet been made to the United States Government but Chinese educators recently asked visiting Ohio professors if American educational institutions could take 200 Chinese in the fall A White House spokesman has said the United States welcomes the idea of such a program Over the past few months there have been other signs that Peking now counts on education to do more than indoctrinate young Communists Special elementary and high schools for bright students denounced during the Cultural Revolution as pagodas for cultivating intellectual aristocarts have been reestablished Plans to teach foreign languages from the third grade on have been announced Entrance examinations for college have been reinstituted and graduate schools of history literature philosophy and other liberal arts once considered irrelevant to a Communist society are to be reopened later this year The decision to send students abroad was a reminder that Chinas first nuclear bomb was developed with the help of scientists who had been trained in the Soviet Union and in the United States An aquarium shop may seem like a highly improbable place in which discover a hitherto unknown animal species but Theodore W Pietsch and David B Grobecker Of Long Beach Calif lucked out The two California State University biologists study anglerfish which they order regularly from a local dealer Anglerfish are creatures that lure their prey with a filament protruding from their heads and they have been known for years Izaak Walton decribed one in The Compleat Angler in 1654 Most of the 200 known species are equipped with fairly unspectacular lures But when the scientists checked one presumably routine delivery not long ago they found mingled with some very ordinary relatives a most unusual specimen above an anglerfish with a fishshaped lure persuasively marked with pair of pigment spots that look exactly like eyes The scientists photograph of their find published in Science magazine shows a fish of the genus Antennarius that is blessed with the innocent appearance of a motionless algaeencrusted rock Having a flexible filament that is attached to its snout and baited with an appendage ressembling a little swimming fish the Antennarius need scarcely exert itself when it feels hungry It rests quietly wriggles its lure waits for a bite  and then simply pulls in its catch Anglerfish are not the only organisms that conserve energy by employing a strategy aggressive mimicry to find food Many others from plants to spiders whales entice their prey by seeming to offer food sex or shelter United Press International Radar profile shows mountain range hidden beneath a mile or more of ice upper lines in the Antarctic Arrow indicates a lake beneath the ice

the tale of a little girl who asked her mother to read her a bedtime story Read me the one about Mary who had a little lamb said the little girl and grew up to own the biggest sheep ranch in Texas Sarah Weddington thinks big This 33yearold Texan grew from her modest upbringing as a Methodist preachers daughter into a lawyer a member of the Texas Legislature a Department of Agriculture official and now a 51000ayear adviscw to President Carter on womens issues She brings to her job a certain serenity that was not a characteristic of her predecessor Margaret Costanza the fiery emotional wisecracking upstate New Yorker who resigned in early August after a series of clashes with top White House aides Wont Make Abortion an Issue Miss Costanza who once described herself as a loudmouth pushy little broad protested the Presidents stand against abortion invited homosexuals to the White House to discuss their problems and publicly insulted Virginia Democrats who voted against ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment Mrs Weddington too disagrees with the Presidents stand on abortion but she has no intention of making an issue of itat least not right now My primary loyalty is to the President she says Some feminists feel that Mrs Weddington may be compromising herself by not making an issue of abortion But even they were among the first to applaud when little more than a month after taking office she skillfully masterminded the campaign for Senate approval of the resolution giving states 39 additional months beyond the original deadline of next March 31 in which to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution In the final days before the Senate vote on an extension Mrs Weddington worked out of Vice President Mondales office just off the Senate floor personally talking to and telephoning key Senators and keeping tabs on the close vote count She is terrific said Anne Wexler a White House adviser and the only other woman to hold a top job on President Carters staff If any one thing was responsible for getting that bill through the Senate it Was girahs lobbying effort And Liz Carpenter a chairman of ERA America a coalition of some 200 clubs and organizations pushing for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment has nothing but praise for her fellow Texan Shes helped give us the momentum we need to get ERA through said Mrs Carpenter In fact we might even meet the original deadline The iron is hot To become part of the Constitution the amendment must be ratified by 38 states So far 35 states have ratified although 4 have subsequently rescinded their approval and it is uncertain whether such rescisions will be considered legal With the extension battle over in Congress Mrs Weddington has turned her attention to state ratification strategy She is also working on setting up the In terdepartmental Task Force on Women created by the President to bring about broader employment for women in the federal government As chairman of the task force she will seek to place qualified women in highranliing federal jobs But  while the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and the working of the task force are now her main concerns she does not plan to confine herself solely to womens issues I think we need to view things not just as a womans issue or a mans issue but as a peoples issue she said We need to create a world where men and women can work together Mrs Weddington was born February 5 1945 in Abilene Texas At 16 she en rolled in McMurry College a small Methodist institution in that west Texas city Graduating Magna cum laude from college at the age of 19 she debated whether to become a doctor or a lawyer finally deciding on the law With her law degree from the University of Texas she began work at age 21 for an American Bar Association committee that was set up to reevaluate ethical standards Three yeazs later Sheandher husband Ron Weddington set up a law practice together in Austin She had helped put him through law school after his military service He in turn managed her successful campaign for the Texas House of Representatives in 1972 When their sixyear marriage ended in divorce in 1979 they continued to practice law together for another year There were no children It was an amiable divorce she said Were still friends But we decided we had our own individual lives to live She was practising law on her own in Austin when her old friend John C White of Texas President Carters appointee as Deputy Secretary of Agriculture telephoned her last year and asked her to come to Washington to be interviewed for the job of General Counsel of the Department of Agriculture She got the job a large suite of offices a le million budget and a staff of 350 including more than 200 attorneys most of them men Now she has a staff of just five and Miss Costanzas old office in the White House basement She diplomatically refers to it as the ground floor But she likes the challenge Woo US Case at 2 Mrs Weddington was just 26 years old when in 1971 she argued a landmark case before the United States Supreme Court that struck down state antiabortion laws While in the Texas House she pushed through legislation strengthening laws dealing with rape She has been active in the National Organization for Women and the National Abortion Rights Action League She is a hard worker usually arriving at the office at 700 A M and not returning home until late at night She does most of her own housework in her twobedroom Washington home She drives to and from work in a 1972 compact

discover how things work Stk bight a book describing haw to make household repairs and she has already put it to use repairing a lamp I expect so much of myself she said I guess Im pretty close to being a perfectionist She said that like most single people she occasionally gets lonely and thinks it might be nice to get married again But then I think of all those divorce cases I handled when I

NATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/06/archives/nation-president-imposes-inflation-guidelines-but-reaction-is-cool.html,President Imposes Inflation Guidelines but Reaction Is Cool Inflationary tires flared inew in the American economy this fall precipit atnig new programs and quick shifts in economic policy To contain the blaze the Administration rushed out new equipment  wageprice guidelines and new vows to restrain Fedend spending and regulation But stocks and the dollar plunged Finally last Wednesday the Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate to a record 95 percent in a dramatic bid to slow both the economy and inflation At the same time the Fed and the Treasury assembled huge new financial resources to defend the dollar Stocks and the dollar made impressive gains but there remained doubts whether the policy would be successful At issue is whether inflation will simply have to burn out leaving a recession or whether some combination of public and private restraint can dampen the flames It was in a somber television address on Oct 24 that President Carter admitting past failure imposed his voluntary guidelines system in yet another effort to slow rising prices To head the new program he named Alfred E Kahn 61 chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board The initial reaction was cool and the AFLCIO rejected the antiinflation plan as inequitable calling for a special session of Congress to impose mandatory controls Other labor and business groups predicted that mandatory controls were inevitable The inflation problem was under scored by the announcement that the Consumer Price Index for September had risen a sharp 05 percent or 96 percent at an annual rate and that October wholesale prices had risen 09 percent or 108 percent at an annual rate Government economists now concede prices will rise this year by more than 8 percent As 1978 began the fc cast was 61 percent compared with 69 ixircent in 1977 Ironically part of the problem is the continued strength of the economy This is what troubles many analysts who fear high inflation will persist until demand is appreciably reduced by tighter fiscal and monetary policies Congress and the Administration have agreed on a deficit of about 39 billion for the 1979 fiscal year compared with 488 billion in 1978 The President pledged to slash the deficit to 30 billion or less in 1980 Preliminary figures for the third quarter showed balanced moderate growth at a 34 percent annual rate compared with 87 Fxrcent in the secorid quarter The Administration predicts about 375 percent growth for all of 1978 and 3 percent for next year These figures suggest willingness to let unemployment rise beyond the 58 percent level it fell to last month The President called on the nation to support new standards of 7 percent for wage increases and a reduction of half a percentage point in price increases from the average of the past two years That would bring price rises down to 575 percent next year Businesses are required to certify their compliance and arc threatened with sanctions such as ineligibility for Government contracts if they fail To win lalaor support the President said he would ask Congress to approve a real wage insurance program giving workers who stayed within the guidelines a tax credit if inflation exceeds 7 percent next year If successful the guidelines a reduced Federal deficit and other fiscal and monetary restraints could reduce inflation to 6 or 65 percent next year Mr Carter said GSA Housekeepers Left a Mess Over the summer the scandal gathered and grew enveloping scores of offices and facilities of the General Services Administration and its 36000 employes from coast to coast Littleknown to the general public until recently the GSA owns and manages Federal Government buildings including the Pentagon and it spends S5 bilInm a year on supplies ranging from computers to paper clips for Federal agencies Because of the large amount of money it handles and its reputation as a repository for political appointees the agency many feel has been especially prone to corrupt practices By last week the fallout from the fraud had led to the first 31 indictments of hundreds that are expected and more than a dozen persons had entered guilty pleas Federal investigators said that mismanagement in the GSA could he costing taxpayers as much as 100 million a year  financially the most costly scandal in the GovernMen s history The Department of Justice set up a special task force headed by William S Lynch one of its more experienced crime investigators to carry on the probe already initiated by Jay Solomon a Cha Ita1100gii businessman NvIv heads the agency Investigators reported a pervasive pattern of corruption including the following  Payments often in huge amounts for work not done or only partially completed This  it is alleged was not an uncommon practice involving managers of GSArun buildings  Payments for supplies not delivered involving collusion between managers and employees of GSA selfservice supplies stores and contractors Fraudulent use of Govermentissued credit cards to charge up him dreds of thousands of dollars worth of supplies and services for personal use Acceptance of great amounts of poorly constructed office furniture without inspection Congress at President Carters request approved legislation early in October to create the office of Inspector General in the GSA and a dozen other t ederit agencies to search out fraud and waste Fifty more auditors were assigned to the GSA and the Pres dtimt is ask mg for still another 100 investigators and auditors to be added to its staff The New York Times Jay Solomon A Boomlet of Congressional Indictments Considering that there are 435 members of the House of Representatives throe indicted members dont make a crowd But separate indictments against three such prominent Congressmen as Daniel J Flcxxl Joshua Eilberg and Charles C Diggs Jr made for an unusually crowded docket during one Congressional session If there is one thing unique about the Flood charges it is the audacity and scope of the corruption they allege In two indictments filed during the past two months the Department of Justice charged him with a nationwide scheme to milk payments from businessmen and professional people who deal with Federal agencies For his part Mr Flood has denied any wrongdoing often with an appropriately theatrical flourish for the actor he once was The powerful Democrat is running hard for reelection in the eastern Pennsylvania district he has represented for more than 35 years Confidently he predicted he would be returned to Washington a forecast that did not seem unreasonable considering Mr Floods popularity back home in WilkesBarre in part as a result of Federal largesse he has obtained for the district He dismissed the accusations as a fabric of falsehtxxis woven by his former aide Stephen B Elko and other desperate men who are seeking to save themselves from prison Ile charges also may have significance for the system under which much of Washington has long operated Mr Floc xi chairman of a powerful subcommittee that controls must of the nations social programs in the House was known as a man who could get what he wanted from the bureaucracy The Government now charges that often what Mr Flood wanted was also what he or his aide had been secretly paid for  about 165000 according to the indictments from a physician who headed a research center a Washington lobbyist a lawyer a building developer an alleged member of organized crime and a Brooklyn rabbi Thc projects they wanted pushed ranged from art invention to cure cancer to a school lunch program Not covered in the current charges are an aspect of the Flood investigation that gained it the most national attention In January David W Marston a young Republican United States Attorney in Philadelphia charged that he was removed from office after the Carter Administration found out he was investigating Mr Flood and Mr Eilberg another powerful Pennsylvania Democrat in connection with the financing of a Philadelphia hospital Mr Eilberg was indicted on Oct 24 on conflict of interest charges for allegedly helping his law firm get a 145 million Federal construction grant for the hospital The Congressman denied the charges The third Congressman to be indicted already has been found guilty On his income tax return for 1973 Representative Diggs reported that he and his wife Janet had gross incomes of 76000 Not had except that his debts threatened to become ruinous So Mr Diggs thought of a solution one that new threatens to ruin him politically On Oct 7 a jury in Washington DC convicted the Michigan Democrat of 29 counts of mail fraud in a scheme that involved inflating his Congressional employees salaries and then using the surplus  more than 60000 over four years  to pay his personal and other debts The money allegedly even paid for some of the Congressmans magazine subscriptions and one employee testified that it was clear to her that acciding to such an arrangement was essent ial hit keeping her jot Mr Diggs the senior black member of the louse of Representatives faces up to five years in prison on each count and a total fine of 191000 Despite his conviction Mr Diggs said he would continue to seek reelection this month to his 13th term in the House Patterns of Primary Elections Offer GOP Only Modest Gains A strange pattern emerged in the primary elections held across the country this summer and fall On the one hand it was a good time for incumbents especially those in Congress in many races they defeated challenges within their own party and strengthened their hand for the November elections On the other hand there was a voter yearning for something new mostly the conservative new as stunning upsets took place in such states as Massachusetts Minnesota Maryland and Florida The pattern was evident in the following samples Upsets The biggest surprise came in Minnesota where ultraconservative businessman Bob Short narrowly upset Representative Don Fraser a liberal Democrat who had the endorsement of the DemocratFarmerLabor Party that had dominated politics in the state for a generation at stake was the Senate seat held by Hubert H Humphrey Short a big contributor to Humphrey campaigns over the years claimed that he was an ideological heir to the late Senator In Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis a liberal activist was unseated in the Democratic primary by Edward J King another ultraconservative In part this may have reflected voter unhappiness with Mr Dukakis having promised four years ago that he would not raise taxes and then doing the opposite surprising upsets were registered in Maryland where Harry R Hughes defeated Gov Blair Lee III because of Mr Lees association with former Gov Marvin Mandel who was convicted of fraud and in Florida where a former state senator Robert Graham defeated Attorney General Robert L Shevin in the Democratic gubernatorial primary Mr Graham became known by working at commonplace jobs Incumbents The closest shave for a wellknown incumbent came in Massachusetts Senator Edward W Brooke who was in trouble over his personal finances overcame a strong challenge by a conservative broadcaster in the Republican Senatorial primary In New York and Connecticut Democratic Governors Carey and Ella Grasso won big primary victories over their lieutenant governors And in Congressional races across the country incumbents generally did well Issues Proposition 13 in California the referendum under which voters overwhelmingly slashed their property taxes set the tone for the rest of the nation Virtually every candidate of both parties came up with some kind of taxcut proposal whether on the federal or state level Candidates promoting the biggest cuts frequently took the conservative position too on such issues as abortion and gun control and in many instances won This was the case with the victories by Mr King in Massachusetts and Mr Short in Minnesota In all movements organized on single issues did quite well by getting their supporters to the polls in elections that almost uniformly showed a low turnout But for all the upheavals in what seemed to be a swing to conservatism the Republican Party which hoped to profit by the discontent as the party out of office and most in favor of reduced government  is not expected to materially improve its position in the general election Democratic candidates in many races have preempted the taxcut issue and swung in line with voters on other issues As it now stands the Republicans are expected to make only small gains on all levels This could be be particularly rough for them at the state level where the partys national committee has concentrated much of its rebuilding effort The Republican fear is that without appreciable gains Democratdominated state legislatures could gerrymander them into nearoblivion after the 19S0 census A 200 Million Tire Recall A year ago when the Chrysler Corporation was experiencing the worst series of carrecall actions in its corp rate history another recall of greater impact was in an embryonic stage Consumer groups had persuaded the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the Firestone 500 steelbelted radial tire and other similar Firestone tires Altogether 235 million tires were in question with 13 million estimated to be still on the roads That informal inquiry would result a year later in considerable embarrassment for Firestone the nations second largest tiremaker and one of the most bitter battles in years between the Government and a manufacturer The inquiry soon ran into an order from a Federal judge in Cleveland that its results not be released When in the spring they were made public  inadvertently says the Safety Administration  the judge authorized Firestone lawyers to seek out the person or persons who violated the court order The agency retaliated by instituting a formal investigation into the tires Defects or blowouts involving the tires were cited zls the cause of 41 deaths 65 injuries and hundreds of accidents in the past twoandahalf years according to the Safety Administration With Firestone insisting that the tires were not defective its case was taken before the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations which was critical of the company and recommended that the tires be recalled By early August the agency had made an initial determination that the tires were defective and scheduled hearings on its findings Then Firestone  its dealer body in turmoil and its sales nose diving decided to seek a settlement The terms were announced on Oct 28 In the largest tire recall in the nations history Firestone agreed to a settlement that could cost it up to 2t0 million although a significant portion would be taxdeductible At the same time the Ford Motor Company faces a potential recall of similar dimensions over the automatic transmissions on millions of its cars made since 1970 There have been complaints that the transmissions are prone to slip out of gear Ford is assessing the 6100 calls it got in a recent hotline survey to determine what it should do Chrysler meanwhile is winding up the mailing of its recall notices Koreans Wasted Their Money The covert campaign began with a plot in the Blue House the South Korean Presidents office and over six years its operations acquired exotic code names like Ice Mountain and White Snow Beneath the snow and ice the Korean Central Ingelligence Agency secretly spent uncounted millions of dollars to influence United States policy But in the end said the chief Congressional investigator last week they wasted their money Representative Donald M Fraser Chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Organizations closed 18 months of scrutiny by concluding that the Koreans had failed to manipulate American policy Instead they only damaged their standing in the United States The Subcommittees 447page final report probably the most comprehensive analysis of the KCJA operation yet published contained several new nuggets Among them  American companies doing busi ness in Korea contributed 85 million to the 1971 election campaign of President Park Chung Hee including l million

ABROAD AT HOME,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/06/archives/abroad-at-home-the-soul-of-the-party.html,BOSTON You come out of the subway and there at the top of the stairs are six men holding Ed King signs As neonle flush oast them the men say While youre on the way to work the welfare chislers and cheaters are having breakfast in bed Youre working for them If you vote for Ed King well catch those chislers Edward J King is the Democratic candidate for Governor of Massachusetts  a fact that makes this election one of the most interesting in the country How can a man who sounds at times like Spiro Agnew be running as a Democrat in what has been considered the most liberal state in the country As always in politics there are many answers to the question Ed King beat Governor Michael Dukakis in the Democratic primary partly because of accumulated grievances against the incumbent Some liberals for example exercising their talent for silliness opposed Mr Dukakis because a budget crisis had forced him to cut state services Singleissue politics the phenomenon of the moment has much to do with Ed Kings success He is for capital punishment and against abortion making major campaign themes of those two issues that aroused so much passion We ran a hate campaign a King aide Angelo Berlandi said on the night of the primary victory We put all the hate groups in one big pot and let it boil Economic issues are basic to the King candidacy He has promised to cut property taxes by 40 percent in three years without reducing necesary services And he has promised greater economic growth in the state Mr King was director of the Massachusetts Port Authority for 10 years putting through huge construction projects and he is running as a man who can create new jobs He brushes aside environmental concerns for instance saying that nuclear power plants should go ahead because disposal of the waste is no problem In a speech prepared for a labor convention the other day he attacked the socalled superliberals He said They are what I call socialprogram liberals and economic reactionaries They smother you with social pro grams yet stifle a growth economy that would make those social programs a reality In those words one hears an echo of what Ben Wattenberg and the Committee for a Democratic Majority have been telling liberal Democrats for the last several years that they have to care more about jobs about the feelings of ordinary people and less about reformist ideas Mr King has attracted wide support from both unions and industry with his pledges of more jobs and lower taxes But Ben Wattenberg and others who want the Democratic Party to focus more on middle America have not indicated that the price would be drop ping the partys other familiar concerns for human rights the environment and the poor Ed Kings candidacy suggests that that is the price At the Port Authority Mr King bulldozed people and communities out of his way He was insensitive to blacks and other minorities who wanted a chance at jobs He operated largely in secret keeping the plans and the power to himself His campaign has played on fear Mr King disavows that intention denying the truth of or responsibility for such incidents as his aides hate comment But many think the most telling statement by his opponent State Senator Francis Hatch was Ed King scares me Mr Hatch is a Yankee Republican in something of the Leverett Saltonstall mold The question is whether he can appeal to Democrats as Mr Saltonstall did in this heavily Democratic state The answer will decide the election But the more interesting contest I think is for the soul of the Democratic Party Its leading figures are having to decide whether Ed King is the future  a future to bet on because it works And in the process some have been badly damaged Thomas P ONeill 3rd Lieutenant Governor and son of Speaker Tip ONeill had been regarded as a liberal After the primary he tried to temporize saying he would only support not endorse Mr King After playing that word game for a while he lamely gave up and endorsed Mr King The episode portrayed Tom ONeill as a profile in putty President Carter came to Massachusetts and raised Mr Kings hand in his  presumably to please Tip ONeill Senator Edward Kennedy by cont rast has stayed icily aloof I think his judgment will prove correct Even in Alabama George Wallace is finished Whoever wins this election Massachusetts Democrats cannot be comfortable for long with an Ed King
Views of Carey and Duryea on the Campaign Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/06/archives/views-of-carey-and-duryea-on-the-campaign-issues-jobs.html,In a battle over issues ranging from A for Abortion to W for Welfare Governor Carey and his RepublicanConservative challenger Perry B Duryea have agreed on one view  that New York State is once again on the way up In a long and frequently bitter campaign they have differed on how it got where it is and each contends naturally that he could speed progress The following are some of their contentions and their proposals JOBS The DemocraticLiberal Governor seeking reelection contends that the state has 74 million jobs of all kinds a record up 104000 in the last year alone after a loss of 500000 jobs between 1969 and 1976 Mr Duryea the Assembly minority leader says that hundreds of businesses have moved out in the last four years and that the states 77 percent unemployment is 2 points above the national average Mr Duryea says that building a strong economic base would be his No I priority In addition to reducing tax burdens for every 1y Mr Duryea offers such ideas as a tax credit of S250 for each newly created job in existing or new businesses For all businesses he proposes rolling back the corporate tax rate from 10 percent to 85 He also suggests a concept of tax havens in some depressed areas in which new businesses might be exempt from state and local taxes Governor Carey says that his administration has aggresively promoted business and tourism citing efforts of Commerce Commissioner John S Dyson and an I Love New York campaign He says that business taxes should be brought down from 10 to at least 9 percent He looks to newly authorized free trade zones in banking and insurance to create 15000 jobs The average number of privatesector jobs in New York State in 1974 just before Mr Carey became Governor was 577 million compared with about 56 million in the first seven months this year Because of the 1975 nationwide recession the state has had a gain of 107800 private jobs as compared with the 1975 average In the last four Republican gubernatorial years jobs in the state actually declined by 27 percent while the nation gained 86 percent in jobs  the Carey years have seen a rise of 2 percent compared with the nations 11 percent BUDGET Governor Carey calls the coming state budget  this years ran about 12 billion  his major tool to shape the future He contends that the current fiscal year will end with a surplus of 611 million because of job growth and efficiencies He proFees using this surplus for such purposes as increasing education aid by 220 million picking up localities shares of Supplementary Security Income for the aged blind and disabled poor by 110 million paying 75 million for courts in localities and increasing state revenue sharing to localities by 50 million Mr Duryea and his running mate for Comptroller Edward V Regan have suggested that the state might face a budget gap next year  anywhere from 200 million to 500 million  because of nonrecurring receipts of various kinds But they also contend that there are needs and opportunities for tax cuts Governor Carey contends that he found a 600 million deficit when he took office but all estimates of deficits and gaps are subject to differing views by account ants He did have to face and overcome a default on notes of the State Urban Development Corporation involving socalled moral obligation state debt rather than the states own securities And in his first year he froze state hiring and salaries TAXES There have been cuts in state taxes enacted in the last two years totaling 11 billion and both candidates promise more Mr Duryea offers a fiveyear plan for 22 billion in tax reductions in all which includes 750 million legislated this year On the income tax for instance he would reduce the five top brackets over a threeyear period so that the maximum rate would become 10 percent on incomes of 15000 and over as against the present 12 percent on 21000 His plan also calls for raising personal exemptions and standard deductions to conform with Federal tax cuts and instituting a 50 earned income tax credit for each worker Both Governor Carey and Mr Duryea propose expanding the new socalled circuit breaker system that provides state rebates for the elderly when their income exceeds certain limits on income in relation to realestate taxes or rent The Governor proposes these limits be raised and the rebate concept extended to farmers But the Governor contends that Mr Durreas proposal would involve a 600 million cost that would go mostly into areas where there would be in effect a reward for localities with high taxes Mr Carey says that he prefers increased direct state aid to localities coupled with a requirement that the localities then reduce taxes for everybody CRIME Governor Carey asserts that there was a decrease in reported violent and property crimes last year and throug the first half of this year for the first time in five years Critics note that this occurred as the proportion of the states population in ages most criminal prone15 to 25  has decreased But the public impression of widespread crime has been a major electoral factor Mr Duryea calls for a revived death penalty for murder while Mr Carey twice vetoed such death penalty bills in 1977 and 1978 and even said that he would commute all death sentences if his veto were overriden The Governor contends that the death penalty would not deter crime and would disproportionately hit poor and nonwhite defendants who might lack adequate legal defense This years special legislative session convened by Governor Carey enacted new anticrime laws  late in Mr Duryeas opinion  that toughened sentences for violent crimes by both juveniles and adults and restricted plea bargaining Mr Carey says that the states prison population has increased onefourth since 1974 and thinks that a state takeover of New York Citys Bikers Island would be able to handle likely fur ther increases Mr Duryea supports a state bond issue to borrow funds for the construction of new facilities NEW YORK CITY Governor Carey says that he fought successfully to avert bankruptcy by New York City in 1975 bringing about the creation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation to refinance the city debt and the Emergency Financial Control Board to monitor the citys finances He charges that Mr Duryea voted against both these programs The Assem bly minority leader contends that he did so when the Legislature was not yet being told the full extent of the citys problems Thereafter with fuller information Mr Duryea says that he helped persuade President Gerald R Ford to support Federal loans to the city TRANSIT Governor Carey says tnat he has earmarked 30 million in the states financial plan to keep transit and transportation fares at present levels over the next four years Mr Duryea says that the Governor broke a 1979 pledge to maintain the 35cent subway and bus fare in New York City but Mr Duryea does say that it is a possible and obtainable goal that fares can be maintained at present levels for the next four years EDUCATION Both Governor Carey and Mr Duryea are proposing that the state pay half the cost of public education as against the present 40 percent aid WELFARE Mr Duryea says that he would fight welfare and Medicaid fraud which he says the State Welfare Inspector General estimates as 1 billion a year Governor Carey says that welfare ineligibility has been halved during his administration with a reduction of 100000 recipients in overall relief rolls in the last year MENTAL CARE Mr Duryea charges that mental hospital patients are being releasd or dumped on communities without adequate aftercare and proposes a moratorium on releases until improvements are made Governor Carey says that such unsatisfactory releases preceded his administration and a new program is training and monitoring patients involved The Governor says that there are now 300 community hostels for the retarded up from 57 four years aao HEALTH Governor Carey says that he has established state controls on hospital charges and slowed the growth of Medicaid costs from a former 20 percent a year to 8 percent Mr Duryea charges that hospitals are facing a financial crisis brought about by Carey administration policies ABORTION Mr Duryea supported a bill to require parental consent for abortions for minors Governor Carey vetoed the bill Mr Duryea has voted to ban Medicaid financing of abortions although giving localities the option to pick up such costs Governor Carey has continued state financing for abortions for indigent pregnant women although personally opposing abortions DISCLOSURES Governor Carey has questioned why Mr Duryea paid Federal and state income taxes of only 12207 on an adjusted gross income of 47188 last year He has called his opponent a millionaire while saying that his own income tax payments to the Federal state and New York City governments were 28822 on an income of 79815 His own net worth Mr Carey said is 140000 The Governor demanded that Mr Duryea release his tax returns for the last five years and said that his rivals net worth report of 668699 currently was 300000 below a 1976 bank statement Mr Duryea said that the difference was because the earlier statement included assets in his wifes name and other assets transferred to other family members In turn Mr Duryea contends that the Governors brother Edward an oil company head may have had an excessive role in Mr Careys 1979 gubernatorial victory
New York State and City,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/06/archives/new-york-state-and-city-mr-carey-for-governor.html,Mr Carey for Governor Hugh Carey became Governor of New York four years ago in a time of financial deficit and decline The state and two of its largest cities were threatened by bankruptcy Taxes had sapped New Yorks ability to compete for businesses and jobs In the midst of recession the imperial projects of his Republican predeces sor and the humanitarian programs of his Democratic constituency had to be halted while still being paid for As Mr Carey put it with charm and understatement the days of wine and roses were indeed over For bravely pursuing dozens of difficult remedies Mr Carey deserves the appreciation of all New Yorkers He raised taxes to restore the states credit and then could finally lower them to promote economic revival He helped New York City and Yonkers to survive without neglecting the most urgent needs of other regions He cut spending humanely And he did all this with a politically divided Legislature whose Republican leaders aspired to his job If he had done nothing else but gain control of our budget and look aggressively to our economic survival the Governor would have earned reelection But he did more He began the search for equity in state aid to education He attacked the costs of medical care and improved the quality of nursing homes He pressed for partial court reform and understood that court and prison administration contribute more to fighting crime than rhetoric He made good appointments He held to principle in resisting the death penalty and the denial of abortions to poor women Hugh Carey is also a deft politician and a complicated human being He has been too quick with some promises and too sly in political combat While doing hard things be has also yielded to the temptation of jug  gling budgets and programs to enhance appearances He has often been aloof while escaping the pressures of office and seeking to carve out a private life An unusually large number of associates have found him rude Beside a warm wit there lives a hot temper Beside an encyclopedic grasp of the issues there is evidence of periodic boredom with detail The state is abuzz with tales of both Playboy Hugh and Carey the Monk These things count but they cannot be decisive In the end this election poses the choice between an admirable performance and merely a benign promise Perry Duryea is an affable politician with a good knowledge of New York affairs His election would not drastically alter the states agenda or shift its politics from the broad center Indeed Mr Duryea promises best Mr Carey in only two significant ways by reducing both crime and taxes still faster That these issues play to the greatest concerns of the electorate is obvious That Mr Duryea knows how to deliver on either count is not He has exaggerated the symbolic effect of a death penalty And he looks to inflationary increases in revenue instead of difficult budget choices to finance more tax cuts Capital punishment aside theres not much there that Mr Carey wouldnt do or hasnt done In sum Mr Carey has been a good Governor and in some respects a courageous one His choice for Lieutenant Governor is just one more mark to his credit Both Mario Cuomo and Bruce Caputo are able men But if we could vote separately for this office we would prefer Mr Cuomo for his political maturity and experience On all counts we urge the reelection of Hugh Carey To reject him now would be to send the worst message to the world of politics it would be to reject a record of responsibility
NATION VOTES TODAY IN SKEPTICAL MOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/07/archives/nation-votes-today-in-skeptical-mood-issues-ignored-as-the.html,Issues Ignored as the Candidates Stress Personal Qualities Americans vote today to choose lawmakers and executives in a generally distrustful election mood that seems more concerned with judgments about candidates honesty and sincerity than about what they say on national issues or how they promise to solve problems The decisions today will follow an offyear election campaign in which legalized political spending by specialinterest groups soared to record highs enabling some candidates to finance milliondollar drives within their states [Page 27] Pnscihic neeisionMaker If candidates have managed to blunt most national issues there remain some matters on which a significant portion of the electorate said their vote would turn The biggest collection of such singleissue voters according to a midSeptember CBS news poll are the 7 percent of the population who said they would change their vote because of a candidates stand on abortion and about threefourths of that 7 percent opposed abortions In a close contest those views could make a difference and the Senate race in Iowa may be such a test with a strong righttolife movement critical of Senator Dick Clark a Democrat Opinion polls reports from Times correspondents across the country the judg The New York TimesFred R Conrad S William Green left Republican and Carter Burden Democrat running for Congress in Manhattan The New York TimesJoyce Dopkeen Angelo R Martinelli left Republican in Yonkers and Peter A Peyser Democrat in Irvington They seek a seat in Congress from Westchester Nations Voters Will Go to the Polls Today in a General Mood of Distrust ments of party leaders and doortodoor interviewing back up the obvious judgment many candidates have made  to make obligatory references to taxes and inflation but to concentrate on selling their character or their opponents lack of it One poll after another has shown intense public concern over inflation and a growing conviction that Federal spending is a prime cause of it But to the dismay of Republicans there is little indication that many votes in todays elections for 36 governorships 35 Senate seats all 435 House seats and legislators in 96 states will turn on those issues A major reason is that the Democrats have stolen much of the Republican thunder and are echoing past minority party complaints about excessive Federal spending Those calls do not come only from old liberals changing their tune Conservatives Among Democrats In a number of states they come from Democrats like Minnesotas Senate hopeful Robert Short or the Massachusetts gubernatorial nominee Edward J King  politicians who are more conservative by traditional measures than their Republican opponents But many observers argue that an even more important explanation of a largely issueless election at least in national terms is that prospective voters are deeply perhaps absolutely distrustful of any candidates promises and in resignation are more interested in an honest look and a new face than in a politician who promises to solve their problems The pattern is not universal Local issues do figure in a number of campaigns In many Congressional races and some Senate contests the Republicans proposed KempRoth 30 percent Federal income tax cut has been stressed enough so that it figures in voters judgments Local issues cut even more heavily A major issue in North Carolina legislative races fp the question of what to do with the states budget surplus  whether to spend it use it for a longterm tax cut or give it back in a single shot rebate Oregon Rebate Plan In Oregon Gov Robert Straub has pinned his hopes for reelection on a constitutional amendment providing 50 percent rebates of property taxes up to 1500 a taxpayer and limiting local spending His Republican opponent State Senator Victor Atiyeh is relying on an alternative patterned on Californias Proposition 13 that would limit property taxes to 15 percent of real market value Both measures are on the ballot and observers expect that the plan that gets the most votes will carry its champion to the governorship Still the broader national pattern is one of doubt about the political process and its relevance The September CBS poll showed that 26 percent of the public agreed with the statement So many people vote in an election that it doesnt matter whether I vote or not While agreement with that view was spread fairly evenly across the population it was highest among the poor the elderly and those with less than a highschool education Voters who said they would vote more often volunteered judgments about candi dates in personal terms than in relation to their stands on issues A woman in Seattle after setting out a series of concerns on issues that suggested she was far more liberal than Republican Representative Jack Cunningham said she intended to vote for him anyway because I just cant imagine someone with nine kids not being honest Vote for the New One In Baltimore a housewife asked her choice for Governor replied The new one uh Hughes a reference to Harry R Hughes the Democratic candidate In Chicago one voter after another explained his choice for Governor or for the Senate in terms of which candidate he disliked least In Denver a retired pharmacist grudgingly explained his support for a Senate candidate this way I dont think hes as full of it as some of them Those same prospective voters sometimes spoke of candidates favorably or critically in terms of local issues like water in Colorado or a homosexualsights referendum in Seattle But they more often argued like a Baltimore pensioner that Issues are nothing or in the words of a Chicago freight car dispatcher Nobody could keep a promise The rare enthusiasms found for individual candidates in this unscientific look at prospective voters in several middleclass precincts that have been closely divided in past elections usually came from the record of an incumbent Gov James R Thompson in Illinois was often praised for holding taxes down And Mr Hughes the new one in Maryland also drew enthusiasm because of his independence from established poilitics in that state and his resignation from a Cabinet office under former Gov Marvin Mandel recently convicted on corruption charges In general the tendency of the voters was to dismiss issues as a basis for casting a vote The candidates this fall not only learned from those sentiments they also fed them This did not mean that they avoided national issues  not only inflation and taxes  but areas where their local polls showed other things mattered such as national defense or the Panama Canal The purpose was often merely defensive On inflation for example the recommendations of two political consultants the Republicans Edward Mahe and the Democrats Mark Shields were remarkably similar You cannot say I have a solution it just wont sell said Mr Mahe But youve always got to have a TV spot talking about it Mr Shields agreed saying that even if neither candidate could offer a more persuasive solution he could project a more persuasive and sympathetic manner that might win him or her votes on character even if they were not awarded for the candidates proposal on inflation Even though many candidates followed that prescription large numbers followed a different route in interpreting the national mood with a spectacular number of negative television commercials attacking the opponent In Oregon this approach extended beyond individual candidates as dentists opposing a referendum that would allow technicians to fit false teeth filled the airwaves with commercials showing malformed jaws presumably the consequence of what they viewed as a lowering of professional standards
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/07/archives/letters-nuclear-waste-our-suicidal-path-land-of-a-billion-zip-code.html,To the Editor Bravo for your welltaken stand in the Aug 5 editorial on the Time Bomb in Love Canal Your coverage of the issue was excellently done I am only distressed that the current newspaper strike has prevented a followup and completion of this story among many others I wish to bring to your attention a matter of great pertinence in this recent awakening to the danger of toxicmaterials dumping The grave problem of nuclear waste disposal the Achilles heel of the nuclear industry has been sorely ignored in its insurmountability In Love Canal we are faced with the backlash of our carelessness in the dumping of relatively simple in comparison with radioactive wastes toxic substances and we see how poorly the matter has been handled As you astutely observed the problem exists not just in Love Canal but quite probably on a national and international scale taking into account the many new industrialized nations which must face the same disposal problems The parallel problem of nuclear waste disposal seems obvious except that when one begins to consider the immensity of the problem of handling and safely disposing of deadly radioactive wastes which remain deadly for hundreds of thousands of years outliving any containers into which they might be sealed and unavoidably leaking into and contaminating the enviromnent the situation at Love Canal rapidly diminishes in scope and becomes almost insignificant I in no way mean to discount the incalculable suffering and loss experienced by the people who lived in the Love Canal area I only wish to emphasize that as we bemoan our mistakes and carelessness of a mere 25 years ago we set the scene for a potential disaster which couldeasily outlive hu manity altogether The protracted refusal to recognize the gravity of this problem as radioactive wastes continue to accumulate is diabolic beyond comprehension It is in effect pronouncing a death sentence upon the earth into which this poison is to be hidden and upon the tens of generations which will be burdened with managing the refuse of our greed and ruthlessness Humanity is currently at a cross roads which has undoubtedly never before been encountered We clearly have the facilities at hand with which to destroy life on the earth And we are Well aware of that The insidiousness of the problem which I am referring to is that these wastes are the result of attempts to create a better life for all through limitless energy production Yet there are many difficulties still to be overcome within the current system of atomic energy production questions on cost effectiveness plant breakdown etc before we are to realize the pieinthesky benefits promised There is at this time absolutely no way to get around the poisonous wastes of nuclear reactors The risks imposed upon future generations easily outweigh the benefits to our generation The tragedy of Love Canal can be redeemed by recognizing that we cannot continue on the path of suicidal disregard for the earth our home The other path that of alternative energy development promises no getrichquick solutions to our needs but it is more in keeping with lifecentered natural processes which are readily available to all It is to these soft energy paths which we must turn if we are to assure the continuation of life on this planet RUTH WEISS New York Aug 24 1978 The letters on this page were received at The New York Times during the 88day newspaper strike They were part of an uninterrupted flow of reader comment on a great variety of issues Land of a Billion ZIP Code Zones To the Editor The Postal Service proposes to add four digits to our present fivedigit ZIP code system  a total of nine digits This will give us one billion ZIP zones 000000000 to 999999999 equals one billion combinations of digits Is not the Postal Service being overgenerous Using the 1970 census showing a national population of just over 200 million one billion ZIP zones would enable every man woman and child in our country to be the proud sole owner of five ZIP zones Even were the Postmaster General in his infinite wisdom to reduce the proposed new system to eight digits that still provides one hundred million ZIP zones 00000000 to 99999999 equals 100000000 combinations of digits That would mean that a childless couple would be required to share a ZIP zone pity I ask you to try to comprehend the manhours involved in subdividing the country into one billion ZIP zones Savor the picture of a little Postal Service gnome puzzling over the subdivision of the Empire State Building into several thousand ZIP zones Envisage the Postal Service Manual listing one billion ZIP zones It would list each man woman and child in the 50 states followed by an address and the two ZIP numbers assigned to each One for frontdoor delivery and the other for backdoor delivery Using the number of likings per page in a telephone directory as a standard we find that the manual would be a row of volumes 287 feet long  almost the length of a football field Since births and deaths will continue to occur the manual will be out of date before publication Euripides said Whom the Gods would destroy they first make mad I suggest that the Postal Service bureaucrats take cover PEIRCE WOOD Melbourne Fla Sept 16 1978 Kimble Mead The Peacekeepers To the Editor In the 11 years since the SixDay War with Israel occupying as the mass media would say the West Bank there have been some violent incidents suitably acclaimed in tall black headlines In the past two years the Syrians have maintained a peacekeeping force in Lebanon In almost any single day the Syrian peacekeepers have slain more Christians than have died in all the 11 years of Israeli occupation of the West Bank in clashes between troops and Arabs The persistence of the mass media in referring to the Israelioccupied West Bank and the Syrian peacekeeping force speaks volumes for the tendentiousness of the media Despite the statistics the media including The Times stick to the Israeli occupation and the Syrian peacekeeping force How fortunate for the West Bank Arabs that they are not having their peace kept by the Syrians HENRY BRENNER Plandome Manor L IAug 16 1978 On Respecting Life To the Editor Yesterday the biggest military spending appropriation in US history was approved after being amended to restrict drastically any funding for abortions among military personnel Someone who believes as I do in a womans right to choose when and if to become pregnant or to remain pregnant even if this requires an abortion can occasionally stretch her mind to understand those who oppose abortion out of a sincere belief that it is an attack on human life But the incongruity  and the profound hypocrisy of the campaign against a womans right to choose appear in stark relief in this news item Where is the evidence of a respect for life in this enormous and unprecedented expenditure for military hardware HESTER EISENSTEIN New York Aug 10 1978 Strikes and the Public A Lacking Forum To the Editor In common with other New Yorkers I experienced a feeling of helplessness as I watched the newspaper strike drag on week after week The public was totally excluded  from the negotiation process Sheer economic strength of the respective sides appeared to be the only relevant factor In strikes of this nature where the community has a vital stake it would seem that there should be an avenue for public opinion to make itself felt In an age of mass communication it is socially backward to conduct labor disputes in the same manner as we did a half century ago in the preelectronic era The television and radio stations of this city for example could have staged a series of onair debates between the union and the publishers In confrontations of this nature the real issues could emerge more clearly than in the scanty superficial coverage on the nightly news Viewers would have had a chance to evaluate the positions of the adversaries Public opinion

Books of TheTimes,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/08/archives/books-of-the-times.html,WHEN she was 5 years old a child of my acquaintance one day announced a theory that she was inhabited by rabbits There was a team of rabbits inside of her she insisted who were responsible for her every func The Times of My Life By Betty Ford with Chris Chase 305 pages Illustrated Harper  RowReaders Digest 51095 tion When she cried it was because the rabbits were pouring salty water through her eyes and the beat of her heart was to be explained by the rabbits pounding on a tomt6m Her theory was smiled at and dismissed by most who heard it but I secretly admired and stored it away for being as good description as Ive ever heard of the part of our behavior that lies beyond our control and consciousness After all to a degree with each of us the rabbits are in charge Betty Ford the wife of former President Gerald R Ford has been both praised and damned in her time for being the sort of person who allowed the public to see her rabbits Her controversial remarks cm premarital sex and abortion her revelation that she intended to share her husbands bed in the White House her candor concerning her bouts with cancer and chemical dependency each was a way of saying that there were things in life beyond our control and she for one was not going to close her eyes to them or gloss them over This was unusual behavior for a person in public life who is not supposed to _ admit the existence of rabbits To some degree Mrs Fords autobiography The Times of My Life is an extension of that behavior Basically the book is the story of a fairly conventional Middle Western woman from Grand Rapids Mich who married the most eligible bachelor in town expecting to spend the rest of her life as a lawyers wife but to her amazement ended up in the White House So here is what its like to raise a family when youre married to a public figure Here is how you entertain kings and princesses Here is life in the White House Our bed and bedding and pillows are in the First Ladys Bedroom and the room usually referred to as the Presidents Bedroom has been made into a private sitting room for us There are Jerrys favorite blue leather chair and footstool and his exercise bike and all his pipes and pipe rack and our old television set The pictures of the children  from babyhood through Mikes and Gayles wedding  are hanging on the walls So Jerry and will have one room in that great big White House that isnt all stuffed with important furniture Besides at the end of the day no matter now marvelous the help is Im going to want a place to escape to a corner I can crawl into someplace where I can shut a door I am not going to want to sit out in some dumb hall But as the foregoing passage should indicate she never stopped being plain Elizabeth Ann Bloomer from Grand Rapids And plain Betty Bloomer from Grand Rapids was a divorcee when she met Jerry Ford She squabbled with her children especially her daughter even after the family moved into the center of the countrys attention After her husband became House minority leader she tried to lose herself in the busyness of being a mother and a wife but there were physical ills loneliness and the loss of a sense of selfesteem all of which led to a drinking problem and the need for psychotherapy Finally after her husbands loss of the Presidency in 1976 there was the acknowledgement of a dependency on painkillers and alcohol and the public coming to grips with these addictions All in all it had been good But into every life the rabbits intrude This is at least the way that Betty Ford seems to want us to see it  as an essentially joyful life incidentally and intermittently disrupted by random unhappiness But there is another way one could look at it One could point to the youthful ambitions to be a dancer which were aborted by something Mrs Ford never quite explains though she suggests a number of superficial possibilities among them lack of dedication a sense of her mothers disapproval and sheer conventionality One could point to her subsequent unsuccessful marriage to Bill Warren which she practically admits was undertaken in rebellion against parental authority Finally one could emphasize that her first psychological break occurred just as her husband was approaching the fulfillment of his ambition to be majority leader with the consequence that she had to bury her own ambitions beneath the burdens of family All in all it also adds up to a life of muted rage Which might explain the perfunctoriness with which she describes much of her experience in the White House and the almost comic banality of her reports on affairs of state  In the end I honestly dont know which way The Times of My Life should be read  as an unhappy life gotten through by dint of grit or as a joyful passage undermined by occasional misfortune I suppose it depends on the readers point of view Its even conceivable that Mrs Ford viewed things one way while her collaborator Chris Chase saw and interpreted them another But however one explains the book it has a quality of being unintentional All in all the last word belongs to the rabbits

Most Voters Stay With Democrats As Anti‐Incumbent Feeling Eases,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/08/archives/most-voters-stay-with-democrats-as-antiincumbent-feeling-eases.html,American voters stayed with the Democrats yesterday giving the Republicans only modest gains if that as they spurned the Republican Partys call for sharp Federal tax cuts Continued Democratic domination of the House was assured and probably at a level close to the 283to146 edge maintained at the adjournment of the 95th Congress It was clear that the Republicans were failing to make major inroads In the first 190 House races decided in fact the Republicans had picked up three Democratic seats but had lost three of their own for a net draw The Senate picture was not as clear The Republicans had a chanceas count ing continued early today for a gain of two or possibly three seats but the first 10 party switches counted broke evenly for each party The party split at adjournment in the Senate was 62 to 33 GOPWin Governorships Only in governorships did the results favor the minority party with a pickup of six or seven likely But the only major state won by the Republicans was Pennsylvania after earlier hopes in California New York and Massachusetts faded But it represented an improvement in the past pattern where there were 37 Democrats 12 Republicans and one independent in governors offices Massachusetts turned out Edward W Brooke a liberal Republican and the only black in the Senate who had been plagued for months with accusations of scandal in connection witgh the finances of his divorce settlement But he was replaced with an even more liberal legislator Representative Paul E Tsongas Mr Brookes defeat was something of surprise because he had appeared to have gained momentum in the final days of the campaign Conceding defeat he said When I was down in the valley I didnt cry I cried out  you gave me the strength to go on He praised Mr Tsongas who did not cite the finance issue for an honorable campaign But numerically this and other important switches in party strength in the Senate tended to balance out Mississippi chose its first Republican Senator since Reconstruction when it elected Representative Thad Cochran td replace the retiring chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator James 0 Eastland Issues did not clearly sway the election and that was a setback for the Republicans who had stressed the KempRoth proposal for a 30 percent cut in Federal income taxes A national poll of voters leaving polling places conducted by The New York Times and CBS News showed a rejection of the KempRoth proposal along with 3to1 support for the view that reducing Federal spending was more important than cutting taxes But voters in several states eagerly backed referendums that would curb states taxes or spending Returns in many Senate and governorship races along with scattered House results showed a diminution of the antiincumbent mood that had shown up in many primaries earlier this year But in one notable case Mayor Frank L Rizzo of Philadelphia was defeated in an effort to get the City Charter amended to allow him to seek a third term The results and clear leads in some House races showed that 94 percent of the incumbents on the ballot were winning reelection which meant that the major thrust of Republican efforts to defeat newcomers elected in 974 and 976 before they solidified their strength and to defeat some senior incumbents who they charged had lost touch was failing The voting came at the end of what appeared to be the most expensive Congressional campaigns in history And the way the money was used depending heavily on negative personal television commercials devoted more to attacking an opponent than to explaining a candidates own virtues or proposed solutions was reported in many states to have succeeded only in turning off more voters than swayed Prefer Cuts in Spending Despite the frequent campaign pitch from candidates on all sides in favor of tax cuts  the new Democratic Senator from Oklahoma David Boren supported the Republican KempRoth tax cut for example  the voters interviewed in the TimesCBS poll at 120 scientifically selected precincts across the country said by a 3to1 margin that they thought it was more important to cut spending than taxes That view prevailed across almost all categories of voters except for blacks and Hispanics More narrowly the voters interviewed said they did not support a large Federal income tax cut regardless of its effect on prices or government services That concept was opposed 50 percent to 42 percent But regardless of the impact of those Democratic arguments against the Republican plan the issue did not seem to affect individual voting patterns The view was held almost equally by those who voted for either Republicans or Democrats Analysis of a questionnaire prepared by The New York Times and CBS suggests that the incoming Congress appears to be more conservative than the outgoing but only slightly so Based on views expressed in the questionnaire on 10 major issues likely to face the 96th Congress the new and the old members tend to agree on issues such as Federal financing of Congressioal elections which had the support of 51 percent of the outgoing Congress and apparently has the backing of 50 percent of the incoming and on Federal funding of abortions which had had the support of 37 percent of the old Congress and 35 percent of the new agree Over all incomplete results from the precincts sampled in the survey showed that Democratic House candidates rationally were drawing about 52 percent of the vote Republicans were getting 40 percent with the remainder either supporting other candidates or not voting for Congressmen Such a pattern if i t held up for the electorate as a whole would be likely to bring about only minor changes in the composition of the House Favor Balanced Budget Other findings from the poll showed the voters heavily favoring a law requiring a balanced national budget Overall the percentage favoring such a proposition was 76 to 15 While Republicans and conservatives were more likely to back such a plan than Democrats or liberals even in the latter groups it got heavy support That issue may confront the new Congress directly because 22 state legislatures have voted for resolutions calling for a constitutional convention to deal with an amendment on the balanced budget If 10 more states join them Congress under the Constitution would be obliged to call such a convention One of the few issues that clearly divided the backers of Democratic and Republican candidates was the issue of national health insurance Asked if they favored a national health insurance fully paid by the Government those surveyed split almost evenly with 45 percent in favor and 47 percent against However those favoring the concept supported Democrats by just over a 2toI edge while those opposed to it backed Republicans by a 4to3 margin Finally the voters indicated that they favored stronger financial backing for the Social Security system despite the increased payroll taxes voted last year and due to go into eject in January That too is an issue on which the Republicans tried to capitalize in the campaign but overall the voters surveyed rejected cutting back those taxes 63 percent to 25 Even Republicans favored keeping the higher tax level 63 percent to 33 The general antitax stance did no prove to be a key to victory in Senate races either Bob Short the Minnesota businessman who had made enthusiastic appeals for Federal tax cuts m winning the norninatioin to Hubert H HumphreyS old Senate seat lost heavily to David Durenberger a Republican lawyer In New Jersey where a similar appeal had won the Senate primary nomination for Jeffrey Bell a Republican it did hin little good in the general election ITP young former aide in Ronald Reagan 1976 Presidential campaign was beaten solidly by Bill Bradley the Democratic former New York Knicks basketball player While Reoublican moderates like Mr Brooke and Robert P Griffin of Michigan went down to defeat in Senate races the overall

Another Success in the Carey Success Story,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/08/archives/another-succcss-in-the-carey-success-story-stereotype-forgotten.html,For Gov Hugh L Carey an aloof strongwilled man who stood 30 points down in the polls in June last nights results were a moment of sweet vindication The contest all along was between Hugh Carey and Hugh Carey between the Governors strengths and weaknesses The orJy question was who was who for Hugh Carey is a complex enigmatic and often contradictory figure Often seen as a brooding loner he is also a man of convivial charm given to spinning a whimsical tale or crooning an Irish song Frequently seemingly bored by being Governor he comes alive in a crisis moving rapidly for instance between Albany Washington and New York to pull the city of its fiscal crisis As a seventerm Congressman from Brooklyn Mr Carey was usually described as portly which in the lexicon of political reportage translates along with cigarsmoking as party hack But David Garth the political alchemist trimmed him down darkened his hair it is gray again this year and helped elect him Governor in 1974 Stereotype Forgotten The old stereotype is long forgotten now as the Governor in his gray pinstipes and Gucci loafers mingles with the Beautiful People Indeed he is as often mentioned in the gossip columns these days as in the political ones  his friendship with Anne Ford Uzielli being an item The Governor has bristled at criticism that he has been known to enter what he referred to as licensed premises and has vowed that he would no longer socialize in public Mr Carey strained during the campaign to remind voters that indeed the state had a Governor for the last four years This was known in his campaign headquarters as the inaccessability issue the disclosure in the Governors own polls that many voters felt he was aloof and barely visible as the states chief executive Thus he roamed the state in recent weeks as a working Governor announcing stateaid programs signing bills appearing accessible A Primary Challenge The perception of the Governor as an irascible loner whose acerbic remarks sometimes shredded aides was strengthened when his own Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak challenged him in the primary Some of his aides secretely welcomed the battle however believing that it energized the Governor for the main bout with Mr Duryea He is supposedly a man who runs best on a dreneIin a fierce fighter who rises to a crisis ready for combat Miss Krupsak was net the first to have a falling out with the Governor Mr Carey severed his alliance with Mayor Abraham Beame who helped elect him during New York Citys fiscal crisis He interjected Mario Cuomo into the primary last year then dropped him Earlier he had dismissed his handpicked Democratic Party chairman when the chairman came under grandjury investigation Perhaps the Governors most politically unpopular and risky act was his repeated vetoes of capital punishment legislation The death penalty has become an emotional and volatile issue many credit Mayor Kochs nomination to his support of capital punishment but Mr Carey has said he was so morally opposed that he would commute the sentences of anyone convicted under such legislation The Governor has taken an equally unpopular and risky stand on another highly emotional issueabortionby insisting that poor women have a right to publicly financed abortions Mr Carey is the father of 12 children and has strong personal reservations about abortion Hugh Leo Carey was born on April 11 1919 in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn the grandson of an immigrant hod carrier His father ran an oil business which his older brother Edward M Carey has turned into New England Petroleum one of the largest private companies in the world It is thus a family that has become wealthy and some of the wealth aided Mr Carey gain the governorship He graduated  like many of the citys political figures  from St Johns University and St Johns Law Schooi His education was interrupted by World War II which he entered as a private and left as an infantry major winning the Bronze Star after leading his unit into the Ruhr  Wife Died in 1974 After the war he met and married the former Helen Owen Twohy whose husband had died in the Pacific and adopted her daughter Together they raised 14 children Two of the sons died in an automobile accident in 1969 Mrs Carey died of cancer in 1974 Still the Governor is said to be guided in times of crisis by what he believes Mrs Carey would have thought was right Mr Carey was elected to Congress in 1960 from what had been a traditionally Republican area and established a reputation as a diligent regular generally liberal respectful of the hierarchy He rose to the Ways and Means Cornmittee The party regulars were not surprized when he failed to make a dent in the 1969 Mayoral primary Upset in 74 Primary But in 1974 he upset the party favorite Howard J Samuels for the guberatorial nomination and went on to overwhelm Gov Malcolm L Wilson a Republican Mr Carey managed to survive some broken former alliances and a number of unkept promisessuch as the pledge to protect the 35cent subway fare His quickness with words was evident in the campaign A favorite line came when his opponents name was slurred by a questioner so that it sounds like the expensive French bubbly water Perrier Perrier is a fine mineral water the Governor cries interrupting But nothing is better than New York State Saratoga water
BROOKE LOSES RACE FOR 3D SENATE TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/08/archives/brooke-loses-race-for-3d-senate-term-only-black-in-chamber-defeated.html,BOSTON Nov 7  Edward W Brooke the nations only black Senator was defeated tonight for reelection to a third term after months of damaging disclosures about his personal life and family finances The 59yearold Republican was beaten by Representative Paul E Tsongaa a liberal Democrat from the factory town of Lowell who had only a 12 percent statewide recognition factor in polls before he challenged the incumbent Senator Brooke who had been considered unbeatable before a bitterly contested divorce led to the disclosures was unable to stem a steady erosion of support His campaign alternately attempted to ignore the disclosures and to depict him as a hounded and somewhat bewildered victim of the press and his family Senator Brooke took his defeat calmly in a concession speech tonight Flanked by his mother and his sister he told campaign supporters here When I was down in the valley I didnt cry I cried out  you gave me the strength to go on Compliments His Rival He said that there were others in the Senate who would continue to champion the causes of minorities and women and complimented Representative Tsongas on the honorable manner in which he conducted his campaign The same electorate that chose an extremely liberal Congressman to fill the seat of a moderately liberal Republican in the Senate meanwhile appeared in early returns to have elected an extremely conservative Democrat Governor over a moderately conservative Republican Edward J King the former director of the states port agency who had campaigned on a promise of a 500 million tax cut raises for state workers and his positions in favor of capital punishment and against abortion defeated Francis W Hatch Jr the minority leader of the State House of Representatives who had campaigned as an alternative for decent citizens in a race marked by bitter namecalling Mr King defeated Democratic Gov Michael S Dukakis a liberal Democrat in the September primary The election left the Republican Party here without a single statewide officeholder Both the senatorial and gubernatorial contests in Massachusettes created unusually painful choices for voters this Year Held Various Offices Despite an overwhelmingly Democratic voter registration Senator Brooke had been regularly elected to a variety of public offices for 16 years because of his liberalism and his race But this year the voters were forced to weigh his symbolic importance as the first black to sit in the Senate since Reconstruction days against recent accusations made against him His problems began last spring when his two daughters succeeded in having details of his family finances publicized in an attempt to win a more generous divorce settlement for their mother Remigia Brooke The Senator has been absolved of possible perjury and of violations of the Senate ethics code in connection with his finances but a state investigation into possible welfare fraud is still under way His opponent Representative Tsongas a softspoken 37yearold Democrat who was given a 100 percent liberal rating by Americans for Democratic Action avoided referring to either Senator Brookes legal problems or his race in campaign that generated little heat Senator Brooke made only veiled references to both issues At one point he said Theres more at stake here that Ed Brooke He also described in one debate a nightmarelike vision of recent events in which I was mining through the woods the hounds were yelping and the posse behind me and I didnt know why Fiery Gubernatorial Race The gubernatorial campaign in marked contrast was a fiery one with both the Democratic candidate Mr King and the Republican State Representative Hatch regularly trading insults Party defections were widespread on both sides as Representative Hatch played on fears of Democrats about Mr King a conservative who had considered running as a Republican Some liberal Democrats turned to Mr Hatch Some Republicans considered him too liberal and went over to the Democratic candidate Ed King scares me Mr Hatch said at one point in the campaign a comment that apparently touched a basic nerve among voters and helped to erode Mr Kings early 32point lead in the public opinion polls to dead even at the close of the campaign
A Pattern of Stability,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/08/archives/a-pattern-of-stability-with-incumbents-faring-well-results-indicate.html,For all the preelection talk about the mood of revolt among the voters the first results indicated that there was far less rebellion across the nation than had beer anticipated and that incumbents ever those with liberal records were faring News Analysis better than expected The pattern of the early returns followed that of the past three Congressional elections in which voters returned all but five percent of the members who sought reelection regardless of vocal complaints about Washington among the electorate And despite the widely reported conservative mood of the voters there was surprisingly nonideological pattern to the relatively modest scattering of upsets in the House and Senate races The liberal wing of the Democratic Party lost two Senate seats  Floyd K Haskells in Colorado and William D Hathaways in Maine  but managed to pick up three new ones in New Jersey Michigan and Massachusetts Brooke and Griffin Defeated Similarly the moderateliberal Republican group in the Senate lost Edward W Brooke of Massachusetts and Robert P Griffin of Michigan but the GOPs moderate wing apparently gained new adherents in Maine Minnesota Kansas and South Dakota Several liberal Democrats in the House were caught in tough contests including some of those elected in the Democratic postWatergate victory wave in 14374 and in Kentucky one liberal Democrat lost his race with a conservative opponent in the district around Lexington  In New York Representative Edward W Pattison an upstate liberal lost to conservative Republican foeBut Representative Robert N Giamo of New Haven apparently staved off a strong challenge and other returns suggested that liberals were generally faring roughly as well as more conservative Democrats despite the pronounced conservative trend in public sentiment in preelection surveys These results if continued across the country seemed to be born out by a voting poll conducted by the New York Times and CBS News that indicated that voters were less conservative and more discriminating in their attitudes on the issue of taxcutting when it came to the Federal rather than state and local government spending Public Prefers Spending Cuts For while several tax limiting referendums were carrying by large margins in Alabama Illinois Missouri Texas and Michigan the sentiment seemed far different on Federal taxes and programs By a 3to1 margin people coming out of the voting booths favored maintaining recent increases in Social Security taxes and by a similar lopsided majority they preferred cutting spending rather than cutting taxes The contradiction in attitudes on state and Federal taxes appeared to confirm the position taken by President Carter who has steadfastly insisted that the publics tax revolt was aimed at state taxes and not Federal taxes In a recent session with reportem Mr Carter asserted that careful evaluation of White House mail had never shown the cutting of Federal tams especially income taxes as one of the top 10 issues concerning the American public Moreover the early returns in yesterdays elections suggested that for all the frustration voters have expressed about dissatisfaction with the Federal establishment in Washington voters were not as rough on incumbents as some observers had expected In the 10 Senate races that brought shifts from one party to another in fairly early returns only four incumbents were turned out of their seats  Republican Senators Brooke and Griffin and Democrats Floyd K Haskell of Colorado and William D Hathaway of Maine The other six party changes involved replacing incumbents who had retired Few Party Switches Seen With roughly half of the House races decided there were remarkably few party switches following the pattern of recent elections when 96 percent of House incumbents seeking reelection successfully defended their seats Only seven of the first 225 seats changed hands and in four of those the incumbents relinquished their seats Two of the three incumbents beaten in early decisions both faced criminal indictments One was Representative Joshua Eilberg a Pennsylvania Democrat charged by a Federal grand jury with conflict of interests relating to a Federal grant to a Philadelphia hospital The other was Representative J Herbert Burke a Florida Republican charged with a misdemeanor after a controversy over a narcotics incident The third Democratic less was that of Mr Pattison the New York liberal But because so many Democrats moved to the right cluing the campaign to preempt the tax issue from Republicans there were fewer than the usual number of clearcut ideological battles between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans In two of the first such races to be decided the two parties swapped seats In New Jersey Bill Bradley the 35yearold former Rhodes scholar and basketball star was a Democratic liberal against Jeffrey K Bell a Republican and the former political director of the American Conservative Union But a conservative Republican William Armstrong turned the tables in Colorado by defeating the incumbent liberal Mr Haskell The Republicans were leading in another tight ideological contest in the Iowa Senate race between Dick Clark the liberal Democratic incumbent and Roger Jepsen the conservative former lieutenant governor who used a number of single issues such as abortion to build his support Several Conservative Victories The relatively nonideological character of yesterdays voting showed up in conservative victories scored by both parties in Senate races in Mississippi Oklahoma and Nebraska The Republican Party picked up its firstpopularly elected Senator in Missis sippi history when Representative Thad Cochran won the seat long held by Senator James O Eastland who retired at the age of 73 after six terms Two conservative Democratic governors won seats left vacant by retiring Republicans in Nebraska and Oklahoma Donald Shasteen a Republican failed to defend the Nebraska seat given up by Senator Carl Curtis against Gov JJ Exon In Oklahoma Gov David Bohen picked up the seat given up by Senator Dewey Bartlett by emphasizing his own record as a fiscal conservative and by endorsing the Republican national campaign plank

13 States Curb Taxes or Spending; A Variety of Other Initiatives Fail,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/09/archives/13-states-curb-taxes-or-spending-a-variety-of-other-initiatives.html,A record number of initiatives were on ballots across the nation in Tuesdays elections and the voters message was clear Go slow on taxes spending and innovations The protest against taxes and government spending that began in California last June spread to 13 more states where tax cuts spending limits or both were approved But in several other states proposals that threatened to cripple public services by cutting revenues were defeated And in states such as Michigan and Maryland voters showed considerable discrimination in rejecting a more drastic measure while approving a more modest one Two Measures Lose In Oregon In Oregon where voters have long prided themselves on their sophistication at the polls both drastic and moderate measures were rejected A variety of other types of ballot initiatives were resoundingly rejected The voters seemed to be saying no to almost everything  to gambling busing environmental measures restrictions on homosexuals abortions a righttowork law and equal rights for women But here and there the voters said yes to extending the death penalty to raising the legal dnnicing age to putting restrictions on muclear power plants California Protest Continues The restrictions on taxing and spending that were voted in 13 states seemed sufficient to continue on the national level the protest that was seen in California with the approval of Proposition 13 a constitutional amendment that drastically cut property taxes in that state Propositions that were almost duplicates of Proposition 13 were approved in Nevada and Idaho They limit property taxes to 1 percent of market value The proposal in Nevada must be approved again in 1980 to become law Restrictions on taxing or spending also were approved in Alabama Arizona Hawaii Illinois Massachusetts Missouri North Dakota South Dakota Texas Michigan and in one large county in Maryland More Initiatives Expected Organized efforts to put tax and spending limits on the ballots in future elections are under way in a number of states and several legislatures are expected to attempt to enact such limitations next year Following are summaries of the state actions on taxes and spending Alabama  An amendment to lower assessments on most property intended to blunt the effect of a court order calling for reassessments was approved by narrow margin Arizona An amendment to limit state spending to 7 per cent of personal income was approved by a margin of three to one Arkansas  Responding to warnings ithat services would have to be sharply reduced voters by a narrow margin defeated a measure to exempt food and drugs from the 3 percent sales tax Colorado  A plan to replace a present restriction of 7 percent per year on state spending with one linking the limit to the cost of living index was rejected Conservatives had said the plan would permit more spending Hawaii  An amendment to limit spending increases to economic growth was approved by a twotoone margin Idaho  By a margin of 56 percent to 44 voters approved a plan to cut the property tax to I per cent of market value Illinois  In an advisory referendum voters by a margin of four to one said they wanted the Legislature to place mandatory ceiling on spending Maryland  In suburban Washington voters of Montgomery County narrowly rejected a deep slash in propery taxes but in adjoining Prince Georges County a less drastic measure putting a ceiling on the present budget of 140 million was approved by a threetoone margin Massachusetts  A measure to prevent property tax increases for homeowners was approved by a margin of more than two to one Michigan  An amendment to drastically cut property taxes and to institute a voucher system for school financing was rejected But a milder provision to limit spending by the state to a fixed percentage of income was approved by a narrow margin Missouri  Voters gave twotoone approval to a proposal to authorize the Legislature to lower property taxes Nebraska  An amendment to limit annual spending increases by political subdivisions to 5 per cent was defeated by a narrow margin Nevada  An amendment to limit property taxes to 1 per cent of market value was approved by a threetoone margin North Dakota  Voters by a twotoone margin approved a measure to cut individual state income taxes by 37 percent Oregon Voters rejected two proposed amendments One was modeled after Proposition 13 and called for a drastic cut in property taxes The other would have granted tax breaks to homeowners and renters South Dakota  By a narrow margin voters approved a proposal to require twothirds vote of both houses of the Legislature to enact new taxes Under present law taxes can be raised by a simple majority Texas  An amendment to link increases in state spending to the growth of the states economy was approved by 85 per cent of the voters Other tax and spending restrictions also were approved While voters were passing tax and spending limits they were rejecting initiatives on other subjects Over the years there has been considerable resistance to ballot initiatives of various kinds but the wholesale rejections seen in the Tuesday voting apparently reflected a general conservative mood a mood to leave things as they are and not force changes Following are some of the initiatives and the actions taken on them Righttowork law  Missouri voters turned out in force and defeated proposal that would give that industrialized state a law prohibiting the requirement of union membership as a condition of employment The issue was bitterly fought with organized labor pitted against conservative and business groups Gambling  Virginia voters turned down a proposal to legalize parimutuel horse race betting Florida voters rejected by a margin of more than two to one proposal to legalize casino gambling in Miami Beach And New Jersey voters refused to permit betting on jai alai Capital punishment  By a margin of two to one voters in Oregon authorized reinstatement of the death penalty for some crimes In California voters expanded the list of crimes subject to the death penalty Busing  In Washington state 67 percent of the voters approved a measure intended to dismantle a busing program in effect in Seattle Massachusetts voters approved three to one a plan placing prohibitions on busing even though they were advised that vote would not undo the controversial busing plan in Bostons schools Equal rights for women  Voters in Florida turned back by a wide margin constitutional amendment that would ban discrimination on the basis of sex And in Nevada a proposal advising the Legislature to ratify the Federal equal rights amendment failed Homosexual rights  California voters refused to accept a proposal that would have banned the hiring of homosexual teachers in the public schools And in Seattle an effort to repeal a homosexual rights law failed However voters in Dade County Florida rejected a homosexual rights ordinance similar to the one repealed a year ago Litter  Voters in Nebraska and Alaska rejected proposals to require deposits on beverage containers Smoking  California voters rejected by a wide margin a proposal to bar smoking in most enclosed public places The tobacco industry had spent 56 million in a campaign against the measure Nuclear power  Montana voters approved by a wide margin a proposal placing severe restrictions on construction of nuclear power plants In Oregon the American Dental Association spent 400000 in an advertising campaign for a law that would prohibit denturemaking by practitioners who are not dentists But 78 per cent of the voters had the last word approving the proposal
Carey Says He Will Seek Tax Cuts For Businesses and for the Elderly,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/09/archives/carey-says-he-will-seek-tax-cuts-for-businesses-and-for-the-elderly.html,An ebullient Governor Carey said yesterday that he would seek additional tax cuts for corporations and for the elderly and he promised to change my personality and be more accessible to the public and the press in the next four years Outlining his plans for the second term he won Tuesday the Governor stressed the bolstering of New Yorks economy additional changes in the courts and the criminaljustice system and increased cooperation among the states of the Northeast to get more help from Washington  particularly in welfare reform And he made it clear that unlike the current Lieutenant Governor Mary Anne Krupsak his new secondincommand Mario M Cuomo will be a key adviser in the second Carey administration Concern and Compassion Im here before you to express my commitment to new courage a new confidence strength and concern and compassion Mr Carey told reporters who had waited for more than an hour in his New York City office adding and the need for a new clock The reporters peppered Mr Carey with questions about his possible plans to marry Anne Ford Uzielli which he deftly avoided answering The Governor suggested there might be a need for another special session of the Legislature before the end of the year to take up such matters as emergency debtreserve payments for the financially ailing Coop City housing complex financing for a Convention Center for New York City and a change in the maximum interest rate for mortgages in the state He said the change in the maximum mortgage rate  currently fixed at 812 percent  was necessary to prevent the collapse of the construction industry in New York State but he continued his insistence that the change be tied to restrictions on redlining  the practice of denying loans based solely on geographic factors Mr Carey stressed the importance of young people and minorities in his reelection and a commitment to them was woven through his statements He reiterated his support for the Westway  the controversial 12 billion replacement that is planned for Manhattans West Side Highway calling it the largest affirmativeaction program we can put together anywhere in this state and pledging that were going to build it And he said bluntly I want more blacks Hispanics and women participating in this administration The Governor called for a total restructuring of the states lawenforce ment system including an extension of the appointment rather than election of judges all the way through the courts  including State Supreme Court whose judgeships are now coveted parts of the local political system But in trying to attain this goal and the others he outlined yesterday Mr Carey will be dealing with a Legislature that despite changes in leadership will be not much different from the one that stalled some similar initiatives in his first four years of office The Senate remains firmly under the control of his Republican adversaries and it is not clear how cooperative Sena for Warren M Anderson of Binghamton the Senate majority leader will be with the Democrats During the first Carey term Mr Andersons competition for power with Perry B Duryea the Assembly minority leader often found him amenable to Carey proposals that Mr Duryea opposed But that competition is a thing of the past And the Assembly while retaining a strong Democratic majority will no longer be under the firm paternal control of Speaker Stanley Steingut who was defeated for reelection on Tuesday The likely successor is Stanley Fink a Brook lyn Democrat with whom Mr Carey also has friendly relations but the effect of that change in command is unclear Mr Carey said yesterday that he will miss Stanley Steingut and added Id like to see him in or near government in the future But he said there would be no place in his second administration for Lieut Gov Mary Anne Krupsak who split with the Governor the day he announced for reelection and challenged him in a bitter Democratic primary He said that having a former Lieutenant Governor in his cabinet might trouble his commissioners The additional tax cuts that the Governor outlined yesterday which a top aide said would be proposed as part of next years state budget included a reduction in the state tax on corporate income to percent from the current 10 percent Mr Carey said he would also like to deepen the socalled propertytax circuitbreaker for the elderly which gives special tax relief to such people with propertytax burdens disproportionate to their incomes A limited reduction was instituted last year but over the Governors objections it was extended through all age brackets The Governor called also for a broader propertytax circuitbreaker tied to reductions in county expenditures but heprovided no details on how this might work He declined to state the total amount of the tax cuts he was considering but said it would take into account an expected budget surplus at the end of the fiscal year Mr Careys change in personality he said will include a series of forums around the state in the rural areas that were often passed by during his crisisriddled first term and in minority areas where people can come directly to the Governor and Liutenant Governor and key state officials and express their concerns Governor Lifts Democrats to Strongest Position in the State in Decades By FRANK LYNN Hugh Carey the first Democratic Governor to be reelected in New York State in 40 years has managed through his victory to bring his party to its strongest position in decades and to leave the state Republican Party in disarray politicians on both sides agreed yesterday Despite the defeat of City Comptroller Harrison J Goldin for State Comptroller Democrats swept three of the four statewide offices and maintained control of the Assembly as well as a lopsided margin in the state delegation to the House of Representatives The Carey victory also reinforced clear Democratic trend in this state since a Republican Governor Nelson A Rockefeller left the scene The trend finally reflecting the longtime 43 Democratic edge in enrollment in the state began with Mr Careys first victory in 1974 the election of United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1976 President Carters capture of the state in the same year and the thirdplace finish of the Republican mayoral candidate Roy M Goodman last year GOP Without Leadership At the same time the Republican Party is so bereft of leadership even Republican county leaders conceded that is vulnerable to strong influence by the Conservative Party and its latest champion Representative Jack Kemp of Buffalo a Republican who is expected to seek the GOP Senate nomination in 1980 Mr Kemp might even challenge Senator Jacob K Javits If he seeks reelection in what would be a classic confrontation of liberal vs conservative age vs youth The strong tilt of the state toward the Democratic Party after 16 years of the Rockefeller regime and 12 years of domination by Gov Thomas E Dewey was only one of several major developments in Tuesdays election Others included the following 9Although the Democratic administration remained in power there was a drastic change in the cast of characters with Lieut Govelect Mario M Cuomo Attorney Generalelect Robert Abrams and State Comptrollerelect Edward V Regan a Republican all replacing incumbents Only Mr Carey is renewing his Albany lease The three new statewide officials  all relatively young are potential governors senators and competitors The Conservative Party despite Mr Duryeas loss easily fended off a determined challenge by the Liberal Party to capture the third position on the state ballot The Conservatives double the votes that the Liberals received  an astounding 122000 ahead of the Liberals Four years ago the Conservatives ran only 40000 votes ahead but this year the Liberals polled 100000 fewer votes for governor than they had in 1974 a statistic hardly guaranteed to increase the partys influence in Carey inner councils Another conservative party the Right to Life Party claimed to have polled at least 50000 votes statewide to assure the splinter group a place on the ballot in future elections This means that every person seeking elective office will have to confront the abortion issue said Mary Jane Tobin of Merrick LI the partys gubernatorial candidate Official figures to confirm Mrs Tobins claim will not be available until next week Wayid Garth Mr Careys chief strategist said that the election destroyed the myth of the death penalty pointing out that the three Democratic state winners all strongly opposed capital punishment The Garth assessment was supported by a New York TimesCBS News survey of voters it indicated that the Governor had received more than half his votes from those who favored the death penalty The survey also indicated that Mr Carey had run as well among those opposing abortion another volatile issue although Mr Duryea had opposed Medicaidfunded abortions to court the antiabortion vote Mr Garth again demonstrated that he is probably the most successful practitioner of the blending of television commercials and politics at least in this area Mr Careys victory gave Mr Garth a triple crown in the metropolitan area with his strategy playing a key role in the elections of the governors of New York Connecticut and New Jersey He was also Mayor Kochs chief strategist last year Abrams Rtms Strongest Race With the returns in from all but a handful of precincts Mr Abrams proved to be the strongest runner with a 365000vote plurality and 54 percent of the vote Mr Carey and Mr Cuomo had a plurality of 229000 votes and 53 percent of the vote Four years ago Mr Careys plurality was 808000 votes the largest in nearly 50 years Mr Regan the lone Republican statewide survivor ran up a 115000vote plurality by running well ahead of Mr Duryea upstate and even in the Long Island suburbs where Mr Duryea was supposed to be strongest In Nassau County Mr Regan won by some 45000 votes while Mr Duryea took the county by only 16000 votes much to the embarrassment of Nassau GOP Chairman Joseph Margiotta one of Mr Duryeas chief sponsors and strategists Mr Carey put together his victory by rolling up a 500000vote plurality in the city somewhat less than the usual Democratic victory margin because of a low turnout but then running somewhat stronger than Democrats usually do upstate and in the suburbs Mr Abrams followed the same pattern The Governor won the citys five counties and five relatively large upstate counties a considerable falloff from his margin of 23 counties in 1974 He won all but four of the citys 66 Assembly districts Mr Goldin did not run far behind Mr Carey in the city but was then clobbered upstate and in the suburbs by Mr Regan who made the most of his relatively meager financial resources by putting on an antiGolden television campaign The role of television commercials and the televised debates between e gubernatorial candidates was apparent in the TimesCBS News survey of 1496 voters throughout the state as they left the polls on Tuesday They were questioned about their candidate prefernces and various issues The survey indicated that the Governor had picked up steam in the last two weeks with voters who said they had decided on their gubernatorial choice in the last two weeks going for Mr Carey by a 5538 margin The debates also helped the Governor as his handlers had anticipated when they agreed to 13 televised confrontations Fully a quarter of the voters surveyed said they had been influenced by tne debates and again Mr Carey won slightly more than a majority of these voters Ethnic religious and racial factors were evident in the voting as they usually are in New York politics Mr Carey won big among Jews blacks and Hispanic people He led among Roman Catholics by a 54 margin and trailed among Protestants by the same proportion Not surprisingly he ran strongly among liberals winning twothirds of their votes and also among moderates with slightly better than half of their votes Careys Fiscal Policies Backed Mr Careys appeal to moderate voters reflected his costconscious budgetary policies  a striking contrast to the big spending of the Rockefeller era He had in effect preempted a traditional Republican position of fiscal conservatism and dampened his own partys image as liberal big spenders The Governors conservative fiscal record made him a difficult target for Mr Duryeas argument that Mr Carey was responsible for flight of business and jobs fromn the state and for the states continuing status as the highesttaxed state in the union Mr Duryea has been the closest thing to a leader of the Republican Party since Mr Rockefeller and the Rockefeller handpicked interim successor Malcolm Wilson left the political scene four years ago Mr Rockefellers many allies have since joined him in political exile and now with Mr Duryea about to depart the GOP leadership vacuum is evident The Republican state chairman Dr Bernard Kilbourne is considered a Duryea agent while Mr Margiotta probably the most powerful GOP county leader in the state is unpopular among his fellow leaders and is taking some of the blame for the Duryea defeat Senator Javits and Mr Regan are now the only statewide Republican officeholders and in the past both have rfemained aloof from the party Senate Majority Leader Warren Anderson controls the largest patronage reservoir still available to the GOP but he too has generally steered clear of party politics He paid for that aloofness earlier this year when his campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination failed to win the backing of party leaders The Republican Party clearly has an empty leadership to fill party leaders

Social Reforms and Arms Accord Likely to Face Snag on Capitol Hill,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/09/archives/social-reforms-and-arms-accord-likely-to-face-snag-on-capitol-hill.html,President Carter seems likely to face greater difficulty in the next Congress in winning support for social reforms and an arms agreement With the Russians even though the numerical gains won by Republicans in Tuesdays elections were only modest A poll of all members of the new House of Representatives conducted by The New York Times and CBS News indicates that the House will be slightly more con The New York TimesNov9 1978 servative than the last one on 10 test issues ranging from mandating a balanced budget and starting a national healthinsurance program to public financing of Congressional elections Youre going to have a skittish Congress a more fiscally stingy Congress commented one experienced Democratic strategist on Capitol Hill All my senses tell me theres a slide to the right In the Senate theres a shift of only three seats but ideologically the shift is even more than that The President is going to be pressed very hard on welfare reform and on health from within his own party and all those are bigticket items this Democrat commented but hes gotten a very clear message from the electorate that they want to slow down to go easy on big spending Defeat of Liberals Weighed On the specific issue of an arms accord with Moscow Jody Powell the White House press secretary conceded that the defeat of five Senate Democratic liberals would probably confront the White House with an even stiffer fight for Senate approval than previously All five  Dick Clark of Iowa Floyd K Haskell of Colorado William D Hathaway of Maine Thomas J McIntyre of New Hampshire and Wendell R Anderson of Minnesota had supported the Administration on the Panama Canal treaties and had been counted upon by the White House for support on an arms agreement The loss of Mr McIntyre was partial larly important because he had become an hrticulate seniorranking defender of arms control on the Senate Armed Services COmmittee If President Carter was able to end the last Congress with a strong showing the election returns indicated that he was unable to capitalize on this momentum and to generate political IOUs and clout with the next Congress by helping a significant number of fellow Democrats into office His campaign influence appeared to be just about neutral With one Congressional race still to be decided roughly half of the Democratic Congressional candidates won in the 22 states where Mr Carter campaigned for them More GOP Committee Seats Moreover Senator Howard H Baker Jr the minority leader who won his campaign for reelection handily said that his partys net gain of three seats would bring its strength to 41 earning the Republicans a larger share of seats on Senate committees The magic of the moment Mr Baker said in a telephone interview is that we got 41 That makes a huge difference because thats the break point It gives us new seats on committees that we ought to be entitled to and we intend to claim On Appropriations we ought to move from 1510 to 1411 for the Demo crats We ought to pick up a seat on Foreign Relations Veterans Affairs Rules Small Business and others The Tennessee Republican who as moderate has voted with the Carter Administration on such controversial foreign policy issues as the Panama Canal treaties said the shift in the party and committee alignments did not automatically mean that the Presidents chances for Senate approval of an arms agreement would be weakened But he asserted that Republicans would be In a stronger position to press for approval of new defense programs Moreoever the defeat of some Senate liberals was expected to have a psychological impact on colleagues who face reelection campaigns in 1980 Some analysts said they would expect to see such an influence on Sen John Culver of Iowa after the defeat of Mr Clark and on Sen Gary Hart of Colorado after Mr Haskell lost In addition though the arithmetic shifts of party strength in both houses were modest the midterm elections will bring 20 new members to the Senate and 77 to the House Democratic spokesmen contended that they had held the party realignment to much less than the average shift of 34 seats during midterm elections But actually the Presidential party has normally suffered very modest losses in the midterm elections held in the second year of a Presidential termonly five House seats in 1962 12 in 1970 and 18 in 1954 In some cases the Presi dents party has made gains in the Senate in midterm voting Labor Law Reform Chances Dim It was impossible to give a clearcut picture of attitudes in the new Senate on the basis of the New York TimesCBS News poll but in the House sentiment in favor of labor law reform shrank from 56 to 51 percent suggesting it faces even slimmer chances in the next Congress than the last one Earlier this year it passed the House but was bottled up in the Senate without a vote The poll also indicated that in the new Congress sentiment is slightly stronger  up to 60 percent from 57 in favor of constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget an issue that could confront Congress in view of initiatives for such an amendment in some state legislatures The poll also indicated that in the next Congress favorable sentiment would slip slightly on the issues of national health insurance Federal financing of Congressional elections and using Federal funds to pay for abortions for poor women Poll a Rough Indicator Although the poll results reflect Congressional attitudes accurately they are only a rough indicator of likely action on legislation because in many cases the actual proposals and the parliamentary situation affects the outcome of votes On Social Security taxes for example 68 percent of the new members of the House said that they favored rolling back to the lower level of taxes provided by the formula in effect before the increases enacted by the last Congress and due to hit taxpayers next Jan 1 But even this size majority seemed unlikely to overcome pressures from lobbyists for older voters and the institutional opposition that can be mounted by House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr who strongly favors the new taxes
Poll Indicates Congress Candidates Were More Extreme Than Voters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/09/archives/poll-indicates-congress-candidates-were-more-extreme-than-voters-a.html,On each major issue in the campaign either the Democratic or Republican candidates for Congress or both groups appeared to have staked out positions more extreme than the rankandfile voters of their parties in Tuesday elections according to two New York TimesCBS News mils The polls suggest that candidates were running in vain on issues in a year in which traditional political loyalties turned out to be paramount If the Republicans had hoped to win new friends among Democratic voters with their broad taxcutting proposals then they failed If they had hoped to capitalize on economic conditions then that too failed Indeed voters appeared to be far more sophisticated about complex economic issues than many of the candidates may have suspected A Normal Year It was on the whole an Election Day poll of voters found an extraordinarily normal year Democrats voted like Democrats Republicans like Republicans The rich and the poor the old and the young union members and nonunion Northerners and Southerners all voted for Democratic or Republican candidates for Congress in much the same proportions as they have always This poll in which about 9000 voters were interviewed on their political views as they emerged from polling places in 120 precincts across the country also contained hints that President Carter may well face a tough fight for reelection in 1980 Perhaps the most striking result of the poll was the failure of the Republicans promises to cut income taxes  embodied in the KempRoth bill to reduce taxes by 30 percent  to take hold as an issue Those who said they favored such a cut were no more likely to vote Republican than those who opposed it In all voters opposed the measure by a 52to40 margin Only 45 percent of voters who called themselves Republican favored the tax cut 97 for Tax Cut By contrast 97 percent of the Republican candidates for Congress told the Times and CBS News in a separate poll taken in the weeks before the election that they endorsed the tax cut Only 24 percent of the Democratic candidates liked it Only the voters it seemed did not consider this much of a divisive issue In this and several other widely discussed issues the candidates of both parties seemed to be out of step with the voters Only one in six Republican candidates said they approved of the Federal Governments paying for abortions of poor women 37 percent of the Republican voters approved and 44 percent of the Democrats Only one in 10 Republican candidates endorsed the notion of national health insurance while one in three Republican voters wanted it However one issue that might ultimately serve the Republicans is that of constitutional amendment requiring balanced Federal budget On this ques tion the Republican candidates appeared to be closer in their views to all voters than the Democratic candidates In all 82 percent of Democratic voters and 86 per cent of Republican ones favored such an amendment while less than half of the Democratic candidates endorsed it The Republican candidates favored it by an 86toI4 margin No Stress on Economics Economic conditions did not seem to play a great role in voting choices this a  year Voters who said their families financial situation was getting worse were only slightly more likely to vote for the Republican opposition than those who said their financial condition was as good or better than in the past In general the voters displayed moderation on economic and tax issues Despite the widespread talk of a tax revolt they opposed by better than two to one rolling back the recent Social Security tax increase Although it is perhaps premature to talk about the 1980 election the poll provided something of a test of President Carters prospects among those who really count  those who actually vote They were divided almost evenly 48 to 45 percent when asked if they approved of the way Jimmy Carter is handling his job as President Disapproval was highest in the South and the West No Enthusiasm for Running Perhaps ominously for Mr Carter there was no overwhelming enthusiasm for his running again In very preliminary trial heats he was running neck and neck with Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts each the choice of 22 percent of the voters Among Democrats the two men were also about even each getting the nod from about one in three party members Black voters once solidly for Mr Carter appeared to have been disappointed by him they now prefer Senator Kennedy by 39 to 29 Picvk up third addpoll The poll suggested that another FordReagan race may be shaping up among the Republicans Ronald Reagan the former California Governor was the choice of Republican voters by 37 to 22 However the survey questionnaire did not list other possible candidates most of whom have yet to declare Partisan Leanings The largely partisan nature of this years races was demonstrated by the way various social racial and economic groups voted Whites voted Democratic by 54 to 46 and blacks 83 to 17 just about  the same margins as in 1976 Union members voted Democratic by two to one while nonunion people were about evenly split again just as two years ago And again as in almost every year in recent history the vote split cleanly along income lines with lowerincome people much more likely to vote for Democratic Congressional candidates than higherincome voters In short it was a rather traditional election If it portended much for the future just what was not very clear The New York TimesNov 9 1978
New England Voters Show Favor For Conservatives and New Faces,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/09/archives/new-england-voters-show-favor-for-conservatives-and-new-faces.html,BOSTON Nov 8  In a crazyquilt of upsets and contradictions that rearranged the New England political landscape yesterday voters abandoned party and ideology for a mix of local concerns and personalities With a few major exceptions the elections in the Northeast showed increased strength for conservatives of both parties as voters turned down liberals and even those conservatives viewed as insufficiently militant But the contradictions from race to race were so strong that little could be concluded with certainty other than that voters were tired of old faces and were willing to take a chance on relatively unknown newcomers Veterans Defeated Some veteran political figures were defeated including United States Senators Edward W Brooke Republican of Massachusetts William D Hathaway Democrat of Maine and Thomas J McIntyre Democrat of New Hampshire New Hampshires Republican Governor Meldrim P Thomson a spokesman for the nations far right also lost One of the biggest upsets yesterday came in Massachusetts where an overwhelmingly Democratic electorate long considered one of the most liberal in the country chose a conservative to be governor Edward J King who had won his partys nomination with no previous political experience will be the states most conservative governor in recent memory In the primary two months ago Massachusetts Democrats denied a second term to Gov Michael S Dukakis a liberalturnedconversative who was judged not conservative enough By a narrow margin the voters spurned State Representative Francis W Hatch Jr who is an almost as conservative as Mr King but was billed as the liberal alternative Losses for Republicans Ironically the states Republican Party dominated by conservatives was almost wiped out in the election ending up with no representatives in the United States Senate for the first time in 41 years no state officials and with only two out of 12 Congressional seats leaving leaders of the party to predict its imminent demise I had only six seats in the state Senate left and three were unopposed and thought three were safe complained Gordon Nelson the chairman of the State Republican Party Yet I even lost one of those Every election night the Republican Party is in worse shape than the one before We better do something or well be gone Very simply this is now a conservative state and the Democrats in Massachusetts have stolen our thunder The election of Mr King the former director of the Massachusetts Port Authority has sent shivers of apprehension throughout the states liberal community which waged a campaign that attempted to depict him as a cross between Robert Moses and Vince Lombardi Budget Disputes Expected Major battles are expected in the coming months over the state budget because of Mr Kings pledge to cut welfare spending by 20 percent without reducing payments or services because of his plan to reduce property taxes by 500 million while granting state workers pay raises and also over his stands on abortion capital punishment nuclear power highway construction and exploitation of offshore oil resources  all of which are diametrically opposed to that of previous administrations Yet the same electorate yesterday turned out twoterm Senator Brooke a liberal Republican who had long had a major symbolic role as the nations only black Senator but whose image was tarnished by recent revelations about his personal and family finances In his place many of the same voters who elected Mr King governor voted for Representative Paul E Tsongas a Democrat even more liberal than Senator Brooke In New Hampshire Governor Thomson had sought an unprecedented fourth twoyear term campaigning once again on the immensely popular pledge to veto a state income tax or sales tax Yet Hugh  Gallen an almost unknown auto dealer from north of the White Mountains whoran as the Democratic candidate won by taking the same pledge himself At issue was the Seabrook nuclear power plant which for six years has been Mr Thomsons nemesis  as he has been its When the cost of constructing the 23 billion plant began to soar Mr Thomson supported a plan to charge the extra cost to the consumers and Mr Galen was  able to paint him

control of both houses in the state legislature Easy Win for Cohen Representative William S Cohen a 37yearold Republican who gained a national reputation by voting for the impeachment of President Richard M Nixon in 1974 won by a wide margin over Senator Hathaway an outspoken liberal who did not attempt to change his position The central but unspoken issue in Maine this year was not taxes but rather the claim by two Indian tribes to roughly twothirds of the state Mr Cohen had taken a hard line against any settlement of the claim while Senator Hathaway had a major role in mediating a proposed settlement recently announced The only major post won by the Dernocrats was the governorship which went to Joseph E Brennan a liberal The New York TimesNov 9 1973
Anglicans Vote Not to Ordain Women Priests,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/09/archives/anglicans-vote-not-to-ordain-women-priests-setback-to-ecumenism.html,LONDON Nov 8  The Church of England dealt a major setback to the ordination of women today deciding by a wide margin at its General Synod not to carry through a decision in principle it made three years ago to allow them to become priests and members of the church hierarchy Itwas generally agreed by both sides in the debate that the outcome meant that women would probably be excluded for at least 10 years Although there are more than 150 women Anglican priests in the United States Canada Australia New Zealand and Hong Kong the grassroots clergy but not the bishops and laity  in Britain voted soundly against the motion to prepare and bring forward legislation to remove the barriers to ordination here Setback to Ecumenism Foreseen Opponents leaned heavily on the argument that to ordain women would not only divide the Church of England but would also set back the cause of Christian unity particularly with the Roman Catholic and Eaitem Orthodox Churches which are adamantly opposed to women in the priesthood The vote came after an allday debate before an attentive standingroom gallery in the circular Church House assembly hall behind Westminster Abbey When the results were announced  272 against the motion and 246 in favor there was an outburst from Una Kroll deacon wearing a Tshirt saying Ordain Women Now Dr Kroll leader of the Christian Parity Group shouted  We asked you for bread and you gave us stone Long live God  The leader of the opponents of womens ordination Bishop Graham Leonard of Truro drew loud applause when he won1 dered why the Church of England appeared to accept the criteria of secular thought so readily and failed to erripha1 size the eternal truths which give true stability and challenge the assumptions of the world He added I want women to be women The debate was the climax of an intensive lobbying campaign Even the wives of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York signed petions supporting the proposal as a matter of urgency serious Distortion in Doctrine The Bishop of Birmingham the Right Rev Hugh Montefiore who made the main address in favor of the resolution said To insist on an allmale priesthood in a society which has abandoned allmale leadership in other areas of life is to distort the meaning of Christian priesthood It leads to serious distortion in doctrine The vote was actually not as close as the total indicated A majority vote of each of the three houses  bishops clergy and tatety  was required The clergy voted in the negative by 149 to 94 the bishops in the affirmative by 32 to 17 and the laiety similarly by a narrower than erected 120 to 106 there were three abstentions A Sheffield teacher Jean Mahland warned the delegates Dont be misguided into thinking that a negative vote today will preserve peace and drive the problem away forever It will not Dr Kroll interviewed afterward said The spirit will find a different Way ahead and that will come in the near tuture The question cannot be formally taken up again in the lifetime of this synod which runs until 1980 and because a lack of a clear consensus and the crush of other business the next synod might not consider it again until 1983 Then it would probably take another five years before the last obstacles were removed It is estimated that 100 women church are largely qualified to become priests American Experience Is Noted In arguing for ordination Bishop Montefiore referred to the relatively small group that broke away from the Episcopal Church in the United States after it decided to admit women Look at America but do not pass judgment because their culture is different from our own he said They actually enjoy confrontation and they tend to politicize where we play things down Against the argument that ordaining women would destroy the chances of reunion with Rome Bishop Montefiore said that he just did not believe it despite the late Pope Pauls description of ordination as a grave obstacle Later the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Donald Coggan said Within the Roman Catholic Church there are a great many people who believe that the ordination of women is right and I believe they would welcome a lead Amendments to put off the question until after dialogues with other churches were defeated Yesterday the synod defeated In a close vote a proposal to include in the official prayer book a prayer to be said after abortions Part of it said Into your hands we commit in trust the developing life that we have cut short This was defeated by both bishops and clergy on the ground that it might make the church seem to condone abortion The synod also put off for two years a rule change that would permit the remarriage of divorcees in church
DEMOCRATS DOMINATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/09/archives/democrats-dominate-republican-victories-point-to-rebuilding-of.html,Republicans built for the future by winning major governorships electing about 300 new legislators in key states and making small gains in Congress while most American voters rejected the partys arguments of the moment and maintained their identification with the Democratic Party at its recent high level No immediate challenge to the Democrats firm political domination of the country was raised despite net Republican gains of 3 Senators 12 Representatives 6 Governors and enough lawmakers to raise their control of state legislatures from 9 to 12 Bill Brock the Republican national chairman said yesterday that his partys gains in state Legislatures would put it in a better position to deal effectively with redistricting problems after the 1980 census and help it to build for the future A poll of House candidates conducted by The New York Times and CBS News showed that the new House will be marginally more conservative on a broad spectrum of issues ranging from Federal payments for Medicaid abortions to easing of restrictiops on tradeunion organizing to requiring a balanced budget Possible Effect for Arms Treaty And the particular mix of Senate victories and defeats appeared to make even more difficult the expected fight for approval of a new treaty with the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms A similarly conservative or at least cautious note was sounded by the voters when they had a chance to act for themselves They voted in referendums for cuts in taxes and spending but often for the more moderate versions of the various plans They also spurned calls for innovations whether the plan was to allow horserace Jaialai or casino gambling to ban public smoking or place restrictions on homosexuals Cue for 80 Campaign to Start While some prominent Democratic liberals and Republican moderates were defeated others were elected and once again the ideological signals from an election in which voter turnout dropped were fuzzy A New York TimesCBS national poll of voters as they left their polling places showed that they were readier for national health insurance than Congressional candidates and at the same time more eager than wouldbe Representatives for a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget But the results including the comfortable reelections of such possible candidates as Gov James R Thompson of Illinois and Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee Republicans and Gov Edmund G Brown Jr of California Democrat embarrassed none of the Presidential hopefuls The only immediate impact was that the election of Republican governors may make the partys nominating process more stable in some important states and perhaps more moderate In an election marked by heavy spending and harsh attacks through television commercials incomplete returns in state after state showed lower percentage turnouts of votingage Americans than in 1974 when only 39 percent voted In many states even in some with tightly contested statewide races the absolute totals dropped below the 1974 numbers It will be several days before final even unofficial totals are ready With all but one House race decided and that one leaning Republican 276 Democrats and 158 Republicans had been elected But only 19 incumbents 16 of them Democrats had been beaten After 22 Republican pickups and 10 Democratic victories in seats formerly held by Republicans were balanced that left a net Republican gain of 12likely compared to the 288 to 147 standing of the 95th Congress No Major Figures Lost The defeated incumbents included no major figures in the House Those who lost were particularly among the House sophomores the class elected in 1974 in the Watergate landslide Even so only seven of them were defeated Tuesday and 75 had been elected in 1974 The survey of candidates attitudes did not show that the voters had acted effectively for major policy changes as the differences between the new and old Houses varied by only one to five percentage points But in a Congress in which Democratic programs often prevail by only a handful of votes against a determined Republican minority even that kind of shift is expected to have some impact Democratic Maioritv Trimmed In Senate races the outgoing Democratic majority of 82 including Harry F Byrd Jr Independent of Virginia was trimmed to 59 with the Republicans picking up eight Democratic seats while losing five to the majority party The only completely unexpected result came in New Hampshire involving Senator Thomas J McIntyre a Democrat who had been believed to have overcome the problems he faced early this year He was defeated by a most conservative Republican Gordon Humphrey an Allegheny Airlines pilot The other incumbents who lost had been known to be in trouble late in the campaign as were some Senators who won reelection like Charles H Percy Jr the Illinois Republican But there had been widely varying views of how they would make out on Election Day The Brooke Griffin Losses These incumbents included such Republicans as Edward W Brooke of Massachusetts dogged by accusations concerning the financial aspects of his divorce and Robert P Griffin of Michigan who began to skip votes after he announced his retirement last year He took back that decision before the voters decided to give it to him after all But the losers also included three Democratic liberals whose difficulties had been known all through the yearFloyd K Haskell of Colorado William D Hathaway of Maine and Dick Clark of Iowa The defeats of the first two men were expected Mr Clarks was not One unusual factor in the campaign perhaps tied to the low interest rteflected by the light turnout was the frequency of sharp swings in polls of public opinion In Colorado while late polls showed Mr Haskell trailing narrowly and Gov Richard D Lamm slightly ahead the results showed the Senator a landslide loser and the Governor a landslide winner The difficulty of assigning ideological implications to the voting was intensified by the Democrats choices of nominees who varied all over the political range In two major Democratic states Massachusetts and Minnesota the voters declined to pick and choose In Minnesota they rejected both the conservative Democratic Senate nominee Bob Short and the more liberal one incumbent Wendell Anderson For good measure they ousted Gov Rudy Perpich who succeeded to the office when Mr Anderson resigned so that Mr Perpich could appoint him to the Senate In Massachusetts they took a liberal Democrat Representative Paul E Tson gas to replace the liberal Mr Brooke But they also chose a conservative Demo crat for Governor in Edward J King turning down Francis W Hatch a model ate Republican An Echo of the Old Days The voting patterns in the gubernatorial race were a throwback to the old days of Massachusetts politics before liberals took control with lowerincome areas voting Democratic and the richer suburbs going for the Yankee Republican The TimesCBSsurvey showed that the voters turned heavily against the Republican KempRoth proposal for a 30 percent Federal income tax reduction over three years  and that was a plan supported heavily by losing Republican candidates Many were in districts in which they had little hope of winning anyway so the controversial plan may merely have been a failing gamble not a cause for defeat If there was one general element that helped Republicans running for all offices it was a continuation though not at intense levels of the antiincumbent voting pattern shown eatlier in the year in many state primaries Seven of the 22 Senators who were on the ballot seeking reelection were defeated as were 5 of the 21 Governors An Opportunity for GOP That factor seemed to have less impact on lessvisible House races where only percent of the Incumbents lost but with the overall preponderance of Democrats in office any antiincumbent mood at all had to favor the Republicans With the preponderance of Democrats already in office those numbers had to favor the Republicans And with Democrats more exposed in Senate races in 1980 than the minority party Tuesdays results presented an opportunity although a difficult one for the Republicans to regain control of the Senate for the first time since the Eisenhower Administration Mr Brock foresaw another possibility of Republican control in the next decade He said that the legislative gains which exceeded by a considerable margin the expectations heard around party head quarters last week would be doubled in 1p80 The gains won Tuesday moved the Republican total from 32 to 36 percent of the total of 7497 state lawmakers across the nation The more impdrtant impact is in the number of states where the Republicans have one or both houses and are in position to protect and strengthen itself in redistricting legislative and Congressional seats Mr Brock said that the Republicans did not want to use their power to gerrymander Democrats out of seats but to protect themselves when the Democrats try to mess with us One unusual factor in the campaign perhaps tied to the low interest reflected by the light turnout was the frequency of sharp swings in polls of public opinion In Colorado while late polls showed Mr Haskell trailing narrowly and Gov Richard D Lamm slightly ahead the results showed the Senator a landslide loser and the Governor a landslide winner In Minnesota they rejected both the conservative Democratic Senate nominee Bob Short and the more liberal one incumbent Wendell Anderson tor good measure they ousted Gov Rudy Perpich who succeeded to the office when Mr Anderson resigned so that Mr Perpich could appoint him to the Senate In Massachusetts they took a liberal Democrat Representative Paul E Tsongas to replace the liberal Mr Brooke But they also chose a conservative Democrat for Governor in Edward J King turning down Francis W Hatch a moderate Republican But Mr Brock and his fellow Republicans still face a formidable chore for the voter survey showed that 48 percent of the 8933 persons interviewed as they left the voting places said that they were Democrats to 24 percent who said they were Republicans and 29 percent who called themselves independents Because of the massive size of the sample the margin of error is only about percent In the 1976 election when greater interest brought more of the less politically involved Americans to the polls the independent total was 34 percent and the Democrats only 41 percent in a comparable survey But the Republican numbers were virtually unchanged during the two years Mr Brock has served as party chairman In 1976 25 percent of thoe who voted said they were Republicans On Tuesday there were only 24 percent was 1 If there was one hopeful sign for the Republicans in the national voting it was the evidence that the election of a Southern Democrat as President had not made any lasting inroads in party allegiances In 1976 65 percent of those who voted in the South said they were Democrats On Tuesday that figure dropped off to 58 percent There was also a drop in Democratic allegiances from 55 to 51 percent in the West but the Republicans had carried that region heavily anyway in 1978 The New York TimesNov9

RIGHT TO LIFE PARTY SHOWS ITS STRENGTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/10/archives/right-to-life-party-shows-its-strength-qualifies-for-future-ballot.html,The newly formed Right to Life Party has polled enough votes in the gubernatorial election to qualify automatically for future ballots and has probably outpolled the Liberal Party to make antiabortionists a new force in state politics A spot check of the unofficial vote in seven of the states 62 counties gave Mary Jane Tobin the Right to Life candidate for governor more than 54000 votes while a party spokesman provided the returns from nearly 50 other counties showing a vote of more than 100000 for the 47yearold Merrick LI nurse and mother of three With the returns from New York City still unavailable it seemed likely that the new party would outpoll Governor Careys 122938 votes on the Liberal line Ballot Position Guaranteed The practical effect of the surprisingly strong showing would be to guarantee the Right to Lifers a position on the ballot for all offices for the next four years if they have polled at least 50000 votes and to give them the fourth position on the ballot ahead of the Liberals if they have outpolled the Liberals Party position is determined by the results of the gubernatorial election every four years Politically it would give the antiabortionists the highest visibility they have had in the state and also potential lever age with candidates for the Legislature and local offices particularly in mar ginal districts where Right to Life support could provide a margin of victory It would also be probably the most stunning blow the 30yearold Liberal Party has ever suffered and is particularly ironic because the Liberals had hoped that the Right to Lifers would siphon votes from the Conservative Party and allow the Liberals to reclaim third place on the ballot which they lost to the Conservatives four years ago The splinter group showing would be still further evidence of the decline of liberalism in the state as well as confirmation of the more recent trend toward oneissue groups and parties such as Proposition 13 proponents in California and their counterparts in other states Mrs Tobin whose husband is a corporate vice presidentlost no time in declaring the new influence of her party It now evident that just as the majorparty candidates have courted the Liberal Party endorsement they must now turn their attention to the Right to Life Party she said Mrs Tobins running mate for lieutenant governor was another Merrick woman Ellen McCormack who made vain bid for the Democratic nomination for President in 1976 and was able at least to take her case to the national convention floor At the time the antiabortionists were able to field slates of delegates in the Democratic Presidential primary in this state in only four of the states 39 Congressional districts They obviously did some homework since Abortion Not a Major Issue The new party did not field any other candidates Ironically the abortion issue was not major one in the election since both the Governor and his Republican opponent the Assembly minority leader Perry B Duryea had supported the liberalization of the states abortion laws The only difference between them on the issue was Mr Duryeas switch last spring from favoring to opposing Medicaidfinanced abortions The sudden switch was generally viewed as a result of pressure from the Conservative Party which hoped to attract antiabortionists with that position However the abortion opponents were not satisfied and collected enough signatures statewide to qualify for an independent line on the ballot for Mrs Tobin and Mrs McCormack The strength of the new party in contrast with the Liberals was evident in the seven counties independently checked Albany BroomeErie Monroe Obondaga Westchester and Nassau  all heavily populated In each Mrs Tobin outpolled the Governors Liberal vote sometimes by as much as 2 to 1 The pattern was similar in the county figures provided by the Right to Life workers The Liberals polled only 97000 votes for the Governor outside New York City while the Right to Life tally outside the city was at least 100000

New Initiative Law Rekindles Bid to Oust Suffolk Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/12/archives/long-island-weekly-new-initiative-law-rekindles-bid-to-oust-suffolk.html,IN the wake of passage of Suffolk Countys new initiative and referendum law last Tuesday opponents fear that it will become a tool of specialinterest groups to force a weakwilled County Legislature to do their bidding Voters approved the measure by almost a 4toI ratio and a spokesman for the Suffolk County Civil Service Employees Association said the union expected the new law to be applied to such issues as abolition of the County Legislatire rather than to taxcut measures liirlivd Republican County Legislator Denis R Hurley said in an interview that he intended immediately to form a citizens committee to begin gathering the signatures necessary to force an initiative on just that question Mr Hurley sponsored a bill to abolish the Legislature that was defeated earlier this year We are concerned that the way this new law is structured its very simple for people who are organized to take advantage a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association said And who is organized The political parties and interest groups like the antiabortion forces and business organizations who want to wreck the county government for their own self interest The CSEA unsuccessfully sued to keep the initiative and referendum proposal off last Tuesdays ballot move widely interpreted as protective of membersjobs The new law provides that citizens can force the County Legislature to consider a proposal by obtaining the signatures of 1000 registered voters with at least 50 signatures coming from each of the countys 10 towns Then if the Legislature fails to act within 60 days the sponsors of the initiative will have 150 days to gather signatures equal to 5 percent of the number of voters in each town who turned out for the last gubernatorial election If that is accomplished 90 days before the next general election the measure will go on the ballot as a referendum The CSEA spokesman said that what concerned the union was the first part of that process which can force consideration of the proposal by the Legislature on the basis of only 1000 signatures The history of this Legislature shows that every time a pressure group has come in and shouted at the members theyve fallen over dead he said He mentioned such instances as the cutoff of county funds for Medicaid abortions which the Legislature passed early this year despite advice by the County Attorney that the measure was illegal As predicted it was overturned in the courts Another example the spokesman gave was the initiative and referendum proposal itself which the Legislature approved late one evening past midnight under severe pressure from large group of elderly citizens interested in taxcut proposals I can see how people would be concerned [about the susceptibility to pressure of the County Legislature] because we have had a few instances where weve been rushed into things Mr Hurley said But I dont think it would happen under the new law because you wouldnt have pressure groups on only one side People like the CSEA would come to us too Besides even if you didnt have this law 1000 people could still come down to us and scream Mr Hurley campaigned for office on a pledge to introduce a bill to abolish the Legislature and replace it with Board of Supervisors whose votes would be weighted Mr Hurley says now that he plans to use the new refer endum law to force a reconsideration of the proposal by the Legislature and if that fails to try to get the measure before the voters in November 1979 The taxcutting effect of abolition of the County Legislature would be minimal In fact County Executive John VN Klein said in an interview that people should not regard the new initiative and referendum law primarily as taxcut measure Only the County Charter can be touched under the new law meaning that the budgets of school districts and other government entities cannot be affected According to Mr Klein county taxes make up only about 8 percent of the total property tax burden and most of that amount is mandated under various state laws for such services as Medicaid If we eliminated every optional service it would affect only 2 percent of the tax bill Mr Klein said However leaders of tax groups say they intend to use the measure to the maximum extent possible in the county They also regard the overwhelming support for the referendum law as foot in the door to obtain passage of state law allowing initiative and referendum With such a state law a cap on or cut in school taxes would be possible Lou Modica president of the Townwide Taxpayers Association said the County Legislature would have six months to find ways to cut the county budget If nothing substantial is forthcoming he promised well do it in our own Proposition 13 on the 1979 ballot Other possible county taxcut measures mentioned last week were changes in the method of financing the county detective squads and in assessing vacant property
Final Congressional Actions Affecting the New York Area,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/12/archives/final-congressional-actions-affecting-the-new-york-area-aid-bills.html,WASHINGTON  In its last days before the midOctober adjournment the 95th Congress approved legislation that will provide billions of dollars for New York New Jersey and Connecticut primarily for highway and masstransit projects and for training and jobs for the hardcore unemployed In the sessions closing hours however Congress failed to pass some aid legislation that had been expected by the three states and especially by New York City Bills with a major effect on the three states will step up Federal aid for educational and housing programs for lowincome groups aid urban parks development in older cities and make cigarettesmuggling into the Northeast from lowtax states a Federal crime with heavy penalties And the finishing touches were put on the complicated package of legislation that allows the Federal government to guarantee loans of 165 billion to NewYork City Aid Bills Die at the Close New York New Jersey and Connecticut looked on in dismay as Congress allowed the twoyearold countercyclical revenue program for areas of high unemployment to expire and also failed to renew the multibilliondollar publicworks programs New York State could have hoped for 100 million if the countercyclical antiunemployment program had been renewed about 70 million in New York City Under two rounds of publicworks spending totaling 6 billion across the country since 1976 New York State had received 720 million Earlier this year the Administration was pressing for another round of 3 billion that would have meant approximately 350 million in publicworks spending in 1979 in New York State and about 150 million in New Jersey But in the final rush of legislation the bills were allowed to die without a vote It was the record 51 billion combined highways and masstransit legislation for the next four years that will have the greatest financial effect on the three states New York State expects to receive record 47 billion dollars over the four years including 21 billion for highways ranging from Interstate System roads to rural roads and 26 billion for transit construction rolling stock modernization and operating subsidies Enough highway money is authorized to assure completion of the nationwide Interstafe System  including such controversial projects as the Westway in Manhattan  and transit money is provided for New York Citys new 63d Street line to Queens and for modernization of the transit and commuterrail system under the 800 million accelerated transit program announced by Governor Carey and Mayor Koch For New Jersey money istavailable in a giant transportation package to complete the combined plan of the state and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for 600 million of commuterrail and bus improvements New Jersey also benefited from the new National Parks Act which contains a provision to expand and protect the sprawling Pinelands of south and central Jersey as a national reserve in which residential and commercial development will be controlled Revised CETA Program Senator Jacob K Javits estimates that the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act CETA will provide New York State communities with slightly more than 1 billion in 1979 The new legislation resulted in a drastic restructuring of the CETA program designed to eliminate abuses while shifting emphasis to the hardcore unemployed In the past New York City used money from the program to rehire laidoff city employees According to Senator Javits New York State spite a 1 billion cut in the national program will have an increase in job slots from 155000 to 160000 in 1979 New York Citys estimated total would rise from 70000 to 77000 slots But officials in the three states said they were concerned about how the untested changes would work out in practice especially since this was now the only major Federal jobs program Record Transportation Bill Two of the principal architects of the record 51 billion surface transportation bill were Senator Harrison A Williams Democrat of New Jersey and Representative James J Howard also a New Jersey Democrat It was the first time that highway and transit legislation had been lumped into one package Mr Howards bill when it came out of committee originally called for a fouryear 66 billion program The Carter Administration called it a budget buster and said the measure would spend money from the Highway Trust Fund much faster than it was being generated Even after the Senate and Administration succeeded in making large cuts the final bill approved by both houses was 6 billion larger than the Administrations proposal Here are some of the highlights of programs affecting New York New Jersey and Connecticut Highways Over the next four years New York State is expected to receive 21 billion in Federal highway aid starting with 4792 million in 1979 For 1979 the principal anticipated allocations are 1615 million for Interstate System highway construction 7 million for repair and resurfacing of older Interstate highways 79 million for primary roads other than Interstates and 665 million for replacing and rebuilding highway bridges New Jerseys estimated allotment for highway programs in 1079 will increase

Referendum Law Opponents Say It May Be Special Interests’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/12/archives/brooklyn-pages-referendum-law-opponents-say-it-may-be-special.html,In the wake of passage of Suffolk Countys new initiative and referendum law last Tuesday opponents fear that it will become a tool of specialinterest groups to force a weakwilled County Legislature to do their bidding Voters approved the measure by almost a 4to1 ratio and a spokesman for the Suffolk County Civil Service Employees Association said the union expected the new law to be applied to such issues as abolition of the County Legislature rather than to taxcut measures Indeed County Legislator Denis R Hurley a Republican said in an interview that he intended immediately to form a citizens committee to begin gathering the signatures necessary to force an initiative on just that question Mr Hurley sponsored a bill to abolish the Legislature that was defeated earlier this year Suit to Bar Proposal Failed we are concerned that the way this new law is structured since its very simple for people who are organized to take advantage a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association said And who is organized The political parties and interest groups like the antiabortion forces and business organizations who want to wreck the county government for their own self interest The CSEA unsuccessfully sued to keep the initiative and referendum proposal off last Tuesdays ballot a move widely interpreted as protective of membersjobs The new law provides that citizens can force the County Legislature to consider a proposal by obtaining the signatures of 1000 registered voters with at least 50 signatures coming from each of the countys 10 towns Then if the Legislature fails to act within 60 days the sponsors of the initiative will have 150 days to gather signa tures equal to 5 percent of the number of voters in each town who turned out for the last gubernatorial election If that is accomplished 90 days before the next general election the measure will go on the ballot as a referendum The CSEA spokesman said that what concerned the union was the first part of that process which can force consideration of the proposal by the Legislature on the basis of only 1000 signatures Sensitive to Pressure The history of this Legislature shows that every time a pressure group has come in and shouted at the members theyve fallen over dead he said He mentioned such instances as the cutoff of county funds for Medicaid abortions which the Legislature passed early this year despite advice by the County Attorney that the measure was illegal As predicted it was overturned in the courts Another example the spokesman gave was the initiative and referendum proposal itself which the Legislature approved late one evening past midnight under severe pressure from a large group of elderly citizens interested in taxcut proposals I can see how people would be con cerned [about the susceptibility to pressure of the County Legislature] because we have had a few instances where weve been rushed into things Mr Hurley said But I dont think it would happen under the new law because you wouldnt have pressure groups on only one side People like the CSEA would come to us too Besides even if you didnt have this law 1000 people could still come down to us and scream
Budget. Fights Loom in Congress With Few New Initiatives Likely,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/12/archives/budget-fights-loom-in-congress-with-few-new-initiatives-likely.html,WASHINGTON Nov 11  When the 96th Congress convenes at noon on Jan 15 it probably will face a considerably lighter agenda  than its predecessor which was asked to pass on everything from Panama Canal treaties to tax cuts from naturalgas price increases to reforms in the Federal bureaucracy Carter Administration and legislative officials say that few new initiatives are planned for the 96th mainly because of the countrys economic problems and the increasingly conservative nature of Congress a trend affirmed and strengthened by Tuesdays elections White House aides are pondering what steps Congress might take to help control inflation and get the economy back on more even track But no specifics have emerged Two major initiatives that the 95th Con gress did not enact hospital cost containment and welfare reform probably will be tendered again by President Carter Some effort also might be made to resurrect the rejected urban program Second Attempts Expected We dont see a lot of new stuff coming up for the 96th an aide to the House leadership said But it looks like there could be a lot of spending fights because of the state of the economy The 95th Congress which adjourned Oct 15 was handed an unusually large agenda by President Carter as he enthusiastically plunged into his first term It was a hardworking Congress one that compiled a record 2691 votes as worked its way through 23942 bills and resolutions But the increasingly conservative mood of the country and the increasing potency of special interest lobbyists made it cautious rather than bold or innovative If at times the 95th seemed to be drifting off in a dozen or more legislative directions with no comprehensive program or thrust the blame was perhaps not so much on its leadership or the Carter Administration as on the special interest groups They have become extremely influential on Capitol Hill in recent years as Congressional reform and declining party loyalty have weakened the power of legislative leaders and enhanced the potency of lobbyists At one point during the 95th Congress lobbyists killed a bill to regulate lobbyists Power of the Middle Class At many legislative turns Congress was strongly influenced by the political power of Americas middle class rapidly expanding segment of the electorate that is tired of being taxed is frightened by inflation and is wary of the Federal Governments ability to solve the nations problems Following are details of some of the highlights of the second session Agriculture An effort to increase sugar supports failed But farmers won new regulations on meat imports as well as easier access to Government loans and requirements that foreigners disclose their investments in American farmland Civil Service Reform After much cajoling by President Carter who said he needed it for government efficiency a civil service bill was passed that streamlines hiring and firing procedures and sets up a system of bonuses for topgrade Federal managers willing to submit to special work standards Congressional Ethics and Reform Hearings uncovered influence buying on Capitol Hill by South Korean agents and three House members eventually were reprimanded Investigations also were begun into the tangled financial affairs of two Senators Herman E Talmadge a Georgia Democrat and Edward W Brooke a Massachusetts Republican Mr Brooke lost his reelection bid on Tuesday Both houses approved ethics codes requiring detaileddisclosure of members financial dealings as well as dealings by other highranking Government officials Constitutional Reform A Constitutional amendment that would grant the District of Columbia voting representation in Congress was sent to the states for ratification along with measure that added 39 months to the period for ratifying the equal rights amendment Consumer Affairs Business lobbyists defeated most consumer legislation except for a bill that set up a fund to Provide loans to consumer cooperatives Defense Congress called for construction of another nuclearpowered aircraft carrier despite arguments that the money should be spent replacing a number of smaller aging ships in the fleet The President successfully vetoed the bill Economy and Taxes Inflation and passage of the Proposition 13 taxcutting initiative in California led the 95th Congress to pare its original 500 billion budget by 12 billion It enacted a 19 billion tax cut that gives many breaks to corporations and middleincome families It also passed a fullemployment bill but only after adding an antiinflation rider and it rewrote bankruptcy laws to speed action in the courts and passed banking legislation that prohibits many types of insider abuses Education Special interests killed a bill that would have wrapped the Governments many education programs and agencies into a single new Department of Education The threat of a Presidential veto helped defeat proposals to provide Federal income tax credits for college and private secondary school tuition payments But restrictions were eased for obtaining college tuition loans from the Federal Government Election Reform Republicans and conservative Democrats combined forces to help kill the Presidents election reform proposals including public financing of Congresssional races Energy It was not exactly what President Carter had asked for or what consumers and energy producers wanted but Congress finally passed an energy conservation package that contained phased deregulation of natural gas prices tax penalties for gas guzzling cars Federal assistance and tax credits for installation of insulation reform of utility rates and requirements that industries using gas and oil switch to coal A bill also was passed to increase competition in bidding for offshore oil leases But a proposal to streamline procedures for licensing nuclear power plants failed to gain much support and railroads killed a proposal to  build coalcarrying pipelines across the country No final decisions were made on breeder reactor or neutron bomb policy Environment The President successfully vetoed the 1978 water projects bill saying that it contained wasteful and inflationary pork barrel projects But a bill con taming some 600 park projects known as the parks barrel bill was passed Developers helped force a weakening of the Endangered Species Act and helped kill a bill to preserve millions of acres of Alaskan wilderness Foreign Policy Hard lobbying by the White House gained passage of treaties authorizing the United States to relinquish control of the Panama Canal at the end of the century The President also won permission to sell jet fighters to both Arabs ad Israelis got the Turkish arms embargo lifted and headed off a number of cuts in the foreign aid bill Health The medical lobbys opposition killed hospital cost containment and the threat of inflation helped kill other health measures Opponents of Federally funded abortions failed to tighten the rules regarding which women qualify but were able to extend existing rules to several new agencies KennedyKing Hearings Nothing significantly new was turned up when the House Select Committee on Assassinations reviewed the shootings of President John F Kennedy and the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr Labor Big labor got very little out of the in creasingly conservative 95th Congress Its most wanted proposal labor law reform was killed after a major effort by big business lobbyists Law and Justice A bill was passed to prevent eavesdropping abuses and more than 150 new judgeships were authorized to help reduce the backlog of cases in Federal courts But an effort to revise the 3000 statutes in the United States criminal code bogged down A law was enacted that will make it more difficult for former Nazis to live in the United States New restrictions were placed on the huge illegal flow of cigarettes from states with low taxes to states with high taxes Transportation Congress rejected a measure that would have helped airlines buy quieter engines But it approved deregulation of airline routes and fares as well as eventual abolition of the Civil Aeronautics Board Funds were authorized for repairing many of the countrys deteriorating bridges and for completing and repairing the interstate highway system and several mass transit systems A tax was placed on fuel used by inland waterway barges which traditionally have not paid for use of the Governmentbuilt system Urban Affairs President Carter was late in sending up his proposals to aid cities with new types of revenue sharing public works projects and grants loans and incentives But what doomed them more than anything else was fear on Capitol Hill that they would be inflationary and perhaps no more effective than earlier However some existing urban programs were extended and Federal loan guarantees were approved to help New York out of its money crisis Welfare Reform Skepticism and fear of inflation aft killed President Carters welfare proposals which were meant to simplify the system make it less burdensome on states and increase work incentives
A Referendum on a New Constitution Is Set for Dec. 6,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/12/archives/spanish-church-state-not-quite-separate.html,MADRID As Spain moves toward the creation a secular state shedding Its image as Western Europes most Catholic country the reaction of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy its priests and the humblest faithful has been contradictory and confused The church has reflected the pluralism of Spanish society on which it rests Catholic Spain has for more than a century been something of a myth more secular than its laws suggest and politicians and churchmen are doing their best to hold onto or re shape chunks of its legacy as questions such as divorce abortion pornography and lay schooling intrude on a debate on the future of the nation On Dec 6 a popular referendum is expected ratify a new Constitution overwhelmingly approved last month by the Cortes or parliament The lengthy document reflects the politics of consensus that has conditioned Spains threeyear transition to democracy and nowhere is this clearer than in its gingerly treatment of issues of interest to the church An earlier draft pointedly declared that the Spanish state was not confessional  a clearcut separation of church and state that aroused the surprise and ire of the 80member Episcopal Conference Now after discreet lobbying by the bishops the Constitution states that no religion has state character but that the Government will keep in mind the religious beliefs of Spanish society and will maintain the resulting cooperative relationships with the Catholic Church and other faiths This is a far cry from the 1953 Concordat between the Vatican and the Franco regime which proclaimed Catholicism the state religion The Concordat is being revised to bring it into line with the Constitution although the church will continue to be subsidized salaries for the clergy and other recurring expenditures receive 85 million in state aid each year  under a tax that citizens may assign to the Government or the church of their choice The school issue touching specific economic interests aroused a far angrier debate than did divorce which the 1953 Concordat put exclusively under ecclesiastical courts Polls show that 70 percent of Spaniards favor civil divorce The Constitution puts marriage and divorce under civil law and only the most conservative churchmen are opposing the expected divorce law Mired in these constitutional skirmishes the church has not coherently defined its larger place postFranco Spain particularly its ties to political parties Individual Catholics are scattered across the political spectrum  the Communist Party is especially active in wooing priests and other practicing Catholics to its ranks  and the church hierarchy has not thrown its weight behind any single party This reflects in part its longterm losses caused by its tight alliance with the Franco regime in its early years born of its fervent support of his crusade in the civil war One architect of the churchs cautious opposition Franco in the 1960s Enrique Cardinal Vicente Tarancon the president of the Episcopal Conference today seems to favor keeping bishops and priests out of conspicuous party politics This stand crippled the chances of an avowedly Christian Democratic party in last years parliamentary election but Christian Democrats inside Mr Suarezs jumbled coalition have been seeking quiet alliances with likeminded bishops It may well be too late to surface an overtly Christian Democratic political movement in Spain in the rest of Western Europe the successes of Christian Democracy were in many ways conditioned by the Cold War when the Vatican itself was a more decisive political force And Spain is probably considerably less Catholic than its reputation sometimes suggests Christians are in a great minority in this country asserted Enrique Miret Magdalena Catholic lay activist and writer The Spanish people are very little Christian What they have is a lot popular customs wrapped up in Christianity and Catholicism There is a mixture of superstitious people with very little faith and the high believers the hard ones the defenders of the faith In any case the role of the Catholic church is no longer an issue that stirs passionate debate In 1936 during the civil war churches were burned and priests murdered but when Manuel Fraga Iribarne leader of the rightwing Popular Alliance invoked this unhappy chapter during the debate on the Constitution he sounded vaguely antiquarian If the Socialists have made concessions to the church in the Constitution it is because in the final analysis they do not fear Catholicism as an opposition rallying cry For some Spanish Catholics notably those in the liberal wing of the church the decline of official Catholicism and the gradual sundering of churchstate ties are reasons for celebration not dismay The liberal Catholic weekly Vida Nueva described the new constitutional order as a true step forward in religious freedom as urged by Vatican II the end of a sad nationalCatholic period and the beginning of real churchstate independence James M Markham is a correspondent

"VOTING JEWS REMAIN LIBERAL, POLL FINDS",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/12/archives/voting-jews-remain-liberal-poll-finds-their-support-of-president.html,Their Support of President Carter WanesKennedy is Preferred in a TimesCBS Survey WASHINGTON Nov II  American Jews remain far more liberal and more Democratic than other voters but the are evenly split on approval and disap proval of President Carter By a margin matched only by Catholics Jewish voters prefer Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts for President in 1980 While their approval o Mr Carters handling of his job is level with the views of the rest of the popula tion it is well below that of other Dem crats and below traditional Jewish su port for Democratic Presidents A New York TimesCBS News Election Day survey of voters leaving polling places included 331 Jews in its sample of 8933 enough to lend statistical credence to its information about Jewish political attitudes In most national polls the small number otJews interviewed leaves vast margins forerror In this poll however with 331 Jews interviewed the margin of error was only about eight points up or down for percentages around 50 It was less when Jews were very heavily for or against a position Jews Tend to Vote More Heavily Since Jews tend to vote more heavily than most other segments of the population they carry political weight beyond their numbers Nationally Jews are about 27 percent of the population but they are nearly 4 percent of actual voters To win close elections Democrats must depend on Jewish voters at least instates with major Jewish populations such as New York California Florida Illinois Maryland Massachusetts Michigan New Jersey and Pennsylvania Tuesdays Jewish voters retained that traditional allegiance with 72 percent saying they had voted for Democrats for the House of Representatives Sixty percent of the Catholics had backed Democrats but Protestants had gone narrowly proRepublican 49 percent to 45 percent The level of Jewish support for Demoi crats was about the same as they gave President Carter when he ran two years ago against President Ford Carter Standing Among Jews Weakens But there were several indications that despite the boost given his standing among Jews by the Camp David agreement on Middle East peace the Presi dents problems were far from settled Mr Carters standing among voting Jews on the handling of his job  95 percent approve 48 percent disapprove was statistically indistinguishable from the whole participating electorate which showed a ratio of 46 percent approval to 48 percent disapproval But while it was higher than the Protestant rating it was less than the 52 to 43 marks given by Catholic voters And with Democrats as a whole giving Mr Carter a 60 percentapprove 31 per centdisapprove scorecard the mostly Democratic Jews clearly were less satis1 fled than their fellow partisians One reason plainly remained the Mid dle East The voters were also asked if they favored a stronger commitment to Israel than we now have Eightyfive percent of them did while adherents to other faiths opposed the idea Looked at  in terms of age race sex or income no other demographic group offered majority support for that view although 56 percent of all Democrats did More Liberal Than Other Groups But the Jews in the survey of 120 polling places in 37 states may be reflecting other political differences too for on broad scale of questions they show up as more liberal than other groups Thirtysix percent called themselves liberal while only 20 percent of the Catholics and 15 percent of the Protestants did While selfperceptions in terms of liber al moderate and conservative often tend to reflect more an idea of life style than politics the polling place setting was far more political than the typical teleptione interview of most polls So it is probably a more reliable indicator of political liberalism and conservatism with only 16 percent of voting Jews callig themselves conservative compared to 27 percent of Catholics and 37 percent of Protestants Those liberal views showed up on many other issues Voting Jews were strongly in favor while other demographic groups except blacks opposed having the government paying for abortions for the poor Unlike other demographic groups except the 18to 29yearold category Jews favored permitting homosexual teachers to work in your public schools and  by a 59 to 33 margin Favor Defense Cuts Arms Pact On other issues with a liberalconservative difference voting Jews were generally on the liberal side They did not want the defense budget raised they wanted it cut They were most heavily in favor of an agreement with Russia limiting military weapons They were less interested than others in a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and less impressed with the significance of the Panama Canal as a voting issue One fact that underlined their liberalism was that half the Jews interviewed reported that they had household incomes of more than 25000 a level at which other respondents to most questions had become more conservative There were two other significant differences between the Jewish voters and others The national sample as a whole thought it was more important for Congressmen to help people in their districts who had problems with the GoVernment than to work onbills by a 49 to 43 margin Jewish voters disagreed 54 percent to 37 And by a smaller difference they had lower expectations than other religious groups about how much a candidate promised he could deliver
HIGH COURT FACING A JOB‐BIAS RULING,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/12/archives/high-court-facing-a-jobbias-ruling-rights-of-voters-and-of.html,WASHINGTON Nov 11  In the rust six weeks of its 1978 term the Supreme Court agreed to consider cases involving voting rights equal employment abortion the role of Federal courts and the rights of prisoners and defendants territorytthat is familiar but mineladen where recent decisions have left significant nuestions unanswered Rights of Voters and of Prisoners Also Among Issues Accepted for Review in This Term How far the Justices plan to go in answering questions about these issues is impossible to tell because the Court does not announce its reasons for taking cases But it seems likely that the term will produce at least a clarification of a key 1976 decision Washington v Davis which held that a claim of unconstitu tional job discrimination requires proof that the discrimination was intentional and not just the result of a seemingly neutral policy or requirement That decision has created considerable turmoil in the civil rights field with confusion over the type of evidence necessary to show intent and over the kinds of situations the Justices meant their new rule to encompass One of the cases the Court accepted for review laSt month is a challenge on the grounds of unconstitutional sex discrimination to a Massachusetts law that gives veterans an absolute preference for state civil service jobs Impact on Women Noted A Federal Court in Massachusetts struck the law down two years ago on the basis of its discriminatory impact on women seeking state jobs Last year the Supreme Court ordered the lower court to reconsider its decision in light of the Washington v Davis standard The three Federal judges again found the law un constitutional and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the states appeal Mass v Feeney 78233 So far in the term the Justices Mid considered roughly 1600 petitions for view of lower court decisions have ac1 cepted 47 cases for full argument al4 decision and have heard argument on 37 cases carried over from last spring Their first full decisions will probabl come down next week with roughly 17 decisions expected between now and the end of the 1978 term next June case the Court has agreed to hear are the folj Among other issues affected by lowing qPrisoners rights The Justices granted the Governments request for re view of a lower court decision that condi tions at the new Federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhatttan late the constitutional rights of prisoners who are awaiting trial The Court of Apr peals for the Second Circuit had ruled that because such prisoners are still sumed not guilty they may be subjected to only those restrictions that jail admi istrators can justify by compelling cessity The Government arguesthat this standard places a serious burden on the prison system Bell v Wolfish 77 1829 q Random stops of motorists The Cou granted Delawares request for a revie of a state court decision that policeme are prohibited by the Constitution f conducting random license and registra tion checks of motorists unless there i some

the consent of both parents before an unmarried girl under age 18 can obtain an abortion The Court struck down a Missouri paren4 tal consent law two years ago The Ma sachusetts law is somewhat different i allowing a girl whose abortion has vetoed by her parents to seek permissi  from a judge Bellotti v Baird 78329 41Plea bargaining A major unani swered question in cases concerning pie  bargaining is how far a trial judge can go in urging a defendant to plead guilty The Court agreed to hear an appeal by a many who pleaded guilty to a robbery in Brook lyn and then contended the judge had coerced him by telling him his sentencd would be twice as long if he insisted on going through with a trial and was con vi6540cted by a jury Ramsey v NY 771 41Federal regulation of television The Court agreed to hear the Governments appeal from a Federal court decision striking down a Federal Communications Commission requirement that cabletelevision broadcasters make at least one channel available for public acccess The case gives the Justices an opportunity to define further an evolving docj trine that the especially intrusive nature of television justifies more Governmentl regulation of television than the Firs Amendment would permit for newspa pers FCC v Midwest Video 771575 qEqual Rights Because Congress exi empted many of its own employees from coverage under the

785072 q Federal Courts The Court accepted an appeal from the State of Texas from a Federal district court decision striking down the states child abuse laws as unconstitutional As framed by Texas the central issue in the case is whether the Federal court had the right to intervene in a state court proceeding Supreme Court rulings over the last seven years have required Federal courts to abstain from intervening in an increasing variety of state proceedings and this case could give the Justices an opportunity to extend the abstention doctrine still further Moore v Sims 786

Young is firstterm Congressman who won reelection this year and may have established safe seat for the future at least in part because he played an important role in decision to keep the St Louis

what it was a decade ago when the President could call up committee chairmen who had virtually unlimited control over the actions of their cornmittees and get a piece of legislation enacted The new breed of Congress member has been increasing with every election and there is every indication that the trend continued last Tuesday That is at the heart of the new order of politics and Governing America Second of three articles government that has emerged in recent years A wide range of authorities now find the Government fractured difficult to organize and to mold into a consensus for the kinds of reforms and changes that most of the voters seem to want In the process the character of Congress is being changed Maurice Rosenblatt who has been watching Congress for years as a lobbyist and representative of the Committee for an Effective Congress says that the trend to district service and cultivation of specialissueigroups strengthens the micro approach since the member can isolate himself with his district and is never tagged on macro problems Likewise Mr Rosenblatt said the public does not want its Congressional representatives to deal with broad questions Thus the role of the politician has become totally absorbed in errandrunning and the good runner gets reelected even though the Congress as a whole declines in status and trustworthiness Senator Clifford P Case of New Jersey was defeated in the Republican primary June 6 after a long career of overwhelming victories Some of his supporters attributed the defeat not only to his age 74 years and his failure to mount an

the House has become much more bureaucratic and serviceoriented The character of the House membership has been changing for a number of years The enormous growth of Federal programs and regulation of business and public institutions by Washington has encouraged Congressmen more than ever before to be attentive to constituent needs and protection rather than to broadly focused national and foreign issues Congressmen More Independent Meanwhile the decline or local political machines has led Congressmen to be more independent of party than in the past and to set up their own political organizations The rise of groups organized around single issues a movement that began in the 1960s with the civil rights drive and spread rapidly in recent years to include a range of social and business interests has further separated Congressmen from national party leaders and encouraged them to cultivate the bureaucracy concerned with those issues important to their districts At the same time they have become more dependent than ever before on campaign contributions from specialinterest organizations as election costs have risen and contributions from such groups have become more easily available While the political campaigns were under way this year polls of public opinion showed dissatisfaction with government running high In the past such voter unhappiness had often translated into _a wide ideological swing in the House with 40 to 50 seats shifting from one party to the other Democratesm Held The Edge Yet there was not much of a shift this year The Democrats held an advantage of almost 2 to 1 over the Republicans who picked up 12 seats in the House and three in the Senate That was hardly a precipitous change since a number of Democrats were sitting in traditionally Republican seats that they won during the Watergatescandal era and managed to hold in 1976 Political analysts offer two reasons for this Many candidates ran on the basis of what they can do for their districts while portraying the issues and party loyalty as secondary and incumbents enjoy a big advantage The Ombudsman This falls campaigns provided supporting evidence for that view Lance Tarrance of Houston a consultant and pollster for a number of Republican candidates across the country said in a telephone interview that hardly any campaigns stressed issues any more What attracts people he said are personality and action themes that put the candidate close to the people showing that he cares about people in the district in such a contest the incumbent has the advantage Our surveys show that people cant tell you how the Congressman voted or what he has done but they have gotten letters from him and they heard he is hardworking and that is all they care Mr Tarrance said Congressional Quarterly surveyed the television commercials that political consultants fashioned for their candidates after voters in California approved of Proposition 13 the constitutional amend ment that cut back drastically on property taxes That action touched empathetic nerves elsewhere For challengers the magazine reported political consultants are designing campaigns that portray the candidate as a victim of overreaching Government just like the voters he wishes to attract The same advisers are depicting incumbents as fiscal watchdogs working energetically to eliminate waste and excess bureaucracy Warping of Government Roles Much of this is traditional American politics but a number of authorities believe that extensive use of the Congressman as ombudsman is skewing the system of representative government The nature of the Washington system is now quite clear Moffis P Fiorina Associate Professor of Political Science at the California Institute of Technology wrote in a book published last year Congress Keystone of the Washington Establishment Congressmen earn electoral credits by establishing various Federal programs Mr Fiorina wrote The legislation is drafted in very general terms so some agency must translate a vague policy mandate into a functioning program a process that necessitates the promulgation of rules and regulations and incidentally the trampling of numerous toes At the next stage aggrieved and or hopeful constituents petition their Congressmen to intervene in the complex process of the bureaucracy The cycle closes he continued when the Congressman lends a sympathetic ear piously denounces the evils of bureaucracy intervenes in the latters decisions and rides a grateful electorate to ever more impressive electoral show ings Congressmen take credit coming and going They are the alpha and omega Protecting the Little Guy Mr Fiorina believes that the proliferation of ombudsmen in Congress Send me to Washington I will protect the little guy from the Government explains the reduction of marginal districts in recent years and minimizes ideological shifts of the  kind that were pronounced when members were more closely identified with the policies of one party or the other The small Democratic loss this year helped support the Fiorina thesis There was a big shift in 1974 when the Republicans lost 48 seats because of the Watergate scandal not because of policy in the Republican White House Many of those seats represented traditionally Republican districts that under the old rules could be expected to shift back to the GOP at a time of dissatisfaction with Democrats But a number of the Democrats holding normally Republican seats won this year They are the new breed They and the class of 1975 make up a third of the membership and more and more many of the older members have become ombudsmen and declared their independence from party leaders These assertions of independence became so pronounced in the campaigns that John C White the Democratic national chairman last summer publicly scolded Democratic candidates for taking cheap shots at President Carter Money and Power Representative David R Obey of Wisconsin chairman of the House Commission on Administrative Review has a simple explanation as to how the House became fragmented A few years ago he says the House was run by its committee chairmen a few old bulls who kept their power purely because of seniority Frequently he says they were insensitive to the broad public interest An effort at reform was started whichbegan by stripping the chairmen of some of their power The power was dispersed to subcommittees which now number 385 in both the House and Senate The plan was to shift some of the power back into the hands of the elected leadership the Speakers office which would enact broad policy initiatives But Mr Obey said the newer members suspicious of centralized power after Watergate and being in control of the House Democratic Caucus liked the system of many subcommittees with divided authority As a result he went on we left the reform job half done Under the subcommittee system every interest has a port of entry into Congress he said but the bulwark of strong central leadership is lacking This leads back to the new breed and how their position was strengthened in the campaigns just ended When Money Came From Home A tew years ago Congressional incumbents up for reelection raised most of their funds from their own districts and the Washington fundraiser was a rarity Now it is a rare exception when a member seeking reelection does not start with a Washington contributions party inviting representatives of all of the interests that might want to invest in that member Beginning early in 1977 members of Congress held their Capitol Hill fund raisers and received generous amounts By midpoint of the campaigns political action committees representing corporate labor and professional groups had spent more than 60 million on Congressional campaigns with special interest groups concentrating heavily on incumbents The Federal Election Commission expects that when the records are complete they will show spending to have been four or five times more this year than ever before Thus the incumbents had substantial war chests even before the primaries and before it was known in many incidents whether they faced serious opposition This change was the result of several factors according to authorities on campaign financing Enactment of the law that provided public financing of Presidential elections freed millions of dollars that have been funneled into Congres sional races Another change in the law in effect freed corporations to contribute to political candidates by establishing political action committees that contrib ute in the names of employees or stockholders Little Attention to Ideology The number of such committees and the amounts they have raised has mushroomed in the last two years In contributing the various interests pay little attention to party lines or ideologies Liberal Democrats for example are frequently the chief beneficiaries of business groups that once helped only conservative Republicans What campaign donors want is access even to those with little seniority under the decentralized committee system Representative Young was one of those whose campaign was strengthened by naf tional interest groups Mr Young who represents a suburban district whose residents range from bluecollar to very wealthy is more traditional than many of his independentminded colleagues elected in 1974 and 1976 but he is no usual urban Democrat Last year even though he has the strong support of organized labor he voted about half the time with what Congressional Quarterly calls the conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats Sometimes he supports President Carter but frequently he does not When the Senate supported the President and approved the sale of F15 jets for Saudi Arabia Mr Young oung told a Jewish audience in his district that he opposed the sale as a turn away from support of Israel even though the McDonnell Douglas Corpora tion which manufactures the plane is based in his district In his first year in the House Mr Young joined a suburban caucus to work for suburban interests and a bluecollar caucus to work for the little guy These are two of the many caucuses that have sprung up in the Congress to defend some class or reeion Every Weekend at Home He never moved his home to Washington and he returns every weekend to his district where his life is a constant round of meetings with constituents In Washington he spends much of his time seeking a larger share of aid and services for them  an effort for which he has received favorable notice back home He held two fundraisers in Washington that turned out to be as Mr Young said pretty good for a freshman According to the records of the Federal Election Commission some of the contributors last spring in addition to a number of labor groups were the political action committees for Western Air Lines the United States Steel Corporation the Tobacco Institute Inc Trans World Airlines the Southern Railway Company The Railway Labor Executives Association the National Rifle Association Ford Motor Company the Emerson Electric Company Burlington Northern Inc the Rural Electrification Association and so on As that partial list indicates Mr Young is a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee Over a threemonth period he collected more than 120000 according to commission records When Seniority Counts Members with more seniority of course generally collected more and it was not unusual this year for House candidates to spend 250000 and Senate candidates several million Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina held a record at 75 million Earlier this year Fred M Wertheimer senior vice president of Common Cause the public affairs lobby which has been campaigning for public financing said It is a Congress becoming more and more paralyzed in its ability to make decisions on behalf of all citizens It is a Congress that in the nottoodistant future will be drowning in specialinterest group political money On July 19 the House declined to bypass its Rules Committee and vote on legislation to establish public financing of Congressional campaigns for 1980 The Rules Committee which clears bills for floor action is opposed to the measure Another attempt at passage will be made next year However some supporters fear that the large amount of money poured into the campaigns of incumbents who won reelection will make passage of the bill even more difficult and the phenomenon of public interest financing will go on SingleIssue Politics Another factor that has changed the Government is the rise of singleissue politics seen this year in a number of states For a long time Republican leaders have been saying privately that the rapid growth of narrowly based political organizations on the right was divisive and harmful to the party Not long ago Bill Brock the Republican national chairman said publicly that efforts to elect or defeat candidates on one or two polarizing issues threatened both the political system and the quality of the candidates elected There are hundreds of these singleissue constitutencies and they create a very serious problem Mr Brock told a group of political reporters in July Any voter who follows their instructions is not going to be judging the candidates broadIy as they amid The primaries and general election in Iowa pointed up what is happening in a number of areas As the primaries drew to a close The Des Moines Register said that the campaigns had been permeated by a shabbiness rarely seen in Iowa politics since the early 1960s The prime example the paper said was the race for the Republican Senatorial nomination which was won by Roger Jepsen a former lieutenant gover nor over Maurice Van Nostrand a former chairman of the Iowa Commerce Commission Wooing SingleIssue Support Mr Jepsen the more conservative of the two candidates ran with the support of a number of such singleissue groups as antiabortion and antigun control organizations He employed the services of Richard A Viguerie the directmail expert in the Washington area Mr Viguerie raised funds for the Jepsen campaign and rallied the specialinterest groups in behalf of the candidate Mr Van Nostrand who was trying to build a campaign on a broader base of support was openly vexed at this The gun owners of America he said at one point have endorsed one of the candidates in this primary without ever asking me where we stand on whatever the gun owners of America think is important The Republican National Committee anxious to build a broadbased party donated 5000 to Mr Van Nostrands primary campaign money that ordinarily would be saved for the winner of the primary That became an issue in the campaign as did Mr Vigueries role in it In effect national Republican money was used against national Republican money not against the Democrats Mr Jepsen won handily Only 17 percent of the voters turned outbut the specialissue people were out in full strength A Boon Seen for Clark It was said in political circles that the Jepsen victory would make it easier for Senator Dick Clark the Democratic incumbent to win in November because I Mr Van Nostrand would have provided a more broadbased challenge But the singleissue controversy I carried over into the general election Mr Viguerie had conducted a mass mailing effort across the state to identify which voters felt strongly about which issues for selected mailings during the campaign The gun owners the righttowork pea ple the antiabortion groups and others  Republicans and Democrats  went to work to get out votes for Mr Jepsen on those single issues Mr Jepsen won by a narrow margin a margin that might not I have been possible withoutthe singleissue people Some leaders say that the growth of ombudsmen of politicalaction committees and of singleissue politics is part of the narrrow selfconcern exhibited daily in Washington to a greater degree than in the past Recently Representative Morris K Udall Democrat ofArizona was angered when the House defeated a bill to build a coal slurry pipeline that would make it easier as part of national energy policy for industry to switch from natural gas to coal Some environmental questions were raised the railroads and labor unions were against it Mr Udall explained but what was really important in the defeat was that only six states would have benefited directly from it It was easy to vote against it he said Tomorrow The Special Interests
Clark Defeat in Iowa Laid to Abortion Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/13/archives/clark-defeat-in-iowa-laid-to-abortion-issue-national-help.html,DES MOINES Nov 12  Much has been made of the impact that dedicated singleissue blocs could have this year at the polls especially when apathy was obviously in fashion among the majority of potential voters No state in the nation offered a better test last Tuesday of whether a relatively small but undeniably fervent group in this case the antiabortionists could upset a highly favored candidate who did not meet their stringent requirements for support To the chagrin of Dick Clark a liberal Democrat seeking reelection to a second term in the Senate the answer turned out to be an almost unqualified yes National Right to Life forces had singled out Senator Clark at their convention last summer as their No 1 target for defeat this year Their reason was twofold First Senator Clark had voted for a bill permitting Federal financial support of of abortions for indigent women under specific restrictions and had said that his conscience would not permit him to support a constitutional amendment forbidding abortions and second Iowans For Life had already proved their political muscle by denying the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor to a popular woman candidate who opposed their views Matinno I Hain rIPTITeeilted A leader of Iowans For Life who asked not to be identified said with some disdain last week that the national groups contribution to the antiClark campaign consisted largely of lip service But the state bodys political arm the ProLife Action Council set out with unflagging determination to elect Senator Clarks Republican opponent Roger Jepsen conservative former lieutenant governor who enthusiastically supported a constitutional ban on abortions From the outset Mr Jepsen a rather plodding campaigner with a tendency to get tangled up in positions that he repeatedly had to clarify or back away from was given little chance even by leaders of his own party of defeating Mr Clark who had a reputation for being both articulate and tireless on the hustings For months and right up till the end all available polls showed Mr Clark with a comfortable lead of never less than 10 percent But Mr Jepsen was never fuzzy about his stand on abortions And on Election Day he was the winner with a margin of slightly more than 26000 votes Senator Clark and his campaigns aides and other Democratic leaders attributed the defeat directly to the antiabortion forces who worked hard for and demonstrably obtained a heavy crossover of party members to Mr Jepsen especially in urban areas with large numbers of Roman Catholics Carolyn Thompson chairman of the ProLife Action Council modestly said she would leave the interpretation of her groups impact on the outcome to political analysts but in a long interview she could scarcely conceal her conviction that the antiabortionists had defeated Mr Clark Only Mr Jepsen and the Republican leadership while acknowleging the contribution of the antiabortionists to his victory declined to characterize it as the major factor Mr Jepsen insisted that Mr Clarks voting record described \ by Congressional Quarterly as the most liberal in the Senate in 1977 was the key issue Since such a record did not reflect the philosophies of the people of Iowa Mr Jepsen said he was able to attract to his cause number of singleissue groups such as the antiabortionists opponents of the Panama Canal treaties supporters of the socalled righttowork laws and foes of any laws restricting the ownership of guns all of whom contributed to his election The Republican leadership tended to assign most of the credit for the Jepsen win to an unquestionably successful getoutthevote effort and to the hard work and unity at the top of the ticket led by Gov Robert Ray who campaigned indefatigably even though he was involved in a relatively easy race for reelection to fifth term Governor Ray ran nearly 67000 votes ahead of Mr Jepsen leaving the possibility that his popular coattails may have had some effect although Iowans have been notorious ticketsplitters in the past And the partys grassroots organiza tional effort this year probably the most intensive in its history returned both houses of the Legislature to the Republicans even though they had controlled neither branch for four years But the election figures seemed to show almost undeniably that neither of those factors would have been enough to carry Mr Jepsen and that the antiabortion votes tipped the scales in his favor A survey by The Des Moines Register at the polls on Election Day found that about 25000 people apparently voted for Mr Jepsen because of the abortion issue Some Register analysts used that to show that since he won by about 26000 votes he could have squeaked through without the support of that singleissue group Except for One Issue However if it is assumed as the Clark forces do that nearly all of those people would have voted for the Senator if it had not been for the abortion issue those ballots would have to be added to the Clark total giving him a victory almost as large as that won by Mr Jepsen The Register survey also showed 20 percent of the Democrats voting for Mr Jepsen and only 16 percent of the Republicans supporting Mr Clark which apparently accounted in part at least for the Senators unusually poor total of only 51 percent of the vote in generally Democratic urban areas It comes right down to those leaflets they put out said Bob Miller Senator Clarks campaign manager referring to about 300000 pamphlets distributed to churches throughout the state on the Sunday before election which was the culmination and the major thrust of the antiabortionists who estimate their total effort cost less than 10000 In Iowa where surveys have shown 54 percent of the people oppose abortions Mr Miller is convinced that the leaflets caused a lastminute shift that could not be countered Associated Press Senator Dick Clark right campaigned with Transportation Secretary Brock Adams left in Iowa farm country Associated Press

Horses Provide Clues To V.D. in Humans,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/14/archives/horses-provide-clues-to-vd-in-humans-infection-of-uterus-in-mares.html,CAMBRIDGE England  British scientists have found evidence of a possible link between a bacterium that caused recent outbreaks of venereal disease in thoroughbred horses and cases of venereal disease in humans The bacterium was discovered last year at the Regional Public Health Laboratory here by Dr C E D Taylor Despite extensive studies scientists have been unable to classify it according to any species or genus and has not been officially named The bacteriums diseaseproducing role was confirmed by the experimental infection of horses It has not been detected in any human and the scientists have not documented the spread of the venereal infection between horses and humans Nevertheless Dr Taylor speculated on its role as a cause of human venereal disease on the basis of results of blood tests his team made among patients in at various clinics in England As many as 37 per cent of the several hundred men and women tested showed positive reactions to the bacterium Dr Taylor said at a recent meeting on sexually transmitted disease If further studies prove the bacteriums role in human infections it will join a list of about 20 others that cause venereal disease a phrase used to describe syphilis gonorrhea and other diseases spread by sexual contact In mares the newly identified bacterium causes a severe infection of the uterus and leads to abortions Stallions are the carriers but generally escape the symptoms of infection though the bacterium can be detected in their genital organs When and where the bacterium first infected horses is not known but the first outbreak became apparent in Ireland in 1976 Since then the disease has been recognized in France England Australia and the United States among other countries Dr Taylor said that he undertook the investigation that led to the discovery of the bacterium at the request of Dr Hugh Platt a veterinary pathologist in Newmarket where an outbreak of the disease occurred last year A combination of factors helped Dr Taylor succeed in identifying the organism where others had tailed Among them were the following He had given Dr Platt specific instructions on how to avoid possible contamination with other organisms when he swabbed infected mares Because the swabs came to the laboratory on a Friday and because an extra growth period seemed necessary to identify the bacterium they were left to incubate until Monday a day longer than usual Dr Taylor used a hand lens a step that is routine in his laboratory but not in most others After the bacterium was identified as new Dr Taylors team set out to determine if it infected other animalsExperiments showed that guinea pigs cattle and sheep were not susceptible to the infection Because Dr Taylors work in the Regional Public Health Laboratory involves tests for diagnosing human diseases he said he was naturally curious to test humans for evidence of infection Initial tests on four veterinary surgeons who had exceptionally close contact with infected horses showed no such evidence However when Dr Taylor did what are called agglutinin tests on blood specimens from four groups of patients he found that there were positive reactions ranging from 2 percent among patients in a prenatal clinic to 37 percent among those treated in venerealdisease clinic Then he did further tests on specimens from patients with venereal disease that Dr David TaylorRobinson of the Medical Research Council had stored in freezers waiting for the type of breakthrough afforded by Dr Taylors discovery These test results showed a correlation suggesting the bacterium as a cause of human infection But the scientists knew that positive blood test reactions provided just a hint not proof of infection The positive results could have been produced by what are called crossreactions with other organisms However tests to date show no crossreactions with any known organism The possibility remains that the positive results represent crossreactions with an asyetundiscovered organism
A Singular Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/16/archives/abroad-at-home-a-singular-issue.html,BOSTON  Over the last few years political analysts have noted the significance of the singleissue voter the person who cares only about a candidates views on gun control for example or busing or capital punishment It is clear now I think tnat one sucn issue is likely to have the largest impact on American politics for the longest time That is abortion The growing influence of the antiabortion movement was dramatized in the midterm elections In Iowa group called the ProLife Action Council fought Senator Dick Clark because he refused to support a constitutional amendment on the issue The council distributed 300000 antiClark leaflets the Sunday before Election Day and many observers thought they tipped the vote against him In New York State a newlyformed Right to Life Party attracted more than 100000 votes for its candidate for governor Mrs Mary Jane Tobin That impressive showing entitles the party to a place on all New York ballots for the next four years Antiabortion groups also had some successes in this years primaries They played a part in defeating Representative Donald Frasers bid for Democratic Senate nomination in Minnesota And they helped Edward King a conservative making his first run for office deny renomination to Michael Dukakis the Democratic Governor of Massachusetts A CBS news poll in midSeptember asked people whether any one thing would determine their vote 5 percent said their feelings against abortion would According to political scientists that is an extraordinarily high percentage to mention a particular programmatic issue as compared to general concern such as high prices National polls on the issue of abortion consistently show a majority in favor of giving women and their doctors considerable discretion Some womens groups strongly favor complete legal freedom to decide But the opponents are better organized and evidently more committed It is a singleissue movement with a difference says Walter Dean Burnham professor of political science at MIT People who are against abortion care about it with the deepest intensity For religious or other reasons they treat it as a nonnegotiable issue After Senator Clarks defeat an official of the ProLife Action Council Robert Dopf said We had met with him for two years but he said he was voting his conscience on this We said we had no alternative but to oppose him In other words a Senators conscientious refusal to support a change in the United States Constitution required a vote against him no matter what else he had done and no matter what the character of his opponent The reason antiabortion groups act so singlemindedly is of course that their political view has a religious moral basis They regard abortion as homicide hence beyond compromise One who respects but does not share that view like myself finds it painfully ironic that in the name of humanity the antiabortion forces oppose some of our most humane politicians Don Fraser for example has been the leading voice of concern for human rights in Congress He has worked effectively to free individual political prisoners in many countries and to save others from torture and death Opposition to abortion centers among Catholics with some also among fundamentalist Protestants and Orthodox Jews Yet the rules permitting abortion here are no more liberal than those recently enacted by public demand in Italy and France overwhelmingly Catholic countries Recent election results suggest that antiabortion sentiment goes along with a mood of resentment against Big Government There again is an irony For the antiabortion movement aims to increase governmental restrictions to have government tell women and doctors what they may do Whatever ones personal view of abortion the influence of voters prepared to decide on that issue alone obviously raises problems for the political system In this large country with its differences of region and race and sect the system has worked best when factions were able to join in broad coalitions Moreover zealotry puts premium on trimming In politics targets those who stand on principle who are not willing to trim There have been other big singleissue movements in American history Usually they are of brief duration like the antiimmigrant Know Nothing Party of the 1840s and 50s They tend to fade away in Professor Burnhams phrase because the subject changes in American politics Some larger issue comes along  slavery in the 1850s economic crisis in the 1930s and captures everyones attention The issue of abortion seems to me unlikely to fade away soon unless a dominant new domestic or foreign concern arises Ideally people should come to understand the political danger of compulsion on such a sensitive matter compelling taxpayers to subsidize something they consider evil or overriding what others consider their medical or ethical responsibility But so far on this issue there is little reason to hope for the forbearance that makes democracy work

people most of them women  gathered in Houston for the historic first National Womens Conference For the next four days this rainbow of women as they came to be called because of their racial and economic diversity met talked argued demonstrated and compromised Finally the 2005 official delegates agreed on a 26point National Plan of Action to be submitted to the President and the Congress It included hotly debated recommendations on ratification of the equal rights amendment abortion on demand and lesbian rights And now it is Houston Plus One  Bella S Abzugs catch phrase for noting that one year haspassed since the conference took place Like many feministoriented women Mrs Abzug who was the conferences presiding officer has mixed feelings about the happenings of the last 12 months There has been movement and that movement is based on Houston and I think thats a very important thing she said Im hopeful on the whole But its a tough struggle and its angering that we havent made quicker strides Carmen Delgado Votaw Mrs Abzugs cochairman on the 40member National Advisory Committee for Women established by President Carter last April to advise him on the initiatives needed to promote equality for American women put it this way Im optimistic But we havent come as far as we should have after that big blast in Houston According to the National Advisory Committee and most womens leaders the major victory for women in the past year was the threeyear extension voted by the Senate for ratification of the equal rights amendment That was the overwhelming event of the past year said Betty Friedan the founder of the modern womens movement It was far more important than anything else that came out of Houston In fact I think Houston was almost a diversion from the importance of getting the ERA passed Among the other victories claimed by feminist leaders since Houston were the passage of the pregnancy disability bill which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of pregnancy childbirth or related conditions training for displaced homemakers under the Comprehensive Employment Training Act improved inheritance status of farm widows the Amateur Sports Act which provides for greater access of women to sports and their representation on the Olympics Committee the parttime career and flexitime bills which increased parttime employment and flexible scheduling of work hours in the Federal Government and the bill providing money for pregnant teenagers Setback Seen on Abortion The most tragic defeat since Houston according to both Mrs Abzug and Mrs Votaw was the further erosion of the right to abortion as guaranteed in the US Supreme Court decision of Jan 22 1973 Congress for the third year in a row attached to a Health Education and Welfare bill a rider denying Medicaid benefits for abortion with certain exceptions HEW regulations ordered by Secretary Joseph A Califano imposed additional restrictions resulting in the decrease of Medicaidfunded abortions by approximately 98 percent in 22 states We really kind of missed the boat on abortion Mrs Votaw conceded Thats an issue in which we dont have Administration support and arent likely to get it So were probably going to have to go it alone Other legislativesetbacks for women during the year according to the National Advisory Committee were failure of Congress to provide funds for shelters for battered women retention of veterans hiring preference in Civil Service reform measures failure to act on a broader definition of rape in the Federal Criminal Code failure to extend Social Security coverage to homemakers and failure to expand childcare programs Mrs Votaw who also serves as president of the National Conference of Puerto Rican women said the spirit of Houston had inspired more women to run for political office this year Although the gains were not enormous women did increase their representation in state legislatures by 58 seats to a total of 761 This is 102 percent of the national total the first time in history women have held more than 10 percent of the seats The election also produced four new female Lieutenant Governors for a total of six Women didnt fare as well in Congress however There the total number of women Representatives dropped from 18 to 16 And the only woman Senator in the 96th Congress will be Nancy Landon Kassebaum Republican of Kansas This is one area where weve been much too soft since Houston said Mrs Abzug herself a former Congresswoman from New York We must have more women in elected and appointed office I think the political parties have to be told we have to have 50 women in Congress by 1980 They have to go out and find them and help them Other areas where women have made gains since Houston include the Carter Administration where 14 percent of all Presidential appointments have been women the astronaut training program where six women were chosen for the space shuttle program and the Navy where women are now on active sea duty Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women said NOWs membership had increased from less than 70000 members to more than 100000 since the Houston conference I think what we saw this year vas a coming of age of the womens movement she said There was much more political activity from all womens groups Jean OLeary coexecutive director of the National Gay Task Force said that after a series of defeats earlier in the year the recent defeat in California of the antihomosexual Briggs amendment was spectacular for us It did for the gay rights movement what the Dade County loss did to it Phyllis Schlafly who led the socalled profamily opposition to the official Governmentsponsored conference in Houston and who heads the nationwide Stop ERA forces said she thought the year since Houston had been fantastic to our cause The ERA was beaten on an advisory referendum Nevada 2to1 and it lost in Florida too she said The proponents spent an enormous amount of money there [Florida]  it was their big effort We also made legislative gains in all the unratified states so we were just all thrilled with the elections Her biggest setback she said was the ERA extension But Im beginning to think it didnt hurt us and may even help us Ive heard that some proERA legislators may vote against it now because they think its extension was done so unfairly More Groups to Provide Help One of the more noticeable changes since Houston is the number of groups set up to deal with womens problems Foremost is the National Advisory Committee whose policies will be carried out by a staff of eight headed by 37yearold Ellen McGovern She is a former legislative director of the American Association of University Women who has a fondness for using the word energized in referring to the condition of women since Houston The staffs office is a cramped suite on the fifth floor of the Department of Labor in Washington Another new body that could prove influential in advancing womens concerns is the Intergovernmental Task Force on Women composed of representatives from various Federal departments and agencies It is headed by Sarah Weddington President Carters adviser on womens issues who said its purpose was to learn how to be more effective on the issues raised in Houston The task force will hold its first meeting on Dec 5 My biggest worry now Mrs Abzug said is that Carter may be willing to sacrifice us to his new economic policy If the economy goes bad women would be expendable since we have the lowestpaying jobs And since we were the last ones hired wed be the first ones fired She paused If that happens she said softly well have to use the same mobilization and organization we did for the ERA extension That way it would be hard to stop us Feminist Gains Threeyear ERA extension Pregnancy disability bill Aid to displaced homemakers More Federal parttime jobs Greater access to sports Relief for farm widows Setbacks Abortion rights diminished Failure to obtain shelters for battered women Social Security for homemakers denied No expansion of childcare Old definition of rape unchanged
Helping Women In Need,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/19/archives/new-jersey-weekly-helping-women-in-need.html,MILLBURN HUNDREDS of telephone calls are pouring in these days to free listening and referral service called WISH an acronym for Women in SelfHelp Operated here by volunteers from the Essex County section of the National Council of Jewish Women the service is divided between listening calls and referral calls according to Blanche Dorman of Livingston who heads the project Many women simply feel the need to talk to someone anonymous someone with whom they can be completely candid but who will not pass judgment on what they have to say Mrs Dorman said Others have needs that are more specific ranging from a college girlwho wanted to have an abortion to an elderly woman in need of a nursing home We can refer these people to an approuriate professional source or local _ agency Mrs Dorman said adding that each agency given as a referral has been screened in advance by a WISH committee The 65 volunteers who range in age from those in their late 20s to those in their 70s are specially trained for the work by professionals in a variety of fields Workshops and discussion groups are conducted by representatives from the Garden State Crisis Information Association which provides information on a variety of subjects from depression and suicide to alcoholism and drug usage The idea for WISH according to Mrs Dorman grew out of a series of study groups conducted by members of the council on the problems of single parents widows and the newly divorced As she put it We found as a recurring theme the need for women to talk to a sympathetic caring but nonjudgmental listener something they couldnt find in friends and relatives no matter how helpful they tried to be We also found that many women are unaware of the community services that exist and the options that are open to them In some cases Mrs Dorman said the options are few giving the organization an opportunity to play an advocacy role in the community something that social agencies regard with great favor Volunteers are instructed to terminate a telephone call after 20 minutes although some have exceeded the time limit when the need was great All conNersations are kept confidential and the callers are asked not to identify themselves either by name or phone number although a log is kept of the number and kind of calls received from day to day Our whole purpose is to help women help themselves Mrs Dorman said If a decision needs to be made they are the ones who must make it All we can do is help them to articulate and understand the problem The ultimate decision as to what to do about it must emanate from them Most calls reflect the social conditions of the times Mrs Dorman noted They come from single parents from adults whose aged parents are a source of concern from women with marital problems and from unmarried women with domestic difficulties For example Mrs Dorman said if a single woman has been running around with a married man who she thought was going to divorce his wife and marry her and he tells her that he has changed his mind she has no place to go for understanding Her friends think she should have known better and so she calls us to pour out her unhappiness Some of the volunteers are social workers others have training in psychology and related subjects The telephone lines are open from 9 AM to 230 PM Monday through Friday with three volunteers on hand at all times This is done so that calls can be taken simultaneously and to have a team approach Mrs Dorman explained Team members are supportive of one another can analyze how calls are handled and sometimes suggest ways to improve the handling of a call Because of the hours few crisis calls such as earlymorning suicide threats are received Mrs Dorman said In the hours that the lines are not open the WISH telephone number  201 6789474  is answered by a recording that gives the correct hours and a tollfree statewide number to call in case of an emergency We also get an occasional call from men who have heard of the service Mrs Dorman said and we do our best to help them Everyone is most appreciative and we know that the feeling is genuine because we get so many calls from women saying You helped a friend of mind andI wonder if you could help me too  
THE E.R.A. —,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/19/archives/the-eradoes-it-play-in-peoria-era.html,It used to embarrass me even to admit that I came from Peoria It was a vaudeville joke the epitome of the hick town Peoria III population 100000 more or less  the town where I was born and grew up and knew I had to get out of I never wanted to go home again or so I always used to tell Betty Friedan is currently a senior research associate at Columbia Universitys Center for Social Sciences myself I remembered only the pain of growing up in Peoria I never would admit the pleasure the delight the sweet sure certainty of belonging in Peoria  that small selfsatisfied deceptively simple mysterious complex heartland of America which undeniably provided my roots and therefore the roots of whatever vision of equality passion for justice or sense of possibility drove me to the womens movement in the world Why else was I going back to my Peoria High School reunion class of 38 this summer of 78 when Illinoiss fail ure to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment awakened us to the emergency threatening all that women have gained It was outrageous unbelievable scary that Illinois state of Lincoln my own home state would once again refuse to ratify the ERA with only a few months left before the sevenyear deadline expired almost cetainly dooming constitutional underpinning of womens rights for this century I dreaded that highschool reunion had gone to the 25th in 1963 the year my book The Feminine Mystique was published taking my husband and my children so they could see where mother came from And no one would sit with us at the banquet My brothers fatherinlaw took his grandchildren out of town lest they be contaminated by their radical aunt and the next morning the tree outside the house where we were staying was festooned with toilet paper But this was 19711 If you come home we will have a march in Peoria and the women will take heart again said Ann Courtney the local NOW National Organization for Women leader hoarse and depressed from futile months of lobbying for ERA with the Illinois legislature I didnt need to be con At the head of a parade through downtown Peoria Betty Friedan lifts her torch in support of extending the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment Back in Illinois for her highschool reunion feminist leader Betty Friedan finds her conservative classmates and vaudevillejoke of a hometown have come a long way since 1938 vinced that no matter how many millions in New York and Los Angeles march arch for equal rights the bottom line is still Does it play in Peoria Peoria is a very conservative town Most of my highschool friends were still conservative Republicans Had there ever been a march in Peoria for anything My recollections of 1963 were still vivid 1 didnt relish the idea of being rejected and ridiculed at another reunion But Ann was persistent Its the moment of truth she said Peoria and the womens movement  maybe will all come together in your own life Besides Harriet wants you to stay with her and she says whe will march now Harriet Parkhurst was my oldest and best friend That clinched it I would go back to Peoria  Harriet who meets me with Ann at the Peoria airport is a Republican state committeewoman mother of six daughter of an old WASP Peoria family wife of a prominent conservative Republican lawyer As a child I used to see her often at the library first with her mother as I was with mine then prowling alone as I did to find more things to read My father finally forbade me to take out more than six books at a time it wasnt ladylike he said for me to be seen walking home up Main Street hill with such a heavy load Harriet belonged by birth to the sororityfraternity and countryclub crowd They were the friends I grew up with knew in grade school  but in high school was suddenly alienated from because as a Jew I was barred from the sorority just as my family was barred from the country club Paul Jordan was her boyfriend then He was a powerful swimmer as Harriet was she nearly made the Olympics and he was president of our senior class At Peoria High I started a magazine with Paul P3 and Doug Palmer and some others And I wrote a newspaper column with John Parky Parkhurst whom Harriet later married At some point there in high school walking the two miles home alone reading poetry at sunset in a cemetery when I would rather have been riding in a jalopy to Hunts hamburger stand with the sororityfraternity kids somewhere I vowed They may not like me now but theyre going to look up to me In the fall of 38 Harriet and I went off to Smith College together After graduation we shared an apartment in Greenwich Village with two other Smith girls And then when World War II ended Harriet went home and married Parky and had six kids It never bothered her to write housewife on the census blank And yet she was a natural politician a born leader of the community she became a Republican state committeewoman while Parky embarked on a political career running for state senator becoming a conservative power in the state You should run for office yourself I used to tell Harriet when I would detour from a Midwest lecture to pay her a visit She was so good so effective  she could have been elected to anything But Harriet would just laugh  and have another child and espouse another cause She was always for the underdog and for democracy equality truth and justice A conservative Republican she calls herself yet Harriet felt as strongly about the Equal Rights Amendment as I did She worked in her own way of course not in NOW but through the League of Women Voters Right now however Harriet is anxious to get back to her husband Parky who is to be master of ceremonies for our reunion has been having kidneystone trouble and isnt feeling well So Harriet will have to stay with him but she promises she will turn up for the end of the march 0 The torchlight parade is to begin at the local Y But the real thing isnt practical says Ann handing me flashlight shrouded in a brown paper bag that has been shaped and painted to look like a torch I hope therell be at least a hundred people Ann says That would be respectable for Peoria Unexpectedly we are stopped by police several blocks from the Y because the crowd has backed up this far As I look out over the jam of people I cannot believe it is Peoria The local NOW leaders are stunned They never dreamed this many cared about equal rights in Peoria Grandmotherly looking women some grandfathers lots of young women and men and not so young ones Junior Leaguers in summer dresses and pumps and highschool kids in blue jeans I see two friends of mine Shirley and Ruth And Adelaide Cooley whose obstetrician fatherinlaw brought me and all the Peoria babies of my generation into the world just as her husband does now Adelaide has been writing fiery letters to The Peoria JournalStar decrying the dangerous motives fo politicians who have not yet learned that equal rights for women seems to be Gods will Holding our torches aloft we move to the courthouse in silence for the police have found an ancient ordinance forbidding song or speech within 50 feet of the courthouse I look back the line extends all around that courthouse square  maybe a thousand women and men and children holding their torches high A young woman costumed as the Statue of Liberty and another in her suffragette grandmothers whitelace dress lead the parade holding the ERA banner while the first woman member of Peorias City Council and I march along behind it Then I speak I tell them that Illinoiss failure to ratify the E RA has forced women to crisis action to extend the deadline And when I say Women will not go away women will not forget the crowd cheers I go on Tonight in Peoria we can see that the majority of women dont want to go back and the men dont want them to go back At the end when all has been said that has to be said the crowd dares to sing despite the ordinance Were on the road to equality and weve had enough discussion and Harriet sneaking in at the end is amazed at the unprecedented size of the crowd A thousand for Peoria is the equivalent of a million for New York After the long despairing months of impasse betrayal futility and the doomsayers tolling the knell of the womens movement this march in Peoria tells me what a few weeks later the great march of 100000 on Washington will confirm that the womens movement has not ended or even peaked it has entered the mainstream of American society where it will finally 0 The class of 1938 meets for lunch at Hunts drivein hamburger joint our hangout in the highschool years at the foot of Farmington Road where the house I grew up in still stands It looks much smaller than I remember  a red brick house with a big front porch and a graceful front door a center hall and stairway on whose landing I would sit and read and watch the dinner guests after I was supposed to be asleep Downtown the streets are absolutely deserted not a bit of the hustle and bustle remember in Peoria on a Saturday But there are trees and park benches along Main Street which Parky tells me are due to the efforts of my brother and others to revive the Center City Hunts which Gordon Hunt from our class of 38 took over from his father is serving us In 1938 budding writer Bettye Goldstein now Betty Friedan and classmates Paul Jordan left and Douglas Palmer worked from the 38 menu  But Hunts is no longer a drivein its an eatery with banquettes and booths And there they all are my classmates most of them looking incredibly the same after 40 years but a few that are difficult to recognize under the layers of fat or other masks theyve put on with age Peorias Remarkable Class of 38 as a local reporter recently described it So much leadership came out of that class that a mere recitation of many of the names sounds like the roll call of a board of directors for a corporation called What Makes Peoria Run There were six valedicto rians that year Harriet me three other girls and Ned Ochiltree a highschool book worm who went on to MIT and the presidency of a big steel company The one black in our class Harold Johnson a football star  is now principal of An Upper Grade Center in Chicago I became a pal of the football team in physics class I did the math for their lab reports and they did my wiring and splicing As one of them wrote in my old yearbook You might be brilliant and get a lot of As but Id hate to see you stranded on a desert island Harold Ronk whom I remember as a fat proper boy in high school Vice President of German Club Prefect Home Room Banker is the singing ringof the together on Tide Peoria High Schools literary magazine `I dreaded going to this reunion I went to the 25th in 1963 taking my husband and my children It was the year my book The Feminine Mystique was published and no one would sit with us at the banquet ers and Barnum  Bailey Circus And there is Al Cox another football star who went from Annapolis to the command of several destroyers at sea then to the diplomatic circuit and on to the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff he wrote a book Sonar and Underwater Sound and retired to the defense industry Tall and handsome as ever the collar ad kind our generation called handsome he eats his hamburger with Jean Farris who looks like an ad for If I have one life to live let me live it as a blonde one of the few women present who has been divorced she now lives in California with over 3000 lifemaster points in bridge and collects antiques has four 10 And Robert Welt a quiet boy whose main claim to fame in high school was Stamp Club Prefect Captain Home Room Banker now is looking suave sophisticated and mysterious he has spent 29 years in the CIA And Richie one of the big Jocks of the class has become a guru of an obscure religious cult in Califor nia changing his name to Seth He doesnt come to the reunion nor does Johnny Altorfer who left Peoria after developing its new industrial park with its road named after him later running for Governor and moving to national finance and Republican politics But Paul Jordan who is now chief of surgery at Baylor Hospital in Houston came all the way from Spain where he was lecturing bearing medical honorifics and awards from London Sweden Brazil and Washington There is a national power at our reunion Bob Gilmore the president of Caterpillars worldwide 8 billion empire who worked up through the ranks Horatio Algerstyle of Peorias largest industry He was not one of the big men in our class he didnt go to college and the only notation under his name in my 1938 yearbook is Home Room President That anonymity serves him now in the upper ranks of American corporate power unobtrusive unrecognizable in the crowd at the lunch and banquet that night He cant even talk to me about how he feels about his eminence his company does not allow its officers to speak for publication without prior committee approval and never on personal matters without a PR professional present And there are others The movers and shakers and doers who came home from World War 11 to run Peoria they are all here running this reunion like a leaderless committee because they know each other so well Theyve all chaired so many boards they celebrate their own powerful ease putting on this homey event together And the powerful they are men and women equally cant deny the feel of that equality as we leave Hunts to tour our old high school to drink and dance and reminiscence at the new motel downtown on Saturday night Harriet Parkhurst is as powerful a political force in Peoria as her husband I do not doubt that Shirley Sudow is fulfilled as a housewife lawyers wife community and Democratic Party activist herself though she Gordon Hunt hugs Friedan arriving with Harriet Parkhurst and Harold Johnson prefers to talk proudly of her daughter the lawyer The women radiate a sense of serenity and quiet assurance unspoken power not only in relation to their husbands and children but as persons in the community the respect with which they are treated is real It is a little confining considering the rhetoric and the images of womens lib even my own images in The Feminine Mystique But now I am struck by my feelings of love admiration respect and even envy of these women my old friends in their pleasant comfortable houses with their children grandchildren and this community We traipse through the high school The auditorium looks the same but the seats are new the principal tells us the kids are taller now Theres a big new gym the old one is used for the girls now he says making a point of the girls basketball team girls track And a new science lab I remember the old one where enthralled with chemistry I was going to be Marie Curie until the teacher told me there was no future for a girl in science Did I want to be a doctors receptionist a lab technician We who edited the paper started the magazine starred in the plays traveled with the debating team or the swimming team sang in the choir played in the orchestra or on the football team  we got the taste the skills the feel in Peoria of actively running our world Boys and girls  Ida was editor of the newspaper Paul and Doug and I started the magazine  we all did the plays and operettas and officered the glass Only the varsity sports were exclusively male in that world which incubated them to run the Peoria Establishment and me I suppose to believe that women could and should help run that larger world which women so But in those days I had no sense that women lacked power In my family and in others too it sometimes seemed as if women had too much power They certainly ran our lives and they could make life hell for our fathers It took a new consciousness to realize that women often took their own frustrations out in the covert power they used on their husbands and kids that they had to dominate the family for lack of economic and political power in the outside world But for usgrowing up in Peoria in the 30s there outside politics nor economics beyond this comfortable river bluff where we lived in our square frame and brick and stucco houses our secure world bounded by the school the streetcar down Main Street the drug store the library the two movies the department store tennis courts golf course countryclub pool and the dance hall where Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman and the big bands would come to play Nobody had ever been as far away as Europe As the Depression eased my family went to Wisconsin or Michigan for two weeks every summer where my father taught me Until I read Middletown in college I never realized that there was another world of people that worked in the Caterpillar factory living in Peoria below the bluff poor people whose kids never went to Peoria High or aimed at college My father as a respectable member of the Chamber of Commerce swore all his children to secrecy when he and my mother went out one grim November day to vote `For us growing up in the 30s there was no outside world  no politics or economics beyond this comfortable river bluff where we lived Nobody talked about Fascism Communism or the war that was brewing in Europe for Franklin Roosevelt Nobody in Peoria ever talked about Fascism Communism or the horrors of the war brewing in Europe I won an essay contest on Why I am Proud to be an American and as a prize recited the Declaration of Independence on July 4 at the fairground and our Congressman Everett Dirksen patted my head It was the time of the Big Apple and the Lindy was catching on and girls wore gardenias on taffeta evening dresses to the highschool dances and the biggest tragedy was not having a date Saturday night In that world in Peoria and its microcosm in our highschool class girls wielded the cruel social power that somehow derived from depended on and was manipulated through men Watching them flaunt that power in those lunch hours on the steps long ago I had no thoughts about the unfairness of ones dependence as a woman not even about the injustice of being an outsider as a Jew  only the pain the envy the longing to be one of them It was only much later that learned economic and political words for that condition learned about WASP prerogative and much later still that related it at all to the condition of being a woman In Peoria today women still have a lot of power especially if they are married to powerful men But in those marriages of 30odd years there seems to be a lot more equality and a lot more mutual dependence than the laws or the images of womens lib recognize That de facto equality among the lucky ones as much as the sheer necessity for economic independence and equal opportunity experienced by some who werent lucky which they all somehow sense as necessary or want for their daughters  makes ERA play in Peoria Somehow in Peoria it all falls in place as the evolution of America  not a revolution and not at all a of So for instance Marion Sprenger pert blond sorority girl with a lot of style how envied her angora sweater my mother ordered plain Shetland twin sets for me from Bests who our sophomore year started going steady with Joe a handsome easygoing fellow and married him while I was away at college Was it economic reasons or talents that needed to be used that turned Marion into a fashion coordinator for a local department store and later parttime bookkeeper for the family hardware busi And Mary Jean Olsen Smatla one of the valedictorians whose husband is a Presbyterian minister in Butte Mont In the reunion miniyearbook she tells about her three sons a geologist a seismologist a photographer For someone who did not want to teach Ive done a lot of it I even learned to like it I keep up music by playing in an English handbell choir and in a recorder group and lead an exercise class at the Y My claim to fame is doing cartwheels around the gym on my 50th birthday Another is Millie Arends the fat girl of our highschool days who is a handsome woman now exuding confidence and high spirits She never married but she is one of them the powers who run this town After teaching school for nine years she started brilliantly successful travel agency in Peoria and has conducted tours throughout Europe and the Far East she is also city treasurer of Peoria now in her sixth term As for dieting Millie claims she starts every Monday and has lost over 1000 pounds  al ways the same two Ann Schmoeger Day a sorority girl who we thought was amazingly adventurous when she took off from Peoria to become an airline stewardess back in 1938 introduces me to her husband 01le a senior pilot at American Airlines In her day stewardesses had to quit at 30 or 35 or after marriage So she became an interior designer She tells me delightedly that thanks to the womens movement a friend of theirs today is a grandmother and still a stewardess Then there is Charlotte Clayton who after 21 years as a secretary became the first female fore man at Caterpillar supervising 14 men Elvira Lemkemann a widow her first husband died in 62 her second husband in 76 works for the Peoria Police Department Helen McLean went into the laundromat business when her first husband died After her second husband died she married again but she still has one laundromat and also works at Mace Advertising And now we are at the banquet all spitted up in our evening clothes and a sweetlooking woman Ruth Fernihough whom I dont remember from high school is following me determinedly around the ballroom trying to tell me between my joyful embracings of old friends how  it changed my life She wanted to take out a bank loan to start an interiordecorating business The bank wouldnt give her a loan unless her husband signed for her I said it wasnt his business They said If he doesnt have faith in you why should we Then you got the law changed and banks cant discriminate against women any more even if they are married Her interiordecorating business is very successful she says glowing It was my hobby and now its my career Some of the men are unforgiving in their outrage at sons who do not want to be like them And others come up asking me to autograph the reunion program for their daughters My daughter is in the Air Force My daughter is going to be trust officer where they never had a woman before Now Parky supressing the pain from his six kidney stones starts emceeing the extravaganza he has written heralded by offkey blasts from the saxaphone Bob Easton hasnt played since high school  CHORUS Johnny caught a rat trap Bigger than a cat trap Alevivo Alevivo Sis boom bah Peoria High School Rah rah rah VOICE One reason it all meant so much to us is because we were in charge of our lives There werent so many ways to escape  no pills to protect us no pot to smoke and everybody knew all the gossip about everybody else after 15 minutes at Hunts We were so visible And that made us responsible or at least scored CHORUS Didnt need no welfare state Everybody pulled his weight In the Class of 38  Those were the days riasr VOICE Then we had to add without computers and reading hadnt been replaced by TV Nobody had ever heard of cholesterol the only Rocket we knew ran on a railroad track and all the beer was heavy Words like brunch and bikini hadnt been invented And no motels only tourist homes We did have torchlight parades but not for ERA Weve come a long way baby Or have SECOND VOICE Lots of you here tonight have been doers ever since you learned how at old PHS And all the doers are introduced and the band plays some Big Apple music and Thanks for the Memories Parkys as flamboyantly sardonic as when he was the star debater only more mellow now When we wrote our highschool column together we used to spar a lot Perky and I seed once when I came back to Peoria  I a radical writer from New York and he a Republican state senator in the shadow of Joe McCarthy  we argued violently about some Communistic idea like health insurance But the roots of his activism and mine are the same and in the last few years the political realities impinging on his life in Peoria and on mine in New York have defied that simplistic leftright polarization Perky has teased me about womens lib but he drew on his years of Repbulican expertise to advise us on how ERA might get through the Legislature in On that graduation day 40 years ago in the time of Roosevelt before Pearl Harbor with the Depression nearly over and the war not yet begun in the security that was never really that secure for our generation Parky had said in his Youth on the March oration We can feel ourselves moving  but we dont know where we want to go We are confident that our line of march will lead to prosperity success and ultimate promotion to the cherished ranks of leadership And now here is Bob McCord lithe lean but more lined and assured than the freckled boy of highschool days trying to explain it all We happened to come along at the right time  It was a lot easier to grow up in 1938 than in 1968 There really wasnt the option to be bad We all had the same morals the same values the same work ethic And yet as the band plays Stardust Paul Jordan tells me how  on the plane from Spain  he suddenly wasnt sure he wanted to come to this reunion With all his honors his success as a surgeon did he really want to feel the pain of being an outsider among them again And he says with strange intensity Do you know they never would have let me be seniorclass president if one of them had wanted it for themselves And as the band continues to play I wonder how much the exclusion from them must have driven this man  and me to the achievements that have won us admittance to a much larger world Can we ever stop armoring ourselves against the pain of that exclusion I want to tell my dear friend PJ the great surgeon looking so boyish still Enough enough youve laid that ghost to rest look how nice they are how glad to see you But Paul leaves the party early takes a plane Other shadows fall from those not here who didnt have the strength to stay afloat as one of them some who died of alcoholism who destroyed themselves or were destroyed But it is when we talk of our children that the sense of shadow deepens For our children are 10 years out of high school now more or less and in Peoria as in New York they arent so sure they even want to be one of them So Vicki married more than 30 years to the same man shes loved since age 16 says helplessly My youngest daughter is already divorced And Shirley content as a lawyers wife and occasional delegate to Democratic conventions says My daughter the lawyer and the boy she is going with are trying to figure out how to combine two political futures And the devout Catholic friend of my childhood whose literal acceptance of Papal edits against birth control troubled her own early married years asks my advice about abortion As a grandmother she is having to play mother again to the babies of a daughter who married too young had babies too young and is only now belatedly and from painful necessity learning to support herself in the world Facing confronting life on her own my friend is fervently supporting the ERA But it is the sons now who seem to trouble us the most He wasnt interested in college Hes got a rock band called Eargasm Harriet can hardly bear to say it out loud Its all he wants to do My son says he wants to write He doesnt seem to care about getting published He isnt interested in the family business at all Some of the men are unforgiving in their outrage at sons who do not want to be like them Others are intensely interested in the strange questing of these defiant sons as if they can find in them some answer to new question marks in their own lives Harriets brother Bob Vance whom I remember mainly as a happygolucky playboy left Peoria to seek tended to stay only a year a kind of sabbatical to deal with the new questions in his soul He stayed the full course Now he is virtually a fulltime minister back in Tucson but he has too many questions about the organized church to seek ordination in it And Bob Easton who was my first beau when we played post office behind the sofa this lovely man who once told a reporter he liked me because I was pretty laughs when remind him of his old worry after he finished medical school that there might not be new diseases for him to discover unless he went into the jungle So now I keep the mothers from pestering their kids to death says the pediatrician who has shephered all my friends children to maturity ask about some research that used to interest him Im not really that interested in medicine any more Bob says Its not where my real questions are He tells me of his son with whom he had such problems in the 60s and who is a doctor now and a fundamentalist lay preacher lie refuses to take out malpractice insurance Bob says trusting in Gods will I have tried to follow him in this spiritual thing Its been good for him he seems very sure But I have too `In those marriages of 30odd years there seems to be a lot more equality than the images of womens lib recognize I tell him the torchlight parade for ERA reminded me of his own march all by himself around the courthouse in Peoria when millions were marching in Washington and New York to protest the Vietnam War I think it took more courage to march alone in Peoria But Bob says there is no simple way now to march against the evil to use ones life for the good Still he says Im not ready to quit Are you Theres something ahead some new questions that go beyond all this The next noon before I have to catch my plane back to New York my brother invites me along with Harriet and Parky to lunch with him and his family on the terrace at the country club I tease him saying that he waited to see if they threw toilet paper again But this time the local paper has run a lovely picture of our torchlight parade And now here is my brother once excluded as a Jew daring to invite his blacksheep sister to the country club Surprisingly Harriet whose family was born to membership no longer belongs We drink icy Bloody Marys on the hot sunny terrace high above the Illi nois River I had forgotten how beautiful it is here on this high point of the bluff In his tennis whites Dave Conner the big banker of Peoria today says I waited to say hello to you Betty He admires me  I make history  but he wont help history along as well he could by pulling a few strings for ERA in this crucial state He repeats the lame refrain It will give too much power to the courts Then giving me an affectionate hug he disappears down the steep cliff steps to the swimming pool Ten minutes later up those steps comes a bevy of girls heading for our table wanting to talk to me Daves daughters and nieces Did he send them up or did they just come Whatever the equality I fight for is where they Thus it is no surprise to me the next week in Washington when 100000 women dressed in white flanked by husbands lovers sons march for ERA And when I go to the Hill to see Congressman Tom Rallsback of Illinois to urge extension of the ERA deadline he asks May my daughter Kathy sit in And she does a Peoriatype girl listening as he raises the legislative arguments Igo on to see Bob Michel the minority whip a few years behind me in Peoria High School We discuss the reunion and ERA then he tells me his quandary He loves public life being part of the action of our nation but should he go back to the private sector and make some money I know he wont I recognize our common roots and dedication Back at my hotel the switchboard operator says Kathy Rallsback has been trying to get me What can I do to help says this little revolutionary conspiratorial Illinois voice Two weeks later she and my niece Laurie from Peoria are organizing the sons and daughters of Congress to demand that their dads pass the Equal Rights Amendment and give women equality once and for all The day before the vote in the House the Concerned Children of Congress made an open appeal to their fathers Never before have we the children of Congress stood up as a body to support the passage of any resolution We as a group are not willing to witness the untimely death of an amendment which represents to our generation the responsi billy of social and economic freedom It is from you our mothers and fathers that we learned the significance of equality and Justice for all It is your Job now to safeguard for your children this precious freedom Nearly 80 sons and daughters of representatives from Texas to New Jersey Joined in this appeal On Aug 15 with the House gallery filled with women wearing white and these same Concerned Children the vote was 223 to 189 to give the Equal Rights Amendment three more years for ratification Last month when the Senate also voted to extend the ratification deadline it was considered a political miracle in Washington That miracle came about because NOW brilliantly mobilized the forces of women and labor Congress saved the ERA because it heard from the Peorias everywhere Now my friends back home tell me that the President of the Illinois Senate has vowed to work this month to get rid of the threefifths rule that has prevented the State Legislature from ratifying the ERA Evolution woman and man It plays in Peoria  Headquarters for the class 011508 Peoria High School as sketched in Friedans yearbook Peorias Remarkable Class of 38 so much leadership came out of that class that a recitation of the names sounds like the roll call of directors for a corporation called What Makes Peoria Run
Some Thoughts On Motherhood At the Age of 43,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/19/archives/connecticut-weekly-some-thoughts-on-motherhood-at-the-age-of-43.html,AVING a baby at 43 will probably be my most notable achievement An epic journey Not that I mind After turbulent plunge into the womens lib eration movement in my 30s this new adventure has been met with much more decorum My grandmother would have called it acceptance I am glad I did not have David in my 30s I would not have had the sense to enjoy him Now I see things from much larger perspective I no longer paint objects in black or white but marvel at the subtle shadings the sur prise mixes and blends that give life the enduring quality of old earthernware How can I describe him this son of our middle years who disrupted our lives and challenged our faith goals and ideals He is sturdier and more ro bust than the others as if nature outdid herself like the last magnificent rose when the others have gone You might notice the crease in his chin a Rice trait  Glenn our oldest son inherited it too One of the twins believes David has her eyes a soft graygreen But Davids eyes have tiny specks of brown now they were so very blue before Almost a year has passed Another spring another fall another turning of my world A time to remember and a time to share David is a paradox He is the child of our renewed love the last and least expected Born 15 years after the girls 18 years after our son he is the child who almost wasnt I almost chose abortion It seemed the logical answer No one would have asked why How could one who always had a deep reverence for life an intellectual and spiritual awareness that abortion was an abuse of that life come so close to surrendering that life The answer is as fragmentary yet as complex as the emotional upheaval of pregnancy To define it in simple terms is not easy I deplore the simplistic attitude of many prolife groups because I have never met a woman who did not experience some deep agonizing of soul when body and mind are virtually being torn apart assaulted by an unknown entity not yet regarded as totally precious My child was not yet a living force within me He had fastened to my placenta but not to my soul It would take days even weeks for the transitional stage to be complete Self would undergo a complete metamorphoris as struggled to accept both physically and emotionally the invasion of this little stranger into heart and life This process so necessary and yet practically unmentioned by both sides on the abortion issue cannot be hurried Like the slow methodical process inherent in nature it needed time to grow The first trimester is the most critical time not only for the fetus but for the woman whose body contains the viable child still only a vague yet alarming presence Heart mind and body must be woven together not by exhortations on the wrongness of abortion but by sincere understanding and another listening heart I discovered to my astonishment that many doctors are beginning to assume that women prefer abortion to having a baby They often interpret turmoil as a signal for termination when it is a vital and necessary transition Many younger women have told me that the first question asked by their physician was When do you want the abortion This led to further confusion At such a critical time a woman needs reassurance Because her emotions are often ambivalent she may be coerced into an abortion by mere suggestion by the compelling urgency of making that Our generation has forgotten many things We have forgotten to tell our young to be strong to endure Weve taught them to think of self to make the necessary choices toward the liberation of that self Weve come a long way we tell ourselves But have we My friends cannot believe that I am content with this business of feeding diapering and nurturing my offspring Something must be wrong my critics say A hormone imbalance I am glad that at my age I no longer have to prove anything I can smile and say that my career if it exists at all holds no illusions There is more to life than becoming there is a sense of being They shake their heads when I tell them that I feel like 20 again and that the mysterious element between mother and child has its own rewards have rediscovered that shaping a future world isnt trivial or mundane and should not be left entirely to the guardians of day care centers however noble they might be It is every mothers right and privilege As women we must speak with a sane and collective voice Those of us who write must use that talent wisely Those who speak must speak with clarity If we are given the freedom under the law to choose then we must choose well The issue is far more significant than whether the poor are given the same privilege as the wealthy in terms of abortion the issue is not religious or ethnic It is a moral question on which depends the future of race the wholeness or degeneration of society Although we have learned that freedom has its own demands of responsibility and restraint we are a nation of excesses we reap our moral choice Is our vision blurred in the prevailing philosophy that insists that it is womans right whether to bring to fruition a living embryo Are we viewing life as a curator might view a specimen Do we preceive the womb as test tube for experiment or failure Does life itself hinge on the thin cord of fancy or whim Can an umbilical cord lead to liberation Or shall it be used to bind us Is abortion on demand a virtue or an immoral rectitude of a sick soci ety These are the questions we must ask ourselves What are the consequences of our excesses Recently the senseless slaughter of dolphins by Japanese fishermen under government sanction prompted widespread outrage I am perplexed by all I do not understand how easily we condemn injustice against our environment yet condone that same injustice against our unborn young This paradox is beyond my comprehension Thank the Lord our David is alive and well But what about the other Davids Do we dare hope that somewhere down the line after we have had our fill with the excesses a future generation will provide the necessary technology to support the legacy and legitimacy of all life and the majesty of the human organism Voices in empty wombs are silent They who know our violence are silent They are forever silent  June S Rice is a freelance writer

Massachusetts Is Now Finding a Bit of Mystery in Its New Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/22/archives/massachusetts-is-now-finding-a-bit-of-mystery-in-its-new-governor-a.html,BOSTON Nov 21  What sort of Gov ernorthe voters elected here earlier this month is something of a deepening mystery as Edward J Kings transition team begins the work of transforming a political upheaval into a government Mr King a conservative political outsider unexpectedly seized control of the Democratic Party here from its longdominant liberal wing in a primary campaign that emphasized rightwing causes like capital punishment abortion and crime and was aimed at the partys bitter and disillusioned bluecollar majority Then he ran on a platform calling for tax cuts financed by economic growth unhampered by environmental and governmental restraints and won election even as large segments of the party defected to his slightly less conservative opponent Republican whose highly successful campaign slogan was Ed King Scares Me Since then Mr King a 53yearold former professional football player has IVtreated to a postelection vacation and series of howto seminars for newly elected governors In his absence the head of his transition team Paul Guzzi liberal who is the Secretary of State here has predicted that voters will be in for a pleasant surprise An Uncertain Future That pronouncement raised some doubts about what to expect from Mr King who spent more than a decade as head of the Massachusetts Port Authority putting together a powerful behindthescenes alliance of labor unions contractors banks and public officials that was fueled by huge construction contracts patronage and political favors Mr Kings endorsement of tax and welfare cuts nuclear energy offshore oil drilling highway construction and unbridled growth his reputation as an authoritarianadministrator and infighter unwilling to settle for less than total victory and his overpowering physical size and glaring visage that combine to intimidate most people have created a climate of fear among liberals Those fears were typified by an invitation to an election eve party sponsored by the Energy Policy intormation Center group concerned with environmental issues In the event of a coronation said in a joking reference to Mr King a travel agent will be available to assist in immediate relocation Moves for Party Unity The main body of the Democratic Party reluctantly whipped into line in the interest of party unity by Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and the states senior Democrat joined his campaign in the closing weeks and has now adopted a cautious attitude I want to be fair to the guy  lets wait and see said Barney Frank a State Representative who is often a spokesman for the liberal wing of the party There certainly is a lot of fear out there and there will also be a lot of pressure on Mr King to appoint the wrong kind of people people who see public service as a way to get wealthy without doing a lot of work But the guys just been elected and I dont want to judge him yet Mr King has already taken steps to mollify the liberal wing of the party including leaving his transition government in the hands of Mr Guzzi the Secretory of State The word most frequently used to describe Mr King by friends and foes alike is bulldozer The voters according to Richard Morris the New York polltaker who was hired by Mr King see him as direr an achiever and a strongman A BlueCollar Revolt It was not a liberalconservative thing Mr Morris explained It was a bluecollar revolt The time has passed fur the 1960s style of candidate who essentially said Trust me trust me The people arc upset and they want someone who is as upset as they are and can do something about it now Mr Kings own philosophy was ex pressed in a quotation that hung over his desk at Massport a quasiindependent state agency The quotation from a speech by Winston Churchill reads Never give in Never never never never When Mr King took over Massport in 1963 it was losing money By 1974 it was making money but Mr King the selfstyled Monarch of Massport lost control of the agencys board of directors for the first time and was dismissed Walter Ryan the head of a union of heavy equipment operators said The election of Ed King represents a rollback to the traditional Democratic Party position of being the bread and butter jobsoriented party as opposed to the dominant role that has been played in recent years by the socalled liberals who smothered us with social programs but stifled the economic growth needed to support them A working man isnt worth much without a ob is he asked Mr Ryan The dominant element in the party has been taught a lesson if they perceive it And that is that people ultimately have to make a living That theme is being echoed even by some liberals like United States Representative Michael Harrington a Demo crat who is opposed to Mr King on most of the philosophical issues but nonetheless supported him in the campaign Mr Harrington who retired this year after five terms as one of the most liberal Congressmen Said It comes down to growth and what the Northeast needs is growth and it has suf fered from the lack of it Until we get that we wont deal with the issues found his record of achievement particu Tarty appealing Mr Kings first test will come shortly after taking office in January when he will have to work with the Legislature in devising a budget package that will make good his campaign pledge of a S300 mil lion property tax cut financed by a 10 percent cut in the state budget United Press International Governorelect Edward King
U.S. Cites Illinois in Billing for Ineligible Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/23/archives/us-cites-illinois-in-billing-for-ineligible-abortions.html,WASHINGTON Nov 22 AP  Joseph A Califano Jr the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare accused Illinois today of improperly billing the Federal Government for some 12600 abortions that were not eligible for Federal financing Mr Califano made the charge in an open letter to Gov James R Thompson in which he said the improper billings amounting to more than 1 million had been discovered in a preliminary audit of Illinoiss financing of abortions under the Medicaid program The audit will be completed in 60 to 90 days and will be submitted to the state for comment at that time Mr Califano said The billings if accurate would indi cate that Illinois had billed the Federal Government for more than 1000 times the average number of federally financed abortions in other states The most reliable estimates indicate that since Congress restricted the Federal Governments abortion financing the number of federally financed Medicaid abortions for the poor dropped to an average of less than one a month in each state But Mr Califano said that audits were under way or would soon begin in 11 other states and he ordered a spot check of the remaining states to ensure that the department provides matching funds only for abortions that can legally be funded under Federal law Under the socalled Hyde Amendment funds of the Department of Health Education and Welfare may be used for abortions only if the life of the mother would be endangered by continued pregnancy if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest or if two physicians certify that the womans physical health would suffer severe and longlasting damage if the pregnancy were carried to term The Federal law does not prevent states from continuing to finance abortions for poor women and the states have adopted a variety of laws and regulations to govern the financing of abortions Illinois under court order has continued to finance abortions that would not be eligible for Federal funds but a state is not permitted to bill HEW under such circumstances for the Federal Government s usual share of Medicaid costs The Federal Government pays an average of 55 percent of Medicaid charges around the nation and pays for half of Illinois Medicaid bills Under current Medicaid procedures the department will deduct any overcharges from its next quarterly payment to the state The other states in which abortion billings are being audited but for whom no results are yet in are New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Texas Georgia and Kansas John Blamphin spokesman for the department said similar audits were scheduled to begin soon in Ohio Massachusetts Colorado Washington and California
Letters: On Civil Defense,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/23/archives/letters-on-civil-defense-nonsense-or-need-letters-wage-and-price.html,Nonsense or Need To the Editor The Presidents new civil defense program well deserves the ridicule you employ in your editorial Mr Carters Fallout Biscuits Nov 14 I suggest only that we not overlook the crucial difference between this new program and the silly one undertaken in the Kennedy years The Kennedy program assumed the Russians would strike first at our nu clear missiles causing radioactive clouds to drift over the cities Hence the cities needed fallout shelters The Carter program is the descend ant of a proposal first made by a prominent think tank In the late 1950s If the Soviets misbehaved we would deliver them an ultimatum while evacuating the cities If they disobeyed we would launch a first strike at their missiles then await their weak second strike at our cities We would then return to the cities and repair whatever damage had been incurred Never adopted by Government this old concept included the phrases Country A and Coun try B to distinguish the fleeing ur banites from their countryside hosts It will not be reassuring to the Sovi  ets to indicate to them that we are launching a civil defense effort princi pally compatible with a US strategy of delivering the first nuclear strike The fact that the program is nonsensi cal as demonstrated many years ago by Government agencies that studied the problems of evacuating cities does not overcome the relationship between the program and an unspeakable US policy FREDERICK C THAYER Assoc Prof Graduate School of Public and International Affairs University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Nov 15 1978  To the Editor Your Nov 19 editorial is founded in part on a false assumption The evacu ation plan proposed to be developed by the President is not intended to protect our population from an attack initiated without prior warning Only a shelter plan which the Administration has rejected as too expensive would be useful in such a situation An evacuation plan is designed to provide our President with an impor tant option if we become engaged in an international confrontation with the Russians and they order their cities evacuated in accordance with plans that presently exist At that point our President would have the option of ordering a counterevacuation Perhaps even a wellplanned evacuation would run into difficulties as your editorial states It is very hard to believe however that there would be fewer difficulties if no prior planning whatever had been undertaken Of course there are alternatives to a counterevacuation The President could launch our missiles to prevent the hostage Soviet population from becoming less vulnerable than our own Or we could just sit tight hope that the Russians claims that they will only lose 5 percent of their evacuated and sheltered population in a nuclear exchange are overstated and try not to think about the fact that the Russians have sacrificed at least that many people over the years to maintain internal discipline Or we could simply acquiesce in whatever the Russians happen to be demanding at the time None of these alternatives would appeal to most Americans however ROBERT A LEVETOWN Washington Nov 14 1978 Letters Wage and Price Controls The Roman Lesson To the Editor Some people are now calling for mandatory wage and price controls since it is becoming apparent that be cause of the opposition of certain spe cialinterest groups voluntary con trols to beat inflation are not going to work History however has shown that mandatory controls do not work either AD 300 the Roman Empire was in a situation parallel to ours The total cost of government  local provincial and imperial  had grown tremen dously especially during the last half of the third century by expenditures for defense and foreign wars by the cost of the imperial past and a vast bu reaucracy by the construction of numerous public works by the in creasing cost of public welfare lar gess and public entertainments plus expenditures for education farm re lief public health etc Because of this emperors had de based the currency Silvercoated cop per coins had been issued we have done the same with our dimes quar ters halfdollars and dollars since 1965 and the denarius was worth no more than 150000 of a pound of gold or no more than fourfifths of a cent at the value of gold in 1944 though origi nally the denarius had been worth fourfifths of our 1964 silver quarter Prices had therefore risen sharply throughout the empire while galloping inflation had virtually obliterated the urban middle classes The Emperor Diocletian therefore in 301 issued his famous Edictum de Pretiis Rerurn Venalium which fixed the maximum prices for various items of food clothing and manufactured goods as well as the maximum wages for each type of work Despite the death penalty for violators this edict did not work Many merchants were ruined profiteers sold their commodities on the black market scarcity increased and bloody riots ensued The law was therefore allowed to fall into disuse and it was revoked not long afterward by the Emperor Constantine Since neither mandatory nor voluntary controls work it is obvious that we must attack the causes of inflation We must cut government spending balance the budget and decrease the staggering national debt We must stop the debasing of the currency and stop printing money not backed by silver or gold We must return to a solid silver andor gold standard as was done by Constantine in 324 Constantine made the gold solidus pegged at 72 to the pound of gold and later called the bezant the standard coin and also issued a new silver coin the miliarensis 11000 part of the gold pound The solidus persisted both in the Byzantine Empire and in the medieval West for more than a millennium we need a similar standard ARTHUR KAPLAN Raleigh NC Nov 14 1978 D E Abraham The Most Wasteful Country on Earth To the Editor Prof John H Hens Nov 15 letter expresses concern that the population explosion in the third world may con demn all of mankind to eventual doom But what about the impact of our popu lation The United States is the most waste ful country on earth Although we have less than 6 percent of the worlds peo ple we use about a third of its re sources We produce almost half of the worlds pollution If only 12 percent of the rest of the world used as much in resources per person as we do there would be nothing left for any other peo ple Our impact on the globes lifesup port systems in terms of pollution and resource consumption per person is at least 25 times that of a person in the third world Thus the United States populations effect on the world is equal to that of 5 billion people in the undeveloped countries more than the total population of the earth today Our tremendous wastefulness poses many global dangers in terms of threats to our ecosystems possible cli mate modifications resource scarci ties inflation widespread malnutri tion and energy shortages to name a few Our excessive use of the worlds resources prevents the kind of devel opment necessary to reduce popula tion Increases in the poorer countries Before we blame thirdworld coun tries for current threats to mankind we would do well to take a look at the impact of our way of life in the United States RICHARD H SCHWARTZ Staten Island NY Nov 15 1978 To Cast a Vote Against Somebody To the Editor A great deal has been said about ero sion in the number of people who bother to vote Here is a proposal which would raise the number of voters A voter would cast either a positive or a negative vote For instance when there are two candidates the voter would have four choices for either candidate or against either candidate I believe that the results would re flect a much truer picture of the feel ings of the electorate Negativity and apathy are important political moods which ought to be expressible at the time when the citizen participates through his vote The current arrange ment allows only a positive vote for ei ther candidate or the checking of a none of the above slot But the latter choice while it expresses negativity throws the voter out of the political system Why bother to go to the polls for that when staying away says the same thing Many people might welcome the op portunity to go to the polls and cast a meaningful vote against someone Only politicians who now invariably act as if they had the positive support of the majority of their constituencies when they get elected should fear the change The introduction of the nega tive vote into the polling process might well be the first step in transforming apathy into something better  and at least it could inhibit dangerous misin terpretations for instance a landslide against McGovern was not exactly the mandate for Nixon it seemed to be Our system is in trouble to help pre serve it we may even be forced to adopt solutions which would teach some politicians humility MARTIN WASHBURN New York Nov 12 1978 Realty Confiscation To the Editor Because onerous rent controls have prevented owners from paying real es tate taxes some 38000 more apart ment houses and other properties are being taken over by the City of New York In some cases the city has indicat ed it is turning the buildings over to tenants who are neither trained nor fi nanced sufficiently to run their build ings well Aside from that I must ob ject to what is clearly confiscation First the city imposes such unrealis tic rent controls that many owners must give up their property Then the buildings are handed over to their oc cupants at no cost All this done in the best tradition of a banana republic is nothing less than the legitimizing of squatters rights It may win some votes but this new est wrinkle in city policy  perhaps an inevitable continuation of the policy of 35 years of confiscatory rent controls merely insures acceleration of the housing deterioration and abandon ment that have scarred New York for decades WILLIAM A MOSES Chairman Community Housing Improvement Program Inc New York Nov 19 1978 Of Food Vendors Ambiance and Soap To the Editor As a daily commuter into Manhattan I want to respond to Michael Grosso letter Nov 14 who finds the food vendors in the central business district to be a nuisance It is not the buildings the traffic the shops restaurants or theaters which make New York the exciting city it is It is the people on the street the streetwise entrepreneurs who have the guts talent and drive to hustle an honest buck peddling their wares and filling the streets with music Hot pretzels knishes freshsqueezed orange juice and chestnuts are part of the scene which gives New York City its life and distinctiveness Mr Grosso should recognize the contributions the streetlevel food vendors make to the citys ambiance and count each one a blessing PAUL OBIS Milford Conn Nov 141978  To the Editor No one among those who have complained of the ubiquitous food vendor has concerned himself with the matter of cleanliness in the preparation of food or for that matter in its dispensing for soap and water are not readily available to the street vendor Eating places are subject to inspection and may be closed down if violations exist Should not this procedure be extended also to the food vendor in the street V R JACOBS East Orange NJ Nov 14 1978 On the Right to Life To the Editor A recent news article on the effect of singleissue constituencies on our elec tion results prompts this note The ef fect of the wellorganized antiabor tion movement  the Right to Life or ganization  leads me to hope that we in the various peace movements can count on its support also Did it for example support the right to life of the thousands of Vietna mese peasants to say nothing of sol diers on all sides who died in that con flict Does it join us in opposing the in creasing militarization of our econo my whose only end can be the destruc tion of life I know that those of us who are in the peace movement would wel come its support for peace and the right to life for all peoples on this earth RITA MORGAN New York Nov 16 1978 Statistics of Mali Behind Each Figure a World of Suffering To the Editor Malis Permanent Mission

And this is what I learned Mali Population 58 million Ex tends over an area of 129 million square kilometers Nothing remark able thus far But what follows is frightening Life expectancy at birth 38

gross national product per capita is 100 The external public debt is 376 mil lion equal to 495 percent of Malis gross national product By the year 2000 the population is ex pected to nearly double This then is the grim profile of my neighbor Behind each figure a world of suffering The dark side not of the moon but of the earth I do not mean to belittle Mali Far from it There is a grandeur in its struggle to battle against such odds In the future I will look at my neigh bor through different eyes both as neighbor and as partner For we and they and all the nations of the world must together

Poll Finds New Legislators Moderate,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/24/archives/poll-finds-new-legislators-moderate-little-change-on-the-issues.html,With tax cuts as their goal and pragmatism as their political banner the new members of the New York State Legislature  like their counterparts in the new Congress in Washington  are a moderate group who will spend most of their time worrying about the local problems of the communities they represent according to interviews with newly elected legislators conducted by The New York Times The standpat nature of the new Legislature is underlined by the apparent failure of deathpenalty advocates to muster the votes they will need to override Governor Careys expected veto of any measure to reestablish capital punishment in New York State The interviews disclosed that although supporters of the death penalty will almost certainly win at least twothirds of the State Senates votes  thus giving them enough support there to overcome the Governors veto  they areapparently two to three votes short of that margin in the State Assembly And on another controversial issue opponents of Medicaid financing of abortions appear to have gained three votes in the Assembly but have lost two to three in the Senate This would would not change the balance of opinion on the issue in either house The most striking fact about the new legislators is how similar in attitude they are to their predecessors  hardly surprising since most of the 36 freshmen won their seats by replacing retiring members and not by defeating incumbents The interviews also revealed the following Mike their counterparts in the United States Congress the 10 freshmen Senators and 26 new Assembly members are almost unanimous in their advocacy of tax cuts though they disagree on whether the biggest cuts should be made in income sales or property taxes In accordance with a longestablished political tradition almost all the new legislators are lawyers or businessmen though one of them is a 67yearold community activist from Brooklyn and another is a handicapped veteran of the Vietnam war And there will be three more women in the Assembly and two in the Senate Many have already had Albany experience working on the staffs of legislators or legislative committees As a group the new legislators are in the upper middle class with incomes ranging from 30000 to 40000 a year Most favor legalized casino gambling but many of those favoring gambling said they would not want casinos in their districts Many of the new legislators are undecided on the issue About half said they expected to make the Legislature their only job confirming a trend toward a fulltime Legislature Nearly twothirds said they would oppose a salary increase for legislators of to  pose an increase said that they thought the legislators needed one but that they would oppose it mainly to satisfy angry constituents Collectively the new legislators are more conservative than the Legislature as a whole This however does not reflect an ideological shift among voters but rather that many of the newcomers are from Republican districts and are replacing equally conservative incumbents Although the death penalty played major part in one of the most closely watched campaigns this year  the Brooklyn contest which saw Assemnbly Speaker Stanley Steingut upset by a political unknown Murray Weinstein  the other changes have left the overall balance on the issue virtually unchanged In the Senate last year the death penalty received 39 votes  only one short of the margin needed to override Mr Careys veto That vote could have been cast by the late Bernard Gordon Westchester County Republican who favored the death penalty but was too ill to appear in Albany at the time of the vote Mr Gordons successor Assemblwoman Mary B Goodhue favors the death penalty and will thus provide the decisive 40th vote In the Assembly though there appears to be virually no change Last year 94 Assemblymen voted to send a deathpenalty bill to Governor Careys desk with three others who did not vote on the bill then apparently committed to supporting overriding Mr Careys veto Unless Assemblymen who opposed the death penalty last year have changed their minds the death penalty now appears to have only 96 sure votes Two of the new Assembly members Rhoda S Jacobs of Brooklyn and Andrew Jenkins of Queens say they are undecided on the issue Mrs Jacobs says she is leaning against the death penalty while Mr Jenkins resolutely declines to commit himself Another Assemblyman who did not vote on the death penalty last year Paul Harenberg of Long Island said in an interview last week that he had opposed the death oonaltv in the past and would probably do so again this year The Assemblys leading advocate of the death penalty Victor Graber DemocratConservative of Seneca said he had not yet conducted his own survey of members and therefore did not dispute the vote count But he expressed confidence that he would eventually muster at least 99 commitments for the death penalty If were at a solid 99 Mr Graber said that puts an awful lot of people in an awfully bad position Ile said he believed that Mr Steinguts defeat might put New York City Democrats who opposed the death penalty in an uncomfortable position The issue of Medicaidfinanced abortions tied up approval of the states budget last year with the Republicancontrolled State Senate against and the Assembly voting for Medicaidfinanced abortions While the shifts in the newly elected Legislature do not appear to be enough to change the position of either legislative body on the abortion issue they appear to guarantee closer votes in both chambers Last year the Senate voted 32 to 23 to cut off Medicaid financing for abortions The vote in the Assembly was 81 to 6i against cutting off funds
Liberal Leaders Acting to Revive Party's Strength,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/24/archives/liberal-leaders-acting-to-revive-partys-strength-questions-on.html,The Liberal Party  facing the ignominy of a possible defeat by the amateurs of the RighttoLife Party at the official New York State vote count in midDecember  has begun a series of private talks about how to revive the considerable power it once wielded Leaders of the little party which used to have a decisive impact on the decisions of the Democrats are discussing  How to loosen their domination by Governor Carey a Democrat who has got the Liberals to do his bidding in two straight elections  The role of Raymond B Harding the strong man in the partys new collective leadership  Their dwindling registration and vote a problem they share with the other New York parties  Even the possibility of changing the partys name Failure and fortune are an ebb and flow Mr Harding said philosophically to a visitor at the partys offices on West 46th Street the other day Numbers are not all there is to the Liberal Party James Notaro the executive director added pragmatically But the likelihood that the RighttoLifers a party fashioned by political amateurs in a kitchen in Merrick LI have polled more votes for Governor than those cast for Mr Carey on the Liberal line  a symbolic comedown of massive dimensions  focused politicians attention on the Liberals fortunes The Liberals problems actually started with the death late in 1976 of Alex Rose the political master who by using the power to confer or withhold the partys ballot line exerted influence upon candidates platforms and patronage far beyond what would have been commanded by the partys vote The question really is said one official can we survive without a genius Mr Rose helped sponsor Mr Careys successful comefrombehind candidacy in 1974 but since then the Governor has looked to many politicians like the main maneuverer with the Liberals supporting his choice for Mayor of New York City Mario M Cuomo in 1977 and the whole Democratic state slate this year Mr Carey was abetted by Mr Harding a forceful Bronx politician who soon moved into command of the collective leadership that the party proclaimed after Mr Roses death I think the partys in very healthy shape Mr Harding said in the conversation at the Liberal headquarters Lets look at the numbers They showed a drop to 93000 in statewide enrollment and a 1978 vote of about MAO just almve or just below the RighttoLife total the two parties are neck and neck in the unofficial tallies that are all anyone has to go with now The vote was only a bit more than half what the Liberal line pulled for Mr Carey four years earlier On the other hand his overall margin shrank by some 700000 so that even while winning he fell further back among Democrats than he did among Liberals Mr Harding glanced now and then at numberfilled sheet and said he was not unhappy with what he read As he assessed the returns the Liberals had shared in a general shrinkage of the overall vote And they had sacrificed some chance of luring voters to their line by endorsing the whole Democratic ticket instead of deviating on one candidate or another to differentiate the two parties So he said  although he suggested that the official count still might show the Liberals in fourth place behind the Democrats Republican and Conservativesit would be understandable if the singleissue people of the RighttoLife movement had polled more for Governor It is a partys total vote for Governor that determines its place on the New York ballot Were wouldbe Senate candidates sounding out the Liberals about the chance of getting their line in 1980 Yes Mr Harding said Could the decision be made independent of the influence of Governor Catey who put Mr Harding on his official payroll as special assistant and Mr Hardings wife on the Urban Development Corporation payroll as personnel director Mr Notaro broke in Mr Harding had wanted to get out of that state job he said but party leaders happy at his ready access to the Governor had insisted that he stay Politicians have observed Mr Careys considerable powers of persuasion with interest Its hard to believe said Mr Cuomo that the Liberals would have endorsed me for Mayor except for Governor Careys influence On the other hand he suggested both in the unsuccessful effort to elect him last year and the successful merger with the Democratic ticket this year it could be argued that the interests of the Liberals and of the Governor simply coincided In the state election Mr Notaro noted the Liberals had achieved what they wanted  the reelection of Mr Carey When politicians all over America were trimming their positions to poll results he said Mr Carey had stood firmly on principle for abortion and against capital punishment two Liberal party positions The view of Mr Carey as a moral monument towering above the political landscape was one that had eluded many New York politicians On the other hand a bad guess can be costly to a party no matter how pure its motivation In the mayoral election for instance the wrong guess on Mr Cuomo was followed by the election of Edward I Koch a politician with a long memory for those who have not been nice to him The result some City Hall inhabitants say has been a pruning from the payroll of Liberals who had been wily enough to survive Abraham D Beames term after the John V Lindsay years in which Liberal support was looked on as an express ticket to a city job
The Unlikely Beginning Of the Right to Life Party,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/25/archives/the-unlikely-beginning-of-the-right-to-life-party-they-form-a-cadre.html,MERRICK LI Nov 22  Abortion a terrible thing someone in the book discussion group at Diane Arrigans house said one day and the other women there agreed that something ought to be done The results have been awesome The Right to Life Party born of that impromptu discussion nine years ago appears to have outpolled the longestablished Liberals in this years election and without a doubt has won status as a regular party with a regular line on the New York State ballot Now the book the partys leaders are studying contains the New York election law and professional politicians are watching them with some nervousness Well start organizing as soon as the state officially certifies us said Ellen McCormack who ran for President of the United States in 1976 They Form a Cadre Everybodys asking us how they can sign up as members said Mary Jane Tobin who got 120000 or so votes for Governor of New York this year That was more unofficial counts indicate than the Liberals got for Governor Carey Now were just a skeleton group Mrs Tobin said Like Ellen and I are the top But were learning said Mrs McCormack Were only on Page 20 of the election book Two pleasant middleaged women dressed in blouses and slacks they sat on a couch in Mrs Tobins living room and talked calmly of their plans to force politicians from the top to the bottom of the major party ticketsto go on record on the troublesome topic of abortion Calm and conversational old friends from the bookdiscussion group they talked as if they were planning an election for the Merrick ParentTeachers Association or the Cure of Ars parish Rosary Altar Society Except for the little poster propped against the divider between the kitchen and the dining alcove  it had a small sketch of the partys symbol a baby in its mothers womb  there was nothing to distinguish the place from any other neatly kept suburban home But no matter how incongruous seemed this was a genuine political center Mrs McCormack Mrs Tobin and their friends had proven their ability to affect majorleague politics I think we had an impact this year said Mrs McCormick We certainly didnt help Duryea Mrs Tobin nodded He counted on a big Long Island vote she said and we took away part of it They and other antiabortion groups around the country will continue trying to pressure legislators to bring about a national Constitutional convention that would write a righttolife amendment they said Probably more important to New Yorkers who plan to run for office this RighttoLife Party intends to insist upon being told how all candidates stand on abortion Even say someone running for an office that would seem to have no relevance to the issue A local tax assessor some job like that Both nodded grimly Issue Called Overriding The issue is overriding said Mrs Tobin Disqualifying said Mrs McCormack You never know where a candidate going to go Mrs Tobin added The women are interested they said in next years election for Suffolk County Executive But like the other parties whose roster they are joining they look upon the comparative campaign calm of 1979 as a respite for the most part that will permit organizational work Forming a state committee registering members so there will be someone to sign nominating petitiong things like that Mrs McCormack and Mrs Tobin are Roman Catholics and registered Democrats but they insisted that their party will be drawn from all sorts of sources Well take everybody said Mrs McCormack As long as theyre prolife said Mrs Tobin It was mostly among Catholics that the antiabortion movement sprang up around the country partly in reaction to the Unite States Supreme Courts ruling that legalized abortions Mrs McCormack and Mrs Tobin say their group has no official church support  certainly no financial help they say ruefully  and they started earlier when legalization of abortion cropped up as a major issue in the Legislature in Albany Brought up in New York City both women had been involved in school and neighborhood activities since their move to the suburbs but never in politics Mrs Tobin who is 46 years old retired from nursing recently after 21 years She and her husband James a vice president at Johnson  Higgins have three children Mrs McCormack 52 has four children and two greatgrandchildren Her husband Francis retired last year as a deputy police inspector in New York City They and other friends decided informally a decade or so ago  one brought along this friend and One brought along another and soon there were about a dozen meeting weekly  to get together and talk about books philosophy whatever I dont remember what book we were discussing that day at Dianes house Mrs McCormack said Thats Diane Arrigan She was Mary Janes campaign manager But I remember that someone said they had seen something on the TV about the move to legalize abortion We never felt we were going to be involved Mrs Tobin took up the story We thought our legislators would take care of it But they didnt We found very early that its in politics that the big decisions are made So we decided to run our own candidates And said Mrs McCormack cheerfully were still doing it This year they said convinced that the major parties both would put up candidates for Governor who would support legal abortion and convinced too said Mrs Tobin that most New Yorkers are prolife they ran her And it just steamrolled said Mrs McCormack The day before electionI just knew we were going to get more than the 50000 votes that would entitle us to a regularparty line The antiabortion movement is one that opponents depict as infested by hoteyed zealots opposed to the rights of women but the two New York leaders say quietly that just as they are concerned about abortions they are concerned too about the physical and psychological troubles that confront the mothers

farcically but depending on the beholder the result might be interpreted as exploitation or sensationalism or mere titilation There are the borderline cases certainly but television is generally clearcut in its intentions In a tale about a prison farm for women for example there can be no doubt about ulterior motives when the voluptuous inmates traipse about like jiggly Daisy Mae dolls in skimpy Dogpatch togs On the other hand Born Innocent despite the inclusion of a controversial rape scene offered a serious exploration of conditions in a reform home for young women Treatment it seems is virtually everything and is increasingly crucial as televisions sex preoccupations continue to accelerate Recent weeks have been clogged with representative examples Bigbudget miniseries  CBSs The Word and The Pirate or ABCs Pearl  have had their standard quotas of bed hopping and kinky implications but the more interesting premises and variations are being developed for ordinary television movies Titles can be almost pantingly contrived NBCs Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery was about a woman who after her husband is accidentally paralyzed from the waist down ponders the possibility of extramarital affairs After some heavy experimenting with a professional golfer she decided on a future dedicated to fidelity Some nice performances including Louise Fletchers as the wife made the Calder Willingham script seem considerably less opportunistic than it was On ABC the dreadful title of How To Pick Up Girls was given to a light comedy that managed to be surprisingly charming about the singleminded pursuits of swinging types in Manhattan Once again the performances particularly those of Fred McCarren and Bess Armstrong proved strong assets In a single week NBC managed a tripleplay in the new game of sex themes Monday night featured Betrayal in which Lesley Ann Warren played the vulnerable woman in a true story about a psychiatrist luring his patient into a sexual relationship Tuesday found Dyan Cannon as Sally Stanford madame of a San Francisco brothel in Lady of the House And in a clever twist Friday had Elizabeth Taylor in Return Engagement as an older college professor in a special relationship with a student Joseph Bottoms The affair in this case was never consummated leaving everything in a constant state of trembling expectation And then there is homosexuality which frequently seems to be little more than a failsafe gimmick for attracting attention Innumerable mincing types have flitted through countless situation comedies Actionadventure formats are strewn with scenes in gay bars in which the hero in search of the villain has to interview various outlandish characters At the other extreme a more enlightened approach was attempted several years ago in That Certain Summer and the characters played by Hal Holbrook and Martin Sheen were elevated to something resembling sainthood More recent efforts have been more effective The British production of The Naked Civil Servant had the courage of Quentin Crisps insistently nonconforming ways And Word Is Out a WNETfinanced collection of interviews with a wide spectrum of homosexuals presented their liberated views of themselves candidly and without apology If male homosexuals have had a bumpy ride in television entertainment lesbians have generally been treated with an ignorance When not lurching around toughly in somebodys conception of a butch dyke they are likely to be menacingly psychopathic The classic TV example had several sadistic women running an old age home and murdering the patients to collect their insurance Tonights A Question of Love in some ways goes to the other extreme becoming the lesbian equilavent of That Certain Summer Given the television record however the resulting exaggerations are not only justified but necessary The screenplay by William Blinn Brians Song episodes of Roots is based on an actual case in which the former husband of a lesbian sued for child custody on the ground that she was automatically an unsuitable mother The dramas court proceedings are based on the actual proceedings of the case As the story begins Linda Ray is moving in with her lover Barbara Linda Ray has two sons teenaged David and young Billy Barbara has a daughter in her early teens The new family seems reasonably happy except for David who is disturbed by his mothers relationship with another woman He discovers that they have joint bank accounts and share several other things Finally he asks her directly if she is a lesbian Linda Ray who has never lied to him says Yes I am  me and Barbara we just care for each other its just as simple as that As for the failure of her marriage to his father It just died in its sleep No one was to blame7 The troubled David then goes to visit his father and refuses to return to his mother She is convinced the reason is because the father has bought him a new car Later though the father sues for custody of his other son and David stays on his fathers side Linda Ray is taken to court Barbara is publicly involved and remains loyal while realizing that it could mean nothing or it could mean our jobs  everything Linda Ray is forced to confront lawyers who are either sexual bigots or afraid of controversy Her case is taken by a young malefemale team She is interviewed by psychiatrists who are either hostile Do you worry about war a lot or timid about testifying for an unpopular cause Even before the trial begins she is telling Barbara I wish to hell I had never met you  all Id be is a divorced woman Warnings that the trial will be rough turn out to be understated In its unabashed sympathy for Linda Ray the script takes overly calculated liberties with what it chooses to include and exclude Once again virtual saintliness is courted as Linda Ray and Barbara superbly played by Gena Rowlands and Jane Alexander are portrayed as uncommonly sensitive people whose decency and intelligence are seemingly incomparable They are carefully portrayed as reasonable moderates unwillingly caught between the extremes of Biblethumping critics and hysterical gay activists The womens warm affection for each other is made quite clear as physical contact is kept to the barest minimum Conversely the character of the husband played by Clu Gulager is parceled out sparingly and is too vaguely defined With little known about him at the beginning he seems like a strong formidable adversary However in crossexamination at the trial he turns out to be a quite ordinary airlines mechanic with a rather pathetic record He once broke his wifes nose in a fight he was found driving intoxicated and finally he paid for an abortion performed on an 18yearold he thought he might have made pregnant On top of this the screenplay makes only brief passing reference to an earlier hearing in which David the older son opted voluntarily to reside with his father Nevertheless A Question of Love is a serious exploration of a complex issue If it treads a bit too timidly at key points it also avoids cheap sensationalizing The film is provocative and finally very moving Directed by Jerry Thorpe the cast is outstanding As Linda Ray Miss Rowlands is at once marvelously strong and vulnerable Shes weary and determined miserable and elated Miss Alexanders Barbara is direct and unaffected almost searingly on target Once again on television the subject is directly related to sex but once again the treatment is admirably on target A Question of Love is preceded by an announcement that due to subject matter parental discretion is advised Richard Benjamin hi Arthur Millers first TV play

JOURNEY TO ESRIAL AND EGIPT,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/journey-to-israel-and-egypt-journey.html,The habit of enmity dies hard and it may be true as an Israeli acquaintance recently quipped that a swift peace settlement would have been an insult to 30 years of conflict Even now when dinnerparty Parents of a slain soldier grieve during the Yom Kippur War Peace with Egypt presents risks to Israelis haunted by such memories conversations in Cairo and Jerusalem revolve joyfully around the prospect of open borders there is still a good deal of wariness  a mood that is perceived in both cities as one of pessimistic optimism The Israelis I spoke with believe that in agreeing to a peace treaty with Egypt theyare taking a terrible risk The Egyptians feel that not nearly enough is being done about the claims of their fellow Arabs They continue to analyze each others motives with reserve it not quiet distrust On a recent trip through Israel and Egypt I inquired closely into their respective rationales The one point on which they are truly united is a profound concern for the health and safety of President Anwar elSadat They worry about what would happen to the precarious peace without the clearly good will of the Egyptian President Ever since Sadat made his initial visit to Jerusalem last November the informed moderates of both countries have clutched at the prospect of peace But even these moderates concede that the bitter memories spanning three decades of hostility cannot be obliterated by signatures on a document They agree that it will take a long time before the reflex of fear is stifled Reproach runs on The Egyptian voices to which I listened were soft even in recalling grievances We have lived for 30 years with the fear of Israeli aggression a welleducated Cairene told me in a tone of gentle petulance It will take time to believe in Israeli friendship to discover we can really coexist with them The Israeli voices had more edge to them Yes we are making peace with Sadat a prosperous Jerusalemite told me challengingly But what will become of IsraeliEgyptian peace it anything happens to him We are still 35 million Jews here surrounded by 100 million Arabs The PLO has not withdrawn its threats of totally extinguishing us There were other voices In Cairo there was the voice of a gendemannered young woman who still has nightmares about the ferocity of Israels military might Every Egyptian welcomes peace How could we not But separate peace between Israel and Egypt is not the perfect solution Egypt is not the whole Arab world and the Israelis could still attack those who surround us  and smash them And of course that would threaten us And of course we do not know who will be Sadats successor Zeinab Taha nicknamed Zizi is a 22yearold college student who says her views are pretty much those of her Cairene peer group most of whom have ardently supported Sadats peace initiative from the beginning When she was 10 Zizi was terrified by an Israeli reconnaissance plane that zoomed past her familys villa shattering every window in the neighborhood She told me her story as we sailed on the Nile in a felucca hired by a mutual friend to give my husband and me the obligatory scenic view of Cairo The water was pale and smooth and inviting treacherously so there was no hint of the lethal bilharzia parasite that lurks along the Niles sluggish banks and in its many canals The sun was setting spectacularly through a haze of pollution from too many cars and from the gnawing desert dust On the shore men and women dressed in Western clothes as well as in the flowing galabia were filling the outdoor cafes for the cocktail hour It was a tranquil moment but Zizi shuddered as she recalled this traumatic episode from her childhood Ill never forget people running through the house screaming that there was a war I hid under the bed with my younger sisters I was sure we would all die Today though still wary her fear has abated somewhat We can forget in time she says smiling sweetly In Israel there was the voice of a selfmade welltodo flower farmer named Rafi Horowitz haunted by a boyhood memory of terror I hope very much the peace will hold And I hope it will be taken as an opening by Jordan and some of the other Arab countries to negotiate with us Sadat has done a very couragenus act but we are still in danger We talk of nothing else M Israel these days We are making peace with all good intentions but we are taking terrible chances It scares us the risks we are taking I stood with Horowitz atop a hill on the West Bank of the Jordan facing the settlement known as the Etzion block This hill was black with Arabs on that day in May 30 years ago he said gesturing all around him His voice was hoarse with emotionThere were thousands of them It was like an attack of Indians in your Wild West We had received word to stand and defend our village and we knew it was the end The children were evacuated We told ourselves this would be a new Masada  we would be allowed to die for Israel Horowitz was describing the destruction of his village and all but four of its 100 inhabitants in 1948 when he was 17 He was one of the survivors In 1948 the Etzion block was a cluster of four frontier villages built on land bought by the Jewish National Fund about 20 miles south of Jerusalem 1 listened with gooseflesh to Horowitzs tale of carnage and to his description of the death of his mother an eye doctor who was slaughtered In a medical convoy en route to a hospital on Mount Scopus Horowitz wounded hid in a ditch overnight and was taken captive next morning by Arab legionnaires He spent the following year as a war prisoner In the dry heat under a blazing earlymorning sun the land lay baked in prairie beauty and it was very still but it was not tranquil Horowitz reliving the battle made me hear the Arab war cry Aleihoum backed by the garglechant of the Arab women egging their men on to battle In an aside half bitter and half mocking he mentioned that the women were more bloodthirsty than their men There is an Arab woman even today quite well known who writes songs about eating the livers of Israeli soldiers he said The sons and daughters of the settlers massacred in 1948 have returned now and they plan to stay These settlements are a vital line of defense in the West Horowitz declaimed We are still in Masada state We are few we are isolated We must show the Arabs that the destruction of Israel is not feasible We must make no easy agreements to nourish their hopes I was better informed as are most Americans about the evolution of beleaguered Israel than I was about the heartbreaking evolutionary efforts of modern Egypt Encountering both cultures in quick succession I found it hard to believe that the Israelis and the Egyptians could have fallen into enmity Not only are they fused in antiquity  sharing even the biblical patriarch Abraham  but they have common attitudes about the closeness of family ties the profound influence of religion the fierceness of national pride and they both are sturdily devoted to their difficult climate and their dramatic treacherous topography Both even use the same Arabic word khamsin to describe their brutal desert wind A number of Egyptians I met acknowledged that they did feel an undefined sense of kinship with Jews although they are mystified by them The Jews were evicted by Nasser 22 years ago  wrongly some now feel  and while there are still a few left they live on the edges of Egyptian society The Israelis on the other hand have something over one million nonEgyptian Arabs in what they regard as their own backyard meaning after the Sinai has been relinquished  the West Bank the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem Many Israeli Jews have grown up side by side with Arabs and some have continuing friendships with them Even those Arabs though would like nothing better than for the Israelis to leave the occupied areas The ubiquitous and wellequipped Israeli soldiers are at their edgiest in the Arabpopulated villages of the West Bank On back roads there Arab children spit at your car but that is mild In one or two of the more militant Arab strongholds you might even be stoned as you drive through Private Israeli citizens sometimes carry submachine guns into the West Bank  mostly the compact Israelimade Uzi But all the security precautions in the world cannot stop a terrorist determined to attack I visited the survivor of one such attack at her home in a fashionable suburb of Tel Aviv called HerzliahonSea She is Israels leading actress Hanna Martin As a child she played one of Peter Lorres murder victims in M On Feb 10 1970 she was sitting in the Munich airport on her way to London to test for the role of Goldie in Fiddler on the Roof Suddenly I heard running steps on the tile she recalled I turned and there was a young man standing there lie was holding something in his hands but I remember looking only at his face his eyes I thought were very beautiful Later I realized that the look was hatred The last thing she remembers with any clarity is hearing the man speak This is an attack Were going to kill you She has a semicoherent memory of the hospital emergency room in Munich where she was gripped by a sense of desperate professional mortality She kept saying Im an actress Im an actress you must save me Hanna Marons left leg was amputated She spent five months in Munich undergoing surgical repairs and rehabilitation I had known of her injury before I met her and I marveled at the springiness of her walk when she greeted me Later she hiked up her long blue denim skirt to show me on her good leg where the amputation had been performed I didnt think I would come back as quickly or as thoroughly as I did she said But my husband didnt give me time to despair Another thing that helped was the sacks of letters from young soldiers who had been wounded While still in the Munich hospital she was asked to participate in an anniversary celebration of the Habimah Theater in Tel Aviv and her husband Yakov Rechter the Israeli architect said Of course youll accept I cant even go to the toilet on my own she protested Nevertheless wearing what she called a terrible contraption she did appear on the stage fur the celebration I stood up and did a soliloquy from Schillers Mary Stuart and sang a song from Brecht Since then she has not only sung but danced on stage It is a special kind of Israeli triumph There is a special kind of Israeli stoicism tar Israelis call it the Masada complex The partially restored Masada fortress really a fortified village atop a steep rock mountain Is for all Israelis a terribly poignant landmark Every Israeli has made at least one pilgrimage to this site of the Jews last hopeless stand against the Romans in AD 73 Exploring the ruins I stumbled onto a group of hardy sunbaked children gathered in an oasis of shade listening to a woman who was speaking to them in Hebrew They were celebrating their bar mitzvahs  10 girls and 12 boys all of them just turned 13 The woman addressing them was Irit Hauben a 27yearold teacher from a hotly disputed threeyearold settlement about 70 miles to the west near the Gaza Strip called Yamit hit Hauben a secondgeneration sabra is married to a farmer named Yochana and they have yearold twins The Haubens chose to help settle Yamit because they are both committed nationalists I sat for a while with the students accepting their offer of chilled grape juice and listened with them as their teacher spoke of the message of Masada of its fighttothedeath significance in presentday Israel She read  from Flavius Josephus  parts of the oration given by Eleazar ben Yair to the 960 besieged defenders of the stronghold  My loyal followers long ago we resolved to serve neither Romans nor anyone else but God It is evident that daybreak will end our resistance but we are free to choose an honorable death with our loved ones Let our wives die unabused our children without knowledge of slavery after that let us do each other an ungrudging kindness preserving our freedom as a gloriThe bar mitzvah children were enraptured The Diaspora was etched in their faces darkskinned and blackeyed fairhaired and hazeleyed a couple of redheads Some wore Tshirts with English writing We walk as one I take my students on many trips frit Hauben explained in somewhat halting English I teach them a little religion and a lot of history It renews the spirit of fight Her voice was mild but her blue eyes were defiant She did not look much older than her pupils She wore her blond hair in a ponytail her light skin was freckled her turnedup nose sunburned She was dressed in shapeless jeans and a skimpy white Tshirt Casually slung over hit Haubens right shoulder was an Uzi The presence of guns is only one of the constant reminders that Israel is if no longer at war with Egypt effectually still at war with her other Arab neighbors For us the problem is how to maneuver how to keep a sense of balance under the state of siege an army captain told me There are wrecks of tanks and skeletons of other vehicles  including the tourist bus blown up on the road to Tel Aviv a few months ago  left as deliberate reminders There are unexpected roadblocks where you undergo unexplained security checks I was impressed but I asked the captain how good he really thought security was The country is not hermetically sealed he said shrugging No official policy has yet been announced for screening out possible terrorists in the anticipated tourist flow from Egypt It is expected though that the Egyptians themselves will take stringent security measures to safeguard the Israelis Meanwhile the borders are hedged by heavy barbed wire At dawn one day near Jericho I watched Israeli soldiers carefully rake smooth the sandy soil on their side of the Jordan River The soil is checked periodically for footprints One of the tightest and most depressing examples of the security check takes place daily in a barren patch of land on the Israeli side of the Allenby Bridge At 830 on a Monday morning I sat in the mottled shade of a camouflage net outside the huge recently constructed shed that serves as a waiting room for those wishing to cross from Israel to Jordan  and as a kind of Ellis Island for Arabs wishing to cross into Israel Since the establishment of the socalled open bridge policy shortly after the 1967 war there has been a brisk trade between the two sides of the river About two dozen trucks cross daily via the bridge carrying produce and other commodities oranges from Gaza bananas from Jericho rocks from Hebron there is a building boom now in Amman I was escorted by an army jeep to the post guarding the entrance to the bridge My first reaction was astonishreacher I rit Hauben an Uzi machine gun slung from her shoutter leads her students through the ruins of the Masada fortress ment the Jordan River was skinny and brackish and the bridge made of rickety planks looked like something constructed with a Tinkertoy set It thundered and swayed under the trucks and buses I walked to the middle of the bridge An Arab was just coming from the Jordan side to place a bundle of that days Jordanian newspapers on the railing at exactly the halfway point  it would be collected by one of the Israeli sentries Later in the day Arab newspapers from Jerusalem would be dropped in the same way for collection by a Jordanian sentry If any kind of military or diplomatic problem arises the soldiers hail each other and meet amicably in the middle of the bridge A less than amicable process is undergone by visiting Arabs open bridge does not preclude caution They sit in the holding shed wrapped up in their long robes and their resentment waiting to be searched for weapons The Arabs of Israel are naturally upset by the suspicion with which visiting Arabs are treated and even more upset by the way they themselves are sometimes made to feel like dangerous usurpers of a land they believe to be rightfully theirs A sophisticated Arab I met in Jerusalem told me Israeli civilians who go to the West Bank are afraid that is why they carry guns They should be afraid They should stay away the settlements are wrong Yet this same man  Mahmud Abu Zalaf the owner and editor of the East Jerusalem Arab daily Al Quds  believes that the Israelis will give up the West Bank one day Meanwhile though he chooses to he angry about what he views as the sadistic attitude of some of the Israeli occupiers Mr Zalaf was born in Jolla and has lived in Jerusalem since 1949 He is a tall heavyset imposing man with a square face dark hair and a toothbrush mustache  not one would think a man easily intimidated Not long ago he said I was driving to Tel Aviv I do not stop at checkpoints unless someone tells me to It was half past II in the morning I went through and they waved me down and told me I would have to stay where I was until 4 in the afternoon because I did not stop We had a hot argument A girl soldier came She said to the other soldier I want to punish him He said to her Hes a journalist he will write about it Finally they let me go How they treat you depends on their mood In Jordan the police are always polite Mr Zalafs contemptuous reference to a girl soldier was restrained He was bored when I asked him about womens opportunities in Arab Israel I dont know much about this he said and seemed puzzled when I inquired if among the 100 members of his newspapers staff there were any women There is a secretary he said impatiently The traditional Arab subjugation of women is one means by which the Arab population of Israel is proliferating Projections of the birth rate indicate that within the next three decades Palestinian Arabs will greatly outnumber the Israelis In addition to their lower birth rate the Israelis have been suffering lately from a drop in immigration All this coupled with the currently increasing grip on the country of religious orthodoxy makes itself felt in a heavyhanded social pressure on Israeli women to marry and produce children marriage excuses a woman from serving her otherwise mandatory twoyear military service after high school This emphasis is understandable from the states point of view but it is distressing to some of Israels unmarried females  particularly those who have immigrated from the more open societies of the Western world women who are interested in careers and in men who sympathize with their aims Young Israeli men were described to me by the unmarried women I met as conceited sexually arrogant and indifferent to female aspiration other than wifehood and motherhood Their idea of giving a girl a marvelous time on a date one young woman told me is to buy her a cup of coffee and then make love to her in a car Lesley Hazleton arrived in Israel from England when she was 20 and has over the last 12 years become a militant feminist She maintains that the image of the strong Israeli female working and fighting alongside the Israeli male has from the beginning been a myth In a recently published book she says that Israeli women have always played a subsidiary role and been regarded as essentially unequal She struck a nerve not only with her book but with comments she made in connection with promoting it  and also by being who she is an intelligent ambitious unmarried woman of 32 who announced publicly that she had no plans to marry and did not want children While Western women take the limitations on their freedom hard even the unmarried sabras are apt to balk The nativeborn daughter of two educated urban Israelis went to the United States to study to be a cantor She thought wed be shocked her father said but we told her we were delighted with her choice of career Of course I wouldnt set foot in a synagogue that had a female cantor He is the kind of man who asks why there has never been a female chess Amnion and his wife offers I read an article saying women tire intellectually faster than men she believes it Israeli society does not discourage a woman once she has married and had children from having a career and equal financial status with men  if she can manage it The married women 1 met concurred in this view  or felt impelled out of chauvinism to pretend that they did One such woman in her late 30s deliberately set aside all thought of a promising career as a painter in order to raise her children Now that the youngest has reached 10 she has gone back to her painting We are beyond womens liberation she says loftily But there are conflicts One of the first works she produced after her selfimposed dedication to motherhood was a vivid montage of howling clutching little children which she candidly admitted was wrung from the depths of 10 years suppressed artistic creativity Endurance under trial is a universally acknowledged Jewish characteristic During the early days of the peace negotiations when the Egyptians in their frustration called the Israelis intransigent the Israelis just dug their heels in a little deeper To a people such as the ancient Jews who could survive 40 years of wandering the desert intransigence is a way of life The Israeli character is still subject to the mystical tug of the desert I flew over the West Bank and the Negev and Sinai deserts in a small Americanbuilt helicopter piloted by an Israeli Air Force lieutenant who looked about 16 In fact he was 22 and had been in the Army five years No one in the military is permitted to give his last name to a civilian the pilot was simply Gideon We flew over alternating patches of green velvet cotton corn great whorls of gray stone like the thumbprints of a giant  strands of an and black roadway broken by the dark brown patches of roadworks and the artificial green squares and oblongs of archeological digs Then over the green line marking the 1967 border that divides the old cultivated Israeli land from the thinly developed Arab area  there are however more and more signs of emerging Arab development and knowhow We passed over a recent Jewish settlement sprinkled with brandnew boxshaped tinroofed houses they looked bleak but Gideon who was horn in a kibbutz and who like most Sahras has lived close to hardship pointed them out to me proudly The Sinai Desert pulses with mystery mirage and miracle At the end of a barely discernible desert road near Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba lives a Bedouin named Saalan who had a vision one day commanding him to chisel torsos of Bedouin men and women from Tadros Botros 72yearold native of Luxor has been a guide since 1928 the Sinais abundant store of limestone Because his religion forbids the worship of graven images Saalan lives alone in a bare earthcarpeted hut set somewhat apart from his tribesmen After some ceremonial tea drinking I was permitted to buy and carry away with me a typical carvinga veiled woman cradling an infant In order to avoid the afternoon heat I rose very early during most of my stay in Israel  sometimes at 4 in the morning One of the rewards was watching the sun rise over the walled city of Jerusalem My hotel windows looked straight out over the old city and beyond to Mount Scopus on the left and the Mount of Olives on the right The sun rose in the saddle between striking the domes of two mosques one silver one gold The light is extraordinary When Gian Carlo Menotti in Amahl and the Night Visitors described the Christ child as being the color of dawn he was surely thinking of the color of Jerusalem just before sunrise  The most difficult thing for me to accept about Israel was the nonseparation of church and state I dont think it is possible to be a happy agnostic in Israel  the country officially has no use for agnostics Some of Israels spokesmen maintain that it is the tradition of Orthodox Judaism that is the glue of Israeli nationalism Having been so long dispersed and in some cases all but assimilated the Jews they say have no common denominator other than religion  not language nor culture nor race Since this is a small country under siege everything is very compressed I was told by Moron Medzini who teaches political science at Hebrew University All the problems we have including the conflicts between religious and nonreligious Jews are intensified He cited the case of a kibbutz leftwing atheist who said Kaddish the prayer for the dead at the funeral of his soldier son The atheist explained My father was incinerated at Auschwitz senselessly My son was incinerated in a tank in the Sinai defending his country This is Israel for me Jerusalems popular Mayor Teddy Kollek is disturbed by the increasing trend toward orthodoxy Teddy as everyone calls him is a rumpled sleepyeyed man with grayishblond hair a wavy strand always falling over his right eyebrow As a sad example of the increasing didacticism of religion he cited the case of an orthodoxly raised child shown a drawing of a man without one of his legs what was wrong with the man the child was asked He has no sidelolcs the child answered Teddys views are unorthodox on other suojects too I am against all integration he informed me pugnaciously  and then grinned You Americans always assume that separate is unequal But integration hasnt worked in the United Slates Here we have made an experiment with Jews of the Argentine Jews from [Soviets Georgia and local Israelis They came to blows when they lived in the same building even though we sent in social workers It didnt work They didnt like the smell of each others cooking the sound of each others language Then we put them in neighboring buildings and they got along fine The subject of religion in Israel is so schismatic that it is of course the topic of jokes among them the one about the Israeli Robinson Crusoe who at long last is rescued from his solitary island Crusoes rescuer marveling at all the handbuilt amenities of the island says Its wonderful what youve done amazing But excuse me why have you built two synagogues Crusoe replies pointing That one I pray in The other one I wouldnt set foot in There are other wonderful paradoxes In Hebron over the cave where Abraham is entombed there is an ancient Moslem mosque The Jews have been battling for years at the cost of many lives to reestablish their claim on the Tomb of the Patriarch citing the passage from Genesis that records Abrahams purchase of Hebron 4000 years ago Before 1967 under the British Mandate Jews were grudgingly allowed to ascend no farther than the seventh step of the long flight of stairs leading to the hall of worship over the tomb Since the Israeli occupation of Hebron in 1967 the Moslems have shared the hall they pray at one end of the mosque facing Mecca while the Jews pray at the other facing Jerusalem  all under the alert of Israeli soldiers In contrast with Israels diverse and scrappy population of 35 million Egypts 40 million are overwhelmingly homegrown and they are almost unfailingly courteous and goodhumored In the urban apocalypse that is Cairo  with its population of eight million and an additional two million passing in and out of the city daily  this is no mean achievement Political views are not expressed as freely in Egypt as in Israel for Egypt is something less than the democracy President Sadat attempts to project Those who do speak out sometimes find themselves in difficulties Mohammed SidAhmed one of Egypts best known writers is a theoretical Marxist and a government goad Early on he voiced his disapproval of the Sadat peace overture because he said Egypt lost the initiative by giving Israel recognition first It was Israel that took the land he said The Palestinians are homeless For his pains he along with other dissident writers is currently prohibited from traveling outside Egypt He is accustomed to punishment having spent two years in jail under King Farouk and 10 under Nasser Mr Ahmed who is 49 has light brown eyes set in pouches fluffy brown hair with sideburns and a large nose He speaks with passion waving his arms at times raising his voice oratorically He is not my idea of a dangerous agitator He is too wellgroomed and comfortable His father grandfather and greatgrandfather were pashas and he lives in a spacious elegantly furnished apartment It is difficult to imagine his being prepared to return to jail It is the duty of a nationalist to defend Egypt regardless of the head of state he declared I have two loyaltiesSadat and tomorrow Those who were loyal to the King were tried under Nasser those loyal to Nasser were tried under Sadat What will happen after Sadat In the newrich class there is institutionalized corruption Everyone bribes thats basic But this clampdown is because we are writing about the money sources of influential people When Sadat spoke of liberation he meant up to a point I expect a period in Egypt not of pure repression partly because of the opinion of the West but of severe restraint Mohammed SidAhmed seemed rather to look forward to martyrdom In Cairo new hotels are going up and tourism is overflowing With peace tourism doubtless will increase There is a raucous goodhumored night life and a sense day and night of explosive vitality The professionals and intellectuals live graciously and are among the warmest and most welcoming people I have ever met Thats the good news The literacy rate in Egypt is 35 percent and the life expectancy is 53 The South Bronx and Appalachia are minor ulcers compared with the malignancy of Cairos poor sectors There families live in the streets with their animals and with the inescapable stench of dung Often there is raw sewage running in footpaths and on sidewalks Some of Cairos hardships affect the rich as well as the poor  the sewage backs up in fashionable apartments too Yet the rich seem unaware of or indifferent to the slums that ring Cairo They refer to them as working class areas and visitors are assured that starvation does not exist Perhaps not Still I couldnt help hearing the ghost of Marie Antoinette in the offhand comment of one upperclass woman Sometimes she said they get ill from overeating Because of Cairos fearful overpopulation many of the poor  estimates range from 100000 to 300000  live in the City of the Dead Cairos vast cemetery area Crowded with tombs ranging from small stone huts to tall magnificently embellished ancient mosques the City of the Dead has always had a population of caretakers living in the tombs they guarded Today though almost every tomb houses a family of squatters many of whom subsist without plumbing or electricity Because of the Governments inability to provide minimally decent housing for these poor it has instead accepted their tenancy in the cemeteries and begun putting in a sewage system some electricity and even scattered schoolrooms Since there is little chance of improving the services in Cairo proper for some time to come  even with peace  it is doubtful that conditions in the City of the Dead will ever be I visited there for the first time near midnight on a Saturday with my husband and an American friend who has lived and worked in Cairo for about a year We were the only nonEgyptians present The scene was out of Hieronymus Bosch The men in their galabias ghostlike in the improvised lighting had diseased eyes and rotten teeth and some were deformed or crippled Though I had been assured that because of the fervor of religious belief there is very little violent crime in Cairo was frightened Many of the men appeared to be high on hashish which is prevalent in the poor sector Yet when one of them lumbered over and drunkenly proffered his hand which my nonplussed husband accepted half a dozen others materialized out of the shadows and gave him the bums rush Women children sheep goats and dogs squatted or slept on the hardpacked dirt outside the tombs the stench was overwhelming I returned to the City of the Dead in the daytime when the khamsin was blowing A really bad khamsin resembles a blinding blizzard but even a mild one on a scorching day is uncomfortable In the City of the Dead the top layer of reddish dirt had already lifted thickening the choking desert dust But a lazy village life was stirring A child hawked pink cotton candy clusters of it strung in wreaths around his neck he announced himself by blowing tunelessly on a tin horn Blackrobed women some with veiled faces carried huge burdens of leaves on their heads And everywhere there were gaunt aniDuring the day the men are out in the streets trying to hustle a few piasters mostly by genteel begging They are known as aewae men yes men and they hang around thelobbies of expensive apartment buildings opening elevator doors running small errands They are also on the streets in front of public buildings and hotels  anywhere that a car is likely to be parked When the driver of the car returns two or three aewae men pop up from nowhere offering to wipe the windshield or open the car door then they cheerfully misdirect you out of your parking space If you follow their signals you will probably have collision If Islamic law is an effective deterrent against violent crime it is also a stifling influence on womens freedom Moslems account for about 90 percent of the Egyptian population the rest are Coptic Christians There has been a religious regression in middleclass women recently Mohammed SidAhmed told me We have now a revival of Islam and its austere values My young acquaintance Zizi Taha  who dresses in European style goes about alone where she pleases and holds a parttime job would not think of coming on her own to the United States to work and study journalism although eager to do so Her father a doctor was opposed even to her choice of the American University in Cairo where she is completing courses for her degree and editing the campus newspaper My father planned for me to be a doctor she said and I could not upset him even more by going abroad alone  that would be too much She is soon to be married and will wait until then to go abroad this will be acceptable to her family But there are more sophisticated Egyptian women whose lives are astonishingly liberated Dr Leila Takla is a Member of Parliament and cochairman of the Foreign Relations Committee After attending Cairo University she went to New York for graduate study receiving her PhD in 1962 By then she had married a fellow Egyptian I was eight months pregnant she said when my husband and I both graduated from NYU Her husband Abdel KarimDarwish is now the Egyptian Deputy Minister of the Interior Married women legally retain their maiden names As might be inferred Laila Takla is a strong advocate of womens rights We must liberate mens minds about women she said I believe that every hand should work every mind should think every heart should beat A frequent traveler to the United States because of her Government role she dresses with Western chic and even under the blastfurnace heat of a Cairo summer afternoon her selfpossession does not wilt Liberated as she is she is also a devotee of family life In this we are very much like the Jews she said with just a trace of irony If Leila Takla is very much the exception among Egyptian women so in her own way is Dr Nawal al Sadawi Twice divorced she says she is now married to the only liberated man I know She is a thorn in the establishments flank largely because of the subject of her books written in Arabic  on repressed female sexuality and its political implications But unlike Lesley Hazleton in Israel Newel alSadawi has been officially disciplined for her unorthodox views For one thing she is obliged to have her books published in Lebanon A handsome grayhaired woman of 47 she studied psychiatry in Cairo where her consciousness was raised I attacked the concept of virginity in 1972 she said I lost my job as director general of the health education department in the Ministry of Health and a magazine of which I was the chief editor was closed by the Minister himself She maintains that man has always been obsessed with preserving female chastity while reserving to himself the privilege of polygamy Throughout history the problem has been how to attenuate the sexual power of women she said The solution was to enforce frigidity One of her most strenuous campaigns is to abolish the stillprevalent Egyptian practice of clitorectomy or  as it is often referred to  female circumcision It is still practiced she says in about 90 percent of the villages and has by no means ceased to be practiced even among educated CMrenes In my building here in Cairo she said lives a teacher in English who has a daughter She knows I am a doctor and she said to me I was about to circuincize my girl Di you think I should  Nawal Sadawi smiled pityingly You can be quite sure that any woman you meet of whatever class has had a clitorectomy if she was born in the 1930s or earlier Think of the psychological trauma not to mention the physical frustration In Egypt they cut only the tip of the clitoris usually with a razor and no anesthetic  and sometimes it regenerates in the Sudan they remove all the labia as well Nawal Sadawi might be regarded as avantgarde even by Western standards She divorced her first two husbands because they did not accept my writings and had an abortion when she became pregnant by her second one She has a grown daughter and a I2yearold son She is blunt about her own sex life I never had an orgasm with my first two husbands she said I was operated upon myself when I was 7  and my parents were educated people I knew they just did what everyone else accepted as right but I think maybe I hated them for it when I discovered I couldnt have an orgasm It takes practice after a clitorectomy to have one but now I can I used to counsel young women about this before I closed my clinic It years ago to write full time I had learned from La Oa Takla that her husband as Deputy Minister of the Interior was Egypts number two cop the minister as in many small nations wing head of the police force I mentioned some research I had done on the New York police and she tentatively offered me a tour of the Police Academy which tier husband heads She asked me to meet her the following morning in her office adjacent to the Parliament To reach her husband by telephone to tell him we were coming she sat herself before a bank of three telephones and dialed the Police Academy on all three while her secretary in an adjoining office went through the same procedure on several additional phones They just kept dialing the number over and over In Cairo this is standard and you hope that eventually you will get through the more phones you have available the better your chances General Darwish was finally reached and said to come ahead The Egyptian Police Academy is no sixmonth crash course as it is in many American cities it is a fouryear tuitionfree college that grants a law degree and offers its graduates social cachet But then the Egyptian police force is a far more spitandpolish military organization than any in this country To greet my arrival General Darwish had ordered posted at the entrance four whiteuniformed cadets three presented arms while the fourth blew a bugle flourish The Egyptian police control the fire department civil defense immigration and the issuance of identity cards to ull private citizens The force numbers 10000 academytrained officers and 11001X1 men We are considered the mother of police academies in the Arab world General Darwish told me The general straightbacked and squareshouldered has a military bearing even in mufti We are underpaid by the standard of our responsibility and danger he said when I asked how police pay is compared with other wages A lieutenant earns 45 pounds approximately 85 a month it is a higher wage than that paid to a teacher but consider ably less than the salary of a cook in private service 60 pounds possibly this is a clue to the Egyptian sense of priori ty The homicide rate was remarkably low in 1977  1353 But when it comes to mass murder the Egyptians can beat any multiple mobkilling in the States During a vendetta in upper Egypt General Darwish recalled there were 7N murdered I asked him if he thought he might have a problem with the dissidents who were being suppressed Did he fear they would go underground We know exactly who they are and where they can be found he said In spite of Cairos frenzy and a recent sense of euphoria over the impending peace Egyptian life is essenl Tally leisurely and fatalistic In shaallah is the habitual response to demands for appant merits pleas for a repair or delivery even a dinner invitation it means Allah willing and it is unanswerable Dinner guests often do not show up Allah did not will them to Egypt air is Jokingly called In Shaallah Airline As hosts though the gyptians are irreproachable always taking time to offer a visitor coffee or tea One of the most accomplished hosts I met was my guide to the Valley of the Kings Ills Millie was Tahos liotros A spry hawknosed immaculately whiterobed 72yearold native of Luxor and a guide since 1928 he had been molded by the treasures upon which it was his delight to discourse Ile could have been  in look and manner  a Pharaonic priest When my husband and I thanked him for his tour saying we would come again when we could spend more time he replied with what sounded like absolute sincerity that we must then be guests in his home The Egyptian spirit of generosity is infinitely touching It is dangerous to admire politely any object in a Cairenes home for he will insist on giving it to you as a gift Just dont ask him to let you keep Mount Sinai It is really too easy to empathize with both the Israelis and the Egyptians  too easy in weighing their respective claims and grievances to find oneself torn Certainly no Egyptian I met or could imagine meeting conformed to the image of Rafi Horowitzs bloodthirsty Arab poet and the Israelis I spoke with were aware that Egyptian and Arab are by no means always interchangeable terms To my regret I did not talk with as many Palestinian Arabs as I would have liked even so I knowand so do the Egyptians  that there is it vast chasm between the sayageri of the small group of Palestinian terrorists and the conciliation of the cautious urbane Egyptians The educated Egyptians say they are eager to improve living conditions for their poor and they have been attempting to do so but only inch by inch With peace more can he done  if not quite as much or as rapidly as some Egyptians expect  the problems are monumental As fur true and total peace in the Middle East It is a matter of frustration for many Egyptians The Israelis must give back all the occupied Arab lands One young Egyptian told me before we can really have friendship We Egyptians feel for the homeless and displaced Palestinum Arabs myself plan to visit when the borders are open I am curious to see Jerusalem 13ut I am going to visit Palestine not Israel The Israelis who thrive tin hardship continue to perform agricultural miracles and the country has a prosperous feel to it Peace with Egypt will certainly improve the Israeli sense of equilibrium even while the threat of attack from other quarters lingers Many though a re newly optimist ic We hope a secondgeneration Israeli told me that the truce with Egypt will be regarded by Jordan  and some of the other Arab nations  as a new opening to negotiate with us in good faith And so the tender flags of hope hang m the desert wind 
Minnesota Loses a Bid to Keep Abortion‐Doctor Names Secret,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/minnesota-loses-a-bid-to-keep-abortiondoctor-names-secret-only.html,ST PAUL Nov 25 AP  The Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled that the state Department of Public Welfare cannot keep from a newspaper the names of doctors who perform abortions on welfare patients The courts 6 to 3 ruling yesterday favored the Catholic Bulletin a St Paul weekly and the Minnesota Newspaper Association Both groups had sought the names of doctors who performed welfare abortions in 1976 and 1977 and the amount of public funds involved The names of women who underwent abortions are protected by state law and their disclosure is not involved in the case The Minnesota Medical Association went to court to block the release saying disclosure of the doctors names would make them unwilling to pyrform welfare abortions and thus would impair the patients right to choose a doctor Only Public Funds Involved But the court said that only abortions paid for with public funds were involved and the public has a right to know about the workings of government The 1978 Legislature cut off the use of public funds for abortions except in cases of rape incest or threat to a mothers life I cant believe it said a joyful Bernie Casserly editor of the Catholic Bulletin after hearing the decision It was in June of 1977 that we began this incredible crusade Data on Computer Tapes A Ramsey County District Court ruling in 1977 ordered the release of doctors names and payments but said the Catholic Bulletin had to pay the cost of providing the data The medical association appealed that decision The information is stored on computer tapes and the Welfare Department estimated that it would cost 2500 to 4000 to retrieve it Mr Casserly said he would publish the names of clinics and hospitals However he said he wanted to see the information before deciding whether to publish doctors names Associate Justice James Otis writing the dissenting opinion said the disclosure was aimed at making it more difficult for the poor to seek abortions He also noted that clinics providing legal abortions had been firebombed or vandalized in at least seven cities around the country including St Paul

Albany Freshmen's Key Goal: Tax Relief,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/long-island-weekly-albany-freshmens-key-goal-tax-relief-new.html,IF the central political concern of Long Island voters these days is the property tax they neednt worry about their new State Assemblymen and Senators Whatever their views on other issues and their political party affiliations all seven new legislators say that propertytax relief will be their central worry in the next T poiclattire Not that they have any illusions about how much power they will have to get what they want The new legislators  two Senators five Assembly members three women four men are generally aware of how power is centralized in the legislative leadership in Albany leaving freshmen with very little to say on matters of importance But on the property tax theyll be speaking with one voice This is what they said about about their priorities and about taxes James J Lack of East Northport the RepublicanConservative who is replacing retiring Senator Bernard C Smith said his central concern on taxation was getting off the property tax as a means of financing education He added You cant cut taxes without cutting spending Certain areas of government can be consolidated At the other end of the Island geographically and at the other end of the spectrum politically is State Senatorelect Carol Erman a Democrat from Lawrence She too sees school tax reform as the central issue and favors tax cuts tied to a limitation on state spending Assemblymanelect Frederick E Parola of Wantagh a RepublicanConservative who will be taking the seat of Assemblyman George Murphy said without hesitation that propertytax reform would be his major goal I represent Levittown so its an issue that transcends everything else he said The Islands four other new legislators  John L Behan of Montauk Antonia P Rettaliata of Huntington Louis T Howard of Amityville and May Newberger of Great Neck  said much the same thing Although all new legislators from across the state embraced cuts in property taxes to one degree or another the Islands legislators were far more vociferous and urgent in their cries for relief and for shifting the burden to other forms of taxation It is on the other issues that the traditional partisan and ideological divisions emerged For example only the two new Democrats  Mrs Berman and Mrs Newberger  favored Medicaid financing for abortion and opposed the death penalty The five Republicans took opposing positions on both issues and one Republican Mr Howard said he hoped to lead the fight against Medicaid assistance for abortions For Mr Howard a college professor the abortion issue is not simply one among many he says it is a key reason for his involvement in politics On the question of raising legislators salaries only Mrs Newberger said she would definitely support an increase I frankly think there should be one she said I think there should be a fulltime Legislature Ill be happy with 23500 the current salary Miss Rettaliata said when asked about a pay raise Mrs Newberger was among about third of the new legislators statewide who said they would vote for an increase but lest this group seem too isolated many of those who said they would oppose a raise in fact thought an increase might be a good idea but opposed one out of fear of an angry electorate Beyond the readymade issues though are the personal concerns like Mr Howards on abortion  that the new legislators will bring with them For Carol Berman who gained some international prominance as a leader in the opposition to landings of the SST at Kennedy Airport noise control  especially airport noise  will be a central concern of her first term Mr Lack a former Consumer Affairs Commissioner in Suffolk County and the former president of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York said he would keep consumer issues as a key interest Mrs Newberger said she would pay special attention to the needs of the elderly and to the problem of increasing utility costs Mr Parola said that all the problems involved in the Levittown financing issue along with general voter frustration would have to top his list As for Miss Rettaliata her concerns included a bridge across Long Island Sound  a goal also mentioned by Mr Lack  and economic development on the Island more generally But for better or worse on almost every question the firstterm members kept coming back to one issue The main thing Mr Behan said speaking for his colleagues is tax reduction New Legislators Positions on Issues The Islands new legislators were asked where they stood on four key ues confronting the State Legislature the death penalty Medicaid funds for abortions casino gambling and a salary increase for members of the Senate and the Assembly 
Is the Party Over?,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/is-the-party-over-voters.html,TIME was when Americans would assert a party affiliation I am a Republican as easily as they would disclose their religion Notables printed their party in Whos Who newspapers named their loyalty on their mastheads Through a party one became political You chose or inherited an allegiance after which you voted that ticket WHERE HAVE ALL THE VOTERS GONE rhe Fracturing of Americas Political Parties 86pp New York W W Norton  Co 795 THE EMPTY POLLING BOOTH 179 pp Englewood Cliffs NJ PrenticeHall 895 With that behavior the norm parties Domed large in American life They ranked high as social institutions not least among foreign commentators Of course graft and patronage helped But their chief strength came from voter loyalty Indeed we came close to having party government In Congress and the state capitols you knew which side was running the show The answer to Everett Ladds title is that we are no longer a partisan people The populace he writes is much more highly educated than ever has many more sources of political information and clearly feels less dependent upon party as an active intermediary We like to style ourselves as independents individuals who think for ourselves not in anyones pocket This change has had serious consequences for our politics Candidates downgrade their party affiliation often ignoring their mates on the ticket Hence the spectacle of contenders for half a dozen offices trying to imprint their names on an electorate The costs of campaigning have become staggering And so has the confusion Moreover the chaos has reached the Presidential level as well Thirty states now have primaries of one sort or another the Dirty Thirty to those running the gantlet which means that someone with stamina and a Piper Apache can end up in the White House Yet Mr Ladd reports the 1976 Presidential primaries drew only 28 percent of their eligible voters We may he better informed than our forebears But we are also apt to vote less Most of Mr Ladds book which appeared originally as a series of articles in Fortune deals with the difficulties the parties are having in rallying people to their banners Chapters on the Democrats and the Republicans analyze their respective states of disarray The GOP is having its troubles with business particularly with the large corporations Corporate capitalism prefers to approach the state as an overall entity rather than depend on its oncefavored party Professional managers Mr Ladd remarks have come to think it does not usually make all that much difference which party wins Indeed as many executives put it they prefer to buy into the incumbents The Republicans are rather weak in that category All this is rather dispiriting to the party of McKinley and Coolidge One Sunbelt Congressman has even proposed that the Republican party ought to sever its ties with big business and support the freeenterprise system Something historic is going on here more than can be analyzed in a Fortune series The politics of capitalism has reached a stage at which corporations no longer need a party of their own indeed find such an agent a liability If the GOP can count on only small and mediumsized businessmen it scarcely has a national constituency The Democrats have always made anarchy a virtue As Will Rogers once quipped I dont belong to any organized party  Im  Democrat For years the party managed to combine dirt farmers and inimigrants with altruistic patricians But now it faces a split of a different sort Mr Ladd calls these groupings New Class and Old Class Democrats The la tter are still essentially workingclass and lowermiddle class but now sufficiently prosperous to own homes pay taxes and feel threatened from several sides Of the New Class we have heard a great deal Here we have a younger collegetrained generation in professional and ancillary occupations They like to feel uptodate and openminded especially on issues such as equal rights abortion and marijuana What Mr Ladd says about them s by now fairly familiar George McGoverns debacle in 1972 showed what happens when a candidate imagines that avantgarde sentiment is stronger than it actually is Even the Equal Rights Amendment is having a tough time winning acceptance It would have been helpful had Mr Ladd speculated on how this new class came into being Greater schooling is only part of the story It does not tell us for example why majoring in comparative literature turns people against capital punishment The answer may lie more with the new cast of our economy which calls for occupations requiring verbal facility That along with longer leisure hours means we have a lot of talk in the air Hence ideas have a shorter lifespan contributing to the Democrats dilemma Mr Ladd thinks that even a 28 percent turnout makes the parties too participative He wants to return them to the regulars who have some finesse in the art of governing Not so Arthur Hadley He deplores the fact that nonvoting he calls it refraining is actually on the rise In 1976 perilously close to half of all votingage Americans stayed home on Election Day We compare poorly with every other democracy Even once civicminded states such as Oregon and Minnesota send fewer people to the polls Mr Hadley wants more of us to vote His central theme is that nonvoting now infects every layer of the population According to his figures rousing the refrainers will not lead to a dilution of quality Indeed many welleducated citizens have decided to stay on the sidelines until they get candidates worthy of their ballots If that kind of attitude persists democracy can only spiral downward Voters voluntarily avoid the booth says Mr Hadley because they see no connection between politics and their lives And that is the problem shadowing both these books Our politics have only a tenuous connection with conditions in the rest of society We demand much of government even as we deny it those capacities Whether the concern is crime or energy or inflation we get inaction because thats what we really want If this is so we need more than a focus on party fissures or calls for greater participation For Americans the discovery that we have a politics insuffficient for our needs has been particularly painful That may have been the plight of other nations But it was never supposed to happen to us Authors Query For a hook on the Russola panese War I would like to receive data and facts concerning the reason by Russian officers leading to the

INTERVIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/new-jersey-weekly-interview-urban-missionary-in-hudson-county-urban.html,JERSEY CITY TWO years after his return from Paraguay where as a member of the Franciscan Order he was instrumental in organizing a diocese Auxiliary Bishop Jerome A Pechillo Roman Catholic Vicar of Hudson County still feels like a missionary I think a lot of missionary activity is going on in most of the larger cities of the Eastern Seaboard and Jersey City is not exempt from missionary ideas Bishop Pechillo said in a recent interview In many respects there is missionary zeal in the innercity parishes Bishop Pechillo spent 15 years in Paraguay as Prelate Nullius of Coronel Oviedo which meant that he performed the functions of a bishop while diocese was being formed He was named Titular Bishop of Novasparsa in January 1966 and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark in March 1976 Basically South America is a baptized continent Bishop Pechillo said but its one thing to be baptized and another thing to be living your faith There were about 131000 people in the territory I was in with the number now grown to 280000 among them Guayaqui Indians an overflow from the Matto Grasso With the Indians you never knew whether youd have your head handed to you or be greeted with a spear there was no chance of evangelizing Because of the Indians harsh social codes the Franciscans did come in contact with the aged who were turned out to die and sick children who were similarly abandoned Even with these people Bishop Pechillo said there was very little conversion But despite the primitive conditions in Paraguay his present post Bishop Pechillo said is even more of a challenge In Paraguay he recalled our aim was to grow survive build schools and churches and bring the sacraments to the people The faith was there The evils of the world that we experience in the United States  abortion drugs ethnic problems  were not part of the culture there Our mission was to preach the gospel baptize and preach the word In some respects Bishop Pechillo said there are parallels between his experience in Paraguay and in Hudson County For example so far as language is concerned many of the children starting school in Paraguay could not speak or understand anything except Guarani the tongue of the natives conquered by the Spanish In Jersey City and other Hudson County cities a large influx of Hispanic people has resulted in a generation of grammarschool children who speak and understand only Spanish Coincidental with the Hispanic population moving in the sons and daughters of the Irish Polish Italian and German immigrants who settled in the county in the 19th century have moved out and the number of blacks has increased As a result many of the pupils in the Catholic schools are not Catholic A poll of 330 students in one of our schools showed that 52 denominations were represented Bishop Pechillo said In effect the prelate went on he talked himself into his service in Paraguay In January 1975 when I was work ing with the Nuncio of Paraguay I had an audience with Pope Paul Bishop Pechillo recounted I recommended that a diocese be set up in Conine Oviedo and that a native  be named bishop The Holy Path agreed so I talked mysof out of a jub Although he still carries TO R after his name  the Franciscan designation for Third Order Regular  Bishop Pechillo asserted that as a Franciscan and a bishop he was neither fish nor fowl I have no voice in the comminity he said The vows you take  life are switched over The obedience is not to the order bet to the Holy See The vow of chastity  well that never changes  but the vow of puverty Joes As bishop you are expected to iive according to your means Bishop Pechillo now 57 years  was

HAVING A BABY AFTER 35,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/26/archives/having-a-baby-after-35-having-a-baby.html,This is not going to be one of those articles with a lot of mushy parts about childbirth  partly because what you are reading is being written by a woman who is nine days away from her delivery date Nine more days There was a period during my pregnancy when the main thing my friends said to me was You dont look it but that time has passed I am bulging laden sloggy logy swaybacked winded the soles of my feet are numb from the extra weight  my idea of heaven at this point would be a night spent sleeping on my stomach How do you feel about your wifes body my husband was asked in our Lamaze class I like it he said but I wont be sorry when she gets her old one back I am pregnant with my first child am 37 years old Just once in my life would like to do something that everyone else isnt doing but that seems not to be my destiny instead I struggle with alternatives grapple with possibilities make a solitary choice and at that moment thousands of other women who are 37 years old do too Thousands of other women writers who are 37 years old do too I imagine that somewhere up in Connecticut Erica Jong is at this very second typing away about her impending child tiers is going to be a girl Mine is going to be a boy We know this Erica Jong and I because we have each had an amniocentesis a remarkable test administered primarily to women over 36 to determine whether the fetus is normal as a dividend the test also ascertains the sex of the child But do you want to know my friends asked Of course I was dying to know Well be glad not to tell you said Lynn Gixlmilow my genetic counselor at Mount Sinai Hospital But its one thing for the sex of my child to be a complete mystery and quite another to have it known to Miss Godmilow and not to my husband and me So four months ago a month after my doctor had stuck a threeinchking needle into my abdominal wall and withdrawn Iwo tablespoons of amniotic fluid from the uterus  a process by the way that is almost Completely painless and that made me understand for the first time why the Japaneses commit harakiri  the call came through Your child is normal said the voice on the phone Its a boy  I shouted hugged my husband and jumped up and down several times Immediately thereupon we both became depressed It wasnt that wed wanted a girl  neither of us cared But one of the most extraordinary things about being pregnant and not knowing the sex is that your unborn child is both a boy and a girl  you can have fantasies about one for as long as you like and when you get tired you can have fantasies about the other The minute you discover that your child is only one thing  a boy as opposed to a girl  you have to give up hall your fantasies Pethaps thats part of what causes postpartum depression I dont know I do know that when my prepartum depression began the fantasies I was giving up had mainly to do with flowered wallpaper and little dresses with smocking that doesnt sound par ticularly modern I know but the fact is that I grew up deprived in the flowered wallpaperandIi ttledresseswi thsmocking department I am not foolish enough to think I will be a more perfect parent than mine were but I do think I will manage  at the very least  to deprive my child in different ways The successful parent a friend once remarked is who raises a child who can afford to pay for his own psychoanalysis just once in my life says the author I would like to be doing something that everybody else isnt doing but that seems not to be my destiny Instead I struggle with alternatives make a solitary choice and at that moment thousands of other women who are 37 do too My depression passed quickly My husbands took a little longer Two days after the phone call he woke up and announced that hed had a puzzling dream I dreamed that the postman came to the door and I opened it and said Go away we dont want any mail here What do you suppose it means Thats the worst pun Ive ever heard I you upset No he said as the meaning dawned Its just that its so much easier being the father of a girl I suppose it is And I suppose  from that point of view  that it is much easier being the mother of a boy and that I should feelthat in some sense I have got the better deal But I grew up with sisters three sisters And my basic feelings about boys stem from the parties I went to in the sixth grade where the girls stood on one side and the boys stood on the other There was Us and there was Them they were foreign beings with arcane interests who spoke in tongues I am considerably older now and I am still not sure I know what boys are I expect I will find out The babys name will be Jacob A few weeks before my doctor Sheldon Cherry performed the amniocentesis I was at his office for a checkup and when he finished he said Ive got to show you something incredible We walked to another room in his office where the sonogram is located and he turned it on to show me the earliest pictures he had ever taken of twins  14weekold fetuses The sonogram uses sound waves to produce a blackandwhite moving picture the images are dotty and a little difficult to make out but there they are clear to anyone who knows what to look for The first thing saw on the screen was a kind of limabean shape The uterus said Dr Cherry Into it swam a white ball the head of the first twin with a vague dotty body attached to it It floated around for about a minute Then another white head and dotty body came swimming in  and suddenly an arm came shooting out of the first twin and whacked the second one so hard that it was propelled all the way out of camera range Moments later the second twin came swimming back and the two of them sat floating there side by side In the middle of each was a tiny thing almost like a frogs tongue fluttering moving up and down with amazing rapidity Thats the heart beating the doctor said and I burst into tears The fetuses were a week older than mine and there was all that moveThe next week I told a Washington friend what I had seen on the machine told him largely because he is a twin and I thought he would be interested to know that he probably has genuine cause to resent his brother as much as he does That information however was not at all what he responded to Fascinating he said I guess makes you feel different about abortion doesnt it He said this in the triumphant manner of many men know who believe their opinions on this subject to be morally superior to mine No it doesnt I replied It doesnt make me feel different at all I have never believed that there was anything simple about abortion The problem of course is that the womens movements line on the issue was as overstated as the antiabortionists On the one side the movement seemed to be saying that abortion was a universally therapeutic experience that had nothing to do with anything but a womans need to control her body on the other side the antiabortionists were saying that abortion was murder Its a shame that ambiguity has so little place in the political arena its also a shame that my Washington friend could not understand that I be of the as he and had nonetheless come out on the other side of the question Abortion involves a complicated moral and ethical choice that women have the right to make in many ways seeing the sonogram underlined that belief for me How do you think having a baby will affect your feminism a woman in Grand Rapids Mich asked me a couple of months ago Its the same question really the same question my Washington friend had asked and its freighted with the same moral superiority You see now these people seem to be saying you see now that it isnt that simple But I never thought it was My mother had four children She also worked full time She died seven years ago I have thought of her often in these past months The baby kicks or turns over and I think of my odd complicated mother choosing to have a child choosing to have me For many years it has been hard for me to remember what she was like before she became sick It is still hard to remember but for the first time in a long time I feel connected to her More than that I feel grateful She would not have cared she was not the sort of mother who wanted gratitude  far from it But last spring as the leaves came onto the trees first the delicate green wisps and then the blossoms blossoms everywhere cherry blossoms dogwood blossoms azalea blossoms I felt honestly and deeply grateful to her Having said that I am compelled to tell you that I know how corny it must sound  and she gave me that too  the instinctive need to pull back from sentiment to cover feeling with selfdenigration But I am managing to overcome that part of her legacy So I will tell you one more thing I miss her We are not going to talk about pain here the Lamaze teacher is saying We are going to talk about contractions I would much prefer that we talk about pain it seems far more realistic but realism is not what this particular Lamaze class is about This particular class is being held on Long Island where we are spending the summer Our teacher is not only into euphemism she is also into raspberry herb tea shiatsu massage and the Leboyer method a procedure developed by a French doctor that is said to be far more humane for the newborn There is no spanking on delivery no bright lights and the infant is taken from the womb and placed in a warm soothing bath Our Lamaze teacher has seen 30 African babies born with this method and she says that within four days she could see enormous differences between them and their American counterparts They had better muscle control they werent tense and scrunched up and squinting from the lights they could focus their eyes In just four days Dont tell me about four days I find myself thinking Tell me about college entrance examinations Someone in the class asks what we are to do if we cant persuade our doctors to deliver by the Leboyer methodanother blow for realism it seems to me since it is nearly impossible to find an obstetrician in the state of New York who will We are not going to talk about pain my Lamaze teacher says We are going to talk about contractions I would much prefer that we talk about pain it seems far more realistic If you cant have Leboyer the teacher replies its your kids karma The Lamaze method is named for another French doctor one Fernand Lamaze who first observed it in Russia and then introduced it in France where an American woman named Marjorie Karmel had a child by it and subsequently wrote a book Thank You Dr Lamaze published in 1959 In New York Elizabeth Bing developed a series of exercises based on the method her book Six Lessons for an Easier Childbirth has more than a million copies in print It is not natural childbirth its a regimen of intense breathing exercises that are meant to distract a woman in labor from the pain of her contractions Twenty years ago it was a muchneeded antidote to what was then the total tyranny of the obstetrician over the process of childbirth it was introduced at a time when many doctors preferred to knock women out cold during labor  thus endangering them and their unborn children  and more critically it seems to me at a time when it was considered an intrusion for a woman to ask her doctor any sort of question about what was going to happen to her The success of this method and the changes it has brought about  informed parents fathers in the delivery room labor without anesthetic  cannot be underestimated But American society has a remarkable capacity to absorb change  and then turn it on its head So the Lamaze method has had other results as well What are the symptoms of transition our Lamaze teacher asks The symptoms of the transition period of labor are excruciating pains This is not the correct answer We are not going to talk about pain here The correct answer is very intense irregular contractions And anger Coaches says our teacher addressing the husbands in Lamazeze this is the period when your woman will he angry She will want to quit She will want to throw in the towel Your job in this period is to urge her on I know of one coach who actually got up on the table and did the breathing exercises along with his woman to get her through An interesting thing is happening here The tyranny of the obstetrician is eliminatedand the tyranny of the method is substituted The total reliance on drugs is replaced by the total reliance on the womans capacity to deal with her labor And who is to he in charge of this Not the woman it seems to me she will be far nxi angry Which leaves the coach I think Im caught in the middle here says my husband What do you mean I say Well he says suppose youre in transition and you want a painkiller What am I supposed to do Get me one I say A long fight followed that conversation No need to recapitulate it But it made me understand finally something that had puzzled me for years Why so many of my friends thought theyd failed if theyd asked for painkillers during childbirth and why so many of their husbands thought theyd failed It seems to me it ought to be quite enough to have gotten pregnant lived through nine months without killing the hundreds of people who volunteer precise instructions on how to be a parent and produced a healthy baby but no there is more You must get through labor without drugs That is real success The trouble with this is that it hurts to have a baby The trouble with this is that it does not make you a better woman to get through labor without drugs The trouble with this is that it makes women feel theyve failed when theyve succeeded The trouble with this  to name one last trouble  is that it has the capability of being every bit as fanatical and narrowminded as the system it has replaced What makes this particularly ironic is that medical practices have changed yet the Lamaze method is taught with the same siege mentality it began with In my class the doctor was painted as a virtual enemy a nonbeliever a sneaky dispenser of drop and unnecessary Caesarian sections But my doctor urged me to take Lamaze literature he has even written a book on childbirth that includes a long approving section on the method Nonetheless he also told me that there is a very good relatively new regional anesthetic called epidural that knocks you out from the waist down It sounds like a decent alternative to the pain of the later stages of labor in fact it sounds better than that  it sounds wonderful I dont really mean to sound so antagonistic toward the Lamaze method  Im delighted I took the course and if Im one of those lucky women whose labor proceeds uneventfully and swiftly I may even stay with it What Im complaining about are the methods ex cesses and the fact that something that ought to liberate women seems  however subtly to be oppressive It never crossed my mind that I would live through the late 60s and early 70s in America only to discover that in the end what was expected of me was a brave albeit vigorous squat tri the fields like the heroine in The Good Earth It never crossed my mind that the prevailing wisdom on the subject of childbirth would be pied cared on the most oldfashioned notions of what being a woman used to be about I believe that the womens movement has hiought about real changes in our society but sometimes when I become cynical about the amount of progress that has been made  and the Lamaze classes produced great fits of cynicism in me  I wonder whether the most concrete change the movement has brought about hasnt been the Dutch treat Why are you having a baby they asked me They asked me this repeatedlylargely because in my sixth month of pregnancy I went out on a bookpromotion tour and when you are a pregnant 37yearold writer on a bookpromotion tour thats what you get asked about The question made me very uncomfortable It implied that at some point in the past I had made a decision not to have a child a political decision really and had then repented again for political reasons Im not making a political statement I blurted out to the 18th person who asked me about it Im just having a baby I had not wanted a child until recently for one reason It had always seemed important to me to have one with a man who wanted children very much And so in some sense I got lucky I had 15 years between graduating from college and becoming pregnant 15 years to work at my career and live my life without the responsibilities of motherhood I can make an argument  a political argument  that having children later rather than sooner is the better way but the truth is that I backed into the choice I could just as easily have done it the other way round I could just as easily not have done it at all In recent months I have read a great deal about having children It seems to be currently trendy to say that it is the last revolutionary act that it is the only worthwhile thing to do that it is an uncommonly brave move in this age of divorce and an uncommonly unselfish one in this age of narcissism I dont know about any of that What I know is that we wanted a baby It will change your life they said to me They said this ominously very ominously with a kettledrum roll on the word change Of course it will I wouldnt be having a baby if I wanted my life to stay the same as its been Thats the point isnt it  You see now these people seem to be saying you see now that it isnt that simple But I never thought it was
Sweeping Right‐to‐Life Goals Set As Movement Gains New Power,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/27/archives/sweeping-righttolife-goals-set-as-movement-gains-new-power-many.html,MINNEAPOLIS Nov 21  The national righttolife movement which emerged from the elections this year as potent controversial force in American politics has set an ambitious agenda for 1980 and beyond In addition to continuing efforts on the state and local levels against abortion national leaders of the movement have set goals that include the defeat of five of the more liberal Senators who will be up for reelection two years from now and Congressional approval by 1982 of a proposed Constitutional amendment that would end legalized abortions except to save the life of the mother The Senators targeted for defeat are Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon and four Democrats  Birch Bayh of Indiana John Culver of Iowa George McGovern of South Dakota and Frank Church of Idaho  all of whom have stfpported use of public funds for abortions The proposed constitutional amendment would be submitted to the states after gaining Congressional approval Many Dedicated Supporters Two years ago such sweeping aims would have been dismissed as ludicrous Indeed the movements principal opposition the National Abortion Rights Action League says it won some stunning victories itself this year and blunted the effort to roll back the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortions legal under certain conditions But the league and other righttochoice groups have nothing like the singleminded fiercely dedicated supporters of the righttolife movement These supporters have had an impact in states and districts across the nation at a time when many Americans are disillusioned with government and have abandoned political processes to the singleissue and specialinterest groups Here in Minnesota which has been a stronghold of participatory democracy the righttolifers are no longer dismissed as a fringe group unable to win elections or affect policy on the single issue they represent Setbacks in Key Races They are an extremely effective political organization said Rick Scott executive director of the DemocraticFarmerLabor Party which dominated politics here for several years but which suffered major setbacks Nov 7 when it lost the Governors office and two Senate seats to the Republicans In the major races the margins of victory were too large for any particular group to say that its support was decisive but Minnesota nevertheless will have next yeartwo Senators a Governor and a Legislature friendly to the righttolife position a reversal from the past Mr Scott acknowledged serious defections from the DFL Party of traditional Democrats who this year voted for Republicans solely on the abortion issue Ile said that the righttolife people working through a proliferation of organizations and committees had mastered quickly and in a sophisticated way the position approach to politics For example both candidates for Governor had records that the righttolife people could embrace Gov Rudy Perpich the Democrat had vetoed legislation that the righttolife people opposed Representative Albert Quie his Republican opponent had done better  he had sponsored legislation in Congress for a constitutional amendment against abortion Two days before the election the state was flooded with righttolife literature supporting Mr Quie now the states next Governor The movement recorded other gains across the nation In New York for example the newly formed Right to Life Party polled more than 100000 votes in the gubernatorial election enough to insure an automatic place on the ballot in future elections development that will give it higher visibility and more leverage Mary Jane Tobin the candidate for Governor said It is now evident that just as the major party candidates courted the Liberal Party endorsement they must now turn their attention to the Right to Life Party Righttolife grassroots activity was an important factor in the defeat of Senator Dick Clark Democrat of Iowa and Senator Thomas J McIntyre Democrat of New Hampshire for the election of number of candidates to the House and to Senate offices and for the willingness of a proliferation of candidates on all levels to endorse the righttolife position Gains by the Opposition Betsy Chotin director of the political action committee for the National Abortion Rights Action League pointed out in Washington that a referendum in Oregon to prohibit the use of statewide funds for abortions had been rejected that a number of antiabortion candidates had been defeated and a number of those who supported freedom of choice had been elected The committee spent 75000 in the campaigns But the righttolife groups have an unusual grassroots movement that in many areas has built up so much force and fervor that it is now by far the strongest of the singleissue groups that have sprouted in abundance in recent years raising questions about its longrange effectiveness and impact on the decline in national political parties Although the movement until now has been concerned with only one issue it is far from unified Nationally and in most states it consists of a proliferation of organizations The largest umbrella group is the National Right to Life Committee based in Washington and composed of members from 50 states It has a political action committee that directs funds and other assistance to candidates and forms national political strategies Committees in Most States Paul A Brown director for political action disclosed in an interview plans for 1980 and beyond Over the next two years he said state political action committees will be set up in all or most of the states Mr Brown is sensitive to charges that the movement supported most of the candidates on the far right regardless of how they stood on other issues of importance to its members Some of the candidates we supported are liberals he said The chairman of our political committee is Morton Downey Jr who has been a Kennedy Democrat Most of our people are Democrats but the Democratic Party doesnt provide a home for us Mr Downey is a Nevada businessman In Minnesota the state party platform calls for freedom of choice on abortion Mr Scott acknowledged the difficulty of the party embracing two warring elements although some popular leaders of the past have been able to pull it off Vietnam War Protesters The rise of issue politics Mr Scott said is a move toward pure democracy which is a disorderly process that the country may have to live with But I dont oppose issue politics he said My own field was philosophy but got into politics to oppose the Vietnam war A lot of people in the righttolife movement in Minnesota were active in the antiwar movement Mary Schmidt education coordinator for Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life the chief lobbying organization for the movement in the state is a Democrat who was part of the Vietnam protest She said that the righttolife movement was the same bringing people into the political process who might otherwise be inactive Despite their sophisticated methods the movement in state after state has homemade stamp Organizations are run out of homes Roman Catholic churches and stores The leaders say they hope to keep it that way But on the national level Mr Brown talks of broadening the base The movement has been criticized for protesting abortions but not joining social movements to help poor children when they are Wm Mr Brown said that an effort would be made to persuade organizations to expand into social work More Than Abortion Issue Two sisters Maureen Fiedler and Dolly Pomerleau who are codirectors of the Quixote Center of the Washington DC area recently conducted surveys to determine attitudes among other Catholics in communities across the nation Among those polled in a broad national sample were persons involved in the righttolife movement Not all members of the movement are Catholic but Catholics make up a substantial portion in most communities The sisters concluded according to report in The Catholic Reporter that the movement arose from a concern fnr social morality These data suggest that many if those in the movement they said see abortion at the deepest phychological level less as a taking of human life than as practice threatening to existing social patterns and customs in families marriages and sexual relations The New York Times  Remo RadMockt Mary Schmidt left and Darla St Martin officials of the

Senate's Only Woman Defies Stereotypes,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/29/archives/senates-only-woman-defies-stereotypes-she-defies-easy-stereotyping.html,TOPEKA Kan Nov 28  Nancy Landon Kassebaum plans to go to Washington sometime next month to be sworn in as the junior Republican Senator from Kansas and get a leg up on the seniority ladder Senator James B Pearson her predecessor who chose not to seek reelection has said he would resign early so that she might be appointed by Robert F Bennett the lameduck Republican Governor but no date has been set And when the Senate convenes in January Mrs Kassebaum a 46yearold political novice will be the only woman in that body As such she is certain to come under especially close scrutiny but if Washington has any stereotypes in mind for a Kansas Republican woman whose only previous elected office was president of the school board in a Wichita suburb and whose other major credentials appear to be that she was worked for Senator Pearson in 1975 and is the daughter of All M Landon it had better hold off a bit She Defies Easy Stereotyping Mrs Kassebaum has already shown that she defies easy stereotyping either as a woman a Republican a Kansan or the daughter of the 91yearold former Governor who as the 1936 Republican Presidential candidate carried only Maine and Vermont In this notably conservative state she said she would have voted for the Panama Canal Treaties She declared that while she believed abortion was seldom right morally she would have supported legislation permitting Federal aid to poor women to pay for the operation in cases of incest rape or on the testimony of two doctors that the pregnancy would seriously threaten a womans health She angered some women by saying that she did not favor the extension of the time for approval of the proposed equal rights amendment but contended that her opposition was based on the judgment that further acrimonious debate could be harmful to womens rights Meanwhile she said she would continue to work for passage of the amendment Cuts in Spending Ate Favored On fiscal matters she was one of the few Republicans who opposed the KernpRoth proposal to cut income taxes by 30 percent over the next three years calling it inflationary and therefore eonomically unsound She favors spending cuts And she pledged if elected to run for no more than one more term It seems to me times have changed communication has changed she explained last night in one of the first interviews she has given since going into seclusion after the election to catch up on her rest mail and family life After 12 years it seems to me it is possible to lose touch with your constituents and to lose perspective For that reason the slender 5foot2inch Mrs Kassebaum said she intended to spend as much time as possible in the state visiting with constituents But for Mrs Kassebaum who is legally separated from her husband Phil a Wichita lawyer and businessman that does not mean that she will always be a mirror image of her constituency I feel very strongly that you have to exercise your judgment she said otherwise youd just be blowing in the wind following the public opinion polls If you feel strongly one way you have to be an advocate As for her famous father she said that he had not attempted to influence her in the campaign and that she did not expect him to when she is in the Senate For someone who loves to give advice she said he stayed out of it pretty well He just called David and told him what to do Smiling she glanced at David Bushong her campaign manager and now her administrative assistant Only in the morning and in the evening Mr Bushong replied with a grin Later he added I enjoyed him He never browbeat He does have strong ideas and justifiably so but he never tried to go around me to Nancy Hes a very honorable man In a separate interview Mr Landon said The art of governing must be preceded by the art of being elected She ran a great campaign I think shes going to make a great Senator Asked if he would like to see her follow in his footsteps on her partys national ticket he replied sharply Thats ridiculous Why ask me that question Its a great honor for her to be elected a United States Senator without talking about the national ticket Mrs Kassebaum brushed aside the same question with a similar astonishment that it was asked She has other things on her mind She still does not know when she is going to be sworn in and with four children three at Kansas State University and one a junior at Maize High School she has holiday plans to make Id really like to pin down a day she said for plane reservations for one thing And the folks are going back Its awfully difficult with Christmas so it wont be a major event just go back get sworn in and come right back

The Editorial Notebook Abortion's Morning After,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/04/archives/the-editorial-notebook-abortions-morning-after.html,An early and widespread reaction to last months election was that antiabortion forces had scored an impressive string of victories They were credited with administering the coup de grace to Senators Dick Clark in Iowa Edward Brooke in Massachusetts and Floyd Haskell in Colorado among others On reflection however it seems that the election was in fact as inconclusive on abortion as on most other national issues Senator Brookes defeat can hardly be counted a grand victory for the abortion foes The winner Democrat Paul Tsongas also favors freedom of choice about abortion early in pregnancy The Senate has lost a leader in the defense of abortion rights but it has not lost a proabortion vote from Massachusetts Similarly the defeat of Senator Haskell by the antiabortion William Armstrong does not necessarily reflect the strength of Colorados antiabortion forces After all Gov Richard Lamm an outspoken advocate of free choice on abortion won reelection In Iowa the ProLife Action Council worked hard to defeat Senator Clark but even there perhaps too much has been made of its influence The liberal Senator crossed conservative voters on many issues  not just abortion In any case what did Iowa voters do in the case of Democratic Representative Michael Biouin who stood against abortion consistently in his two terms in Congress They voted him out too  Meanwhile numerous proabortion candidates won at the polls Colorados Patricia Schroeder and New Yorks Richard Ottinger were returned to office Carl Levin a hero of the freechoice side defeated abortion foe Robert Griffin in the Michigan Senate race Illinois Gov James Thompson won reelection despite battles with the RighttoLife lobby What is one to make of all this There are some who seek to make of it a rout They will attempt to use the alleged victories of abortion foes this November to scare the new Congress into a new legislative assault on abortion rights  not just for poor women as before but for all women RighttoLife workers are already pointing to November as a harbinger of things to come and are compiling a political hit list for the future Such threats are plainly exaggerated In a careful reading of the evidende the foes of abortiondo not appear to have won big this fall They did however score an important psychological victory merely by winning small For this is the first general election in which they have demonstrated even a modicum of strength at the ballot box They have thereby tossed a challenge to the majority of voters in this country who according to repeated polls still favor free choice for abortion early in pregnancy
Lawyers Sum Up Case Challenging a Cutoff Of U.S. Abortion Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/05/archives/lawyers-sum-up-case-challenging-a-cutoff-of-us-abortion-aid-cites.html,Lawyers representing indigent women in a class action suit urged a Federal judge in Brooklyn yesterday to halt a 16monthold cutoff of Federal funds for abortions They contended that the restrictions threatened womens lives and their religious liberty The lawyers making their final arguments in the case said that the cutoff of funds had been produced by an intensely religious mobilization The Roman Catholic Church and some of its religious allies have played the central role Rhonda Copelon of the Center for Constitutional Rights told Judge John J Dooling Jr The essential premise of the Federal legislation that halted Medicaid funding for abortions was that the fetus is human being and that abortion is murder Miss Copelon said She contended that the argument was a religious view and that other religious groups held contrary view Cites Other Faiths Most Protestant and Jewish groups reject the view she said referring to the belief that a fetus is a human being Miss Copelon said those groups feel that women must make a consciencious choice on whether to have an abortion Federal restrictions were first imposed on the use of Medicaid funding for abortions in 1976 However in response to legal challenge on behalf of women and doctors Judge Dooling temporarily blocked those restrictions from going into effect He lifted his injunction in the summer of 1977 after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the law then in effect did not require public financing of abortions The litigation before Judge Dooling then turned into the case that is now being argued The class action suit was filed on behalf of indigent women who are eligibile for Medicaid and who may need abortions doctors who wish to provide Medicaidfinanced abortions and the womens division of the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church

3 Policemen Slain in Basque Area,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/06/archives/3-policemen-slain-in-basque-area.html,MADRID Dec 5  On the eve of a historic referendum on Spains new democratic constitution three young gunmen burst into a crowded bar in the Basque city of San Sebastin this afternoon and assassinated three policemen The murders believed to be the work of the Basque separatist organization ETA set a somber tone for the referendum particularly in the disaffected Basque province of Guipzcoa where the terrorists have lately concentrated their violence ETA which says it wants to make a separate socialist state out of the four Basque provinces and their northern French neighbors apparently hopes to create a climate of fear in the region to keep voters away from the polls It is expected that the number of abstentions and perhaps No votes will be high in the Basque region where the important Basqbe Nationalist Party has contended that the new charter to make Spain a constitutional monarchy under King Juan Carlos does not give the prosperous industrialized northern area sufficient autonomy Elsewhere in Spain the constitution is expected to receive a large majority Cabinet ministers from Prime Minister Adolfo Suarezs centrist Government and leaders of the Socialist and Communist parties have been on the stump for a favorable vote Extremist rightwing and new Francoist parties haye opposed the constitution One opinion poll said to have been conducted by the Ministry of the Interior indicated that 75 to 80 percent of the electorate would vote and that only 9 percent of the votes would be negative The day has been declared a holiday Last night Mr Suarez appeared on television to defend the constitution and rebut attacks by a small but vociferous rightwing minority that says the document is atheistic and approves abortion and divorce Todays killings in the San Sebastin bar underscored the conviction among some Basques that ETA has become indiscriminate in its targets Two of the victims were plainclothes policemen but the other was a member of the municipal police in the town of Pasajes The municipal police are generally considered politically innocuous in the Basque region while the national police and Civil Guard are sometimes regarded as forces of occupation Down on the floor shouted the three young gunmen to the clientele of a bar near San Sebastins city hall and old quarter They spotted the three policemen drinking in a corner and riddled their bodies with automatic pistol fire The assassins fled shouting in Basque Long live a free Basque land
About New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/09/archives/about-new-york-to-the-hinterlands-with-thanks.html,Even before Walter C McSherry moved to an apartment on West End Avenue near Lincoln Center he figured he knew what urban sophistication was because he was raised in McAllister Okla McAllister had the largest population  16000  and the largest theater the Busby between Dallas and St Louis Heck we were the center of life out there says Mr McSherry who so well remembers his wise and conservative roots along the OklahomaKansas border that he was absolutely shocked this year when Congressional representatives from the area voted to support the emergency loan guarantees that permitted New York City to avoid bankruptcy He is the sort of man who tracks public issues in some detail and he had even made a few small office bets for the fun of it that the bill would fail But when it passed in a vote that wasnt even close he had to wonder whether he really knew middle America So what he decided to do was write letters to America at election time and have some fun thanking everyone out there for helping New Yorkers by his reasoning to stay healthy enough to enjoy a tax cut this year and another cut next year according to Governor Careys campaign promise I want to say thank you for cutting my taxes Mr McSherry wrote to about 30 newspapers scattered out there somewhere beyond the edge of the Steinberg poster of western Manhattan Dont think were all ingrates  His letter was spotted by campaign strategists for James Jeffries a Republican in Topeka Kan who was challenging the Democratic incumbent in the House of Representatives Martha Keys The Jeffries people saw possibilities in such McSherry lines as I had bet my friends here that you people were brighter than to elect representatives who would tax you to pay for us in New York City And so it was that Walter McSherry flew out to Topeka on Oct 15 and checked into the Ramada Inn quiet as a hitman and appeared the next day at a Jeffries campaign news conference as a chatty grateful somewhatexotic New Yorker In his mind he wasnt endorsing Mr Jeffries so much as having some fun by thanking Topekans and telling them how well things were going in back in the big city Shes done a fine job representing New York City in Congress Mr McSherry said of Mrs Keys in his friendly western way Sarcasm Irony Why Mr McSherry says he had no such thing in mind as the local press interviewed him and TV cameras zoomed in on New York Post headline he had saved from when the loan guarantees were passed The headline read How New York Conned the Peasants Kind of like the Drop Dead headline isnt it Mr McSherry asks as he relives his Kansas trip over a cup of coffee down in the financial district where he works as a computer analyst for the Irving Trust Company The trip was strictly a oneday lark paid for by the Jeffries campaign he says He thanked Mrs Keys for her vote for the city loan bill soon as the news conference began Without the help of you people in Mrs Keyss district he said I dont know how we could keep up having about a million people on welfare 20year retirement programs for subway workers and garbage collectors free abortions     It is time to let Mrs Keyss forces have their say here even though it is pointless in terms of the ballot because the incumbent lost to Mr Jeffries by a narrow margin of 52 to 43 percent We knew McSherry was coming and we were prepared for him Michael Lennen Representative Keyss administrative assistant said We had distributed a fact sheet to the press that pretty well met the substantive flaw in McSherrys case  that the loan bill involved no expenditure of taxpayers money only a backup guarantee Furthermore Mrs Keys pointed out that the 16 billion guarantee plan was only a fraction of the cost of a similar loan guarantee program  the new 4 billion agricultural credit extension act adopted to help the nations farmers maintain fiscal health Most important of all Mrs Keys contrasted her vote with her vote two years earlier against the seasonal loan program in which the Federal Government actually had lent money to the city The way Mr Lennen recalls the day Mr McSherry was treated lightly as feature story character making one TV show and a newspaper or two The Keys camp turned to other issues and Mr McSherry flew back to New York in the time it takes for middle America to have a good nights sleep But then the Jeffries advertising campaign began Mr Lennen recall with big repetitious newspaper and radio announcements to Kansas voters that Youre worth 400 to Walter McSherry And Walter McSherrys thanks to Mrs Keys for the tax cuts became a household word at least in the households of Representative Keyss staff The Jeffries people called right after the election with the result and their thanks and as a registered Republican Mr McSherry got a bit of reassurance about the heartland he remem bored as he lives his life in Manhattan Of course Im a New Yorker he says in response to a question I live here by choice the place to be if youre in the financial business Its exciting Lots of power The other day Mr McSherry had his pocket picked of 200 on a crosstown bus and while he grabbed the pickpocket he says people just sat and looked at him as though he were strange Thats just like New York he says The thief disembarked as safely as if this were Topeka
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/09/archives/letters-of-city-bonds-and-the-contract-clause-life-and-crime-in-the.html,To the Editor Often overlooked in an assessment of the factors that have contributed to the partial restoration of New York Citys credit standing is the role of the courts Recent announcements of an upgrading of Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds and of the citys planned reentry into the bond market attest to the wisdom of judges who despite the temptation rejected deceptively simple solutions to vexing problems If the road ahead remains strewn with possible hazards at least the first steps have been taken toward a reestablishment of investor confidence It was neither popular nor readily understandable when late in 1976 New Yorks highest court refused to sanction a note moratorium ostensibly designed to save the city from financial collapse The action of the Court of Appeals premised on independent state constitutional grounds seemed reminiscent of an earlier day when charges of impairment of contractual obligations were subjected to searching scrutiny and exacting standards At the same time there were suggestions that the Supreme Court had it been given the opportunity to review parallel challenges tied to the contract clause of the Constitution would have sustained the legislation in question by denying the propriety of any judicial intrusion into the area of economic policymaking Such predictioni proved to be unfounded when in 1977 and again in 1978 the Supreme Court made clear that the contract clause had not been abandoned after 40 years of disuse Asthe Port Authority covenant case revealed the Court may refuse to defer unreservedly to legislative judgments of reasonableness and necessity Other alternatives looking toward a more moderate course need to be explored should drastic impairment threaten Does the reactivation of a muchmaligned contract clause or its state counterpart portend a return to the extremes of judicial negativism that led to the judicial debacle of 193738 Clearly the past is not being revived in a way that will encourage notions of private property rights prevalent several decades ago What seems to be emerging is a modest return to a substantive review function that intrudes selectively in compelling circumstances Admittedly the latter is an imprecise and subjective measure Yet the previous policy of judicial selfabnegation pointed to a flight from responsibility contrary to American tradition It is in the best interest of beleaguered cities that in times of crisis they be dissuaded from pursuing paths of expediency that may lead to financial ruin If the courts both Federal and state serve in minimal fashion to preserve some semblance of integrity in the bond markets they will have made a valuable contribution An uncritical deference to legislative initiatives accompanied by blithe references to the assumed selfcorrecting mechanisms of the political process is not always the course of prudence or even of genuine accountability STANLEY H FRIEDELBAUM Professor of Political Science Rutgers University New Brunswick NJ Nov 29 1978 Life and Crime in the Republic of Guyana To the Editor As someone who has recently returned from the Cooperative Republic of Guyana after five years I was interested to read your background coverage to the tragic events at Jonestown but disappointed to find that the same exaggerated fears of visiting businessmen are still being faithfully reported as indices of the quality of life in Georgetown am a lawyer and a criminologist and during my time in Guyana conducted extensive field research among the urban lower class from whose ranks the choke and rob delinquents are largely derived No one would deny their existence nor the growth in crimes of violence in the decade since independence But it should be remembered that this is a trend throughout the developing world particularly in countries like Guyana where the expectations aroused by political independence have remained unmet and where in consequence the frustration level is high When compared to many other countries inside the Caribbean and elsewhere Guyanas crime rate is comparatively low In fact it has decreased in recent years It is therefore highly irresponsible to continue to present travelers tales as serious accounts One is led to wonder why this is a practice not followed elsewhere for example in Jamaica where a most impressive level of street crime and violence has been reached in the past decade Perhaps it has something to do with the lack of a tourist industry in Guyana  the Prime Minister is on record as having said he does not want a nation of pimps and waiters  or else with the attempts however unsuccessful to create the framework for a socialist state In any event it is inaccurate as is the suggestion in a recent news story that the Government wishes to revive Obeah an African religion sic There was merely a suggestion that in the modern American tradition its practice should be decriminalized It remains a misdemeanor DAVID J DODD Assoc Prof Dept of Sociology State University at Stony Brook Stony Brook LI Dec 2 1978 Distorted Anthropology To the Editor In his Nov 26 OpEd article on messianic movements Marvin Harris seriously misrepresents the discipline of anthropology He claims that at its recent annual meeting in Los Angeles the American Anthropological Association  barred scientific papers based on empirical studies of behavior from the program Perhaps as a result of poor phrasing Harris seems to argue that all proposed papers which were scientific and empirically based were systematically excluded by the organizers of the meeting This contention is patently false Harris also maintains that the American Anthropological Association  gave top priority to symposiums on witchcraft shamanism abnormal phenomena and extrasensory perception This too is false While these topics are among the concerns of anthropology less than 3 percent of the sessions at the annual meeting were devoted to them Finally in an argument devoid of logic Harris contends that the same Californian human wasteland which produced the Peoples Temple cult also gave rise to the anthropology meeting because the latter happened to take place in Los Angeles this year Harris does a disservice to himself and to his discipline by presenting the public with such a distorted view of anthropology FREDERICK J CONWAY Washington Nov 271978 Franklin on Judges To the Editor Your Nov 26 editorial on Trials of Judicial Selection raises serious questions concerning the most efficacious methods of choosing members of the judiciary From the earliest years of the nation Americans have never been sure how best to do it Your ruminations put me in mind of the observation by Benjamin Franklin at the convention in Philadelphia in 1787 which drafted the Federal Constitution where the subject inevitably came up Jame Madison recorded it as fol lows Docr Franklin observed that two modes of chusing the Judges had been mentioned to wit by the Legislature and by the Executive He wished such other modes to be suggested as might occur to other gentlemen it being a point of great moment He would mention one which he had understood was practiced in Scotland He then in a brief and entertaining manner related a Scotch mode in which the nomination proceeded from the Lawyers who always selected the ablest of the profession in order to get rid of him and share his practice among themselves It was here he said the interest of the electors to make the best choice which should always be made the case if possible ERNEST CASSARA Professor of History George Mason University Fairfax Va Nov 29 1978 The Better Pledge To the Editor There is a movement afoot further to amend the text of the Pledge of Allegiance that I learned as a child First American flag became flag of the United States This impaired the simplicity and destroyed the rhythm of the original statement without changing it philosophically So with reservations it was acceptable Then the phrase under God was added f found this objectionable because the universality of the pledge was diminished Why not all of usChristians Jews agnostics whatever as the Founding Fathers intended Now I learn that text and euphony are to be further diminished by adding born and unborn a phrase politically inspired I would like to see a return to that moment when we all stood around the flagpole heads bared united and said I pledge allegiance to the American flag and to the republic for which it stands one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all ALBERT G RYDEN Forest Hills NY Nov 20 1978 On Leniency To the Editor It was with total disbelief that I read in The Times of Dec 1 that Justice George Roberts had given Davereaux Wiggins half the maximum sentence for a crime which the justice himself called horrendous  the vicious repeated attempt to snuff out the life of a young woman in the subway Why By what possible reasoning has Justice Roberts given such a light sentence Surely he knows that this despicable criminal will do it again as he has indeed attempted to before by his own admission What a disgrace JANE BOUCHE STRONG New York Dec 1 1978 South Africa On Minimizing Staggering Developments To the Editor On Nov 19 The Times published an editorial Changing South Africas Rear Guard and a news report by John Burns Blacks Attack South Africa Plan for School Reforms both of which a distorted the facts b were extremely negative and c were arrogantly prescriptive a Burns states that nothing in the draft legislation would commit the Government to reducing the large funding disparity in amounts spent on black and white children However in the same report he informs your readers that salaries for black teachers will be nearly doubled establishing a single scale for white and black teachers As salaries constitute the largest element in the education budget this Government action will obviously reduce the funding disparity In your editorial it is incorrectly stated that the new Minister of Plural Relations Pieter Koornhof will make decisions on behalf of the mulattoes and Asians of South Africa He is of course responsible only for black relations in South Africa b In your editorial you grudgingly admit that steady change has taken place in South Africa but in stark contrast to the spirit in which similar changes were received in your own country you maintain that the changes in South Africa have been too little and too late You say that they will be resisted and that they are in fact simply a tinkering with policy Let me assure you that when it was announced recently that beaches in the Cape Province will in future be opened to all races it did not require the South African National Guard to enforce the implementation of that decision The Burns article dealing with a fundamental change in South Africa namely the introduction of compulsory education for black pupils was headlined as quoted above In fact Mr Burns went out of hisway to seek out persons who would make negative comments about this most important and constructive development c The Burns article goes to considerable lengths to show that now that school attendance has become obligatory boycotts have become a technical offense His negative attitude toward a universallyaccepted principle is staggering The term compulsory education implies that people will be required by law to attend school a state of affairs which not so long ago was strongly supported nut only by Mr Bums but by many other detractors of South Africa Your editorial goes further Not only does it aim to minimize the staggering developments which have taken place in my country over the past few years but it also prescribes that we should share power in a unitary South Africa This prescription for chaos borders on the ridiculous and could be compared to a prescription by the USSR that you should share power in a unitary America with Mexico Canada and the Central American countries of this continent JOHAN ADLER

A Changed Synanon The Subject of Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/10/archives/a-changed-synanon-the-subject-of-inquiry-a-changed-synanon-finds.html,LOS ANGELES Dec 9  Synanon the acclaimed drug rehabilitation program that evolved into a highly profitable organization is now under state investigation on charges of violence and a wide range of illegal activities And with its founder hospitalized and under arrest there are signs that several people are jockeying for control of the wealthy controversial organization The California Attorney Generals Office is investigating Synanon for alleged complicity in at least 18 assaults including a recent rattlesnake attack on a Los Angeles lawyer The state is also investigating allegations of terrorism child abuse attempts to bribe a California state official and violations of California charitable trust laws and gun laws Founded in 1958 by Charles Dederich a onetime salesman who called himself a reformed alcoholic Synanon claimed credit for rehabilitating thousands of drug addicts It got international attention there were books and television documentaries about it and the organization received millions of dollars in donations from American business With the income it built huge communalstyle villages and other facilities in seven California counties and established branches in West Germany Malaysia and the Philippines But according to former members law enforcement officials and others familiar with its operations Synanon was gradually transformed into an organizational hybrid both a profitmaking business and an authoritarian cult that enforced discipline and suppressed dissent with its own police force called the Imperial Marines and had a stockpile of 300000 worth of arms The Los Angeles District Attorneys office alleges that Mr Dederich ordered a rattlesnake placed in the mailbox of Paul Morantz a 33yearold attorney here who had been involved in several lawsuits against Synanon Two members of the Imperial Marines Lance Kenton 20 the son of band leader Stan Kenton and Joseph Musico 28 have also been charged in connection with the rattlesnake attack A New Religious Posture Investigators in the District Attorneys office yesterday played for newsmen a tape recording made on Synanons statewide leased telephoneline communications system in which a voice they identified as Mr Dederichs allegedly said Our new religious posture is this Dont mess with us You can get killed dead Physically dead The investigators are attempting to prove the tape is evidence of a plan to attack Mr Morantz and other lawyers who challenged Synanon Elsewhere on the tape a voice alleged to be that of Mr Dederich says that it wants an ear in a glass of alcohol on my desk and after a reference to the Imperial Marines says Im quite willing to break some lawyers legs and then tell him next time Im going to break your wifes legs and then we are going to cut your kids ear off Try me  Phone calls to Mr Dederich for comment were not returned In the early 1970s membership in Synanon exceeded 10000 But since then the membership has dropped to about 1000 partly former members say because of policies introduced by Mr Dederich that included forced vasectomies for male members mandatory abortions for women and orders from Mr Dederich for more than 230 married couples to divorce and switch to other partners within the group  a process Mr Dederich labeled changing partners While membership has declined the organizations assets have continued to climb and according to estimates of some law enforcement officials the assets have grown to 30 million to 50 million much of it banked they believe in Switzerland Germany and Canada Questions on Tax Exemptions Synanon owns a mortgage company in Los Angeles a major producer of commercial advertising sales promotion specialties and several other businesses It owns 10 airplanes 22 boats and more than 500 motor vehicles as well as vast real estate holdings mostly in California The business operations have been exempt from Federal and state taxes although last summer California moved to begin imposing state income taxes saying the organization was a profitmaking business Former members have charged that Synanon was using its legal status as a nonprofit trust to run a business that earned revenues of more than 13 million a year and that it paid substantial salaries to its top officials as well as a 500000 preretirement bonus to Mr Dederich last year In recent weeks there have been indications that Synanon was in the throes of a turbulent transfer of power as well as indications that some members were planning for an overseas exodus According to an official in Sacramento more than 125 Synanon members recently applied for passports refusing to state their intended destination The leadership transfer is related to the condition of the 65yearold founder of the organization At a hearing this week in Kingman Ariz following Mr Dederichs arrest for allegedly conspiring to kill Mr Morantz a justice of the peace ruled that he was not competent to participate in legal pro ceedings and subsequently his family sought to assume custody of him on these grounds Police officials said that when they arrested him before the court hearing at his home in Lake Havasu City Ariz Mr Dederich was intoxicated Law enforcement officials who are investigating Synanon say they have reason to fear that Mr Dederich might be murdered as a way of stilling the recent interest of police and news organizations in the profitable organization With Mr Dederich apparently incapacitated two persons have emerged as possible successors  his daughter Judy Dederich Akey 27 and Dan L Garrett Jr a World War II bomber pilot and attorney who joined Synanon in the 1960s and has been one of Mr Dederichs closest aides for almost a decade Mrs Akey assumed the chairmanship of the organization last February apparently about the time it became known that Mr Dederich who earnestly opposed any drug use or drinking in the organization was using alcohol again Investigators say that while Mr Garrett and Mrs Akey appear to have the strongest roles in the organization now one of Mr Garretts daughters and Mr Dederichs wife also play key roles Leadership in the organization has been further depleted over the past year by the departure of two key executives John Hurst a former president of Synanon and Howard Garfield a principal legal adviser to Mr Dederich At a court hearing this week in connection with the rattlesnake attack in Visalia Calif  at which Synanon challenged the legality of the seizure of tape recordings at its Badger commune in the High Sierra Mountains  Marvin Engquist Los Angeles police officer testified that Mr Garretts son Michael claimed that his father was murderous The officer quoted the son as saying that under his fathers guidance Synanon members are very dangerous The officer also quoted the son as saying I have no doubt that my father would have me killed for my defection from Synanon Mr Garrett and Mrs Akey did not reply to The New York Timess requests for comment about this and other matters regarding Synanon Michael Kiser the organizations public relations director also did not respond to a request for comment Law enforcement officials and others who have investigated the organization I say they have been struck by the number of similarities between Synanon and the Peoples Temple the organization led by the late Jim Jones Although they stressed that there was a major difference  Synanon does not embrace a philosophy embracing mass suicide as did the Peoples Temple  they noted the following similarities In both organizations drug addicts were many of the first members both organizations promised members a utopian community and employed communal living techniques deemphasizing materialism and playing on its members guilts both used stern authoritarian leadership hard labor long meetings and frequently frank and bitter criticism and ridicule of members to keep adherents loyal both split families and stockpiled arms both grew rapidly behind the enthusiastic support of political liberals in both organizations rigid pursuit of nonviolence was replaced by increasing paranoia over outside criticism and defection and both sought to intimidate the press There are all kinds of comparisons asserted Mr Morantz the alleged victim in the rattlesnake attack who won a 300000 default judgement against the organization for a couple who claimed to have been kidnapped falsely imprisoned and brainwashed by Synanon They both had charismatic leaders one called the father the other the founder both tried to operate in a sealed world away from everyone else  one in Guyana the other in Marin County [in northern California where Synanons largest facilities are located] both believed the outside world was conspiring against them both had specially trained security forces both favored the use of corporal punishment both have overseas bank accounts and both have their own private communications system A Beautiful Synanon Seen The Synanon I joined was so beautiful said David Gerstel a 33yearold graduate of Brandeis University who went into Synanon in 1969 as an alternative to military duty because he was conscientious objector and who left it in 1974 after rising to become one of Mr Dederichs senior aides They had these beautiful properties in Marin County he said They had lots of goodlooking girls and I was looking for place to land It was very exciting we were going to create a new American institution and wed be the leaders There was a vision that we could create a new world I was a utopian Mr Gerstel added I wanted to try a commune People were cheerful and happy and extremely loving Everything was in perfect repair was like a Shaker community might have been Against the background of what we were seeing on television  the mass slaughters in Vietnam and the assassination it looked pretty good Mr Dederich he continued was fabulous person he was a brilliant conversationalist he was one of the funniest people Ive ever heard in my life People adored him that was the only word for it By the early 1970s Mr Gerstel who has written a book Paradise Incorporated about his experiences in the group said Synanons function which originally had been to serve as a rehabilitation haven for drug addicts was changing Most members were like himself dropouts from conventional society who were looking for a better world They were called lifestylers and squares The heart of the Synanon experience is participation in what the group calls The Game a structured verbal combat Wed spend anywhere from 20 to 100 hours a month gathered in a circle dozen to 15 people and talk to each other one former member said The keynote of The Game was savage angry verbal attacks on each other  ridicule destructive attacks with no holds barred He remembered one woman who had learned that she was dying of cancer and was savagely belittled at one session When it was over anther member of the group turned to her and said You dont even deserve to have cancer Under Mr Dederichs direction Synanon supporters say these encounter sessions helped many heroin users get rid of their addiction and the organization provided enough satisfaction to nonaddicts to make them a principal factor in the explosive growth of Synanon in the early 1970s Although many of the new members appeared to like playing The Game former members said they realized after while that they were losing their selfconfidence becoming increasingly dependent upon the Synanon community for support and less likely to want to return to the outside world The Game is an incredible instrument for manipulating human behavior said Mr Gerstel who said he left because Mr Dederich was becoming more authoritarian Mr Gerstel said he still has good memories from his early years with the group and felt miserable for more than a year after he left it In 1973 a former Synanon member said a strict rule on nonviolence in its games was broken by Mr Dederich himself when disgusted at one members ridicule of him he poured a can of root beer over her head Once the nonviolence code was broken similar incidents followed the former member said Mr Dederich they asserted was becoming more dictatorial and assuming the trappings of a monarch among his people He began requiring all Synanon members to participate in jogging exercises for example then he began a harsh program requiring overweight members to lose weight and then he made all female members shave their heads Afterward came the forced visectomies and abortions and the change partners rule Meanwhile fueled by contributions from affluent members huge gifts of materials from businesses sympathetic to rehabilitating addicts and by money from Synanons own businesses the organization began to grow It began to build a larger and larger security force and the organizational leadership decided to explore legal avenues to establish Synanon as a religion to take advantage of the freedom of religion protection in the United States Constitution Reports began to circulate increasingly among members of Synanon that when defectors left the organizations they were called splitees  they were roughed up terrorized Officials in Marin County and Tulare County in central California where the organizations sprawling mountaintop facility is located began to investigate reports of beatings but in most cases they were met by silence from the former members apparently fearful of further attacks In some cases they said efforts were made to block investigations through the intimidation of county representatives They clearly had decided that they wanted to be a total and separate and independent state within the county said a Marin County supervisor who did not want his name published because he feared possible reprisals They had guns goon squads and just laughed at the county Strategy to Suppress Criticism When earlier this year the Marin County grand jury called for an investigation of Synanon and its properties within the county the largest of which six square miles and of reports that weapons were being stockpiled children being beat^n and other abuses being perpetrated Synanon sued the county for more than 55 million The suit was representative of the strategy that according to a former aide Mr Dederich had developed as a ploy to attempt to suppress official criticism and press investigation This source said that the inner circle of leadership in the organization includes at least 15 lawyers who have implemented the legal counterattack In 1972 the counterattack had its first result The San Francisco Examiner printed a critical article about the organization Synanon sued for libel Eventually the Hearst Corporation the parent company of the Examiner agreed to outofcourt settlements totaling 26 million believed to be one of the largest libel payments ever in this country The organizations problems with the press however were not over After Mr Dederich issued his order on forced vasectomies and changed partners he attracted more attention and in 1977 he was interviewed by a reporter from Time magazine Later he told an aide that he thought that the magazine was considering him for a cover story possibly its Man of the Year Instead the magazine published a critical article and claimed that despite Synanons earlier virtues it had become a kooky cult The article enraged Mr Dederich his former aide said and Synanon responded with a lawsuit against Time Incorporat ed seeking more than 76 million in damages Hedley Donovan the magazines editorinchief and Andrew Heiskell the corporations chairman reported being threatened by individuals that investigators concluded were linked to Synanon The American Broadcasting Company was sued for more than 42 million after reporting on Synanon and one member of the group appeared at this years meeting of ABC shders and warned the companys chairman Leonard Goldenson there is great danger for you your wives and your families Fred Silverman the president of NBC has also been threatened by persons investigators believe are linked to Synanon This year at least a halfdozen reporters who have worked on stories about Synanon including a correspondent for The New York Times have reported threats by persons apparently linked to the organization For the most part until recently the press has been far more active than public officials in investigating Synanon But the near fatal beatinob of one former member of Synanon on Sept 21 followed by the rattlesnake attack on Mr Morantz prompted the Attorney Generals investigation as well as a separate investigation of the organization by police departments in Los Angeles and Berkeley In the September attack Philip Ritter who had left Synanon after refusing to submit to a vasectomy and who was trying to gain legal custody of his child from his wife who had remained a member was attacked by two men in Berkley with clubs He suffered a fractured skull Synanon spokesmen have said the group had no connection with any of the assaults or threats In recent weeks the Attorney Generals office has identified at least 18 beatings that are believed to be linked to the organization In most cases it is alleged former members were beaten because they had defected State investigators have sought cooperation from Federal investigators including the Internal Revenue Service but have gotten no response
Kennedy Assails Carter on Budget At Midterm Meeting of Democrats,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/10/archives/kennedy-assails-carter-on-budget-at-midterm-meeting-of-democrats.html,MEMPHIS Dec 9  Senator Edward M Kennedy today confronted President Carter over the spirit that should guide the Democratic Party telling the partys midterm conference on issues that Democrats must sail against the wind of public opinion and reject drastic slashes in domestic spending In a ringing speech to a cheering audience of 2500 the Massachusetts Democrat seized a building mood at the conference where unhappiness about budget proposals was heard again and again at workshops on the cities inflation arms control and health insurance Mr Carter worked the conference too in a lower key and left before Mr Kennedy came to town But the President told an inflation panel that he promised his efforts to balance the budget would not be unfair to the poor Senator Kennedy insisted afterward that his speech was not an indication he would challenge Mr Carter for the 1980 nomination even if the President did not change his stand No no no he said I presume hell run hell win the nomination and Ill back him but Im going to speak out on these issues and he understands that Kennedy Gave New Hope to Liberals The Massachusetts Senator had been invited to speak on national health insurance an issue on which he broke with the President on July 28 but his attack was much broader He warned There could be few more divisive issues for America and for our party than a Democratic policy of drastic slashes in the Federal budget at the expense of the elderly the poor the 1ack the sick the cities and the unemployed Mr Kennedys appearance gave new hope to liberals mounting challenges to the AdminiStration in resolutions to be voted on tomorrow even though the Senator was to leave Memphis after only six hours in town In the evening John C White the national chairman sought ways to soften or divert those challenges especially on the budget and on health insurance President Carter made his way among the delegates through the morning listening to them sound off more than conversing with them Vice President Mondale Cabinet members and other Administration figures worked the conference all day explaining pleading and trying to persuade At a panel discussion of inflation Mr Carter was told that his antiinflation program let corporations off scotfree that his trade policies let American industries suffer and that he was not balancing the Federal budget quickly enough At the workshops on defense and arms control he was praised for his efforts to contain nuclear proliferation and to negotiate a new arms agreement with Moscow but was criticized for his plan to increase defense spending and to proceed with the development of an expensive new mobile missile system He told both groups that his primary duty was to maintain the nations security and that he would deal with spending in a way that protected the poor and curbed inflation Mr Whites main concern was a proposed resolution that demanded domestic spending not be cut in the next budget and criticized the Administrations apparent intention to increase defense spending Worried by the Resolution Top White House officials also were plainly worried by the resolution which was being pressed by Douglas A Fraser president of the United Automobile Workers and which was attracting signatures thoughout the convention hall One signature it obtained was of particular concern to the Administration  that of Coleman Young the Mayor of Detroit and ordinarily a firm Carter loyalist To be considered new resolutions must have signatures from 409 of the 1633 delegates Mr White was trying to win a compromise on the resolution but if he failed it was not clear how he would deal with that measure or others circulating in the corridor dealing with a range of subjects including abortion and homosexual rights While the leaders of the various factions dealt with warned and sometimes bluffed each other privately the delegates and assorted leaders argued about a wide range of issues Carol Bellamy president of the New York City Council raised the budget issue at a workshop on urban problems and demanded that if Federal spending was reduced the Defense Department share equally in reductions Burden on Backs of Poor People Mayor Young at the same session said the Carter Administration should clarify its commitment to urban America It unconscionable that we are raising defense while putting the burden on the backs of poor people he said But the official members of the workshop panels generally friendly to the Administration were not the only ones who came to take a stand At the session on inflation Henry Hill of Vineland NJ was so intent on reading a statement on trade from the floor that he paused only briefly when President Carter came into the room He ignored a request for questions to the President and resumed reading his statement Delegate Doug Seal of Wellington Tex told that panel that inflation can be solved if the farmer gets a fair price Paul Perlin of Los Angeles attacked the antiinflation program for ignoring land speculation interest rates and rent gouging Ruth Jordan of Washington complained that the Carter budget would threaten the poor on Medicaid when the people who get the profits are the doctors and the insurance companies At a session on the Middle East Hyman Bookbinder of the American Jewish Committee urged the Administration not to lose patience with the pace of Middle East peace talks and impose its own ideas on how to settle the remaining differences or to impose deadlines for further progress whether it be the Dec 17 deadline for this first peace or the endof1979 deadline for Palestinian selfrule

HARVARD'S NOZICK: PHILOSOPHER OF THE NEW RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/17/archives/harvards-nozick-philosopher-of-the-new-right-nozick.html,Robert Nozick was not there when I arrived at his Emerson Hall office at Harvard His secretary explained that he would be bicycling over shortly Sitting alone in his office facing that familiar edict Thank you for not smoking I mused about the complexities of libertarianism  the defense of individual right that Professor Nozick has become celebrated for expounding in his widely acclaimed book Anarchy State and Utopia Since its publication in 1974 Nozick has become a darling of the right and something of an enigma to his own profession Both teachers and learners fall asleep at their posts as soon as there is no enemy in the field JOHN STUART MILL If individual rights are as inviolable as Nozicks view has it why shouldnt I smoke If I were to smoke would I be violating Nozicks rights not to be polluted Or if he were to stop me would he be violating my right to ingest whatever chemicals I choosee How would the issue be decided If we were to come to blows over the matter who would have a right to intervene The opportunities for debate were mounting My reflections were interrupted by the syncopated clip of Nozicks sandala Contrary to oldfashioned images of the philosopher a Platonic idea did not float in Nozick 40 is a youthful goodlooking man of medium height The face of this aging Wunderkind is long A caricaturist would depict a square jaw and full mouth then lots of unoccu pied space until his small eyes and heavy black eyebrows appear capped by shocks of graystreaked hair strewn over his forehead He is one of those strange alloys sometimes found among itinerant academics a blend of Brooklyn where he was born and Ivy League Affable and alert it is hard to imagine him walking across the campus in an abstraction But once a topic strikes his interst the pedagogue vanishes He exposes his topic to a crescendo of questions and answers and soon his voice follows suit with highpitched punctuations of delight as if every ear in the neighborhood had to be reached The most unlikely ears have heard his message For example when Professor Nozick was interviewed by Forber Magazine the interviewer reacted to his answers by exclaiming that some of our readers will be dancing in the streets tonight The readers would be dancing because they had at last found a respectable philosopher who had written a book that would preach the justice of unrestrained capitalism It promises to serve as a textbook for future libertarians The book is not just about capitalism It is a defense of radical libertarianism a view that promotes individual rights and freedom of action  business and sex alike  and regards a state powerful enough to interfere with the free exercise of these rights morally insufferable But the libertarianism it urges defies the simplicity of customary liberalconservative categories It is not obviously right or left  although it is obviously immoderate It justifies no single contemporary political current  although it seems to embody the curious mixture of ideologies that political commentators were at a loss to explain after Novembers elections The political drift of today seems to be in the direction of a broader recognition of personal liberties away from state interference with these liberties in the name of social ideas and emphasizes everywhere human rights and freedom of personal expression For reasons not entirely clear this general drift has been labeled rightwing But if there is a general movement to the right in this country the component forces of this movement cannot be uniformly stamped rightwing Despite points of agreement between Barry Goldwater and the local antivivisectionist most of these component forces elude an easy classification Judged by the usual yardsticks the views of many leading politicians possess the purity of neither left nor right but fit into some hybrid category Since the current political vocabulary is too crude to capture most of these complex views a reworking of thisfoctibulary might do more for political understanding than the simplistic conclusion that we are turning to the right The job of conceptual housekeeping in politics has historically been the concern of philosophers As recently as in the days of John Dewey it was commonplace for the engage philosopher to peek in on tradeunion meetings expose present and foreseeable evils and dash off letters to statesmen in times of national crisis But then there came a more circumspect period for the profession The preoccupation of the analytic philosopher with logic and language led to widespread neglect of social issues Most political philosophers became solitary ruminants in the intellectual pastures and few observers were surprised to learn that a British writer had pronounced the subject of political philosophy dead The pronouncement was dramatic but misleading The subject had in fact been anesthetized by overzealous linguistic surgeons In the last decade younger philosophers with the same analytic instruments have recognized that the subject is still alive and have taken steps to reanimate it It is a curious fact that the two men who most notably represent the philosophers renewed preoccupation with politics not only hold mutually repellent views but also occupy adjoining offices at Harvard University The first is John Rawls 57 whose book A Theory of Justice first appeared in 1971 Rawls is one of the most esteemed of living political philosophers His work is a stolid meticulous inquiry into profound theoretical problems of politics and his approach the traditional one of starting from the ground up constructing an elaborate network of justification for his position It is a book busy with abstract argument rarely venturing into details of contemporary social issues and never making obsequious reference to current political fashions Rawls has become the object of reverence among colleagues and graduate students This has not yet occurred in the case of the other philosopher Robert Nozick He is probably one of the most controversial of living political philosophers and one who shrewdly appeals to current political and intellectual fashions I asked him how he sees the role of the political philosopher today Has he seen his way through the confusions of the contemporary political scene How does he defend himself against colleagues who challenge his motives His answers suggest an unexpected and controversial picture of the committed philosopher Whatever else he may be Nozick is a catalyst who just might succeed in doing what other contemporary political philosophers have failed to do provoke our participation in philosophical debates about politics For a philosophy book Anarchy State and Utopia initially received as astonishing a reception as Rawlss book had three years earlier For one thing its range is unusual Apart from its main ideas there are clever asides on intricate questions of economics incisive remarks on the historical charac In 1969 the Society for Philosophy and Public Affairs SPPA was founded by a small group of philosophers in order as they put it to overcome the detachment of philosophy from concrete social issues It has since be come a national body and has organized symposlums in which its members have tackled con temporary problems like preferential hiring genocide abortion and civil disobedience The formation of the SPPA foreshadowed the development of political philosophy into a minor industry Issuing a torrent of distinctions theories ideologies and suggestions for reorienting the aims of government ter of love fugal embroideries on the psychology of envy timely maxims about drugs and sex Then there is the distinctive style in which it is written Firstperson jocose carelessly zigzagging from point to point welcoming every opportunity for fireworks it is utterly different from the pulseless treatises of philosophys dead giants And if it lacks the glittering prose of a Bertrand Russell or the exquisite logical brevities of a WVO Quine its style nevertheless grows on you as Rawlss for example does not When Nozick builds a cobweb of questions jokes and hypotheses around some pedestrian assumption suggesting unlimited complications beneath its surface one sometimes feels one is directly experiencing an expansion of philosophical territory Philosophical writing often seems like an awkwardly dubbed film tentative thoughts squeezed into the tone of what Ludwig Wittgenstein once called wisdom out of the icebox But with Nozick philosophical activity with all its turbulent starts and stops seems displayed rather than reported For reasons of style alone political philosophy might not have been a malaria district for so long had Nozick been around earlier Veneration for Rawlss book seemed to have been bred within the philosophical profession and radiated outward whereas the opposite seemed true of Nozicks Reviews of the book quickly appeared in the general public press The National Book Award was bestowed upon it the imaginations of political scientists lawyers economists and educated laymen were exercised by it But within the philosophical profession a somewhat different tone prevailed Before the book appeared Nozicks reputation had been based upon three published articles brilliant vignettes written in the accepted style of dense argument confined to narrow topics The appearance of this big chatty book with its grand sweep and its flashy arguments was occasion for some of Nozicks colleagues to see him as an attention grabber declining into a kind of narcissistic display Nozicks excitable presence on television discussing the rights of animals in the debate following a showing of a film on animal experimentation only strengthened this impression Then there was the dark subject of Nozicks conversion He had been an ardent socialist in his college days a founder of a local branch of the Student League for Industrial Democracy  a group which subsequently changed its name to SDS  and now he was basking in the attention of the extreme right Was this intellectual resilience and courage in renouncing former dogmatism or selfpromoting exploitation of his obvious talents A lot of philosophers were prepared to draw the blackest inferences Some whispered Goethes remark that when one respects nothing it is no trick to be brilliant Nozick is a disarming combination of candor and calculation He describes his temperament as sleekly functional  his energies all thrown together into a single program of research his work an unambiguous expression of his whole personality Unlike some philosophers he makes no pretense at being swollen with erudition he knows what he needs to know to address his problems and compares himself with Sherlock Holmes who was an expert on thumbprints but ignorant of astronomy Nozick knows little about thumbprints but has surprising pockets of learning such as the Indian philosophical tradition about which he once taught He confesses to little interest in music films or theater He was an ardent sports fan years ago but even this has paled What remains of it has been absorbed into sociological speculation I have noted among my colleagues a higher percentage of Jews are interested in sports In the ecology of their lives it is a way of Americanizing themselves Perhaps Nozicks own interest in sports served this function Neither of his parents was born in this country His father who was widowed and has since remarried came to this country from Russia at the age of 17 The household he grew up in says Nozick was not bookish Did his parents want him to be a rabbi or learned man Oh no he says emphatically A doctor maybe something socially mobile like that Even if he ignored the medical profession Nozick has certainly been mobile Brooklyn to Columbia to Princeton to Harvard where he has been a full professor for 10 years now since his appointment at the age of 30 He lives in a modest private home in Belmont Mass with his wife Barbara a science teacher at a Hebrew junior high school and their two children who attend a public school there The Nozicks have been married for 20 years he does a lot of house keeping and she in turn is the first audience for many of his ideas As yet however Nozick has convinced none of his family of the truth of libertarianism Each day Nozick runs or bicycles the three miles from his home to his classes polishing his ideas along the way As a teacher Nozick was recently judged by the student evaluation guide as superficial and uncaring for his students Nozick demurs He regards himself as one of those teachers who project a definite personality perhaps inaccessible to some students but a decisive influence on those who take the trouble to carry on with him In this respect Nozick says he is what he calls the Sidney Morgenbesser type of teacher referring to the remarkable Columbia University philosopher who shepherded him into the subject when he was an undergraduate Nozicks dissertation was dedicated jointly to his wife Barbara and Morgenbesser a founder of the SPPA Sidney Morgenbessers stamp upon Nozick is evident in other ways as well He helped me see a way of being a Jewish academic Morgenbesser has an abnormal facility for subtle polemic and Talmudic distinction To become independent of the Morgenbesser sphere of influence a young philosopher must be ambitious enough to ignore the unconscious image of Morgenbesser peering critically over his spectacles Nozick was ambitious enough The first thing Nozick was anxious to say was that worrying out the details of the criticism given his book is not his current interest I dont see myself as just or primarily a political philosopher He does not intend to spend the rest of his life refining and polishing up Anarchy State and Utopia and would much rather discuss his new work which lies in other regions of philosophy Does this mean that he has become skeptical of his former libertarian allegiances To the contrary he explains that he sees it as his duty to express and dissemi Nozick thinks that even if lives could be saved by taxing affluent citizens a dime per year the result would be morally intolerable nate libertarian ideas He accepts no government money for his research as do so many academics on the libertarian ground that such a practice should not exist and that he will not contribute to its persistence And If cows and catfish have a right not to be eaten Nozick respects it Whos Who lists him as a member of a group called the Jewish Vegetarian Society Pressed to discuss his reaction to his critics Nozick pointed wearily to an abandoned crate the repository for stacks of critical pieces on his book Early on I read reviews that appeared in the general public press and enjoyed having the book reviewed  and then stopped I now get sent a lot of things that I really dont read I glance at them to see if theyre friendly or an attack If it is an attack I dont read it and if its friendly I dont read it We agreed that covers a lot of ground But Nozick justifies his attitude He found many of the reviews of the book mere mechanical rejections of his ideas and expects to learn nothing from them He will go further I think there is some deep psychological explanation that one should offer as to why people just automatically reject libertarian ideas I think it is going to turn out to be an uncomplimentary explanation for those people discussing what sorts of festering motivations lead them to impose their will on others and to feel threatened themselves about being left alone as independent individuals As for the criticisms that are not aggressively negative Nozick prefers to set them aside for a leisurely reading in the future he thinks he will learn more that way than by responding in a combative manner Indeed  a striking application of his political ideas to his own professionhe has come to deplore what he calls the coercive tone of philosophers I used to think that the ideal philosophical argument was to produce words that set up a change in the listeners brain so that if he doesnt accept the conclusion he dies It is as though what philosophers want is a way of saying something that will leave the person theyre talking to no escape Well why should they be bludgeoning people like that Its not a nice way to behave Nozick thinks that there are things in my book favoring individual liberty that should seem favorable to some on the left or at least the decentralized left In other words his position has something to please everybody a trait that is sometimes considered more a concession to the gallery than to truth But Nozick also thinks that he has given something to offend everyone The rightwing people like the profreemarket arguments but dont like the arguments for individual liberty in cases like gay rightsalthough I view them as an interconnecting whole and the liberty to engage in market transactions as continuous with other liberties And then there are the people on the left who like some of the personalliberation things but who dont like the things which they see as supporting private property And he adds Maybe no position that offends everybody in that could be all wrong Whether right or left or neither Nozicks book is addressed to one of the central problems of political philosophy At least since Thomas Hobbes noted that men must sleep and that when they sleep they need protection from enemies philosophers have assumed that the state should at least serve the function of providing security for its citizens But more than that they have also tried to argue that the state should promote certain collective aims  the maintenance of political and economic justice the conservation of natural resources the upkeep of public utilities and so forth But apart from these common goals stand individual rights the right to privacy or to freedom of thought religion speech and contract But promoting both the collective aims and the individual rights can lead to serious dilemmas Depending on how broadly or narrowly individual rights are drawn the powers of the state shrink or swell As Nozick expresses the problem How much room do individual rights leave for the state Philosophers have usually taken one of three approaches to this problem The most familiar of these is one that carefully meets the demands posed by both individual rights and collective aims Intelligent discretion to make balancing adjustments must be applied between the two case by case This moderate position is often thought to be the message of liberalism it is very roughly the approach of John Rawls Liberalism is often assumed to be dull but true Flanking it are two extreme positions assumed to be exciting but false One of these elevates the collective aims above all else juggling around the assignment of individual rights as much as is necessary to realize these aims Extreme instances of this approach can be found among totalitarians of every color Nozick takes the other extreme position Individual rights are rigid not tampering with them is more important than permitting the state to pursue some collective aim like welfare or social justice On grounds of moral principle then Nozick concludes that the only acceptable state is one that serves only to protect its citizenry against interference with their rights Like so many others confronted with this extreme view I asked Nozick what happens to concerns like economic justice in his ideal state Are they to be sacrificed entirely Isnt one of the reasons we are taxed the fact that everybodys business is nobodys business and we feel we ought to preserve justice and equality This set Nozick off The state isnt the enforcing agent for all morality People can voluntarily get together and do various sorts of things Its just that you have no right to force them to do that His stand on the limits of state power makes no provision for taking care of the needy other than by purely voluntary means If the helpless cannot persuade rich people to support them they will perish Doesnt this ask too little of us Since we are moral creatures since we live with others and learn from them can we allow ourselves to be indifferent to the suffering of other human beings Nozick thinks that even if lives could be saved by taxing affluent citizens only a dime per year the result would be morally intolerable  a view readers have found uncomfortably harsh And predictably Nozick opposes drug laws seatbelt laws protective tariffs and anticyclamate legislation These laws are examples of government telling us how to lead our lives Nozick wants them voted out Nozick considers the question How should things be distributed in society the improper approach to answering puzzles of social and economic justice If someone is resourceful and becomes a billionaire by using his wits there is nothing unjust about it as long as he hasnt interfered with the rights of other people in getting there But deciding whether others rights have been violated in the long career of a billionaire is a deep problem that Nozick concedes he has not adequately resolved Nozick further explains that his con troversial defense of free enterprise is all of a piece with his general ideas on justice Invoking the names of libertarian economists like Friedrich von Hayek he says that inflation recession and other undesirable economic phenomena are largely the result of illegitimate government activities that interfere with market efficiency But ultimately his opposition to state intervention in the market is once again based on moral principles It is unjust for it violates our right to dispose of our legitimately acquired property as we wish To coerce a man who wishes to decorate his dog with diamond collars into using the money for other purposes is as illegitimate as taking away his wife and forcing him to take on a different sexual partner This is what the dancing readers were delighted to hear In Nozicks words the trouble with government regulation of the market is that it prohibits capitalist acts between consenting adults It is not easy to tell whether his ideas capture current discontent with government Most of this discontent is vague and inconsistent Many people who resent government intrusion still favor unemployment insurance and Social Security pensions Most of it seems to be aimed at abuses of state power not state power itself One should separate the two It would be as silly to oppose state power because it had been abused as it would be to forbid scissors to be used for cutting paper because some psychopaths have used them as instruments of torture The historical evidence is that Americans have repeatedly voted in and legalized moral commitments that Nozicks ideal state could not enforce A century ago most Americans thoroughly opposed workmens compensation compulsory vaccination and even public libraries as attempts to give the poor something for nothing The objections leave Nozick cold In fact as he had said earlier his ideas manage to offend most people he never intended them to be a description of what most Americans feel however much hed like them to be He does not expect his views to be popular and is rather gloomy about their prospects for widespread influence  Anarchy State and Utopia offered another view to be put into the field so that its opponents wouldnt think that there just was no other alternative Philosophy offers other things besides intellectual Gallup Polls Nozick is more than willing to deflect the conversation to tell us what he thinks philosophy is all about This is unusual Although most philosophers have an opinion however misty on the definition of their subject they rarely spend a great deal of time discussing it It remains like so much else in philosophy a matter of opinion Apart from cynics who think there is nothing to discuss some philosophers imagining an intimate relationship between philosophy and the sciences think of themselves as cooperating participants in a scientific pursuit of truth Ttley look for theories hypotheses and results and want philosophers to maintain the same kind of detachment about practical issues as scientists do Others in the same camp disagree about philosophys capacity for influencing practice To them the philosopher is no longer a Hamlet who produces systematic nonsense and needs a bit more eternity to settle the question of whether to tell a white lie The same arguments break out among those who dont think of philosophy as scientific at all but who look at it as a personal activity that issues comprehensive absorbing pictures of the universe which help us to understand our place in it Nozick is therefore bold to say that his new book  Phil osophical Explanationsalready 550 pages long in first draft  will include among other things a new conception of how philosophy might be carried on As if this were not ambitious enough consider that the other things are detailed discussions of human knowledge free will selfidentity the foundations of ethics the meaning of life and even the hoary puzzle Why is there something rather than nothing Nozick says he has for some time viewed philosophy as properly falling under the humanities rather than under the sciences  and the mark of the humanities as I see it is a concern with values Philosophers should try he thinks to achieve a coherent conception of things that links up with values He wants philosophers to be judged primarily by the skill and richness of their arguments rather than merely by how near their ideas come to the truth or what we think is the truth And he admits  at the risk of derision from those who regard philosophy as a parent child or mimic of science that I really now view philosophy as an art form philosopher ambiguous Nozicks view of philosophy may not be entirely consistent but its emphasis on breadth of vision and free intellectual play might encourage overdue mutinies against the intimidating atmosphere of current philosophy It also matches his own talents very nicely It is unusual today for a philosopher to be at ease as he is with ancient problems that have been neglected  rather than resolved  by recent philosophy This neglect can assume odd forms Consider that Nozicks puzzle Why is there something rather than nothing was just a generation ago dismissed by the wellknown philosopher Sidney Hook as devoid of sense except as a sign of emotional anxiety Apart from pure philosophical work Nozicks principal amusement has been to write short stories and fables illustrating philosophical problems One of his recent fables describes the difficulties encountered by God in trying to prove His existence to us The idea of skywriting His name occurs to Him as does the scheme of letting us discover that the path of an elementary particle spells God exists in English cursive script But eventually He is resigned to failure and moans Whatever the nature of a signal why should people think it came from me Many of Nozicks critics think that the flaws in his political vision are reverberations of a fundamental error his absolutist conception of human rights Although this conception is the linchpin of his entire political philosophy it is never clearly argued for in anything Nozick has written Reading Nozick on rights one feels that the toughest work has been left out And he hardly discusses the questions about rights that most of his readers are straining to ask Even if no one wants to undergo the annoyance of military training should people be forced against their will to join an army to defend the social order if all people have rights because they are human beings should we intervene in the affairs of those societies where peoples rights are being abridged Should we step in to enforce the preservation of rights among dissident Jews in Russia or blacks in South Africa or Uganda Nolick recognizes that these problems arise for his position but claims that he will resolve them  later Nozick rephrases the old problem How much room do individual rights leave for the state His critics argue that individual rights must both restrain and be restrained by respect for collective aims Human rights are not as he suggests sacrosanct under all possible circumstances Nothing seems more fundamental than my right to decide what other people may do to my body But the right is not exceptionless even when I am not harming anyone else Should I be permitted to hire you to plunge a knife into my heart Does it matter if I am depressed when I hire you Is it my right to take a depressant in order to hire you Nozicks worship of rights in the abstract may lead to horrible consequences in complex practical situations As before Nozick sees the difficulty but complains that his critics want from him a total moral theory a complete answer to every difficulty This he claims is an unfair demand How many of them make the same demands of their own favorite ideas The sort of life Nozick wants for us is admirable I want it to be a free world where people who disagree with me can all lead the sort of life they want to lead without interfering in others lives But we dont want freedom in our lives at the cost of all other values  that would be logical lunacy Orphans and blind widows the starving and the helpless are free  Nozick would not permit anyone in his ideal state to interfere with their liberties But as this example shows no one values freedom above life itself a point tersely made in Bertolt Brechts maxim Grub first then ethics Many people think that Nozicks intransigence on the absolute priority of rights leads him into a kind of political romance  from myopia to utopia If this is so other philosophers must identify precisely where his arguments have failed It is remarkable how many of them are content to dismiss his work because they couldnt possibly believe what he says that he must therefore be pretending charges that border perilously on logical fallacy Accusations of this kind are really questions about his sincerity fueled by his obvious ambition to acquire intellectual influence The scholarly world rarely pardons such ambition When the philosopher David Hume declared that my ruling passion is the love of literary fame he was denounced by Samuel Johnson as a blockhead and a rogue Reactions of this sort against Nozick by the modern Dr Johnsons bring us nowhere in judging his significance Maybe no position that offends everybody could be all wrong muses Nozick But there is another different twist at the end of this story Even if Nozick is neither right nor Right even if his political ideas and activities are obscured by his conception of philosophy he has performed a valuable service He can be seen as an imaginative intellectual attorney goading us to reexamine our beliefs by persuasively arguing for a view that is unpopular and yet responds to our complex political needs That he has failed to answer some important criticisms does not detract from his importance By raising the problems he has he has immensely enriched the field That his view resists appraisal by crude rightleft yardsticks might turn out to be a signal of its virtues rather than otherwise Political ideas and distinctions like rightleft are at once useless but indispensable umbrella categories making mutable positions and inadequate labels a permanent feature of politics If they are to be helpful they need continual redefinition and adjustment to match new circumstances By crystallizing and intensifying debate about them the necessary adjustments might be proposed This catalytic process of seeking truth by forcing attention to alternative ideas through debate is not Nozicks invention but a permanently valuable element in philosophy Indeed whether philosophy can ever accomplish much more is itself what philosophers call a perennial question  and the perennial answers to it are conceded by them to be perennially disputable 
Buffalo Abortion Law Requiring Counseling Blocked by U.S. Judge,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/17/archives/buffalo-abortion-law-requiring-counseling-blocked-by-us-judge.html,A judge in Federal District Court in Buffalo has barred the enforcement of a new Niagara County antiabortion ordinance under which women were required to look at photographs of fetuses before they could obtain abortions The ordinance also required that women seeking abortions be told that the procedure could result in a number of complications ranging from hemorrhage and sterility to psychological problems and emotional disturbances The judge John T Elfvin issued a preliminary injunction against the ordinance on Friday ruling that New York State had preempted the field of regulating medical care including abortion Citing a 1972 State Court of Appeals decision as a precedent the judge said local authorities were prohibited from passing their own regulations on the subject The Niagara County Legislature passed the ordinance in October  with Dec 3 as the effective date  despite the advice of the countys lawyers The first assistant county attorney Michael Gold said yesterday that the lawyers had warned that the ordinance had serious legal difficulties Opponents of abortion however sup ported the measure Antiabortion groups in several parts of the country have begun to push for such ordinances as way of limiting abortions A similar ordinance was passed recently in Akron Ohio Its enforcement has been temporarily stayed pending litigation of a challenge in Federal District Court Notification of Husband The Buffalo ordinance was quite detailed It required that a woman give written consent to an abortion at least 24 hours before the procedure Before she could do so however the doctor had to provide extensive counseling including a detailed description of the fetus to be aborted The doctor was to describe the following appearance mobility tactile sensitivity brain and heart function the presence of internal organs and external members Said description shall also include a visual presentation through photographs of the development of a human fetus the ordinance added The ordinance also required that if a woman was married her husband be notified at least five days in advance of the proposed abortion and that he too be given an oral description of the fetus accompanied by photographs The New York Civil Liberties Union challenged the ordinance on behalf of a 20yearold Niagara Falls nursing student who was six weeks pregnant and wanted an abortion The civil liberties group with Barbara E Handschu of Buffalo and Steven R Shapiro of the organizations New York City office handling the case made several arguments that the state had preempted the field of regulating medical practice that the ordinance infringed on a womans constitutional right to receive an abortion that it denied equal protection of the laws and that it breached the constitutionally required separation of church and state
Medical Tapes System Relocated In Dispute in Massachusetts City,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/17/archives/medical-tapes-system-relocated-in-dispute-in-massachusetts-city.html,SPRINGFIELD Mass Dec 16 AP  Mayor Theodore E Dimauro who drew sharp criticism by confiscating six tapes on abortion and birth control from a telephone medical information system has announced that the system will be removed from city property A written statement issued on Thursday the firstterm Democratic Mayor said that he and Blue CrossBlue Shield of Massachusetts had mutually agreed that the system called TelMed would be moved out of Springfield Municipal Hospital But the insurance company said that it regrets the outcome of the dispute The system was installed last month with 180 recorded messages on topics ranging from common diseases to how to quit smoking cigarettes The nationally syndicated tape system operates in more than 170 communities After praising TelMed at a news conference when the system was introduced Mayor Dimauro an activist against abor tion removed six tapes from the electronic answering device He said that he wanted to review them to determine i they were suitable for the people of the city which has 175000 residents Mayor Dimauro refused to answer questions from reporters today as they crowded into his outer office to receive the statement The statement did not say whether Mayor Dimauro had found the tapes unsuitable The statement said that the real issue was whether spending tax dollars for a service which might be unacceptable to a large segment of our population was justified Later in the statement however Mayor Dimauro said The TelMed system is an informational program and as such I wholeheartedly endorse it
"Young People of Iran, Rejecting Modernism, Revive Islamic Values",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/17/archives/young-people-of-iran-rejecting-modernism-revive-islamic-values.html,TEHERAN Iran Dec 16  Afsaneh a 21yearold senior at the University of Teheran is prepared to die for the cause She says that three of her friends have already been killed while demonstrating If you call my home and my parents tell you Im not at home any more then youll know Ive been killed too she said The cause for which possibly hundreds of young Iranian men and women have already given their lives is the downfall of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi and the establishment of a new Islamic republic  a conservative Moslem nation that would subjugate them to religious traditions that their parents generation has been discarding over the last 20 years Some young women here caught in the crosscurrents of a culture undergoing change seem to draw a security from a return to conservative religious traditions that Westernization does not offer Not all Iranian women see such a trend as desirable But in Teheran where most females wear Western dress many college women are donning the chador a traditional allenveloping robe as a gesture of defiance explaining their action in words that sound quaint to Western ears  If you cover yourself you give your character its true value because people will not respond to you according to the the way you look but to what you are said Zahra Safyari a 25yearold graduate student I know a couple who are engaged both college graduates The man has never seen his fiancee without the chador but he fell in love with her the way she really is Nahid a sociology major at Pahlevi University who wears slacks and drapes her head in a brown scarf so that only her face and hands show recalled When I first started college my professors were telling us that we should kiss a boy if we like him even sleep with a man if we wanted to But inside we were confused We knew that it was spiritual love that matters Now we feel more secure because Islam tells us that it is the right way to feel It tells us how to live Not all women of course are as comforted by what is happening in Iran Maryam Mohgadam the 34yearold Britisheducated wife of an oral surgeon said Its exciting that we are being awakened to the values of our religion But the kind of society the mullahs want to create frightens me Its a terrible step backward Mullahs are Moslem religious leaders Iranian Women Have Made Strides In recent years Iranian women have made important strides They now represent onethird of the countrys work force and 37 percent of students in colleges and universities Women vote and in cosmopolitan cities like Teheran they generally do not wear the veil But in spite of this progress their position remains in many ways medieval For instance most brides are expected to produce a bloodsoaked handkerchief after the wedding night to prove virginity A husband can take a second wife if the first one consents and in rural areas the first wife is often forced to acquiesce An Iranian woman cannot travel without the consent of her husband A daughter inherits only half of what a son does from the family estate A wife inherits only oneeighth of her husbands estate and none of his fixed assets such as land If her husband dies she does not automatically become the guardian of her children unless both their grandfathers are dead These laws are based on Islamic traditions and are likely to be stiffened if the mullahdominated opposition takes power Mehrvash Safinia former president of the Federation of Iranian Womens Lawyers notes that the response of the lower house of Parliament to the religious fervor has been to draft legislation to further curb womens rights The bills would lower the age at which a woman can marry to 15 forbid women to serve in the armed forces and make abortion a capital crime Mrs Safinia who is a former deputy in the lower house declared I know my religion as well as any mullah and it its practiced faithfully Im not afraid of a theocracy Mohammed took his wife to battle with him He didnt keep her locked up at home The trouble is that men interpret the Koran Islams holy book to their own advantage Many women in the opposition feel they can hold their own in a new government even if it is controlled by religious leaders The men will not be able to push us aside said a 27yearold journalist We are fighting with them and dying with them They know we will not accept it Others are not as confident The best chance for Iranian women is to help the liberal political leaders increase their strength in the opposition movement said Homa Nateg a history professor at Teheran University Her caution may be weilfounded judging from the attitude of the mullahs the bazaaris merchants who finance much of the religious establish ment and from traditional Islamic teachings In his book Islam the Misunderstood Religion Muhammad Qutb a religious scholar says that Islam does not approve of womens outside activities as the West and Communist nations do For a woman cannot participate in social activities but at a cost to her real primary function within her home In the homes of mullahs and bazaaris their wives and daughters are never seen by visitors When questioned on the matter a wealthy baazari who lives in the conservative town of Amul near the Caspian Sea said that he did not oppress his wife and volunteered to let her appear for an interview The woman who wore a black veil looked from the absence of wrinkles around her eyes the only visible part of her face considerably younger than her 47yearold husband She never faced the interviewer and when a question was asked she whispered her response into her husbands ear He then relayed it in Farsi the dominant Iranian language to an interpreter who translated it into English Asked if she felt threatened by the current religious fervor the wife said that there was nothing unfair to women in the Islamic religion Asked whether she felt confined remaining home all the time she answered in the negative She had her sisters she said her sistersinlaw her brothers and uncles her children My life is very full Did she agree that in Iran men have much more power that women Of course in certain areas But women have the power in important areas like raising children Asked if she would prefer more freedom she said Look at American women Im told they have all kinds of freedom But they arent happy Theyre all seeing psychiatrists

About New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/19/archives/about-new-york-love-in-a-very-small-place.html,There is a style of young love in this city that has a couple set itself apart in a crowda tactile evecontact kind of love indulged as the world glances past on the larger business of society A case of this could be observed last Thursday in the waiting room of an abortion clinic on Queens Boulevard The surprising sight as the daily quota of 35 patients gather at the clinic which is called Choices is the number of males present with the women sianing up for the fivehour walkin walkout abortions The younglove male is mustachioed and in denim and he keeps his arm across the shoulders of a curly haired woman They share a downward ltok and he keeps talking slowly and softly to her as if in seduction There are several other men waiting two wearing windbreakers most having the look of lour decades of wear and tear with too much going on in their lives Marty of the women have the same vaguely yoked look There are a few motherdaughter couples in the room and one particularly young looking teen age girl works a crossword until its time for her abortion Merle Hoffman the director of the clime say that sometimes in the recovery room when the women are shedding the tension and realizing they re no longer pregnant there is banter that gets to the sobject of men and Their germinators role And one woman will loudly now celibacy and others will laugh Outside meanwhile hile there is impatience and anxiety among the males left waiting while the woman go through abortion One man is pacing determinedly in the exterior corridor as if this were a maternity ward During these wuts a man will sometimes call over one of the clone workers and quietly inquire for cur if the sex of the fetus can be deterrned Ah macho Miss Heirman says tolerantly She is too wise to editorialize about other womens relationships Besides she occasionally sees a male sign up for a vasectomy at Choices using the same operating room and looking just as beautiful and vulnerable as the women do Abortion was legalized in this state eight years ago and now whatever the extent of lingering controversy it is part of the citys daily routime Choices is a onestop clinic that performs over 100 abortions a week at 175 for a firsttrimester operation The women enter oft the lobby of a plann office building and fill the waiting room by 330 They fill out forins take bld and urine test are interswed have the abortion and recover for a few hour in bed it necessary in a pleasant room of warm   toys and hot coffee They are done by 9 clock at night Some take the IND sib home  up the block at the 630 Drise station Other ar esled by the waiting males The routine happen 5000 times a year The impotant thing is to make the women feel powerfulnot walkingout with their heads downtheir system serewed up Miss Hoffmana 32yearsold psychologist says From this point of view then the important step at Choices may not be in using the latest vacuum machinery in the two brilliantly lighted operating rooms as much as in taking the facilitators step This is the initial interview by a counselor facilitator in one of six private room furnished in plush chairs soft lights and warm tones with perhaps a Miro poster on one wall or a womans lib poster depicting Ms liberty with a tear in her eye in symnathy with the abortion struggle There is no desk by Miss Hoffmans design in order  reduce the sense of authority figure and patient vulnerability Just as Mrs Hollman has worked at other hale lou he Instead of the usual gaping hospital gown a patient wears a smart pover of Navy blue And gynecoloust use a preheated speculum in their examinations to counnter a since of shock and invaion Miss Hoffmans idea is to give a lener sen control to the patient including she says an extensive description of the process of abortion When abortion was legalied there was a great of political enthusiasm and expertise available after the struggle but the actual look of an abortion clinic was an unknown largely left to women Miss Hoffman says Having in Shape the Style and practices of the clinics has been an advantage she feel in which the womens liberation movement can help wrest control of medicalcare methods from authoritarian professionals affecting life far beyond the abortion issue On Thursday one of the facilitators Helen Schecterson pauses at her station to describe this average day They range from 14 years to 42 Years she says Most are married and have and theyve talked this over with their husbands Theres tension at first because of the old connotations I try to relax them Miss Hoffman has seen women who treat abortion casually as contraception and others who experience it as a cosmic event changing their life and girls as young as 11 following parental dictates or trying to skirt them For any of them she says it can never be easy even if it is legal It hardly looks easy for the wormen gatheted for the Thursday abortion sion They seem individuals to say the least and they seem to want alone even if there is a male hanging on nearby in the name of love or obligation From a state of reproduction on arrival the women Ieave five hours der in ghtened solitude They go back on to Queens Boulevard and the city themselves alone again

POPE TO TAKE PART IN MEXICO MEETING,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/23/archives/pope-to-take-part-in-mexico-meeting-decision-seen-as-show-of.html,ROME Dec 22  Pope John Paul II announced today that he will fly to Mexico next month to take part in a meeting of Latin American bishops scheduled to lay down the longrange policies of the church in the southern hemisphere In the traditional Christmas address to cardinals the Pontiff called for greater respect for the inalienable inherent human rights of man Human rights will be a major topic at the bishops conference In Puebla Mexico Peace in the world remains fragile the Pope said There can be no peace without justice and without respect for human rights The Pope also announced that Argentina and Chile had accepted his offer to mediate their dispute over three islands in the Beagle Channel southeast of Tierra del Fuego He said he will immediately send a representative to make contact with the two governments who he said accepted his offer last night Concerned About Open Conflict The Pontiff is known to have been concerned about the threat of a clash between Chile and Argentina and has previously offered to mediate The visit to Mexico will be the Pontiffs first trip outside Italy since he was elected more than two months ago He described the conference as an event of outstanding importance Some say that the future of the church will be decided in Latin Amerita he said Almoschalt the worlds Catholics live there The conference is the Third General Assembly of the Latin American Episcopate While official topic will be Spreading the faith in the present and future in Latin America the main discussion will be about the position the Latin American church should take on the pressing social and political issues facing the region At the last general assembly in Colombia 10 years ago progressive members of the Latin American hierarchy obtained acceptance of a policy statement that called on the church to side actively with the poor and dispossessed against the dictatorial regimes of the region In recent years conservative Latin American prelates have been attacking thesocalled liberation statement with increasing sharpness as being too Marxist and too leftist The conservatives have served notice that they will ask the Puebla conference to revise the statement in what would ambunt to a rightward swing of the church in Latin America John Paul II thus will find himself in the middle of a dispute between conservatives and progressives He is regarded as leaning to the progressives on social issues while on theology and on such issues as abortion celibacy for priests and the role of the clergy he has shown himself to be more in agreement with the conservatives Position on Human Rights The fact that he went out of his way to stress the importance of human rights and justice in his address today while at the same time announcing his trip to Puebla caused specialists here to conclude that he wants the church in Latin America to continue to take a strong position on human rights He is expected to state this view in Puebla The specialists noted that the Pontiff could have avoided personal involvement in the controversy by saying it was too early in his pontificate to make a trip abroad His predecessor John Paul I generally considered favorable to the progressive position in Latin America had announced that he would not go to Puebla The decision of John Paul II to enter the fray is seen by church sources here as further evidence of his determination to assert strong personal leadership on ail major issues facing the church
Strong Impact on Poor Reported From Cut in Medicaid Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/26/archives/strong-impact-on-poor-reported-from-cut-in-medicaid-abortions-cut.html,In Akron Ohio a woman applied at hospital for prenatal care She said that she would prefer to have an abortion but was having the baby because Medicaid which would not pay for an abortion would pay for a birth and welfare would pay to rear the child In Columbia SC a 24yearold woman could not pay the 370 to 550 that a legal abortion would cost She went to an illegal nonprofessional abortionist who charged only 110 Three days later she was taken to a hospital Her uterus had been torn by the abortion and a hysterectomy was necessary Nationwide three women have died in the last 16 months Federal officials say after botched nonprofessional abortions In Connecticut and Texas thousands of women got safe legal abortions by borrowing or scrimping to raise the fee or by finding a doctor or clinic that would reduce or eliminate it In New York and California thousands of poor women got safe legal abortions that were paid for by the state Those cases show some of the anomalies and the effects direct and indirect of the drastic reductions in free abortions for the poor that have been ordered by the Federal Government and by 33 states since August 1977 Federally funded abortions were reduced from as many as 350000 a year to fewer than 900 in the third quarter of this year At what cost does a woman who is getting maybe 86 on welfare manage asked Dr Steve Heartwell referring to having an abortion He works at the Maternal Health and Family Planning program of the University of Texas Southwest Medical School in Dallas which What Sacrifice for 150 charges 150 to 170 for a first trimester abortion What sacrifice does she have to make to raise 150 he asked Prostitution Selling her food stamps Borrowing from a loan shark at enormous interest Legal challenges to the reductions are under way in several parts of the country most of them brought by the American Civil Liberties Union In some states they have succeeded in restoring public financing of abortions at least temporarily But opponents of abortion and of public financing for abortions are pleased by the cutbacks If the babies are being born thats got to be a good effect said Gerald Bodell a Manhattan lawyer who represents three of the original Congressional sponsors of the Federal cutbacks Protection of the fetus is the whole point of the argument he said The full scope of the impact of fund cuts cannot be gauged partly because there are no comprehensive Government statistics and also because there is no way of knowing some things such as how many women who are having babies would have had abortions if the surgery had been free Effects Believed Substantial But the limited statistics that are available and interviews with doctors and other healthcare workers around the country suggest that the effects are substantial Federal funds had traditionally paid for half the cost of welfare abortions with the states paying the rest Then stringent restrictions on Federal funds for abortions were passed by Congress in 1976 were put into effect in August 1977 and have been modified somewhat over the last year They now allow Federalfinancing for abortions only where the womans life is endangered where the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest or where continuing the pregnancy would cause severe and longlasting physical health damage Some states including New York one of the largest providers of Medicaid abortions decided to pick up all or almost all the costs of abortions for the poor using state Medicaid money In eight states including California and New Jersey state financing for all abortions is still generally available However this is a result of court orders so that condition may merely be temporary 33 States Limit Aid In 33 states including Connecticut state funds are currently available only in limited circumstances similar to those in which Federal funds are available In the more restrictive states some doctors and clinics are offering poor women abortions at low cost or even free At Reproductive Health Services in St Louis Mo for example the standard fee for a first trimester abortion is 170 but for a woman on welfare the maximum charged is 130 and a typical charge is 50 But often doctors and clinics do not want their charity advertised for fear they will be deluged with requests for reduced charges Nobody really wants to talk about this around here said Joseph E Cobb the director of public relations for the Maine Medical Center in Portland Some clinics and hospitals feel that they can afford to provide lowcost or free abortions only in the most desperate cases One is the Hartford Hospital in Hartford Conn which gives abortions to some indigent women but turns others away Other clinics feel that they cant afford to cut rates at all Numbers Are Not Known In the face of this some women are deciding to go ahead with their pregnancies No one has any idea how many are making this decision but health workers suspect the number is high Some clinics for example say that far fewer indigent women have even inquired about or applied for abortions than in the days before the cutoffs At Reproductive Health Services in St Louis according to Judith Widdicombe the director the percentage of patients who were on welfare was 32 percent before the cutoff By December 1977 it had dropped to 9 per cent Now it is back up to 27 per cent but only Mrs Widdicombe said because the clinic put on an outreach campaign designed to inform people in poor neighborhoods that lowcost abortions could be arranged At Akron General Hospital in Akron Ohio a number of the indigent women who signed up for prenatal care in recent months told hospital workers that they were continuing their pregnancies rather than having abortions solely because of financial considerations Some Try to Raise Funds Theyre more or less forced to because of their financial condition and they have to go through with the unwanted pregnancy said Ann Haas the hospitals director of medical social services Other women attempt to raise funds for abortions with varying results Some women spend so much time trying to gather the funds that by the time they get their abortion they are in their second trimester of pregnancy and the abortion is much more complicated and expensive Here again no one knows how many women have done this but there are indications that the number could be significant Morton Silver of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut said that his organization had heard of many such cases The Federal Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has compared cases of women who suffered abortionrelated complications It found that those women who were indigent and lived in states with Medicaid cutoffs had obtained their abortions an average of two weeks later than two other groups of women  nonindigent and the indigent who lived in states where Medicaid was available Significantly Later Stage The indigent women were on the average in their 13th week of pregnancy at the time of abortion compared to the 11th week for the others  a significantly later gestational stage according to Dr Willard Cates Jr director of the centers abortion surveillance project What do women do when they are unable to raise the money even after several weeks of looking and cant find a clinic that will operate free From the reports coming into the center from hospitals Dr Cates said we know that some women are resorting to nonphysicians or selfinduced abor dons The number of women doing this does not appear to be large he said but the figure is unknown A letter from a doctor at the disease control center to the lawyer representing the Federal Government in a lawsuit told of a selfabortion involving a 21yearold woman in Wichita Kan a woman who normally would be eligible for Medicaid for her general health care She was told by personnel at the Medicaid office that it was illegal for public funds to be used to pay for an abortion the letter said The woman apparently interpreted this to mean that abortions were illegal and on returning home was advised by a girlfriend to use a Drano douche to induce the abortion This woman then applied Drano in douche form for three days after which she was admitted to hospital with pelvic sepsis and renal failure Treatment of this condition required hysterectomy antibiotics and supportive therapy for the renal failure The nonphysician abortionists include people like Lucy Jackson a 59yearold woman of Columbia SC who was convicted of performing an illegal abortion and sentenced to six months imprisonment The procedures they offer are as primitive and dangerous as they were in the days when abortion was a crime The abortion that Lucy Jackson gave her 24yearold client took five minutes a report of the disease control center said It involved packing the young womans uterus with gauze inserting a rubber tube and telling her to leave the tube in place for at least three days but no longer than two weeks How many women have tried these methods it is impossible to say Illegal abortions are by their nature secret they rarely come to light unless the woman is severely injured or dies Three Deaths Reported So far Dr Cates said the Federal authorities have found three deaths related to the fund cutoff One was that of an indigent 27yearold woman from South Texas who heard about the Medicaid cutoff got a cheap illegal abortion and died of complications a few days later in October 1977 Dr Cates declined to detail the two other deaths he said that they were more indirectly related to the cutoff The legal status of the fund cutoffs is unclear The Federal Medicaid cutoff was mandated in 1976 under the Hyde Amendment so called after its sponsor Representative Henry S Hyde of Illinois Initially a Federal district judge in Brooklyn John J Dooling enjoined the amendment from going into effect in response to a legal challenge by the civil liberties union the Center for Constitutional Rights Planned Parenthood of New York City and others The injunction was lifted in August 1977 after a United States Supreme Court ruling on abortion that upheld statutes of two states Connecticut and Pennsylvania limiting Medicaid financing of abortions Challenge Is Renewed Now however in a continuation of his original lawsuit Judge Dooling is considering a renewed legal challenge to the current Federal law The challengers have raised many arguments that the Social Security Act requites the states to continue to fund medically necessary abortions even if the Federal Government doesnt that the Federal cutoff violates the Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws and that it violates the First Amendment requirement of separation of church and state Judge Dooling heard final arguments Dec 4 In recent months several courts in other states hearing challenges to the cutoff of state funds have been swayed by arguments similar to some of those made by the challengers in Judge Doolings case But some of those court rulings are now on appeal Whatever the legality the cutoff has been emotionally rending for those on both sides of the issue At the final arguments before Judge Dooling A Lawrence Washburn Jr a lawyer arguing in behalf of the cutoff stressed that fetal life should be protected Mr Washburn represented Isabella M Pernicone an opponent of abortion who has been named guardian of the interests of the unborn in the litigation Conscience of Congress He also made another point that the cutoff was giving effect to the conscience of Congress The director of obstetrics at Hartford Hospital Dr Clay Burchell voiced some of the anguish on the other side The hospital gives abortions at reduced fee for some of the needy women who seek them but not to all such women he saidsome cant get them Abortion is a tragedy he said but the original tragedy is unwanted pregnancy Its awful to turn people away because they cant pay he said And its really the only time we do it
"For Many Couples, Infertility Means Prolonged Anxiety",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/26/archives/for-many-couples-infertility-means-prolonged-anxiety-some-of-the.html,Every month she said it hits her like a bomb went off When she gets her period and has to face one more time the fact that she still isnt pregnant she sits and sobs for hours Im getting better she added grimly I used to cry for two days now I only cry for one She is depressed ail the time Her husband is working two extra jobs to pay for the fertility treatments which some months cost as much as 1000 He comes home exhausted unable to cope with his wifes inconsolable desolation They fight constantly about stupid things Sex is mechanical on schedule as the doctor ordered The times we have to we do the wife said her voice lifeless The times we dont have to dont feel like it Both 28 years old they cant talk about anything but The Problem and after four years of it they cant bear to talk about it anymore But there is no one else to talk to because they refuse to tell anyone close to them Infertility is like a social disease said the husband bitterly Terrified that someone might guess her identity the wife refused to reveal even the borough they live in She admitted she was obsessed by their failure to conceive and added When youre facing something like this you feel like youre the only one who has this problem Some of the Reasons However this couple is far from alone Medical experts estimate that one in five couples of childbearing age more than 10 million people in this country  have some kind of infertility problem either in conceiving a child or in carrying it to term And the numbers are growing Doctors cite a variety of reasons including the increasing incidence of venereal disease and abortions both of which can cause damage to the reproductive system Such contraceptive methods as the pill and the IUD can also interfere with fertility In addition more people are getting married at a later age and a growing number of women are postponing childbirth until well into their lessfertile 30s But despite its prevalence infertility has long been surrounded by a kind of social taboo and only recently has the subject begun to emerge from the closet where many still keep it hidden It is a difficult topic for those whose lives have been affected by it As one man said of dealing with infertility The medical process is the easy part The emotional impact can be devastating It you cant conceive a child that means youre not a man to some people said a Long Island teacher Another husband a 42yearold photographer recalled the night his wife came home with test results showing he had a low sperm count When I found out I went bananas he said I was in a rage My first reaction was that it wasnt true My sense of masculinity was directly involved Anxiety About Masculinity Doctors and other professionals report that some men feel so threatened by the subject they refuse even to undergo a sperm test Its my impression that men make a more direct equation between the production of sperm and their own virility than women do between the production of an egg and their femininity observed Barbara Eck Menning the founder of Resolve a national infertility counseling and support group based in Boston But women too can be profoundly affected A 32yearold social worker confided tearfully Im sort of ashamed of it I feel inadequate I feel it means Im not a total woman Her husband added Children are a badge of accomplishment in this society People get up at their high school reunions and say I have four children and this and that If you dont have them you feel like an outcast  as though theres something wrong with you Her husbands low sperm count notwithstanding the social worker blamed herself as well wondering whether her own shaky emotional state is inhibiting conception It is always a bilateral problem said Dr Sherwin Kaufman director of Lenox Hill Hospitals Infertility Clinic Its a unique condition its the only medical problem that involves two people and their interaction According to Mrs Meaning who is nurse So often people presume this is the womans problem but up to 40 dercent of infertility problems are based in the male Another 40 percent are in the female and 20 percent are either shared problems or of unknown cause With women said Dr Kaufman some of the more common causes of infertility are absent or faulty ovulation partial or complete blockage of the fallopian tubes and cervical secretions which interfere with sperm ascent With men he added the difficulty usually involves defects in the number quality or motility of the sperm Whatever the cause the problem can put a tremendous strain on a marriage according to Steven and Laurie Goldstein a young Bronx couple who are having trouble conceiving Mr Goldstein who is 36 said You see people saying to each other Its your fault No its your fault The 30yearold Mrs Goldstein added Its put a lot of tension on our relationship but it also tests us in some ways its brought us very close And indeed some couples endure infertility and its emotional drain year after year paying the mental as well as the financial costs to pursue the dream that seems so simple for other people and so impossible for them Kass and Al McGowan who live in East Quogue LI have been trying to have a child throughout their 14year marriage They have spent more than 25000 on fertility drugs and artificial insemination attempts on examinations and appointments on her operation for tubal adhesions and his for a varicocele dilated veins of the scrotum believed to be affecting his sperm motility They are still optimistic dutifully making their weekly visits to the Fertility Research Foundation in Manhattan where they have now invested their hopes after giving up on eight or 10 doctors But like most couples who have dealt with infertility over a long period of time they are knowledgeable about its often complex origins and while they applaud such recent medical advances as last summers first test tube baby they recognize that couples with multiple fertility problemi may never benefit In my opinion it solidifies the love that AI and I are building Mrs McGowan said softly about their long trial She and her husband spoke of the compassion and understanding they have developed for each other in the process but like other such couples they also noted the pain and jealousy they feel when for instance a friend has a baby When you see other people get pregnant Mrs McGowan said you feel angry Why is it so easy for them and why isnt it for me You know what a tremendous amount of love you have to give and you look at all the people who do have children who shouldnt The McGowans who have one adopted child live according to a strict regimen dictated by the monthly fluctuation in temperature that signals Mrs McGowans ovulation Every morning Kass has to put the thermometer in her mouth before she gets out of bed Mr McGowan explained When ovulation is indicated be said We either make love or come to the institute to do an insemination Its pretty anxietyproducing especially after you drive 100 miles fighting the traffic Whose Fault Is It Doctors find that many men become impotent when confronted with the necessity for command performances on schedule Other peoples reactions can also exacerbate a couples difficulties Rs very uncomfortable when someone comes up to you and says Whose fault is it reported Ernest DAngelo a housing developer from Bloomfield NJ who plans his business trips around his wifes ovulation every month Youd be surprised what pressures that puts on a marriage he added DAngelos wife Carol a 32yearold medical assistant has been trying to

Judge to Determine Fate of Louisiana Abortion Law Soon,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/26/archives/judge-to-determine-fate-of-louisiana-abortion-law-soon-final.html,NEW ORLEANS Dec 25  A Federal judge will decide next month whether Louisianas antiabortion law believed to be the strongest in the nation should stand His ruling is expected to have an impact on abortion legislation now being considered around the country The state law passed by the Louisiana Legislature last summer was scheduled to go into effect Sept 8 but has been blocked until the case is decided by Judge Robert F Collins The case was heard without a jury Judge Collins will issue a ruling after Jan 15 the deadline set for lawyers to file their posttrial briefs The abortion law was challenged as unconstitutional by the American Civil Liberties Union a pregnant woman desiring an abortion three New Orleans doctors and three abortion clinics Final Arguments Made From October to midDecember questions of when human life begins and where womens rights end were argued here intermittently before audiences that included homemakers and employees of abortion clinics Members of the Louisiana Right to Life organization and others favoring strict abortion laws crowded into the Federal courtroom Dec 13 to bear the final arguments Attorneys for the civil liberties union concentrated their attack on three main provisions of the law One provision requires a doctor to counsel a woman seeking an abortion on the dangers of the procedure and to tell her that the fetus is an unborn child that may be viable if more than 22 weeks have elapsed since conception It also mandates a 24hour wait between the time of application for the abortion and the abortion The second provision requites doctors to notify the parents of teenage girls seeking abortions and the third requires that abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy take place in a hospital A similar ordinance passed in Akron Ohio has also been challenged by the civil liberties union Doctors Gave Testimony Over 13 days of testimonyand arguments interrupted by several postponements doctors and scientists testified that the new law would discourage women especially poor and young women from seeking abortions or would send them to criminal abortionists and would also inhibit doctors from performing abortions Michael Connelly the Assistant Attorney General who wrote the abortion legislation before he was appointed to his present job called physicians and a lawyer to testify that the new law was fair and was necessary to protect the lives of women and their unborn children In final arguments Judith Levin the attorney for the civil liberties union charged that the law had set the state up to go after abortion clinics and their doctors that it was vague and overbroad and would endanger the life of a pregnant woman at the expense of protecting the fetus that she would like to abort She said that many elements of the new law had already been struck down as unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court or lower courts She also argued that the law violated freedom of religion by describing a reus as an unborn child from the moment of conception and violated rights of privacy by authorizing state searches of the records of abortion clinics The laws purpose is harassment of abortion providers in making their lives as difficult as possible she said adding that there was no similar state regulation of other kinds of medical clinics She said that the state requirement for abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy to be performed in hospitals would place a financial hardship on women because hospital abortions were much more expensive than clinic abortions She then added that no Louisiana hospitals performed second trimester abortions and that only a few performed any abortions Mr Connelly in his final arguments defended the new law as necessary to protect women from serious medical complications including sterility The law he said is designed to prevent abortion clinics from becoming abortion mills He vigorously defended the laws declaration that life begins at the moment of conception and denied that the laws description of the fetus as an unborn child violated the constitutional guarantee to freedom of religion We had doctor after doctor testify its a scientific fact he said The fact of the matter is its a human life and it can be nothing else
DOCTOR HELD LIABLE IN ABNORMAL BIRTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/28/archives/doctor-held-liable-in-abnormal-births-albany-high-court-asserts.html,If a doctor fails to advise a patient properly that she faces particular risks of bearing an abnormal child and she then gives birth to such a child the doctor may be required to pay the lifelong special costs of caring for it the New York State Court of Appeals ruled yesterday The court split 5 to 2 on the issue The dissenters asserted that the ruling would prompt doctors in marginal cases to recommend abortions rather than risk being sued In some cases they said otherwise healthy children will be unnecessarily aborted as the only alternative to the threat of pecuniary liability Through the ruling by the states highest court New York joined a growing number of states that in recent years have allowed doctors to be subject to lawsuits in such cases Numerous other states though  perhaps half according to lawyers in the case  have continued to bar this kind of litigation The court acted in two companion cases from Long Island one involving a 3yearold retarded and braindamaged girl suffering from Downs syndrome commonly known as mongolism the other involving a girl who was born with a kidney disease and died of it when she was 2 The mother in the first case Dolores Becker was 37 at the time she became pregnant in September 1979 The risk of bearing a child with Downs syndrome increases with age There is a test known as amniocentesis that can be given to pregnant women to determine if the fetus has this disorder Mrs Becker was not given the test She says she was not advised of the risks of Downs syndrome or of the existence of the test In the second case the mother Betty Park gave birth in 1969 to a child who had the polycystic kidney disease and died five hours after birth By her account her dottors ndYised her that her chances of having a second child with that affliction were practically nil She then became pregnant again and gave birth to the child involved in the case Both women with their husbands sued their doctors on a number of counts The premise underlying their cases is that they had known of the risks of bearing abnormal children  and in Mrs Beckers case if she had taken the test  they would have obtained abortions Yesterdays ruling does not mean that the doctors in either case are necessarily liable Nor does it mean that doctors generally will automatically be found liable in such cases The standard rules developed in negligence cases and also in medical malpractice cases apply  in a case involving Downs syndrome for instance it would probably have to be shown that it is accepted medical practice in that area to give the amniocentesis test for women of that age group For the Beckers and the Parks there must now be trials of the factual claims The trials could be as far as year or two away However the decision is likely to have a quicker impact on the profession generally A lawyer for the doctors in the Becker case Walter F Wortman said that as a practical matter a lot of doctors will interpret the decision as almOst requiring amniocentesis which involves withdrawing fluid from the amniotic sac The result is that a medical decision will now be made on legal grounds not medical grounds he said And with amniocentesis in particular he said there is another problem The procedure has some risks including slightly more chance of miscarriage It is possible he said that women who have the test and suffer complications will sue their doctors for malpractice Doctors will be in a bind he said explaining Theyre damned if they do and damned if they dont The lawyer for the Beckers John Anthony Bonina also predicted wide impact for the ruling As he saw itthough it is a victory for patients I think its a great day for the people of the State of New York I think patients needed it he said The courts decision  with Judge Matthew J Jasen writing the majority opinion  did not specify what expenses the doctors could be required to pay saying that issue was best left to trial It was clear though that the case involved a great deal of money both for clients in the two specific cases before the court and in cases generally A person suffering from Downs syndrome now has a normal life expectancy according to Mr Bonina Care in an insti tution could cost as much as 35000 a year Asked how much the Beckers might receive Mr Bonina said I intend to better my own record His record he went on was a verdict of 4041775 won last June for a client in a medical malpractice case involving a 34year old woman braindamaged as a result of an unnecessary operation I expect this case will dwarf my 4 million verdict he said The doctors sued in the Park case were Herbert Chessin and Allen Gibstein of New Hyde Park LI in the Becker case Burton D Garfinkel Stuart Bednoff and Eugene D Schwartz of Great Neck LI

It's the Last Day for The Finest Legal Mind in the State’,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/31/archives/the-legacy-of-chief-judge-charles-breitel.html,Upon beginning his judicial career in 1950 Charles D Breitel who retires today as Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals was praised by Gov Thomas E Dewey as possessing the finest legal mind in the state That was no small compliment from Mr Dewey who as the racketbusting prosecutor in Manhattan during the 1930s had recruited several young aggressive and talented lawyers who went on to become leaders of the legal profession Had Mr Dewey been elected President in 1948 Judge Breitels swearingin ceremony might well have been to the United States Supreme Court instead of to the Supreme Court of New York the trial court of general jurisdiction I almost was a lot of things Judge Breitel once told an interviewer Not until 1966 did he reach the states highest Court where for the past five years he has been Chief Judge A man of rigorous intellect pugnacious inquisitiveness short temper and unswerving allegiance to precedent Judge Breitel will become affiliated with the Manhattan law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz  Mendelsohn He leaves behind a legacy that will not easily be duplicated It was Judge Breitel who wrote the opinion upholding the states liberalized abortion law of 1970 and was Judge Breitel who wrote the opinion saying poor people seeking a divorce did not have the right to be represented by a lawyer paid from public funds He wrote the opinion invalidating the moratorium on 1 billion in New York Citys shortterm notes noting that while the city was in dire straits life too was a succession of emergencies and the citys financial problems could not be compared say to nuclear decimation He also wrote the opinion later affirmed by the United States Supreme Court upholding the landmark designation for Grand Central Terminal His successor is not known yet but it is clear to lawyers judges and professors who follow the court closely that whoever is chosen the court will shift in important if yet uncharted ways By Jan 15 in the first time the appointive process has been used for the states highest court Governor Carey must choose the states 31st chief judge from among seven names given him this month by the Commission on Judicial Nomination The choice must be confirmed by the Senate Since three of those men are Republicans and not given much of a chance and since two Democrats are outsiders who are not now on the court speculation has focused on Matthew J Risen arid Lawrence H Cooke both associate judges on the court With a full head of snowy white hair Judge Jaser at 65 is a movie directors ideal of what a senior judge should look like Next to Judge Breitel he has the most seniority and because of this he is Judge Breitels choice as his successor He is from a suburb of Buffalo and served as a United States Military Court judge in Heidelberg Judge Cooke who is 64 has the folksy personalized manner of a smalltown politician is considered quite liberal and has been publicly praised by the Governor He is from Monticello and served as co lower court judge for 20 years he Chief Judge has the saute single vote as an associate judge but by his intellectual magnetism can shape a court in the waychief Justice Earl J Warren the the 1960s If as expected the next Chief Judge conies from the ranks of sitting court memhers the Governor will then get the chance to name an associate judge and that seventh judge will also have a significant ef fect in shifting the direction of the court At present three judges Sol Wachter Judge Cooke and Jacob D Fuchsberg who once coveted the Chief Judges job but did not even apply for the opening this time form a loose coalition of liberal judges An additional judge of liberal persuasion would give them a majority For the last four years the lineup of judges has been the same and while no one suggests that Judge Breitel has brought it back to the reputation it enjoyed in the 1920s as the premier appellate court in the country when Benjamin Cardozo was Chief Judge it has recaptured its place among the top rank of state courts  a position that many felt the California Supreme Court clearly held for several years With the lineup of the court so unsettled many regulars who argue before it have preferred to bring their cases before Judge Breitel rather than wait for his successor Long before he joined the Court of Appeals Judge Breitels jurisprudential philsopophy was wellknown In a 1965 lecture that has been widely reprinted and quoted Judge Breitel concluded The power of the courts is great indeed but it is not a power to be confused with evangelic illusions of legislative or political primacy If this is true then selfrestraint by the courts in lawmaking must be their greatest contribution to the democratic society His philosophy has been vividly expressed in recent decisions of the court Many of these decisions were by close votes often 4to3 and that saddened and disturbed Judge Breitel who felt it was his task as Chief Judge to have the court speak on important issues with one voice To decide where ultimate truth is by 4to3 is folly he once complained A year ago by a 4to3 vote the court declared unconstitutional key portions of the states death penalty statute The majority opinion was written by Judge Cooke and it has not gone unnoticed that the Governor is a vehement opponent of the death penalty and was pleased with the decision Judge Jasen who has often voted with Judge Breitel joined in a dissent written by the Chief Judge who in voting to uphold the constitutionality of the law said the ultimate issue is whether society through its legislature or lawmaking body may determine the usefulness of capital punishment or whether judges are empowered to do so recognizing that capital punishment has been a sanction throughout the history of AngloAmerican law He found the legislature had acted properly In a highly unusual footnote Judge Breitel then de scribed his personal feelings on the subject Speak ing for myself alone among the dissenters he said I find capital punishment repulsive unproven as an effective deterrent unworthy of a civilized society because of the occasion of mistakes and changes in social values as to what are mitigating circumstances and the brutalizing of all those ho participate directly or indirectly in its infliction
Be Armed With Facts,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/31/archives/be-armed-with-facts-woman.html,ID thought myself inured to cockeyed gynecologist stories but I heard one recently that seemed to me to border on the bizarre An acquaintance of mine who was interning in an obstetricsgynecology service was called to assist in an emergency hysterectomy that took place in the middle of the night The chief resident on the ward who performed the procedure did so with what my friend considered impeccable style and skill But just afterward as the patient lay unconscious upon the table the physician held the newly detached uterus aloft My friend glanced at his face and said quizzically You look  pleased Ah yes I am he answered Another small victory in Mans unending battle against the womb THE WOMAN PATIENT Medical and Psychological Interfaces Vol 1 Sexual and Reproductive Aspects of Womens Health Care Edited by Malkah T Notman MD and Carol C Nadelson MD 363 pp New York Plenum Press 1950 This tale is I recognize an extreme of the type but it does point up the kinds of problems that confront the female patient Women do first of all visit physicians frequently on matters pertaining to sexual and reproductive function such as advice on contraception treatment of minor vaginal infections pregnancy monitoring menstrual difficulty menopausal symptoms disorders of the breast ovaries uterus and course routine wellpatient care The male patients health care is by no means so strongly oriented toward the maintenance of the genital and reproductive organs He may see his doctor about one of a far more delimited number of presenting problems ie problems of potency fertility prostate difficulties but clearly the medical treatment that he seeks and receives isfar less directed toward this particular organ system Moreover the male patient usually will be consulting a physician of his own sex the female patient typically will not In short the woman will be seeing her male doctor more frequently about sexual and reproductive problems difficulties and issues The discussions that arise and the treatment she receives may be charged with emotional significance far beyond the merely medical and practical  for her for her doctor or both Arm yourself with information is the strong underlying message of a book overflowing with medical information and psychological insight The Woman Patient edited by psychiatrists Malkah T Notman and Carol C Nadelson contains some 25 wideranging chapters that include essays on genetic counseling prenatal influences sexual dysfunctions in the female breast cancer and the psychological issues and considerations relating to mastectomy There is an excellent chapter on the impact of rape and the one on gynecological surgery is I believe the most concise and informative piece of reportage on the subject available anywhere This particular chapter Surgical Gynecology can serve as an example of the best of the material contained in the book It offers a very accessible overview of current medical knowledge about surgical sterilization and abortion there is also an explanation of the indications for and against hysterectomy that never condescends and should be required reading for any woman contemplating that operation After reading this material someone I know actually canceled planned surgery But the physicianauthors who contributed this chapter Drs Ann Barnes and Caroline Tinkham dont limit themselves to a dry recitation of the medical information on gynecological surgical procedures They go on to discuss the kinds of relationships that often develop between the frightened female patient and her distancing actionoriented surgeon Frequently note the physicians women patients try to placate this seemingly omnipotent personage they feel a need to do so as a way of warding off imagined reprisals or rejection and aso as a means of achieving their desired ends that is to be cured and not to be abandoned But the female patient in her role as Good Little Girl does what the doctor tells her to do she refrains from questioning his decisions or querying him about procedures he may he undertaking  vital though having the answers might be to Her fantasy that she will be taken care of if she behaves well is an expensive one It involves divesting herself of her adult rights and entitlements and empowering the physician to make decisions unilaterally This book is intended to help women move away from a helpless childlike stance visavis paternalistic doctors Many though not all of the chapters in The Woman Patient were written by physicians many though not all were written by women Clearly because there are a number of different authors one doesnt find the same standard of excellence throughout But most of the book is remarkahly good the material is packed with fascinating medical tidbits as well as a lot of very serviceable information Amusing and probably well worth noting is the fact that the editors saw fit to include in the hook  which is subtitled Sexual and Reproductive Aspects of Womens Health Care chapter on cosmetic urgery wondered what it was doing there but at the same time found myself learning a great deal about the selfbeautifying operations and the particular psychological factors that may be at play in the woman patient who seeks them 
"Pregnancy, Motherhood And Decisions",https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/31/archives/connecticut-opinion-pregnancy-motherhood-and-decisions.html,DEAR June Congratulations on your baby son David A new baby at midlife maturity is indeed a special joy  for some of us I myself had a fourth child a son not at 43 after a 15year interval but at 35 after a fiveyear pause Unlike yourself I made a deliberate decision which was followed by special pleasures greater confidence in how to rear a child less fear of making a harmful mistake than with the first child more leisure to enjoy his babyhood than with the middle children and somewhat more economic security to ease the difficulties of making the ends meet the means So having experienced the triumphant joy of a beautiful baby at just the right time in life whatever year that may be I would like to discuss your choice with you since you opened the matter to the public The following letter was written in response to a Nov 19 article by June S Rice on having a baby at the age of 43 You say your child was unexpected after 15 years But you also say he was a child of renewed love You say you feel like a 20yearold and have rediscovered that the relationship be tween mother and child has its own mysterious rewards but that your friends find this hard to believe I find it hard to believe that anyone already a willing mother could have forgotten these things Then too with all the happiness you find in your David I wonder how unexpected he really was Somehow I wonder if you did not rather knowingly cooperate with the circumstances that lead to pregnancy if conception occurred in the frame of mind that children have when falling off the dock after their parents said the hour was late and the lake too cold for swimming Conception accidentally on purpose is a frequent phenomenon you know and not infrequently serves the purpose of a reprise of youth Did you really consider abortion If so why You say you always had a reverence for life and a belief that abortion is an abuse of life Why then were you so ambivalent and so susceptible to being coerced into abortion You mention no circumstances to suggest a compelling need for abortion You do not mention poverty or a severely handicapped older child needing constant care and heavy expense a husband unemployed or in failing health dependent ailing parents or being the principal support of your family Certainly motherhood does not preclude being a freelance writer Your description of your situation is more than a bit suggestive of trying to relieve yourself of guilt for almost taking an action you would have regretted rather than a revelation of moral sensitivity You seem to have considered abortion for trivial inappropriate reasons which would have been harmful for you and your family I rejoice that you rejected an action which would have been wrong for you and rejoice with you in your new baby But your conclusion from this that other women should not have the opportunity to make their own decision for themselves is deeply disturbing You were frightened by the possibil ity that you might have chosen badly so now you want to prevent others from having the right to choose when to be a mother Does not this show contempt for them What makes you think others are morally and spiritually inferior to yourself Thousands even millions in your situation would not have considered abortion even those who are in more adverse circumstances I have mentioned earlier several siVations in which regard for sentient living struggling people might have precedence over the interests of an embryo Or suppose your fetus had been recognized as being hopelessly defective condemmed to a life of pain Suppose instead of 43 you were 30 years younger a victim of sexual abuse within the family as we have now discovered many children are At the age of 13 pregnancy does indeed become body and mind virtually torn apart assaulted by an unknown entity in a way and with lifelong consequences which you admit are beyond your comprehension Still you would take choice away from this young woman many years short of the maturity which made possible your fulfilling experience and for whom pregnancy delivery and childmotherhood would be a stigma and a lifelong memory of torment What I am saying is Because you feel guilty for having considered abortion for small reasons you are trying to gain absolution for your temptation by being eager to deprive others of the right to choose ignoring reasons of enormous moral and physical seriousness In this temptation you display contempt for the spiritual values and the moral responsibility of your fellow human beings particularly other women Why were you so ambivalent and so susceptible to being coerced into abortion There is another aspect of your letter  your description of the behavior of doctors which is not credible to me I am glad you report your discoveries as being hearsay not from your own experience Unless a woman has already made up her mind to have an abortion going to a physician or clinic to arrange for that purpose the question when do you want the abortion would not be asked by any physician or counselor I have encountered You use the phrase abortion on demand instead of the more accurate elective abortion No one is compelled to per form abortions so no one can successfully demand them The law says that a woman with her physician can decide for herself In this respect it is the same as any other elective that is an optional medical procedure A doctor must be willing and an approved facility must be available No one can demand or command but only decide and arrange Maybe you forgot that Yes June you are right when you say that if we are given the freedom to choose then we must choose well You after turmoil chose well for you I am truly happy for you I can still although they are now mature men look at each of my children and feel tears of joy in gratitude for their being But we you and I owe to other people to younger women especially respect for their integrity and the dignity of choice which has meant so much to you as well as to me 
The Gavel Pounds Again in Hartford,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/31/archives/connecticut-weekly-the-gavel-pounds-again-in-hartford-school.html,HARTFORD THE minority leader of the State House of Representatives R E Van Nostrand was sitting in his office one Sunday just before the last election when a fellow resident of Darien dropped in to solicit a donation for the local YMCA As the man completed his pitch and rose to leave he said to the Representative By the way I think youre doing a great job up there in Albany With that kind of public awareness of the work of the Connecticut legislature following on the heels of an election campaign that was dominated by the personalities of the candidates for Governor rather than the issues the 187 legislators who will convene here on Jan 3 will hardly be faced with a crowd of voters clamoring for instant action on specific issues But the mood of the electorate and the rulings of the courts has left the Legislature with broad mandates to restrain spending change the sentencing of criminals and find a way to equalize school expenditures among the states 169 municipalities The legislature also faces attempts to rewrite or undo bills passed in previous years The autoemissions bill passed in the last session is widely acknowledged to require revision before it will work and opponents of the bottle bill now scheduled to take effect a year from now are likely to seek a postponement or repeal The Democrats with strong majorities in both House and Senate want to take a long look at whether there is any basis for persistent rumors of corruption in the jai alai frontons Another perennial issue abortion legislation is likely to come to the General Assemblys attention before it adjourns in June At the top of everyones agenda are the contradictory mandates of spending limits which many election winners promised and a plan to equalize school budgets which under the HortonMeskill decision must be developed by May While the cost of such a plan is open to debate  the final figure will be the lowest one that the Legislature votes and the court accepts  the essence of the problem is that they must make perpupil expenditures more nearly equal and since no one wants to lower what the richer districts spend the state will have to raise the budgets of the poorer areas No matter what formula is finally used it means that the total education budget will rise with paid in state taxes While the amount that the legislature votes may be higher or lower the School Finance Advisory Panel suggested in December that the payments be phased in over five years at a level of 39 million in the first year and 196 million in the last We can accomplish that proposal this year without creating a fiscal crisis said Joseph I Lieberman the Senate majority leader Along with other legislative leaders Mr Lieberman predicted a budget whose revenue limit was determined solely by existing taxes  a ceiling he called immovable  and said that other spending would have to be ranked in order of importance and financed only to the extent that that limit allowed Its going to take a general sense of discipline and its going to be a challenge he said No members of the General Assemblys leadership will predict higher taxes  Joseph J Fauliso president pro tempore of the Senate  speaks of prudence and moderation in state spending for example even though some people note that the contracts for all unionized state employees come up for renewal this year But much of the business taken up by the legislators this year will have little to do with spending For instance House and Senate leaders taking their cue from the public are looking at ways to stiffen punishment for juveniles who commit repeated offenses Theres definitely a mood in this state to do something about juvenile crime said Mr Van Nostrand with strapping 14 and 15yearold kids beating the stuffing out of old people Noting that the legislature would probably move to send the most violent young people to trial in adult courts he summed up the states posture as swinging to a punishment mode instead of a rehabilitation mode The popular mandate for punishment  and a study showing that two persons convicted for the same crime in Connecticut could face widely varying prison terms depending on who did the sentencing  are encouraging the legislature to pass a proposal for uniform sentencing One proposal would make the standard sentence for each crime the average term ordered for persons convicted of that crime in the first quarter of 1975 with judges allowed at their discretion to vary the length of imprisonment by 15 percent Some Republicans agree with the concept but would like to see stiffer penalties But here too public mandates contradict The decision to use average sentences as guidelines for the future reflects the capacity of the state cor rections system If you didnt go that way with the bill youd have to put a lot of money into new prison construction said Representative Ernest N Abate of Stamford the new speaker the House of Representatives Democrats also plan to introduce a bill for the selection of judges on a merit basis possibly by presenting the Governor with a list of candidates approved by a committee of bar members and lay people rather than simply allowing the Governor to nominate anyThe Issues at a Glance School Financing  The Legislature is facing a deadline of May 1 for setting up a new system Standard Sentencing Procedures  A reduction in judicial discretion will be under discussion Juvenile Offenders  There is a move to transfer repeat offenders to adult courts in serious cases ElectionLaw Reform  The goal is to make it easier for candidates to qualify for a primary Coastal Zone Management  The bill passed last year needs substantial amendment before it can be effectively enforced Automobile Emissions Testing  The program passed last year and vigorously sought by the Federal Government is opposed by legislators who fear its potential cost and inconvenience Arbitration in School Disputes  Last years jailing of teachers in Bridgeport has led to suggestions that binding arbitration be imposed in school disputes Gaming Regulation  The main job of the new Public Safety Committee will be overseeing legalized gambling Constitutional Amendments  In the wake of Californias proposition 13 amendments will be introduced that would limit state spending and prohibit an income tax Return Engagements  There will be proposals to repeal the Bottle Bill and the Blue Laws and bills to repeal the dividends tax and to protect the rights of homosexuals one for appointment by the General Assembly One issue sure to repeat from last years legislative diet is productliability The matter is a classic example of a lowprofile concern that the lawmakers will have difficulty digesting because it pits powerful lobbies against each other but does not produce a public opinion strong enough to guide the Representatives On one side manufacturers and their insurance companies would like the state to limit the extent to which they are responsible for injuries suffered from the use of their products They would like intervening causes taken into account and they would like a time limit set on their responsibilities Labor unions and trial lawyers however do not want the General Assembly to make it harder for workers and consumers to collect compensation and by implication lawyers to collect commissions  in accidents involving manufactuered goods A bill significantly limiting liability was passed last year but was vetoed by the Governor Also sure to come to the surface again is the autoemissions inspection law The state is likely to require an annual inspection of each vehicle at a set fee perhaps 750 Options are for the state itself to perform the test or to leave the job to service stations the way it does with auto inspections or to select a single company the Hamilton Standard division of United Technologies has been mentioned to establish a chain of testing centers around the Another bit of unfinished environmental business from the last session is coastal zone management Connecticut would be eligible for some Federal planning money if it passed a state law to limit development on the shore Such a bill was introduced in the house last year but was watered down so much that in the end it called only for further studies If some kind of coastal management is approved this session it is likely according to legislative leaders to follow the form of an earlier wetlands law under which the state provides guidelines for local action But the issue is touchy with municipalities It involves state regulation and elimination to a certain extent of local autonomy or at least thats the feeling said Mr Abate One worry coming back to haunt the state is legalized gambling Following an inconclusive grandjury investigtion of alleged abuses in the jai alai frontons and persistent rumors of corruption with disagreements among members of the Gaming Commission the General Assembly will probably hold hearings on the conduct of the games and the structure of regulation Several new issues promise to make their way to the fore Following the cliffhanger effort by Robert K Killian who was then the Lieutenant Governor  to garner the support of 20 percent of the delegates to the Democratic sta e convention to force a primary for the gubernatorial nomination some Democrats would like to change the system requiring a challenger instead to circulate petitions around the state and gather a specific number of signatures Following the low turnout in the last election an effort may also be made to make it easier to vote through postcard registration or electionday registration Two other issues involving popular control over government are waiting in the wings Some taxpayers would like constitutional limit on state spending and the right to put initiatives on the ballot the way Californians did with Proposition 13 But a survey of members of the General Assembly shows wariness on both points Another question waiting for lawmakers as a result of recent events is how to balance the competing rights of school systems and teachers in labor disputes After the Bridgeport teachers strike which saw over 300 teachers jailed before a settlement was negotiated some school boards would prefer system of binding arbitration which unions generally dislike in cases of impasse One proposal would give the unions the option of either submitting to binding arbitration or striking Republicans and Democrats may seek to change the way in which prisoners are transported to trials around the state Currently a town must handle the responsibility itself most often by assigning a local policeman and a car to take the accused to court and stay there with him until his case is disposed of In each court this may result in half a dozen officers spending most of the day in a courtroom with their halfdozen cars sitting unused outside A state transportation system might be efficient
Ideas &Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/31/archives/ideas-trends-in-summary-husband-cleared-but-rape-law-still-untested.html,John Rideout was acquitted last week the first man in the nation to be tried for raping his wife while they were living together But the underlying central question  does a husband have a commonlaw right to sex with his wife  remains unresolved A jury of eight women and four men in Salem Ore acquitted Mr Rideout of a charge of rape brought by his wife Greta But legal observers said that only Mr Rideouts conviction and subsequent appeals would have tested the constitutionality of the 1977 Oregon statute eliminating marriage as a defense against rape Mrs Rideout testified that her husband had beaten her into submission but Mr Rideout told the court that although he had struck his wife he had apologized and she had voluntarily engaged in sex with him Mr Rideouts lawyer Charles Burt said the marriage had been going bad for a long time and would already have ended in divorce if the couple had been more adult This is not a classic confron tation of mens rights versus womens rights the lawyer said Though Mr Burt also suggested that the acquittal might discourage prosecutors and women from bringing these charges District Attorney Gary Gortmaker said that each case would be decided on its merits Hyperactivity  A Surgical Malady Almost three years have passed since a Congressional subcommittee first blew the whistle on unnecessary surgery Last week the subcommittee suggested that voluntary efforts to remedy the situation are not working and recommended that the Federal Government try mandatory regulation of operations paid for with Government funds Last year said the subcommittee Americans underwent two million operations they did not need at a cost of 10000 lives and 4 billion The subcommittee also said that the risk of dying as a result of surgery varies from hospital to hospital In major Boston medical centers it was said the mortality rate for open heart surgery is 10 percent compared with 22 percent at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge and 49 percent in Malden Massachusetts Hospital One recommendation was for the Department of Health Education and Welfare to set up a nationwide program to monitor the frequency and causes of surgical mishaps and to publicize their findings including mortality statistics at specific hospitals The subcommittee also proposed that second opinions should be required before nonemergency operations and that the Government should set minimum competency standards for surgeons Doctors Liability Doctors who fail to advise patients of the risks of bearing defective children may now be found legally liable for the special costs of caring for such children according to a 52 ruling of the New York State Court of Appeals The decision last week came in two cases in which mothers bore defective children after they say doctors failed to tell them they were in highrisk categories and thus denied them the option of further testing or abortion The dissenting judges said the riling would lead doctors to advise abortion in marginal cases to avoid suits and would therefore probably bring about abortions of normal children The decision does not mean the doctors in the two cases are necessarily liable  only that they may be sued Such suits had previously been barred in New York and are still impossible in about half the states New Spelling For a New China Beginning tomorrow the westernlanguage dispatches of Chinas official press agency will change the names of everything and everybody in China Deputy prime minister Teng Hsiaoping will be Deng Xiaoping Communist Party chairman Hua Kuofung will be Hua Guofeng Mao Tsetung himself will have been Mao Zedong In Chinese of course everything will sound just the way it did last week and in Chinese characters noth ing will change Only the transcription of Chinese names into Roman characters will be different Most Americans will not notice the change since they get their Chinese names from American newspapers and magazines most of which intend to follow for now their customary styles The burden of telling whos who will fall mostly on editors and reporters who read Chinas Englishlanguage dispatches For the Chinese the change is only a step toward adoption of Romanization for nearly all purposes a process under way since the 1950s The new system called Pinyin simply replaces the socalled WadeGiles system of Romanization devised by two 19thcentury British scholars By one reckoning there are only 1271 syllables in all of Mandarin the officialand majorityChinese language Why then are there about 10000 characters in the Chinese telegraph code book and if Romanization is such a good idea why is it taking so long A very large number of Chinese characters are combinations of several other characters part of the combination giving the sound and the rest giving the meaning In traditional Chinese writing therefore words that sound alike or cases of the same word bearing different meanings do not look alike In speech of course Chinese depend on context to determine what is being said to them just as English speakers do but in the traditional written language they get extra information It is as though English speakers wrote base hit Broadway hit past tense of the verb hit but only said hit in each case After Romanization the Chinese like others will have read and write Army Changes Alphabet Soup An army marches on its nomenclature The United States Army which in 1939 introduced a series of rations called A B C and D has long since dropped B and D Last week perhaps as a Christmas present to the troops the Army said C also would go to be replaced by MRE Meal ReadytoEat Originally A was a balanced diet of fresh ingredients and B was the same only canned dried or preserved C was for troops who had no access to kitchens could be eaten hot or cold and was regarded as nasty for 39 years There was however variety canned meat and vegetable stew canned ham and lima beans canned pork sausage patties D was emergency food a huge fortified chocolate bar which according to a 1943 Army report caused headaches nausea and a feeling of general indisposition in people living on it for more than a day Ds defects led to K based on a sort of pemmican biscuit and the Army once speculated that K might find a large civilian market after World War II Comes now MRE The first batch of 24 million will be ordered right away and will offer 12 different main courses packed in retort pouches that are lighter than cans fit the pocket can be heated in boiling water or eaten cold and are opened by tearing the corner off the pouch Meanwhile there are enough C rations in warehouses that some troops will still be eating them in 1983 Torn Ferrell and Virginia Adams
